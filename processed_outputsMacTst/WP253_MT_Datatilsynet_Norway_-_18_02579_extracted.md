Okay, let's start by looking at the decision text provided. The user wants me to extract specific facts based on the guidelines given.

First, for Question 1: What is the top-level category of the defendant? The parties involved are "Education Agency for Oslo municipality." Since this is a public authority (a government agency), the answer should be PUBLIC_AUTHORITY.

Question 2 asks about the public authority type. The Education Agency is part of Oslo municipality, which is a local government. So the answer here is LOCAL_GOVERNMENT.

For Question 3, since the defendant is a public authority, this question isn't applicable. But wait, noâ€”the instruction says if Q1 is BUSINESS or NON_PROFIT, then ask about private-sector activity. Since Q1 is PUBLIC_AUTHORITY, we skip this and answer N_A.

Question 4 is about SME status, but again, since the defendant is a public authority, not a business, this is N_A.

Question 5 is reserved, so it's N_A.

Question 6: Was an administrative fine issued? Yes, the decision mentions a fine of 1,200,000 NOK. So Answer 6 is YES.

Question 7 requires the amount in ISO currency. The fine is 1,200,000 NOK. The ISO code for Norwegian Krone is NOK. So Answer 7 is "1200000 NOK".

Question 8: Article 58(2) powers used besides a fine? The decision mentions the use of a fine but doesn't explicitly state any other measures like warnings, reprimands, or orders. However, looking back, the text says the fine was issued due to breaches and mentions that the municipality took steps to address the flaws. But there's no mention of other corrective actions listed in the allowed codes. So Answer 8 is NONE.

Question 9: Did they refer to EDPB guidance? The decision references WP253 (Privacy Council guidelines) but not explicitly EDPB's administrative-fines guidance. However, the user instruction says "EDPB administrative-fines guidance (Guidelines 04/2022) or WP253". Since WP253 is mentioned, Answer 9 is YES.

Question 10: Previous infringements? The decision doesn't mention any prior infringements by the same defendant. It discusses the current case and mentions that the municipality didn't contest the evaluation but there's no reference to previous cases. So Answer 10 is NOT_DISCUSSED.

Question 11: Not in breach? No, the outcome was "Violation Found," so Answer 11 is NO.
