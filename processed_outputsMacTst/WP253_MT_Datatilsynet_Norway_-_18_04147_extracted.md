Okay, let's start by looking at the decision text provided. The user wants me to extract specific facts based on the guidelines given.

First, for Question 1: What is the top-level category of the defendant? The defendant here is the Public Roads Administration (Statens vegvesen). Since they are a public authority, the answer should be PUBLIC_AUTHORITY.

Question 2 asks about the public authority type. The Public Roads Administration is part of the Norwegian government, so it's likely a CENTRAL_MINISTRY_AGENCY or maybe LOCAL_GOVERNMENT. But looking at the text, it's mentioned as a public roads administration, which in Norway might fall under a central ministry. However, the exact classification isn't explicitly stated. Wait, the decision mentions they are the controller for the personal data concerned, but doesn't specify their type. The options include CENTRAL_MINISTRY_AGENCY or LOCAL_GOVERNMENT. Since it's a national authority, maybe CENTRAL_MINISTRY_AGENCY is correct. But if there's no explicit mention, I should answer N_A? Wait, the instructions say if Q1=PUBLIC_AUTHORITY, then answer Q2. However, the text doesn't specify the type beyond being a public roads administration. The allowed tokens for Q2 include REGULATOR_INDEPENDENT_AUTHORITY, but that's not applicable here. Since there's no explicit mention of their type, maybe it's UNKNOWN or N_A? Wait, the instruction says if multiple defendants are named, choose the one in the operative part. Here, the primary defendant is Statens vegvesen. But the public authority type isn't specified in the decision text. So Answer 2 should be UNKNOWN.

Question 3: Core activity sector. Since it's a public roads administration, their core activity would relate to transportation or infrastructure. The options include TRANSPORT_POSTAL. That seems appropriate. So Answer 3 is TRANSPORT_POSTAL.

Question 4: SME status. The defendant is a public authority, so the SME question (Q4) only applies if Q1=BUSINESS. Since it's PUBLIC_AUTHORITY, Answer 4 is N_A.

Question 5 is reserved, so Answer 5: N_A.

Question 6: Was an administrative fine issued? Yes, the decision mentions a fine of NOK 1,000,000. So Answer 6: YES.

Question 7: Total fine amount. The text says "NOK 1,000,000", so formatted as "1000000 NOK". Answer 7: 1000000 NOK.

Question 8: Article 58(2) powers used besides a fine. The decision mentions ordering deletion (ORDER_COMPLIANCE), but no other measures like reprimand or warning. So Answer 8: ORDER_COMPLIANCE.

Question 9: Reference to EDPB guidance? The text doesn't mention Guidelines 04/2022 or WP253, so Answer 9: NO.

Question 10: Previous infringements? The decision mentions prior discussions and letters dating back to May 2017 but doesn't explicitly state previous infringements by the same defendant. So Answer 10: NOT_DISCUSSED.

Question 11: Not in breach? The outcome was "Violation Found", so Answer 11: NO.
