Okay, let's start by looking at the decision text provided. The user wants me to extract specific facts based on the guidelines given.

First, for Question 1: What is the top-level category of the defendant? The primary defendant here is the missionary organization. Looking at the "Parties" section, it lists "Community missionary organization (anonymized)" as one of the parties involved. Since this is an organization, the correct token should be BUSINESS.

Next, Question 2: Since Q1 is BUSINESS, this question isn't applicable, so answer N_A.

Question 3 asks about the core activity sector if the defendant is a business or non-profit. The missionary organization's activities are related to religious or charitable work, which doesn't fit into any of the provided categories like DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM or HEALTH_LIFESCIENCES_PRIVATE. So, the answer here would be OTHER.

Question 4: Is the defendant an SME? There's no mention of the organization being classified as a small or medium enterprise in the text. Therefore, the answer is UNKNOWN.

Question 5 is reserved and should be N_A.

For Question 6: Was an administrative fine issued? The decision states that the DPA issued a reprimand but there's no mention of a fine. The "Fine" field in the case information says "None," so Answer 6 is NO.

Question 7 isn't applicable because Q6 is NO, so it's N_A.

Question 8: Article 58(2) powers used. The DPA issued a reprimand under Article 58(2)(b), which corresponds to the REPRIMAND code. There are no other corrective measures mentioned besides the reprimand, so Answer 8 is REPRIMAND.

Question 9: Did the authority refer to EDPB guidance? The text doesn't mention Guidelines 04/2022 or WP253, so the answer is NO.

Question 10: Previous infringements. The decision doesn't discuss any prior infringements by the missionary organization, so it's NOT_DISCUSSED.

Finally, Question 11: Not in breach? The Privacy Appeals Board overturned the DPA's decision, finding that the missionary organization had a legal basis under Article 6(1)(f). Therefore, they were not found in breach, so Answer 11 is YES.
