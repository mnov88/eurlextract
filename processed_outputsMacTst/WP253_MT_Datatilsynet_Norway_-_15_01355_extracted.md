Okay, let's start by looking at the decision text provided. The user wants me to extract specific facts based on the guidelines given.

First, for Question 1: What is the top-level category of the defendant? The defendant here is "Legelisten.no AS," which is a company. In the decision, it's mentioned as a Norwegian limited liability company running a website. So that should be BUSINESS.

Question 2 isn't applicable because the answer to Q1 isn't PUBLIC_AUTHORITY. So Answer 2 is N_A.

For Question 3: Core activity sector. The company runs a review website for healthcare personnel. Looking at the allowed tokens, this seems like PROFESSIONAL_BUSINESS_SERVICES since they're providing a service related to reviews and ratings, which could fall under professional services. But wait, there's also RETAIL_ECOMMERCE or DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM. However, their main activity is facilitating reviews, which might be more aligned with PROFESSIONAL_BUSINESS_SERVICES as it's a platform for user-generated content. I'll go with that.

Question 4: SME status. The decision doesn't mention anything about Legelisten being an SME. So Answer 4 is UNKNOWN.

Question 5 is reserved, so N_A.

Question 6: Fine issued? The outcome says "Fine: None" in the case information. Also, in the English summary, there's no mention of a fine. The DPA ordered them to delete data and implement policies but didn't issue an administrative fine. So Answer 6 is NO.

Question 7 isn't applicable because Q6 is NO. So N_A.

Question 8: Article 58(2) powers used. The decision mentions several orders like allowing opt-out, erasure policies, deleting information, etc. Looking at the allowed codes, these would fall under ORDER_COMPLIANCE and maybe ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT. But I need to check if they explicitly mention any of the codes. The DPA instructed them to delete data and implement policies, which could be ORDER_COMPLIANCE. Also, erasure policies might relate to ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT. However, the text doesn't use the exact terms like "reprimand" or "warning," so maybe NONE? Wait, but they did issue orders. Let me check again. The decision says they must delete data and establish erasure policies. According to the allowed codes, ORDER_COMPLIANCE is for ordering compliance with GDPR obligations. So Answer 8 would be ORDER_COMPLIANCE;ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT.

Question 9: Did they refer to EDPB guidance? The decision doesn't mention Guidelines 04/2022 or WP253. So Answer 9 is NO.

Question 10: Previous infringements? The case was appealed and went through multiple courts, but the decision text doesn't explicitly state that there were prior infringements by the same defendant. It mentions previous complaints but not prior infringements. So Answer 10 is NOT_DISCUSSED.

Question 11: Not in breach? The outcome says "Violation Found," so Answer 11 is NO.
