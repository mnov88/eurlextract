<think>
We are given a decision text from Datatilsynet (Norway) regarding Legelisten.no AS.

Let's break down the requirements step by step for each of the 11 answers:

Question 1: Top-level category of defendant.
- The defendant is "Legelisten.no AS", which is described as a Norwegian limited liability company. This indicates it is a BUSINESS (a commercial entity).
- We must check if there's any explicit term in the text that says "business" or similar, but note: the decision does not explicitly say "BUSINESS" for the category. However, by definition, a limited liability company (AS) is a business.
- The allowed tokens are: PUBLIC_AUTHORITY, BUSINESS, NON_PROFIT, INDIVIDUAL, UNKNOWN.
- Since it's a commercial company, we choose BUSINESS.

Question 2: Only if Answer1=PUBLIC_AUTHORITY. But our Answer1 is BUSINESS, so we answer N_A.

Question 3: Only if Answer1 in {BUSINESS, NON_PROFIT}. We have BUSINESS, so we need to determine the core activity sector.
- The company runs a website for anonymous reviews of healthcare personnel (dentists, doctors, etc.). This is an online review platform, which falls under "RETAIL_ECOMMERCE" or perhaps "PROFESSIONAL_BUSINESS_SERVICES"? 
  However, note: it's not selling products (retail) but providing a service. But the allowed tokens include:
    - DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM
    - FINANCE_INSURANCE
    - HEALTH_LIFESCIENCES_PRIVATE
    - RETAIL_ECOMMERCE
    - PROFESSIONAL_BUSINESS_SERVICES
    - TRANSPORT_POSTAL
    - OTHER

- The activity is a review website for healthcare professionals. This is not directly in the health sector (it's about reviews, not providing healthcare services). It's an online platform that collects and publishes user-generated content (reviews) about healthcare providers.
- We can consider it as "PROFESSIONAL_BUSINESS_SERVICES" because it's a service business? But note: the token for review platforms might be under "RETAIL_ECOMMERCE" if we think of it as an e-commerce site, but typically review sites are not retail. Alternatively, it could be "OTHER".
- However, looking at the description: "Legelisten.no AS is a Norwegian limited liability company running a website where people anonymously can post reviews about dentists, doctors, psychologists and other healthcare personnel." 
  This is an online platform for user-generated content (reviews) which is similar to Yelp or Google Reviews. Such platforms are often categorized as part of the "DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM" sector because they operate on the internet? But note: DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM typically refers to telecommunications, IT services, etc.
- Alternatively, it might be considered a "PROFESSIONAL_BUSINESS_SERVICES" if we think of it as providing a service for professionals (healthcare personnel) but that's not exactly right.

But let's see the exact words: 
  The decision says: "Legelisten.no AS is a Norwegian limited liability company running a website where people anonymously can post reviews about dentists, doctors, psychologists and other healthcare personnel."

This is clearly an online service for publishing reviews. In the context of GDPR decisions, such platforms are often classified under "DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM" because they operate as digital services.

However, note that the token "DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM" is available. We don't have a specific token for review sites, so we must choose from the given ones.

Given the options, I think "DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM" is the best fit because it's an internet-based service (a website) and not retail or finance.

But wait: the decision also says that they process personal data of healthcare personnel and users. The core activity is running a review platform on the web -> digital service.

So, Answer 3: DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM

Question 4: Only if Answer1=BUSINESS. We have BUSINESS, so we need to check SME status.
- The decision does not explicitly state whether Legelisten.no AS is an SME (Small or Medium Enterprise) per EU Recommendation 2003/361/EC.
- Therefore, we must answer UNKNOWN.

Question 5: Reserved for future use -> N_A

Question 6: Was an administrative fine explicitly issued?
- The decision states: "Fine: None" in the Case Information section.
- Also, in the English Summary under Holding, there is no mention of a fine. Instead, they ordered Legelisten to take certain actions (like allowing opt-out, deleting data, etc.).
- Therefore, Answer 6: NO

Question 7: Only if Answer6=YES -> so we answer N_A.

Question 8: Which other Article 58(2) corrective powers were explicitly used?
- The decision does not mention any of the specific codes (like WARNING, REPRIMAND, etc.) in the text. However, note that they issued an order to take certain actions (erasure policies, deletion, etc.). 
- But let's check: the allowed codes include "ORDER_COMPLIANCE", "ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT", etc.
- The decision says: "Legelisten is required to ... delete information ...", which is a form of order for compliance and rectification. Specifically, they ordered:
    - To allow opt-out (which relates to the right to object or erasure? but note: it's about allowing healthcare personnel to opt out of being listed -> this might be related to Article 21, but the decision doesn't say "order" in that sense).
    - They also ordered deletion of certain data.

- The specific orders are:
   8. Legelisten is required to stop processing special category personal data ... (which is an order for compliance and rectification)
   And they have multiple orders about erasure.

- Therefore, the corrective powers used include "ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT" (because it's ordering rectification or erasure) and possibly "ORDER_COMPLIANCE".

But note: the decision does not explicitly say "Article 58(2)(c)" or similar. However, we are to look for explicit mention of the power.

Looking at the text: 
   The DPA issued a decision that includes orders (like in the Conclusion section). 

In GDPR terms, Article 58(2) allows for:
   - (a) to issue a warning
   - (b) reprimand
   - (c) order to comply with the GDPR
   - ... etc.

The decision does not use the words "warning", "reprimand", but it did issue orders. So we have:

   ORDER_COMPLIANCE: because they ordered Legelisten to take specific actions (compliance).
   ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT: because they ordered erasure and rectification of data.

But note: the token list includes:
   "ORDER_DSR" -> which is for Data Subject Rights, but that's not directly applicable here.
   "ORDER_COMPLIANCE"
   "ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT"

So we have two codes: ORDER_COMPLIANCE and ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT.

However, the decision does not explicitly say "Article 58(2)(c)" or similar. But note the rule: 
   "EXPLICIT" means either (a) the exact term appears in the decision text (including official translations), OR (b) the decision explicitly cites the relevant GDPR article and clause describing that measure.

The decision does not cite Article 58, but it says they are ordering Legelisten to do things. The fact that they issued orders is explicit enough? 

But note: the rule for Q8 says "explicitly used", meaning we must see a reference to one of these powers in the text. However, the decision does not list the powers by name (like "reprimand" or "order"). But it does say "the DPA held that ... Legelisten is required to ...". 

In the context of GDPR enforcement, when an authority issues such orders, it's under Article 58(2)(c). So we can infer? But note: the rule says "Do NOT infer." and only use what is explicitly stated.

However, the decision does not say "I issue a reprimand" or "I order compliance". It just states the requirements. 

But wait: in the Case Information section, it says:
   **Outcome:** Violation Found

And then in the Conclusion, they list 10 orders (which are corrective measures). The authority is using its power to require these actions.

The allowed tokens for Q8 include "ORDER_COMPLIANCE" and "ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT". Since the decision does not explicitly say "order compliance", but it does issue orders that are about compliance, we have to see if there's an explicit mention of the term in the text.

Looking at the text: 
   The English Summary says: "The DPA held that: ... Legelisten is required to ..."

This is a clear order. But note: the token list includes "ORDER_COMPLIANCE" and "ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT". 

We have two types of orders:
  - Orders about erasure (which would be ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT)
  - Orders about stopping processing (which might fall under ORDER_COMPLIANCE)

But note: the token list has both. However, we must see if the decision explicitly uses the term "order" in a way that matches? Actually, the tokens are named after the GDPR powers.

Given that the decision does not use the exact words of the tokens (like "ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT"), but it is issuing orders for rectification and erasure, we have to rely on the rule: 
   If the decision explicitly cites the relevant GDPR article and clause describing that measure.

But note: the decision doesn't cite Article 58 at all. So by the strict rule, we cannot say "ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT" because it's not explicit.

However, let's look for any mention of a power:

The Case Information says:
   **Outcome:** Violation Found

And then in the Conclusion, they list requirements (orders). But there is no statement like "We order you to ...", but rather "Legelisten is required to ...". This is standard.

But note: the rule for Q8 says: 
   "Answer is a semicolon-separated list of CODES from the set below, sorted alphabetically"

And we are allowed to use the codes if they are explicitly used (by citation or by term).

Since the decision does not cite Article 58(2) and does not use the exact terms (like "reprimand", "warning"), but it is issuing orders that correspond to these powers, we must be cautious.

However, note: the token list includes "ORDER_COMPLIANCE" and "ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT". The decision does issue orders for compliance and for rectification/erasure. But without explicit mention of the power name, we cannot say it's explicit.

But wait: the rule says "explicitly cites the relevant GDPR article and clause describing that measure". The decision doesn't cite Article 58 at all. So by strict reading, we should not assign any code? Then we would have to use NONE.

However, note that in many DPA decisions, they don't explicitly say "Article 58(2)(c)" but the orders are understood as such. But our rule says: if it's not explicit (by term or by citation), then UNKNOWN for the token? Actually, no: we have to choose from the allowed tokens.

But note: the instruction says "If neither [exact term appears or explicit citation], answer UNKNOWN" — but that was for Q1-Q4. For Q8, we are to output one of the codes or NONE.

The rule for Q8 does not say to use UNKNOWN; it says to use a semicolon-separated list (or NONE). So if we cannot find an explicit code, we must use NONE? But note: the token "NONE" is allowed and means no other powers were used.

However, in this case, they did issue orders. But without explicit citation of Article 58(2) or the specific power name, we have to say that it's not explicit enough for us to assign a code. Therefore, we should use NONE? 

But wait: the decision is from a DPA and it's standard practice to issue such orders under Article 58(2). However, the rule says "Use ONLY the provided decision text". The decision text does not mention any of these codes.

Therefore, by strict reading, we cannot say that they explicitly used (by term or citation) any of the powers. So we must output NONE.

But note: there is a token for "NONE", and it's exclusive.

So Answer 8: NONE

Question 9: Did the authority explicitly refer to EDPB administrative-fines guidance?
- The decision text does not mention EDPB, Guidelines 04/2022, or WP253.
- So we answer UNKNOWN? But note: the tokens are YES|NO|UNKNOWN.

However, the rule says "explicitly referred", and there's no reference. So it's NOT DISCUSSED -> but the token for that is not available; we have to choose from the given tokens.

The allowed tokens for Q9 are:
   YES | NO | UNKNOWN

Since they did not refer (so it's not YES), and they didn't say "we did not refer" (so it's not NO in the sense of a negative reference) but rather no mention at all, we should choose UNKNOWN? 

But note: if there is no explicit reference to EDPB guidance or WP253, then it's not referred. So we can say NO? However, the token "NO" means they explicitly said they did not refer? But that's not what we have.

Actually, the rule for Q9 says:
   "Did the authority explicitly refer to ..."

If there is no reference at all, then they did not explicitly refer -> so it would be NO. But note: the token "NO" might mean they referred and then said something about it? Actually, the tokens are:

   YES: if they explicitly referred (cited or mentioned)
   NO: if they explicitly stated that they did not use the guidance?
   UNKNOWN: if we cannot tell.

But in this case, there is no mention of EDPB or WP253 at all. So it's clear they did not refer -> so Answer 9: NO

However, note: the token "NO" might be interpreted as "they explicitly stated that they are not using the guidance", but we don't have that. But in common sense, if there is no reference, then they didn't refer.

But let's see the exact wording of the tokens:
   - YES: explicit reference
   - NO: ? 
   - UNKNOWN

The instruction says for Q9: "Did the authority explicitly refer to ...", so if they did not refer (no mention), then it's a clear NO? But note: the token list does not have an option for "not mentioned". However, in such cases, we use NO.

But wait: the example tokens are YES|NO|UNKNOWN. We should choose NO because there is no reference to EDPB guidance.

So Answer 9: NO

Question 10: Did the decision explicitly reference previous infringements by the same defendant?
- The case information says: "In 2017, ...". Also, in the Comment section: "Complaints against Legelisten started in 2012 and went through several rounds both at the Norwegian DPA and the Privacy Appeals Board (Personvernnemda), before going to the Norwegian courts and, ultimately, the Supreme Court."

This indicates that there were previous cases. However, does the decision explicitly reference previous infringements? 

The decision text says: "In 2017, the Norwegian DPA held ...". It doesn't say "this is a repeat infringement" or "previous violation".

But note: the Comment section (which is part of the provided text) mentions that complaints started in 2012 and went through several rounds. However, the decision itself (the operative part) does not explicitly state that there were previous infringements by Legelisten.

The question says: "explicitly reference" — meaning in the decision document (not just in the comment section). The Comment is a separate section, but it's part of the provided text? 

But note: the instruction says "Use ONLY the provided decision text". The entire block we are given includes the Comment. However, the rule for Q10: "explicitly reference" — meaning does the decision (the main body) say that there were previous infringements?

Looking at the operative part of the decision (the Conclusion section), it doesn't mention any prior cases. It just states the current findings.

The Comment says: "Complaints against Legelisten started in 2012 and went through several rounds ...". But this is a comment, not part of the decision's reasoning. The question asks for what the decision explicitly references (meaning the main body of the decision).

Therefore, we cannot say that the decision itself explicitly referenced previous infringements. So it's either "NOT_DISCUSSED" or "UNKNOWN".

The tokens are:
   PRIOR_INFRINGER_PRESENT
   DISCUSS_NO_PRIOR
   NOT_DISCUSSED
   UNKNOWN

We have to choose one.

- If they discussed and said there were no prior, then DISCUSS_NO_PRIOR.
- If they didn't discuss at all, then NOT_DISCUSSED.

The decision (the main body) does not mention previous infringements. The Comment is a separate section that mentions it, but the decision itself doesn't. So we should say "NOT_DISCUSSED".

But note: the entire text provided includes the Comment. However, the rule says "Use ONLY the provided decision text", and the Comment is part of the document. But typically, when we say "the decision", we mean the main ruling (not the comment). 

Given that the question is about what the decision explicitly references, and the main body doesn't mention it, but the Comment does, I think we should consider that the decision as a whole might be considered to have referenced it in the Comment. However, the instruction says "the decision text", so if the Comment is part of the document, then they did reference it.

But note: the tokens for Q10 are about whether the decision explicitly references previous infringements. The Comment section is not part of the legal reasoning but a separate comment. 

To be safe, let's see if there's any explicit mention in the main body (the holding and conclusion). There isn't.

Therefore, we'll say that it was NOT_DISCUSSED because they didn't discuss it in the decision itself (only in the Comment).

So Answer 10: NOT_DISCUSSED

Question 11: Was the defendant found not in breach?
- The outcome is "Violation Found", and the DPA held that Legelisten had to take actions because of violations. So they were found in breach.
- Therefore, Answer 11: NO

Now, let's compile all answers:

Answer 1: BUSINESS
Answer 2: N_A   (because Answer1 was not PUBLIC_AUTHORITY)
Answer 3: DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM
Answer 4: UNKNOWN
Answer 5: N_A
Answer 6: NO
Answer 7: N_A
Answer 8: NONE
Answer 9: NO
Answer 10: NOT_DISCUSSED
Answer 11: NO

But note: for Answer 3, we are not sure if "DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM" is the best fit. Let's reconsider:

The company runs a website that collects and publishes reviews of healthcare professionals. This is an online platform (digital) but it's not primarily IT or telecom. However, in GDPR contexts, such platforms are often classified under digital services.

Alternatively, "RETAIL_ECOMMERCE" might be considered because they have a business model of collecting user data for the purpose of providing reviews to consumers? But note: retail is about selling goods, and this is not selling anything (it's free). So it's not retail.

Another option: "PROFESSIONAL_BUSINESS_SERVICES" — but that would be if they are providing services to professionals. However, their service is for the public (to review healthcare personnel), so it's more of a consumer platform.

Given the tokens, I think DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM is the closest because it's an internet-based service.

But note: there is no token for "review platforms", so we have to choose from the given ones. And "DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM" is the only one that fits as a digital service.

So we'll stick with DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM.

Now, write exactly 11 lines:

Answer 1: BUSINESS
Answer 2: N_A
Answer 3: DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM
Answer 4: UNKNOWN
Answer 5: N_A
Answer 6: NO
Answer 7: N_A
Answer 8: NONE
Answer 9: NO
Answer 10: NOT_DISCUSSED
Answer 11: NO

But note: the instruction says "each line starts with 'Answer n: '" and contains ONLY one of the allowed tokens.

So:

Answer 1: BUSINESS
Answer 2: N_A
Answer 3: DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM
Answer 4: UNKNOWN
Answer 5: N_A
Answer 6: NO
Answer 7: N_A
Answer 8: NONE
Answer 9: NO
Answer 10: NOT_DISCUSSED
Answer 11: NO

Let's check the tokens for each:

- Answer 3: DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM is in the allowed list.
- Answer 4: UNKNOWN is allowed (for SME status when not explicit).
- Answer 8: NONE is allowed.

We are good.

Note: For Answer 9, we chose NO because there was no reference to EDPB guidance. But note: the tokens for Q9 are YES|NO|UNKNOWN. We have chosen NO meaning they did not explicitly refer (which is true). However, some might argue that "not referred" should be UNKNOWN? But the token list has NO and it's intended for when there was no reference.

So we'll go with NO.
