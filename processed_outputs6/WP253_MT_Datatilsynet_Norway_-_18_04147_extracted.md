Let me analyze the provided EU data protection authority (DPA) decision to extract facts according to the instructions.

First, I need to identify the defendant. From the case information:

**Parties:** Public Roads Administration (Statens vegvesen)

This is clearly identified as the defendant in the operative part of the decision.

Now let's go through each question and determine the answer based on the provided text.

Question 1: What is the explicitly identified top-level category of the defendant?
- The defendant is "Public Roads Administration (Statens vegvesen)"
- This appears to be a government body, so it should be classified as PUBLIC_AUTHORITY
- I need to check if there's any explicit statement about this being a public authority. In the text, it says "the Norwegian Public Roads Administration" which indicates it's a public entity.

Question 2 (only if Answer 1=PUBLIC_AUTHORITY): What is the primary public authority type?
- The defendant is "Public Roads Administration"
- This appears to be a government agency responsible for roads
- Looking at the allowed types: LOCAL_GOVERNMENT, CENTRAL_MINISTRY_AGENCY, LAW_ENFORCEMENT_POLICE, EDUCATION_PUBLIC, HEALTH_PUBLIC, REGULATOR_INDEPENDENT_AUTHORITY, OTHER, UNKNOWN
- Public Roads Administration is typically part of central government (not local), and it's not a law enforcement agency or regulator. It seems to be a central ministry agency.
- The text doesn't explicitly state what type of public authority it is, but "Public Roads Administration" is commonly understood as a central government body in Norway.

Question 3 (only if Answer 1 in {BUSINESS, NON_PROFIT}): Not applicable since the defendant is PUBLIC_AUTHORITY

Question 4 (only if Answer 1=BUSINESS): Not applicable since the defendant is PUBLIC_AUTHORITY

Question 5: Reserved for future use - N_A

Question 6: Was an administrative fine explicitly issued?
- The decision states "Fine: 1,000,000 NOK" and later mentions "the Norwegian Data Protection Authority... to pay an infringement fee to the Treasury of NOK 1,000,000"
- This is clearly a fine under GDPR
- Answer should be YES

Question 7 (only if Answer 6=YES): What is the total fine amount?
- The text states "Fine: 1,000,000 NOK" and later confirms "infringement fee of 1,000,000"
- This should be formatted as "1000000 NOK"

Question 8: Which other Article 58(2) corrective powers were explicitly used (besides a fine)?
- The decision mentions "Decision on order" which includes:
  - "The Norwegian Public Roads Administration must, without undue delay, delete personal data..."
  - This is an order to comply with GDPR requirements
- Looking at the allowed codes: ORDER_COMPLIANCE would be appropriate for this.
- There's no mention of other powers like WARNING or REPRIMAND in the text.

Question 9: Did the authority explicitly refer to EDPB administrative-fines guidance (Guidelines 04/2022) or WP253?
- I don't see any explicit reference to these guidelines in the decision.
- Answer should be UNKNOWN

Question 10: Did the decision explicitly reference previous infringements by the same defendant?
- In section 9.3, it states "No previous violations can be ascertained."
- This means there were no prior infringements mentioned or found
- The appropriate token would be DISCUSSED_NO_PRIOR (since they discussed and found no prior infringements)

Question 11: Was the defendant found not in breach?
- The decision explicitly finds that "SVV has violated articles 5 and 17 of the personal data protection regulation."
- It also states "the Norwegian Data Protection Authority's conclusion is that an infringement fee should be imposed" because there was a violation.
- Answer should be NO

Now let me double-check each answer:

Answer 1: PUBLIC_AUTHORITY (defendant is Public Roads Administration, which is clearly a public authority)
Answer 2: CENTRAL_MINISTRY_AGENCY (Public Roads Administration in Norway would typically be part of the central government ministry responsible for transportation)
Answer 3: N_A (not applicable since Answer 1 = PUBLIC_AUTHORITY)
Answer 4: N_A (not applicable since Answer 1 = PUBLIC_AUTHORITY)
Answer 5: N_A
Answer 6: YES (fine was explicitly issued)
Answer 7: 1000000 NOK (the fine amount is stated as 1,000,000 NOK in the decision)
Answer 8: ORDER_COMPLIANCE (the authority ordered the defendant to delete personal data without undue delay - this matches "ORDER_COMPLIANCE" from the allowed codes)
Answer 9: UNKNOWN (no explicit reference to EDPB guidelines or WP253)
Answer 10: DISCUSSED_NO_PRIOR (explicitly states "No previous violations can be ascertained")
Answer 11: NO (defendant was found in breach)

Let me verify the Article 8 answer again. The decision says:
"The Norwegian Public Roads Administration must, without undue delay, delete personal data about chip number, location and time of passage (invoice part) that is stored beyond the time SVV can legally keep this personal data..."

This matches "ORDER_COMPLIANCE" as it's an order to comply with GDPR requirements.

Now I'll format these answers exactly as required - 11 lines, each starting with "Answer n: ", and containing only one of the allowed tokens.
