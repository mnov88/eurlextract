Let me carefully analyze the provided decision text to extract facts according to the specified format.

First, I need to identify the top-level category of the defendant (Answer 1). The "Parties" section states: "DatatilsynetPrivacy Appeals BoardCommunity missionary organization (anonymized)". 

The primary defendant appears to be a "community missionary organization", which is an organization. Looking at the allowed tokens for Answer 1:
- PUBLIC_AUTHORITY
- BUSINESS
- NON_PROFIT
- INDIVIDUAL
- UNKNOWN

A community missionary organization would typically be classified as a non-profit organization, so Answer 1 should be NON_PROFIT.

Now let's check if there are any other relevant details:

For Answer 2: This is only applicable if Answer 1 = PUBLIC_AUTHORITY. Since our Answer 1 is NON_PROFIT, we don't need to answer this.

For Answer 3: This is only applicable if Answer 1 is in {BUSINESS, NON_PROFIT}. We have Answer 1 as NON_PROFIT, so we need to determine the core activity sector. The organization is a "community missionary organization", which would fall under non-profit activities related to religious or community services. Looking at the allowed tokens:
- DIGITAL_IT_TELECOM
- FINANCE_INSURANCE
- HEALTH_LIFESCIENCES_PRIVATE
- RETAIL_ECOMMERCE
- PROFESSIONAL_BUSINESS_SERVICES
- TRANSPORT_POSTAL
- OTHER
- UNKNOWN

"Community missionary organization" doesn't fit into any of the specific categories listed, so it would be classified as "OTHER".

For Answer 4: This is only applicable if Answer 1 = BUSINESS. Since our Answer 1 is NON_PROFIT, we don't need to answer this.

Answer 5: Is reserved for future use, so I'll put N_A.

For Answer 6: Was an administrative fine explicitly issued? The "Fine" field in the Case Information states "None", and there's no mention of a fine being imposed. So Answer 6 should be NO.

For Answer 7: This is only applicable if Answer 6 = YES, but since Answer 6 is NO, we'll put N_A.

For Answer 8: Which other Article 58(2) corrective powers were explicitly used (besides a fine)? The decision mentions "reprimand" in several places. Specifically:
- "The Data Inspectorate sent the mission assembly a notice of a decision on reprimand"
- "the Norwegian Data Protection Authority gave the mission assembly a reprimand for having processed personal data from camera recordings illegally, cf. Article 58 no. 2 letter b."
- The Privacy Board overturned this reprimand.

The allowed codes include REPRIMAND (which is explicitly mentioned as being used by the DPA). So Answer 8 should be REPRIMAND.

For Answer 9: Did the authority explicitly refer to EDPB administrative-fines guidance or WP253? I don't see any explicit reference to these in the text. The decision mentions "Guidelines 3/2019" but not specifically referring to EDPB administrative-fines guidance (Guidelines 04/2022) or WP253. So Answer 9 should be UNKNOWN.

For Answer 10: Did the decision explicitly reference previous infringements by the same defendant? I don't see any mention of previous infringements in the text, so Answer 10 should be NOT_DISCUSSED (since it's not mentioned at all).

For Answer 11: Was the defendant found not in breach? The Privacy Board overturned the DPA's decision to reprimand. This means they found that there was no breach of GDPR. So Answer 11 should be YES.

Let me double-check my answers:

Answer 1: NON_PROFIT (the primary defendant is a community missionary organization, which is non-profit)
Answer 2: N_A (not applicable since Answer 1 isn't PUBLIC_AUTHORITY)
Answer 3: OTHER (community missionary organization doesn't fit into the specific categories listed)
Answer 4: N_A (not applicable since Answer 1 isn't BUSINESS)
Answer 5: N_A
Answer 6: NO (no fine was issued, as stated in "Fine" field)
Answer 7: N_A (since Answer 6 is NO)
Answer 8: REPRIMAND (the DPA issued a reprimand, which is explicitly mentioned)
Answer 9: UNKNOWN (no explicit reference to EDPB administrative-fines guidance or WP253)
Answer 10: NOT_DISCUSSED (no mention of previous infringements by the same defendant)
Answer 11: YES (the Privacy Board overturned the DPA's decision, meaning they found no breach)

Let me verify if "REPRIMAND" is correctly identified as an Article 58(2) power. The text states:
- "The Data Inspectorate sent the mission assembly a notice of a decision on reprimand"
- "the Norwegian Data Protection Authority gave the mission assembly a reprimand for having processed personal data from camera recordings illegally, cf. Article 58 no. 2 letter b."

This confirms that REPRIMAND is explicitly mentioned as being used under Article 58(2)(b), so it's correctly identified.

Let me check if there are any other Article 58(2) powers mentioned:
- The text mentions "reprimand" but doesn't mention any of the other specific powers like WARNING, ORDER_DSR, etc.
- So REPRIMAND is the only one explicitly used.

For Answer 10: I need to be careful. The question asks if there's an explicit reference to previous infringements by the same defendant. There's no such reference in the text, so NOT_DISCUSSED seems correct (not DISCUSSED_NO_PRIOR or PRIOR_INFRINGER_PRESENT).

Let me check one more time for Answer 11: "Was the defendant found not in breach?" The Privacy Board overturned the DPA's decision to reprimand. This means they found that there was no breach of GDPR, so YES is correct.

Now I'll format my answers exactly as required:

Answer 1: NON_PROFIT
Answer 2: N_A
Answer 3: OTHER
Answer 4: N_A
Answer 5: N_A
Answer 6: NO
Answer 7: N_A
Answer 8: REPRIMAND
Answer 9: UNKNOWN
Answer 10: NOT_DISCUSSED
Answer 11: YES

Let me check if I've got all the answers right:

1. NON_PROFIT - Correct, as it's a community missionary organization (non-profit)
2. N_A - Not applicable since Answer 1 isn't PUBLIC_AUTHORITY
3. OTHER - Community missionary organization doesn't fit into specific categories listed
4. N_A - Not applicable since Answer 1 isn't BUSINESS
5. N_A - Reserved for future use
6. NO - No fine was issued (stated in "Fine" field)
7. N_A - Not applicable since Answer 6 is NO
8. REPRIMAND - Explicitly mentioned as being used by the DPA under Article 58(2)(b)
9. UNKNOWN - No explicit reference to EDPB administrative-fines guidance or WP253
10. NOT_DISCUSSED - No mention of previous infringements by the same defendant
11. YES - The Privacy Board overturned the decision, meaning they found no breach

I think these answers are correct based on the provided text.
