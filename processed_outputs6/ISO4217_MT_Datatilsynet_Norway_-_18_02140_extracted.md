Let me analyze the provided EU data protection authority (DPA) decision to extract facts according to the instructions. I need to output exactly 11 lines in English, each starting with "Answer n: " and containing ONLY one of the allowed tokens.

First, let's identify key information from the decision:

- The defendant is "Bergen municipality" - this is a public authority (municipality)
- It's a local government entity
- There was a fine issued (1,600,000 NOK)
- The violation was related to GDPR Articles 5(1)(f), 32(1)(a) and 32(1)(b)

Now let me go through each question:

Question 1: Top-level category of the defendant
The defendant is "Bergen municipality" - this is a public authority (municipality). So Answer 1 should be PUBLIC_AUTHORITY.

Question 2: Public authority type (only if Q1=PUBLIC_AUTHORITY)
Since it's a municipality, this would be LOCAL_GOVERNMENT. The decision states "Bergen municipality" multiple times and refers to it as a public body.

Question 3: Private-sector activity (not applicable since Q1 is PUBLIC_AUTHORITY)

Question 4: SME status (not applicable since Q1 is not BUSINESS)

Question 5: Reserved for future use - Answer 5 should be N_A

Question 6: Was an administrative fine explicitly issued?
Yes, the decision states "Fine: 1,600,000 NOK" and describes it as a fine. So Answer 6 = YES.

Question 7: Fine amount (only if Q6=YES)
The fine is stated as "1,600,000 NOK". The ISO4217 code for Norwegian Krone is NOK.
So Answer 7 should be "1600000 NOK" (without commas or spaces in the number).

Question 8: Article 58(2) powers used
The decision mentions:
- A fine (which we've already accounted for)
- An order to implement measures ("Bergen municipality must change all employees' login...")

Looking at the allowed codes, "ORDER_COMPLIANCE" would be appropriate here. The decision says: "Pursuant to Article 58 no. 2 letter d of the Privacy Ordinance, the Data Inspectorate makes decisions on the following orders."

So Answer 8 should include "ORDER_COMPLIANCE". Let me check if there are other powers mentioned:
- No mention of warning
- No mention of reprimand (explicitly)
- No mention of order for data subject rights (DSR)
- No ban on processing
- No order to rectify/erase/restrict
- No certificate withdrawal/block
- No suspension of transfers
- No temporary daily fine

So the only additional power mentioned is "ORDER_COMPLIANCE".

Question 9: Did authority explicitly refer to EDPB administrative-fines guidance?
The decision mentions "Privacy Council's guidelines regarding the application and determination of infringement fine in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (WP 253)" - this is referring to WP253, which is a document from the Article 29 Working Party (which was replaced by EDPB).

So Answer 9 = YES.

Question 10: Previous infringements
The decision states: "In the case against Bergen municipality and Møhlenpris school (see under point b), a decision was made that the municipality had to make use of two-factor authentication in access control."

This indicates there was a previous infringement. So Answer 10 = PRIOR_INFRINGER_PRESENT.

Question 11: Was defendant found not in breach?
The decision states "Violation Found" and describes multiple violations, so Answer 11 = NO.

Now let me double-check everything:

Answer 1: PUBLIC_AUTHORITY (defendant is a municipality)
Answer 2: LOCAL_GOVERNMENT (municipality is local government)
Answer 3: N_A (not applicable for public authority)
Answer 4: N_A (not applicable for business)
Answer 5: N_A
Answer 6: YES (fine was issued)
Answer 7: 1600000 NOK (1,600,000 NOK without commas)
Answer 8: ORDER_COMPLIANCE (only additional power mentioned)
Answer 9: YES (referenced WP253 guidelines)
Answer 10: PRIOR_INFRINGER_PRESENT (previous infringement case mentioned)
Answer 11: NO (defendant was found in breach)

Let me verify the fine amount format:
- The decision says "Fine: 1,600,000 NOK"
- We need to output as "DIGITS SPACE ISO4217" without commas
- So it should be "1600000 NOK"

For Answer 8, I'm checking if there are other powers mentioned. The decision says:
"Pursuant to Article 58 no. 2 letter d of the Privacy Ordinance, the Data Inspectorate makes decisions on the following orders:"

This indicates they used a power under Article 58(2)(d), which is "order to take measures" (which would be ORDER_COMPLIANCE). There's also mention of an infringement fine, but that's already accounted for in Q6.

Let me check if there are other powers:
- The decision says: "The Data Inspectorate makes three different decisions. One decision concerns the imposition of infringement fines. The other two decisions apply order to implement further measures."

So they used a fine (Q6) and an order to implement measures (which would be ORDER_COMPLIANCE).

Now I'll format my response exactly as required:

Answer 1: PUBLIC_AUTHORITY
Answer 2: LOCAL_GOVERNMENT
Answer 3: N_A
Answer 4: N_A
Answer 5: N_A
Answer 6: YES
Answer 7: 1600000 NOK
Answer 8: ORDER_COMPLIANCE
Answer 9: YES
Answer 10: PRIOR_INFRINGER_PRESENT
Answer 11: NO

Wait, I need to check if there's any mention of "reprimand" or other powers. The decision doesn't explicitly say "reprimand", so we shouldn't include that.

For Answer 8, the allowed codes are:
WARNING; REPRIMAND; ORDER_DSR; ORDER_COMPLIANCE; ORDER_BREACH_COMMUNICATION; BAN_PROCESSING; ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT; CERT_WITHDRAW_BLOCK; SUSPEND_TRANSFERS; TEMPORARY_DAILY_FINE

The decision mentions "order to implement further measures" which corresponds to ORDER_COMPLIANCE.

Let me check if there's any mention of other powers:
- No warning mentioned
- No reprimand explicitly stated (though they might have implied it, but we need explicit mention)
- No order for data subject rights (DSR) mentioned
- No ban on processing
- No order to rectify/erase/restrict
- No certificate withdrawal/block
- No suspension of transfers
- No temporary daily fine

So the only additional power is ORDER_COMPLIANCE.

For Answer 9, they explicitly mention "Privacy Council's guidelines regarding the application and determination of infringement fine in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (WP 253)". WP253 was a document from the Article 29 Working Party (which became EDPB), so this is referring to guidance that would be relevant.

So Answer 9 = YES.

For Answer 10, they explicitly mention "In the case against Bergen municipality and Møhlenpris school... a decision was made that the municipality had to make use of two-factor authentication in access control." This indicates there was a previous infringement. So Answer 10 = PRIOR_INFRINGER_PRESENT.

Let me double-check all answers:

Answer 1: PUBLIC_AUTHORITY (municipality is public authority)
Answer 2: LOCAL_GOVERNMENT (municipality is local government)
Answer 3: N_A
Answer 4: N_A
Answer 5: N_A
Answer 6: YES (fine was issued)
Answer 7: 1600000 NOK (1,600,000 without commas)
Answer 8: ORDER_COMPLIANCE (only additional power mentioned)
Answer 9: YES (referenced WP253 guidelines)
Answer 10: PRIOR_INFRINGER_PRESENT (previous infringement case mentioned)
Answer 11: NO (defendant was found in breach)

This looks correct.
