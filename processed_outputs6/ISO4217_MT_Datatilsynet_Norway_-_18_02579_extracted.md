I need to extract facts from this EU data protection authority (DPA) decision and output exactly 11 lines in English, each starting with "Answer n: " and containing only one of the allowed tokens.

Let me go through the document carefully to find the relevant information for each question:

Question 1: Top-level category of defendant
- The case is about "Education Agency for Oslo municipality"
- This appears to be a public authority (municipality)
- In the decision, it's referred to as "Oslo Municipality Education Agency" and "the City of Oslo"
- So this should be PUBLIC_AUTHORITY

Question 2: Public Authority Type
- The defendant is an education agency for a municipality
- This would fall under EDUCATION_PUBLIC (as per allowed tokens)

Question 3: Private-sector activity (not applicable since it's a public authority)
- Answer N_A

Question 4: SME Status (not applicable since it's not a business)
- Answer N_A

Question 5: Reserved for future use
- Answer N_A

Question 6: Fine issued?
- The decision states "A fine of NOK 1,200,000 (approximately €120,000), reduced from NOK 2,000,000"
- So YES

Question 7: Total fine amount
- It's stated as "NOK 1,200,000" which is Norwegian Krone
- ISO4217 code for Norwegian Krone is NOK
- Format should be "DIGITS SPACE ISO4217"
- So "1200000 NOK"

Question 8: Article 58(2) powers used (besides fine)
- The decision mentions a fine, but I need to check if there are other corrective powers mentioned
- Looking through the text, it seems only the fine was issued as a sanction
- There's no mention of warnings, reprimands, orders for data subject requests, etc.
- So this should be NONE

Question 9: Reference to EDPB guidance (Guidelines 04/2022) or WP253?
- The decision mentions "Privacy Council's guidelines regarding the application and determination of infringement fine in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (WP 253)"
- So YES

Question 10: Previous infringements by same defendant?
- I don't see any mention of previous infringements
- The decision states "The municipality did not contest the evaluation by the DPA regarding the scope of the security breach."
- But there's no indication of prior violations
- This appears to be a new case, so NOT_DISCUSSED

Question 11: Defendant found not in breach?
- The decision explicitly says "Violation Found" and details multiple breaches
- So NO

Let me double-check each answer:

Answer 1: PUBLIC_AUTHORITY (the defendant is an education agency for Oslo municipality)
Answer 2: EDUCATION_PUBLIC (it's a public education authority)
Answer 3: N_A (not applicable as it's not a business or non-profit)
Answer 4: N_A (not applicable as it's not a business)
Answer 5: N_A
Answer 6: YES (fine was issued)
Answer 7: 1200000 NOK (the fine amount is stated as NOK 1,200,000 which converts to 1200000 NOK)
Answer 8: NONE (only a fine was mentioned as the sanction)
Answer 9: YES (it explicitly references WP253 guidelines)
Answer 10: NOT_DISCUSSED (no mention of previous infringements by this defendant)
Answer 11: NO (the decision states "Violation Found" and details multiple breaches)

Let me verify Answer 8 again. The question asks for Article 58(2) powers used besides a fine. In the document, it says:
"Pursuant to the Privacy Ordinance, Article 58, No. 2, letter i, cf.the Personal Data Act § 26, cf. the Privacy Ordinance art. 83, the Danish Data Protection Agency understands the following decision on infringement fine:"

This indicates that they used "Article 58, No. 2, letter i" which is about imposing fines. The document doesn't mention any other Article 58(2) powers like warnings or reprimands.

So Answer 8 should be NONE.

Let me verify the currency format for Answer 7:
- It's stated as "NOK 1,200,000" in the text
- The instruction says to output without symbols and with no separators: "DIGITS SPACE ISO4217"
- So it should be "1200000 NOK"

Let me check if there's any mention of previous infringements for Answer 10:
- I don't see any reference to prior violations by the same defendant
- The decision states "The municipality did not contest the evaluation by the DPA regarding the scope of the security breach."
- But it doesn't say anything about past violations, so NOT_DISCUSSED is correct.

Let me check if there's any mention of EDPB guidelines (Guidelines 04/2022) or WP253 for Answer 9:
- The document states: "We also refer to the Privacy Council's guidelines regarding the application and determination of infringement fine in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (WP 253)"
- So it explicitly references WP253, which is what we're looking for.
- Answer 9 should be YES.

Now I'll format my response exactly as required:

Answer 1: PUBLIC_AUTHORITY
Answer 2: EDUCATION_PUBLIC
Answer 3: N_A
Answer 4: N_A
Answer 5: N_A
Answer 6: YES
Answer 7: 1200000 NOK
Answer 8: NONE
Answer 9: YES
Answer 10: NOT_DISCUSSED
Answer 11: NO

Wait, I need to make sure about the format. The instruction says "each line starts with 'Answer n: '" and contains ONLY one of the allowed tokens.

So my response should be:

Answer 1: PUBLIC_AUTHORITY
Answer 2: EDUCATION_PUBLIC
Answer 3: N_A
Answer 4: N_A
Answer 5: N_A
Answer 6: YES
Answer 7: 1200000 NOK
Answer 8: NONE
Answer 9: YES
Answer 10: NOT_DISCUSSED
Answer 11: NO

Let me double-check the allowed tokens for each question to make sure I'm using the correct ones:

Question 1: Allowed tokens are PUBLIC_AUTHORITY, BUSINESS, NON_PROFIT, INDIVIDUAL, UNKNOWN. I used PUBLIC_AUTHORITY.

Question 2: For PUBLIC_AUTHORITY, allowed tokens include EDUCATION_PUBLIC. I used that.

Question 3: N_A (not applicable)

Question 4: N_A (not applicable)

Question 5: N_A

Question 6: Allowed tokens are YES, NO, UNKNOWN. I used YES.

Question 7: Format is DIGITS SPACE ISO4217. I used "1200000 NOK".

Question 8: Allowed codes include NONE. I used that.

Question 9: Allowed tokens are YES, NO, UNKNOWN. I used YES.

Question 10: Allowed tokens are PRIOR_INFRINGER_PRESENT, DISCUSSED_NO_PRIOR, NOT_DISCUSSED, UNKNOWN. I used NOT_DISCUSSED.

Question 11: Allowed tokens are YES, NO, UNKNOWN. I used NO.

Everything seems to check out.
