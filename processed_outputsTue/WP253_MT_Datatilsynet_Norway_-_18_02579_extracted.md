Okay, let's start by going through the decision text step by step to extract the required information for each question.

**Question 1: Top-level category of the defendant.**
Looking at the decision, the primary defendant is "Oslo Municipality Education Agency," which is part of a public authority. So the answer should be PUBLIC_AUTHORITY.

**Question 2: Public authority type.**
Since it's Oslo Municipality, which is a local government entity, the answer here would be LOCAL_GOVERNMENT.

**Question 3: Core activity sector.**
The core activity mentioned is education, specifically related to schools and students. The sector cues suggest EDUCATION_PUBLIC might fit, but since the defendant is part of the municipality's education agency, it's more likely EDUCATION_PRIVATE isn't correct here. However, looking at the allowed options under Q3 for PUBLIC_AUTHORITY, there's no specific education public category. Wait, the user instructions mention that if Answer 1 is BUSINESS or NON_PROFIT, then use the sector cues. Since this is a public authority (Answer 1: PUBLIC_AUTHORITY), Question 3 isn't applicable here. So the answer should be N_A.

Wait, but looking back at the instructions for Q3: "only if Answer 1 in {BUSINESS, NON_PROFIT}". Since Answer 1 is PUBLIC_AUTHORITY, Q3's answer is N_A.

**Question 4: SME status.**
The decision doesn't mention anything about the defendant being an SME. So the answer is UNKNOWN.

**Question 5: Evaluation of Article 83(2) factors.**
The decision text mentions that the Data Inspectorate evaluated various factors like severity, number of data subjects affected, measures taken, etc., which are part of Article 83(2). The answer here should be YES.

**Question 6: Administrative fine issued?**
Yes, a fine of NOK 1.2 million was imposed. So the answer is YES.

**Question 7: Total fine amount.**
The total fine is stated as NOK 1,200,000. According to the format, it should be "1200000 NOK".

**Question 8: Article 58(2) corrective powers used besides a fine.**
Looking at the decision text, there's mention of measures taken by the municipality to close the breach and mitigate damage. However, specific orders like reprimand or warnings aren't explicitly mentioned. The only explicit order is the fine. So the answer might be NONE.

Wait, but in section 4.2.4, it says "The security hole was closed the same day as the municipality discovered it." This could imply that they took corrective actions, but according to the lexicon for Q8, "orders" like requiring compliance or rectification would be needed. Since there's no explicit mention of orders beyond the fine, the answer is NONE.

**Question 9: EDPB/WP253 reference?**
The decision text refers to the Privacy Council's guidelines (WP 253) in section 4. So the answer is YES.

**Question 10: Previous infringements?**
There's no mention of prior infringements by the same defendant. The answer is NOT_DISCUSSED.

**Question 11: Not-in-breach?**
The decision states that there was a breach, so Answer 11 is NO.

**Question 12: Role of the defendant.**
The defendant is described as the data controller (Oslo Municipality Education Agency), so the answer is CONTROLLER.

**Question 13: Cross-border OSS case?**
There's no mention of cross-border aspects or One-Stop-Shop procedures. The answer is NO.

**Question 14: Art. 9/10 data involved?**
The text mentions that sensitive information like health data was potentially exposed, which falls under Article 9. So the answer is ART9.

**Question 15: Processing context.**
The application involves children in primary schools and their personal data, including absence reports and health info. The contexts are CHILDREN_EDUCATION and HEALTHCARE_PATIENT (since it's about health information). Also, there's a mention of breach security. So the answer would be BREACH_SECURITY;CHILDREN_EDUCATION;HEALTHCARE_PATIENT.
