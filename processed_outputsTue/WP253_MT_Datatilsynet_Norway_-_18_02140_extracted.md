Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a lengthy decision text from the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) regarding Bergen Municipality. They want me to extract specific facts based on the given instructions.

First, I need to go through each question one by one. Starting with Question 1: What is the top-level category of the defendant? The defendant here is Bergen Municipality, which is a public authority. So Answer 1 should be PUBLIC_AUTHORITY.

Next, Question 2 asks for the public authority type. Since Bergen is a municipality, it's LOCAL_GOVERNMENT. That's Answer 2.

Question 3 is about private-sector activity, but since the defendant is a public authority, this question isn't applicable. So Answer 3 is N_A.

For Question 4 (SME status), again, since it's a public entity, SME doesn't apply here. Answer 4: N_A.

Question 5 asks if individual Article 83(2) factors were evaluated when setting the fine. The decision mentions several factors like nature of infringement, negligence, measures taken, etc., which are part of Article 83(2). So Answer 5 is YES.

Question 6 checks if an administrative fine was issued. Yes, the text states a fine of NOK 1,600,000. Answer 6: YES.

Question 7 requires the total fine amount in ISO format. The amount is 1,600,000 Norwegian kroner, so Answer 7: 1600000 NOK.

Question 8 asks about other Article 58(2) powers used besides a fine. The decision mentions an order to implement two-factor authentication. Looking at the allowed codes, ORDER_COMPLIANCE fits here. So Answer 8: ORDER_COMPLIANCE.

Question 9 checks if EDPB guidance (Guidelines 04/2022 or WP253) was referenced. The text mentions the Privacy Council's guidelines but not specifically EDPB's. So Answer 9: UNKNOWN.

Question 10 asks about previous infringements. The decision references a prior case with MÃ¸hlenpris school, so Answer 10: PRIOR_INFRINGER_PRESENT.

Finally, Question 11: Was the defendant found not in breach? No, they were found in breach and fined. So Answer 11: NO.

I need to make sure each answer is correctly formatted and uses the allowed tokens without any extra text or explanations.
