Okay, let's start by looking at the user query. They provided a detailed press release from the Data Inspectorate regarding a fine imposed on Oslo Municipality Education Agency for a data breach in their mobile app School Notification.

First, I need to extract facts based on the given instructions. The primary defendant here is clearly Oslo Municipality Education Agency, which is part of the public sector. So for Q1, the top-level category should be PUBLIC_AUTHORITY.

Next, for Q2, since it's a public authority, we need to determine the type. The agency is part of the education sector under the municipality, so EDUCATION_PUBLIC makes sense here.

For Q3, since the defendant is a public authority, this question isn't applicable, so N_A.

Q4 asks about SME status for businesses, but since it's a public entity, again N_A.

Looking at the fine details: The decision mentions an infringement fee of NOK 1.2 million. So Answer 6 would be YES, and Answer 7 is 1200000 NOK.

Article 58(2) powers used here include ordering compliance (since they had to fix the vulnerabilities), so ORDER_COMPLIANCE. There's no mention of other measures like reprimand or warning, so only that one.

Previous infringements: The decision doesn't mention prior issues with the same defendant, so NOT_DISCUSSED.

Not-in-breach is NO because there was a violation found.

The EDPB guidance (Guidelines 04/2022) isn't explicitly mentioned here, so Answer 9 is UNKNOWN.

For the evaluation of Article 83(2) factors, the decision does discuss several factors like severity, measures taken, etc., so Answer 5 would be YES.
