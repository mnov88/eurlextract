Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a detailed case from the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) and wants me to extract specific facts based on their instructions.

First, I need to determine the top-level category of the defendant. Looking at the parties involved, the main defendant here is the "Community missionary organization," which is an organization. The allowed tokens are PUBLIC_AUTHORITY, BUSINESS, NON_PROFIT, INDIVIDUAL, or UNKNOWN. Since it's a missionary organization, that's likely a non-profit. So Answer 1 should be NON_PROFIT.

Next, since Q1 was NON_PROFIT, I need to check if the question about public authority type (Q2) applies. It doesn't, so Answer 2 is N_A.

For Q3, which asks about the core activity sector for BUSINESS or NON_PROFIT. The missionary organization's activities are related to religious or charitable work, but the allowed options don't include that directly. The closest might be OTHER since it's not in the listed sectors like digital, finance, etc. So Answer 3 is OTHER.

Q4 asks if the defendant is an SME. There's no mention of the organization being classified as an SME, so Answer 4 is UNKNOWN.

Q5: Did the authority evaluate Article 83(2) factors when setting a fine? The case doesn't mention any fine; instead, there was a reprimand. So Answer 5 is NO because no fine was issued.

Q6: Was an administrative fine issued? The outcome says "Fine: None," so Answer 6 is NO.

Q7: Since Q6 is NO, this answer is N_A.

Q8: Article 58(2) powers used. The DPA issued a reprimand under Article 58(2)(b), which corresponds to REPRIMAND. So Answer 8 is REPRIMAND.

Q9: Did the authority refer to EDPB guidance? The text doesn't mention Guidelines 04/2022 or WP253, so Answer 9 is NO.

Q10: Previous infringements? The decision doesn't discuss prior issues by the same defendant, so Answer 10 is NOT_DISCUSSED.

Q11: Not in breach? The Privacy Appeals Board overturned the DPA's decision, finding that the organization had a legal basis under Article 6(1)(f). So the defendant was not found in breach. Therefore, Answer 11 is YES.
