Okay, let's start by going through the decision text provided and extract the necessary information for each of the 15 questions. 

First, the top-level category (Question 1) is asking whether the defendant is a public authority, business, non-profit, individual, or unknown. The case involves the Public Roads Administration (Statens vegvesen), which is a government body in Norway. So Answer 1 should be PUBLIC_AUTHORITY.

Next, Question 2 asks for the primary public authority type. Looking at the decision text, the Public Roads Administration is part of the Norwegian government, so it's likely under LOCAL_GOVERNMENT or CENTRAL_MINISTRY_AGENCY. Since they are a national authority responsible for roads, maybe CENTRAL_MINISTRY_AGENCY fits better.

For Question 3, since the defendant is a public authority, this question isn't applicable, so Answer 3 would be N_A.

Question 4 asks if the defendant is an SME. The decision text doesn't mention anything about the company size or SME status, so Answer 4 should be UNKNOWN.

Moving to Article 83(2) evaluation (Question 5), the decision mentions that the authority considered various factors like the nature and duration of the infringement, measures taken by the controller, etc., which suggests a systematic evaluation. So Answer 5 is YES.

Question 6 asks if an administrative fine was issued. The text states a fine of NOK 1,000,000 was imposed, so Answer 6 is YES.

For Question 7, the total fine amount is NOK 1,000,000. According to formatting rules, it should be written as "1000000 NOK".

Question 8 asks about other Article 58(2) corrective powers used besides a fine. The decision mentions ordering deletion of personal data, which falls under ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT and ORDER_COMPLIANCE. So the answer would be ORDER_COMPLIANCE;ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT.

Question 9 asks if EDPB/WP253 guidance was referenced. The text doesn't mention any such references, so Answer 9 is NO.

For Question 10 on previous infringements, there's no explicit mention of prior violations by the same defendant, so Answer 10 is NOT_DISCUSSED.

Question 11 checks if the defendant was found not in breach. The decision states that a violation was found, so Answer 11 is NO.

Question 12 asks for the defendant's role. The Public Roads Administration is the controller, so Answer 12 is CONTROLLER.

Question 13 about cross-border OSS (Article 60) isn't mentioned, so Answer 13 is UNKNOWN.

Question 14 checks if Art. 9 or 10 data was involved. The case involves toll road crossing logs with personal data like car tag numbers and location, which doesn't fall under special categories (Art. 9) or criminal offenses (Art. 10), so Answer 14 is NO.

Finally, Question 15 asks about processing contexts. The data includes personal information related to toll crossings, which might relate to KYC_AML if it's for identification purposes, but more likely it's under OTHER since the context isn't explicitly listed in the provided categories. However, looking back, the data is about toll road crossings with location and time, which could be considered as part of employment or other contexts, but none fit exactly. The closest might be OTHER.
