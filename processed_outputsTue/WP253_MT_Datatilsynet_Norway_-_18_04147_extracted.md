Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a detailed decision from the Norwegian DPA (Datatilsynet) regarding a fine imposed on the Public Roads Administration (Statens vegvesen). They want me to extract specific facts based on the given instructions and format them into 11 lines with exact tokens.

First, I need to identify the top-level category of the defendant. The case involves the Public Roads Administration, which is a public authority. So Answer 1 should be PUBLIC_AUTHORITY.

Next, for Question 2, since it's a public authority, I need to determine the type. The Public Roads Administration is part of the Norwegian government, so LOCAL_GOVERNMENT might not fit. Looking at the options, CENTRAL_MINISTRY_OR_AGENCY seems appropriate because they're a central government agency responsible for roads.

For Question 3, since the defendant is a public authority, this question isn't applicable. So Answer 3 is N_A.

Question 4 asks about SME status, but since it's a public authority, not a business, Answer 4 is N_A.

Question 5: The decision mentions that the DPA reassessed the case and adjusted the fine based on factors like the duration of the infringement and cooperation. However, there's no explicit mention of systematically evaluating Article 83(2) factors. So Answer 5 might be UNKNOWN or NO. But looking at the text, they did consider various elements (nature, severity, etc.), but not explicitly stating systematic evaluation of each factor under Article 83(2). So maybe UNKNOWN.

Question 6: The fine was issued as NOK 1 million. So Answer 6 is YES.

Question 7: The amount is 1,000,000 NOK. So Answer 7 is "1000000 NOK".

Question 8: The DPA ordered deletion of data (ORDER_COMPLIANCE) and possibly a reprimand? Wait, the decision mentions instructing to delete data without undue delay, which would be ORDER_COMPLIANCE. There's no mention of other measures like warning or reprimand. So Answer 8 is ORDER_COMPLIANCE.

Question 9: The text doesn't reference EDPB guidelines (Guidelines 04/2022) or WP253. So Answer 9 is NO.

Question 10: There's no mention of prior infringements by the same defendant, so Answer 10 is NOT_DISCUSSED.

Question 11: The decision states that the Public Roads Administration was found in violation, so Answer 11 is NO.
