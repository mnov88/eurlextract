Based on the provided decision text, here's a summary of the key points regarding Spotify's handling of data subject access requests (DSARs) under GDPR:

### Key Findings and Violations

1. **General Routines Deficiencies**:
   - Spotify failed to provide complete information required by Article 15(1)(a)-(h) and 15(2) GDPR for a period from November 16, 2021 through May 16, 2022.
   - The description of data in technical log files was insufficiently explained (June 11, 2019 to May 16, 2022).

2. **Complaint-Specific Violations**:
   - **Complaint 1**: Spotify failed to provide a complete copy of personal data within the required timeframe and provided encrypted/encrypted data.
   - **Complaint 2**: Spotify didn't provide all required information under Article 15(1)(a)-(h) and 15(2).

### Sanctions

- **Administrative Penalty Fee**:
  - â‚¬58,000,000 (approximately 1% of maximum possible fine based on Spotify's turnover)
  - Justified by:
    * Large number of affected users
    * Long duration of violations
    * Difficulty for data subjects to exercise other rights

- **Other Measures**:
  - Reprimand for Complaint 2
  - Ordered to comply with Article 15 GDPR for Complaint 2 (provide complete information within one month)

### Key Observations About Spotify's Practices

1. **Information Provision**:
   - Information was available but not always properly communicated in DSAR responses.
   - Some information was only available through privacy policy rather than directly with access requests.

2. **Language Issues**:
   - Descriptions of technical log data were provided in English without proper translation support for non-English users.

3. **Improvements Made**:
   - Spotify had implemented improvements before regulatory action
   - Added detailed explanations on their "Understand my data" webpage

4. **Operational Practices**:
   - Users could contact customer service for additional information
   - Some complainants received complete responses after follow-up requests

This decision highlights the importance of:
- Providing complete, clear and accessible information in DSAR responses
- Ensuring technical explanations are understandable to average users
- Maintaining transparency about data processing activities
- Responding fully within legal timeframes (1 month extendable by 2 months)

The case demonstrates how regulators assess both systemic compliance failures and individual complaint handling when determining appropriate enforcement actions.
