The document is a penalty notice issued by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the UK to Tuckers Solicitors LLP for breaches of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The key points are:

1. **Breach Details**:
   - A cyber-attack occurred on 24 August 2020, resulting in the encryption and exfiltration of personal data from Tuckers' systems.
   - Approximately 972,191 files were encrypted, including 24,711 court bundles. Of these, 60 bundles containing sensitive personal data (including special category data) were published on the dark web.

2. **Contraventions**:
   - Failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures under Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR.
   - Specific failings included:
     - Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) on remote access solutions
     - Delayed patch management for critical security updates
     - Inadequate encryption of data at rest

3. **Factors Considered**:
   - The seriousness of the breach, affecting vulnerable individuals and involving sensitive court-related data
   - Tuckers' negligence in failing to implement basic security measures despite prior warnings from regulatory bodies
   - Mitigating factors including Tuckers' cooperation with the investigation and subsequent improvements to their security posture

4. **Penalty**:
   - The ICO imposed a penalty of Â£98,000 (ninety-eight thousand pounds)
   - This amount was calculated based on 3.25% of Tuckers' annual turnover for June 2020
   - The penalty is effective and proportionate given the circumstances

5. **Appeal Rights**:
   - Tuckers has the right to appeal against either the imposition or the amount of the penalty within 28 days through the First-tier Tribunal (Information Rights)

The document serves as a clear example of regulatory action for GDPR non-compliance in the legal sector, highlighting the importance of implementing robust data security measures.
