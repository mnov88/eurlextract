The decision by the Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB) regarding a complaint about Wikipedia's handling of personal data provides several key insights into the application of GDPR principles, particularly in relation to public figures and freedom of expression.

### Key Points from the Decision:

1. **Applicability of GDPR**:
   - The DSB confirmed that the GDPR applies to Wikipedia (the respondent) as it operates within the EU and processes personal data.
   - Wikipedia was found not to be a "media owner" under Austrian law, so the media privilege exception in Article 85 GDPR did not apply.

2. **Controller Status**:
   - The DSB determined that Wikipedia acts as a joint controller for the processing of personal data on its platform, even though it does not directly control or edit content.
   - This is because Wikipedia provides the infrastructure and framework within which users create and modify content.

3. **Data Accuracy and Completeness**:
   - The complainant (a public figure) argued that some information about him was inaccurate or incomplete.
   - The DSB found that the information was largely accurate, even if not exhaustive, and that Wikipedia's purpose of providing general information did not require listing all of his works.

4. **Right to Erasure (Article 17 GDPR)**:
   - The complainant requested deletion of his personal data under Article 17 GDPR.
   - The DSB weighed the complainant’s right to erasure against Wikipedia’s legitimate interest in providing free, public information and the public’s right to access information about a public figure.
   - The balance favored Wikipedia because:
     - The complainant is a public figure (a filmmaker, director, cameraman, and author).
     - The information was accurate and available elsewhere online, including on his own website.
     - The intensity of the intervention into his privacy was low.

5. **Freedom of Expression vs. Privacy**:
   - The DSB emphasized that freedom of expression (Article 11 EUCFR) and public access to information about public figures can outweigh privacy rights under GDPR.
   - This aligns with the ECJ’s case law, such as *Google Spain v. AEPD* (2014), where the right to be forgotten was balanced against the public interest in accessing accurate information.

### Implications:
- **Public Figures and Wikipedia**: The decision reinforces that Wikipedia can retain biographical information about public figures even if they request deletion, provided the data is accurate and in the public interest.
- **GDPR’s Flexibility**: The DSB’s approach shows that GDPR does not always favor erasure, especially when balancing conflicting fundamental rights (privacy vs. freedom of expression).
- **Role of Wikipedia as a Platform**: The decision highlights Wikipedia’s unique role as a user-generated platform where it is not directly responsible for content but still subject to GDPR as a joint controller.

### Conclusion:
The DSB dismissed the complainant’s request, upholding Wikipedia’s right to retain his personal data. This reflects a broader trend in EU data protection law where public figures have limited rights to erase accurate information that serves the public interest.
