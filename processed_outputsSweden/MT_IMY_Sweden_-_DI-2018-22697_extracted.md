### Summary of the Decision

The Swedish Data Protection Authority (IMY) has issued a decision against the Executive Board of the Rescue Service Östra Skaraborg for violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The violations pertain to the processing of personal data through camera surveillance at eight fire stations.

#### Key Points:

1. **Violations Identified**:
   - **Article 5(1)(a) GDPR**: The camera surveillance was deemed unreasonable in relation to the employees' privacy interests, particularly during the change into alarm stands.
   - **Article 5(1)(c) GDPR**: The surveillance was excessive as it operated around the clock in real-time without proper masking or demarcation of privacy-sensitive areas.
   - **Article 32(1) and (4) GDPR**: The Rescue Service lacked appropriate organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data, including guidelines for accessing and handling the camera footage.

2. **Factors Considered**:
   - The socially important task of the Rescue Service in preventing and limiting accidents.
   - The privacy-sensitive nature of monitoring employees during change into alarm stands.
   - The lack of guidelines and measures to reduce the invasion of privacy.

3. **Decision**:
   - The Executive Board of the Rescue Service Östra Skaraborg was ordered to pay an administrative penalty fee of SEK 350,000.
     - SEK 300,000 for violations of Article 5(1)(a) and (c).
     - SEK 50,000 for violations of Article 32(1) and (4).

4. **Appeal Process**:
   - The decision can be appealed within three weeks from the date of announcement by submitting an appeal to IMY.

This decision underscores the importance of balancing operational efficiency with privacy rights, especially in sensitive contexts like emergency services.
