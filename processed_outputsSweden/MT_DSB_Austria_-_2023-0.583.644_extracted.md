Based on the provided decision text, here's a concise summary of the key points:

### Key Findings:
1. **Unlawful Processing**:
   - The accused operated a video surveillance system without proper legal basis (Article 6 GDPR).
   - The processing violated transparency requirements (Article 5(1)(a) GDPR) and data minimization principles (Article 5(1)(c) GDPR).

2. **Violation of Record-Keeping Obligation**:
   - The accused failed to maintain a mandatory processing register as required by Article 30 GDPR.

3. **Fault & Penalty**:
   - The accused acted negligently, failing to comply with GDPR requirements despite available guidance.
   - A fine of â‚¬20,000 was imposed (0.1% of the maximum penalty range under Article 83(5) GDPR).

### Key Legal Principles:
- **Absorption Principle**: Multiple violations arising from the same processing operation are penalized as one offense (Article 83(3) GDPR).
- **Turnover Calculation**: Fines for companies are based on global annual turnover, not profit.
- **Proportionality**: The fine was set at the lower end of the penalty range due to mitigating factors (no prior violations).

### Practical Implications:
- Employers must ensure video surveillance complies with GDPR transparency and data minimization rules.
- Controllers must maintain complete processing records as evidence of compliance.

This case highlights the importance of proactive GDPR compliance, particularly in high-risk areas like workplace monitoring.
