Answer:
- **System**: The system is a legal decision-making framework that evaluates compliance with data protection regulations, specifically the GDPR. It involves analyzing the context of a case, identifying relevant laws and guidelines, and determining appropriate penalties based on the severity and nature of the violation.

- **Decision Context**:
  - **Jurisdiction**: Austria
  - **Regulation**: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
  - **Case Reference**: DSB (Austria) – 2023-0.789.858
  - **Key Articles**: Article 12(3), Article 15, and Article 83 of the GDPR

- **Facts**:
  - A data subject filed a complaint regarding the deletion of their personal data without proper notice.
  - The data controller (a bank) argued that the deletion was part of routine data management practices.
  - The Data Protection Authority (DSB) found that the bank had violated the GDPR by not providing sufficient notice before deleting the data.

- **Relevant Rules**:
  - **Article 12(3)**: Requires controllers to inform data subjects about actions taken on their personal data, including deletions.
  - **Article 15**: Grants data subjects the right to access their personal data and information about how it is processed.
  - **Article 83**: Provides guidelines for imposing administrative fines for GDPR violations.

- **Application**:
  - The DSB determined that the bank had violated Article 12(3) by failing to notify the data subject before deleting their data.
  - The severity of the violation was assessed as low due to the lack of intentionality and the limited impact on the data subject.
  - Mitigating factors included the bank's cooperation with the investigation and its efforts to rectify the situation.

- **Conclusion**:
  - The DSB imposed a fine of €9,500 on the bank for the violation.
  - The decision emphasizes the importance of transparency in data processing activities and the need for controllers to comply with GDPR requirements regarding notice and access to personal data.

- **Additional Notes**:
  - The case highlights the importance of understanding and adhering to GDPR regulations, particularly those related to data subject rights and transparency.
  - The DSB's decision aligns with the broader goal of ensuring that data controllers are held accountable for their actions under the GDPR.
