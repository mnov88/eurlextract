Based on the provided decision text from IMY (Sweden), here's a summary of the key points:

### Key Findings:
1. **Violation of GDPR Article 6(1)**:
   - Bonnier News AB processed personal data without proper legal basis for profiling individuals to display tailored advertisements and for telephone/direct mail marketing.
   - The processing involved behavioral data (collected via cookies) linked with other customer data, creating extensive profiles.

2. **Profiling Concerns**:
   - The profiling was deemed "extensive" as it combined surfing history, purchase history, demographic data, and statistical data from external sources (Bisnode Sverige AB).
   - IMY emphasized that such profiling goes beyond what individuals can reasonably expect without explicit consent.

3. **Legitimate Interest Assessment**:
   - While Bonnier News AB argued its commercial interest in profiling was legitimate, IMY ruled that the privacy interests of data subjects outweighed these interests.
   - The balancing test considered:
     - The nature of the data (behavioral + purchase history).
     - Lack of explicit consent for such extensive profiling.
     - Potential impact on individuals' sense of control and privacy.

4. **Penalty**:
   - A fine of 13,000,000 SEK (~â‚¬1.2 million) was imposed based on:
     - Duration (long-standing violation).
     - Scale (large number of data subjects affected).
     - Mitigating factors: Data minimization efforts and no disclosure outside the group.

### Key Takeaways for Compliance:
- **Consent Requirement**: Behavioral data collected via cookies cannot be repurposed for extensive profiling without explicit consent.
- **Profiling Limits**: Combining behavioral data with other personal data (e.g., purchases) heightens privacy risks and may require stronger legal bases.
- **Transparency**: Clear communication about data use is critical, especially when profiling involves sensitive inferences.

### Appeal Process:
The decision can be appealed within three weeks to the Administrative Court in Stockholm.
