### Summary of the Decision

The Swedish Data Protection Authority (Datainspektionen) issued a decision against KRY, a healthcare provider, for failing to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Patient Data Act. The main issues identified were:

1. **Inadequate Needs and Risk Analysis**: KRY had not conducted a comprehensive needs and risk analysis before allocating access permissions in their journal systems (ProReNata and National Patient Overview). This meant that they could not demonstrate that they had restricted access to only what was necessary for staff to perform their duties.

2. **Violation of GDPR Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1)-(2)**: These articles require that personal data be processed securely and that appropriate technical and organizational measures are implemented to protect the data. KRY's failure to conduct a proper analysis meant they could not ensure this security.

3. **Violation of the Patient Data Act**: Specifically, Chapter 4 Section 2 and Chapter 6 Section 7, which mandate that access permissions be restricted based on a needs and risk analysis.

### Key Points

- **Needs and Risk Analysis**: KRY had conducted an initial analysis but it was insufficient as it did not adequately consider the risks to individuals' rights and freedoms or different types of data. They later improved this analysis, but further development was required.
- **Authorization Allocation**: The initial access permissions were too broad, potentially leading to unauthorized access to personal data.
- **Documentation of Access (Logs)**: KRY had implemented logging measures that complied with the requirements, but these were not sufficient on their own without a proper needs and risk analysis.

### Decision

The Data Inspectorate ordered KRY to complete their needs and risk analyses by February 2021. Specifically, they needed to:

1. Develop the analysis of risks to individuals' rights and freedoms.
2. Reassess the allocation of permissions based on this updated analysis to ensure that each user only has access to the personal data necessary for their tasks.

### Conclusion

This decision highlights the importance of conducting thorough needs and risk analyses before allocating access permissions in systems handling sensitive personal data, especially in healthcare settings where such data is particularly vulnerable. The Data Inspectorate's intervention ensures that KRY aligns its practices with GDPR requirements and national laws to protect individuals' privacy rights.

### Key Takeaways

- **Compliance Requirement**: Organizations must conduct comprehensive needs and risk analyses before allocating access permissions.
- **Security Measures**: Appropriate technical and organizational measures are essential for protecting personal data.
- **Regulatory Oversight**: Regulatory bodies like Datainspektionen play a crucial role in ensuring compliance with data protection laws.

This summary provides an overview of the key aspects of the decision, focusing on the regulatory requirements and the steps taken by the Data Inspectorate to ensure compliance.
