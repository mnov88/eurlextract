# Summary of the Decision

The Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB) ruled on a complaint regarding the processing of personal data during an audit conducted by the Federal Office for Safety in Health Care (BASG). The complainant, a pharmaceutical wholesaler, alleged that its right to confidentiality under Section 1(1) of the Austrian Data Protection Act (DSG) was violated when BASG processed and disclosed business documents during an unannounced inspection.

## Key Points

1. **Legal Person's Right to Privacy**:
   - The DSB confirmed that legal persons can invoke the protection of Section 1 DSG, which goes beyond the scope of EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that primarily protects natural persons.
   - However, the complainant’s right to privacy was not violated because the data processing was based on a valid legal basis under Sections 67 and 68 of the Austrian Medicines Act (AMG).

2. **Proportionality of Data Processing**:
   - The audit was conducted as an unannounced inspection, which inherently involves some level of excessive data collection initially.
   - BASG subsequently reviewed the collected data and deleted irrelevant information, which is acceptable under data protection law.

3. **Disclosure to Third Parties**:
   - The DSB found that BASG’s disclosure of the complainant’s data to third parties (pharmacies) was necessary for investigating potential violations of the AMG.
   - While the complainant argued that this disclosure violated its right to confidentiality, the DSB ruled that it was lawful as part of an administrative investigation.

4. **Deletion of Data**:
   - The complainant also claimed that BASG failed to delete irrelevant data promptly.
   - The DSB dismissed this claim, stating that the retention period was justified by ongoing investigations and requests from the complainant.

## Conclusion

The complaint was dismissed as unfounded because:
- The data processing had a valid legal basis under AMG.
- The disclosure of data to third parties was necessary for administrative purposes.
- The retention period was justified by ongoing procedures.

This decision highlights the balance between regulatory oversight (e.g., audits in the pharmaceutical sector) and data protection rights, even for legal persons.
