# Summary of the Decision

The Swedish Data Protection Authority (IMY) has issued a decision regarding a company's use of camera surveillance in a residential property. The key points are:

1. **Legal Basis for Surveillance**:
   - The company lacks a legal basis under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for most of its camera surveillance activities, particularly in areas like entrances and stairwells.
   - However, the surveillance in the garage is deemed to have a valid legal basis due to the higher risk of theft.

2. **Information Obligations**:
   - The company failed to fully comply with the information obligations under Article 13 GDPR regarding the processing of personal data through camera surveillance.
   - Deficiencies were found in providing clear and complete information about the purpose, legal basis, storage period, and data subject rights.

3. **Corrective Measures**:
   - The company is ordered to cease surveillance in all areas except the garage within four weeks of the decision taking effect.
   - The company must update signage with complete information about the surveillance, including contact details for the data controller.

4. **Administrative Penalty Fee**:
   - A penalty fee of 200,000 SEK is imposed on the company for the violations found.
   - The amount was determined based on the seriousness of the violations and the company's financial situation.

5. **Appeal Process**:
   - The decision can be appealed within three weeks to the Administrative Court in Stockholm.

This case highlights the importance of ensuring camera surveillance complies with GDPR requirements, particularly regarding legal basis and transparency obligations towards data subjects.
