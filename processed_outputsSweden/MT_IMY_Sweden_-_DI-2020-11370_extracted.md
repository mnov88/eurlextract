Based on the provided decision text, here's a summary of the key points:

### Key Points from the Decision

1. **Context**:
   - The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) investigated Dagens Industri Aktiebolag's use of Google Analytics.
   - The investigation focused on whether personal data was being transferred to the US in compliance with GDPR.

2. **Findings**:
   - IMY found that Dagens Industri transferred personal data (including IP addresses and unique identifiers) to Google LLC in the US via Google Analytics.
   - The transfer was not adequately protected against access by US intelligence services, as required by GDPR (Article 44).

3. **Legal Basis**:
   - The transfer violated GDPR because:
     - Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) alone were insufficient due to US surveillance laws (FISA Section 702).
     - Additional measures taken by Dagens Industri and Google (e.g., IP address truncation, cookie hashing) did not effectively prevent access by US authorities.

4. **Decision**:
   - IMY concluded that the transfer violated GDPR.
   - Instead of imposing a penalty fee, IMY issued an injunction requiring Dagens Industri to:
     - Cease using Google Analytics (as configured on August 14, 2020) unless additional protective measures are implemented.
     - Ensure compliance with GDPR within one month after the decision becomes legally binding.

5. **Appeal Process**:
   - Dagens Industri can appeal the decision by submitting a written appeal to IMY within three weeks of receiving the decision.

### Implications
This case highlights the challenges of using US-based services like Google Analytics under GDPR, especially post-Schrems II. Companies must ensure that transfers to third countries (like the US) are supported by adequate safeguards and additional measures where necessary.
