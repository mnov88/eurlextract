Based on the provided decision text, here's a summary of the key points regarding the Austrian Data Protection Authority's (DSB) ruling on video surveillance in a residential building:

### Key Findings:
1. **Proportionality and Necessity**:
   - The DSB found that the extensive video surveillance in entrance, elevator, staircase, and corridor areas was disproportionate and violated the principle of data minimization under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.
   - The authority emphasized that milder measures (e.g., electronic access control) were sufficient to achieve the stated security goals.

2. **Specific Violations**:
   - Cameras recording entrance, elevator, staircase, corridor areas (numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 38) were deemed inadmissible due to excessive intrusion into residents' privacy.
   - The DSB noted that such surveillance could not be justified by property protection interests alone.

3. **Permissible Surveillance**:
   - Limited recording in garbage rooms (cameras: 9, 10, 35), bicycle/stroller storage areas (24, 25, 36), and garage entrances (27, 37) was deemed acceptable due to past incidents of theft/damage.
   - The authority balanced the controller's property protection interests against residents' privacy rights.

4. **Remedial Measures**:
   - The DSB ordered the restriction of recording areas for cameras near parcel stations (numbers: 6, 17) to avoid capturing entrance areas unnecessarily.
   - Further processing by the disproportionate cameras was prohibited under Article 58(2)(f) GDPR.

### Legal Basis:
- **Article 5(1)(c) GDPR**: Data minimization principle requiring processing to be limited to what is necessary for the purpose.
- **Article 6(1)(f) GDPR**: Legitimate interest as a lawful basis, but only if necessity and proportionality are satisfied.
- **Case Law**: The DSB cited ECJ rulings (e.g., C-597/19) and national court decisions to support its interpretation of "highly personal areas" and the limits of surveillance.

### Practical Implications:
- Residential property managers must ensure video surveillance is strictly necessary, proportionate, and limited to specific risks.
- Electronic access control systems are preferred over extensive CCTV in shared spaces like entrances and hallways.
- Regular reviews of camera coverage are recommended to align with evolving legal standards (e.g., balancing new incidents against residents' privacy).

This decision underscores the importance of compliance with GDPR's data minimization principle, especially in contexts where surveillance could intrude on private life.
