Based on the provided decision text, here's a summary of the key points:

### Key Facts:
- The Data Protection Authority (DSB) in Austria imposed a fine of **€10,000** on an organization for failing to cooperate with a complaint procedure under Article 31 GDPR.
- The organization had a turnover of approximately **€176 million**.
- The violation was classified as having a **"low level of seriousness"**.

### Legal Basis:
The decision is based on:
- **Article 31 GDPR** (obligation to cooperate with the supervisory authority).
- **Article 58(1)(a) and (e) GDPR** (powers of the supervisory authority to investigate and issue fines).
- **Article 83 GDPR** (penalties for violations).

### Reasons for the Fine:
1. The organization failed to respond to multiple requests from the DSB regarding a complaint procedure.
2. Despite being informed by the DSB about the pending complaint, the organization’s Data Protection Officer (DSBA) did not take further action or inform management.
3. The violation was considered intentional due to the organization’s awareness of its obligations under GDPR.

### Mitigating Factors:
- The organization admitted the violation and cooperated during the investigation.
- No prior GDPR violations were recorded against the organization.
- The organization implemented measures (e.g., a "security system" for official documents) in response to the proceedings, which were considered mitigating factors.

### Penalty Calculation:
- The fine was set at **€10,000**, representing **0.1% of the maximum possible penalty** under Article 83(4) GDPR (up to €10 million or 2% of global turnover).
- The DSB justified this as proportionate due to the low severity of the violation and the organization’s cooperation.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Cooperation with Supervisory Authorities is Mandatory**: Failing to respond to requests from a data protection authority can lead to fines, even if the violation is minor.
2. **Internal Processes Matter**: The DSB noted that internal deficiencies (e.g., failure to forward official documents) contributed to the violation.
3. **Mitigation Through Remediation**: The organization’s efforts to improve compliance post-violation were taken into account in reducing the penalty.

This case highlights the importance of establishing clear procedures for handling data protection authority inquiries and ensuring accountability within organizations, especially at senior levels (e.g., Data Protection Officers must escalate issues appropriately).
