Based on the provided decision text, here's a summary of the key points:

### Key Facts:
- The Data Protection Authority (DSB) in Austria imposed a fine of €11,000 on an entity for GDPR violations.
- The violations involved:
  - Failure to comply with a deletion request under Article 17(1)(a) GDPR
  - Non-compliance with the authority's service order
  - Violation of data protection by design principles (Article 25(1))
  - Failure to follow instructions from the supervisory authority (Article 58(2)(c))

### Legal Basis:
- The fine was imposed under Articles 83(4), 83(5), and 83(6) GDPR
- The authority considered this a medium-level seriousness violation

### Key Findings:
1. **Non-compliance with Deletion Request**:
   - A legally binding deletion request from September 2020 was ignored
   - Subsequent service order (May 2021 decision) also not complied with
   - The entity failed to implement proper technical measures for data deletion

2. **Article 25 Violation**:
   - No appropriate technical/organizational measures were implemented to ensure data protection by design
   - This was particularly problematic as the processing involved personal data in a publicly accessible database

3. **Procedural Violations**:
   - The entity failed to cooperate with the authority's investigation
   - No financial information was provided despite requests

### Sentencing Considerations:
- The fine was set at €11,000 (the lower end of possible penalties up to €20 million)
- Aggravating factors included:
  - Ignoring legally binding decisions
  - Lack of cooperation with authorities
- Mitigating factor: No prior GDPR violations by this entity

### Significance:
This case demonstrates the importance of:
1. Promptly responding to data subject rights requests (especially deletion under Article 17)
2. Implementing technical measures for data protection by design (Article 25)
3. Cooperating with supervisory authorities during investigations
4. The potential for significant fines even for medium-seriousness violations

The decision also highlights the European Court of Justice's recent clarification that legal persons can be directly fined under GDPR without needing to identify specific individuals responsible within the organization.
