# Summary of the ICO Decision Against AMEX

## Key Points
- **Date**: 17 May 2021
- **Jurisdiction**: United Kingdom (ICO)
- **Regulations**: PECR (Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations), specifically Regulation 22 regarding unsolicited marketing emails.
- **Fines**: £90,000 (with a potential reduction to £72,000 if paid early).

## Background
AMEX sent approximately 4 million direct marketing emails over a year to customers who had opted out of receiving such communications. These emails were internally classified as "servicing" but contained clear marketing content encouraging purchases.

## Legal Analysis
1. **Definition of Direct Marketing**: The ICO determined that the emails fell under the definition of direct marketing because they encouraged purchases and promoted AMEX's services.
2. **Consent Requirement**: Under PECR, organizations must obtain explicit consent before sending marketing emails. AMEX did not have valid consent as:
   - Consent was not freely given (it was tied to receiving services).
   - Customers could not easily withdraw consent.
   - The consent mechanism was not clear or prominent.

3. **Contravention**: AMEX violated Regulation 22 of PECR by sending unsolicited marketing emails without proper consent.

## Mitigation and Penalty
- **Mitigating Factors**: AMEX initiated an internal review after the ICO's investigation began and stopped sending marketing emails to opted-out customers.
- **Aggravating Factors**:
  - The breach was negligent (AMEX knew or should have known about the risk).
  - The emails were sent for financial gain.
  - AMEX ignored guidance and complaints from customers.

The ICO determined that a £90,000 penalty was appropriate to encourage compliance with PECR and deter similar behavior by other organizations. The penalty could be reduced to £72,000 if paid early.

## Conclusion
This case highlights the importance of obtaining explicit consent for marketing communications and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations like PECR. Organizations must regularly review their practices to avoid sending unsolicited marketing materials to customers who have opted out.
