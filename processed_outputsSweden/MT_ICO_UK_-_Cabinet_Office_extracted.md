# Summary of the ICO Decision on the Cabinet Office

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued a monetary penalty notice against the UK Cabinet Office for breaches of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Here are the key points:

## Key Facts
- **Date of Decision**: 15 November 2021
- **Penalty Amount**: £500,000
- **GDPR Articles Violated**:
  - Article 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality of personal data)
  - Article 32(1) (security of processing)

## Background
The Cabinet Office published an honours list containing postal addresses of recipients. This information was not supposed to be made public, and some addresses were not previously available in the public domain.

## Findings
1. **Data Breach**: The Cabinet Office inadvertently published postal addresses of 207 individuals who were not already in the public domain.
2. **Root Cause**: A build error in a newly introduced IT system that incorrectly included postal address data in the generated reports.
3. **Mitigation Efforts**: The Cabinet Office took several steps to mitigate the damage, including:
   - Removing access to the data
   - Contacting affected individuals
   - Working with police to assess risks
   - Implementing additional security measures

## ICO's Assessment
1. **Seriousness of Breach**:
   - The data was published in a high-profile context involving vulnerable and high-profile individuals.
   - There were 3 complaints from affected individuals raising personal safety concerns.

2. **Responsibility**:
   - The Cabinet Office, as a well-resourced government department, should have implemented stronger security measures.
   - Previous training and procedures were inadequate to prevent this breach.

3. **Mitigating Factors**:
   - The Cabinet Office was cooperative with the ICO's investigation
   - They took prompt action to mitigate the damage after discovery

## Penalty Justification
The ICO determined that a £500,000 penalty is:
- Effective (sufficiently large for a well-resourced organization)
- Proportionate (considering the nature and extent of the breach)
- Deterrent (will discourage similar future breaches)

## Appeal Process
The Cabinet Office has 28 days to appeal this decision to the First-tier Tribunal (Information Rights).

This case highlights the importance of thorough testing and validation processes when implementing new IT systems that handle sensitive personal data, especially in high-profile contexts.
