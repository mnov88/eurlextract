Answer:

**System**

- **Input**: The decision text from the DSB (Austria) - 2021-0.816.492 case.
- **Task**: Extract relevant information to answer specific questions about the case.

**Reasoning**:
1. Identify key elements such as the parties involved, the legal basis, and the outcome of the case.
2. Focus on the facts and legal reasoning provided in the decision text.
3. Ensure that the extracted information is accurate and relevant to the context of the case.

**Output**:

- **Parties Involved**:
  - The complainant (an authority) and the co-participating party (a data subject).
- **Legal Basis**:
  - Chapter 3 of the Data Protection Act (DSG), which implements Directive (EU) 2016/680.
  - Sections 42(4) and 44(7) of the DSG, as well as Article 12(1) of the Data Protection Directive for the area of justice and home affairs.
- **Key Facts**:
  - The co-participating party submitted a request for information electronically by email on October 10, 2020.
  - The complainant processed the request but did not send the information electronically as requested.
  - The complainant made two attempts to deliver the information physically (via RSa letter) but was unsuccessful due to the co-participating party's absence.
- **Legal Reasoning**:
  - The complainant argued that delivering the information by email would violate the requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act (AVG) and the Delivery Act (ZustG).
  - However, the Data Protection Authority (DSB) ruled that neither Union law nor comparable domestic law requires that information containing 'criminal data' or special categories of personal data be delivered personally.
  - The DSB emphasized that the complainant had already confirmed the identity of the co-participating party through previous delivery attempts and thus could have sent the information by email without violating any legal requirements.
- **Outcome**:
  - The DSB concluded that the complainant violated the co-participating party's right to information by not sending it electronically as requested.

**Final Answer**:

The decision text from the DSB (Austria) - 2021-0.816.492 case involves a complainant (an authority) and a co-participating party (a data subject). The legal basis includes Chapter 3 of the Data Protection Act (DSG), which implements Directive (EU) 2016/680, and specific sections and articles related to data protection and administrative procedures. Key facts include the submission of an electronic request for information by the co-participating party on October 10, 2020, and the complainant's failure to send the requested information electronically despite two unsuccessful physical delivery attempts. The legal reasoning centers around the complainant's argument about the necessity of personal delivery versus the DSB's emphasis on the legality of electronic transmission under specific conditions. The outcome is that the complainant violated the co-participating party's right to information by not adhering to the requested electronic delivery method.

\boxed{\text{The complainant violated the co-participating party's right to information by not sending it electronically as requested.}}
