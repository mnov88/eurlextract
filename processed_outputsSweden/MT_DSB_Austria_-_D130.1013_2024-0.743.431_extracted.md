Answer:

1. **PRIOR INFRACTIONS**: The decision does not mention any prior infractions by Google LLC (BG) or Google Ireland Limited (GIL).

2. **LEGAL BASIS**: The legal basis for the decision is primarily Article 4(7), Article 26, and Article 58 of the GDPR, as well as Sections 21 and 24 of the Austrian Data Protection Act (DSG). The decision also references Recital 78 of the GDPR.

3. **FACTS OF THE CASE**:
   - A complainant (BF) submitted a request for information to BG using an online form.
   - BG referred BF to GIL as the controller for the relevant data processing activities, but did not provide specific information about BF's personal data.
   - The complainant filed a complaint with the Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB), alleging that BG had not fully complied with the request.

4. **DECISION**:
   - The DSB determined that both BG and GIL are joint controllers for the relevant data processing activities under Article 26 of the GDPR.
   - The DSB found that BG had violated its obligation to provide information under Article 15 of the GDPR by not providing specific information about BF's personal data and instead referring BF to general information in its privacy policy.
   - The DSB ordered BG to provide BF with a copy of his personal data within two weeks.

5. **REASONING**:
   - The DSB reasoned that BG, as the parent company of GIL, has significant influence over the purposes and means of data processing, even though GIL has decision-making authority for introducing new products in the EEA.
   - The DSB also reasoned that referring BF to general information in its privacy policy was insufficient under Article 15 of the GDPR, which requires controllers to provide specific information about a data subject's personal data.

6. **REMEDIES**:
   - BG is ordered to provide BF with a copy of his personal data within two weeks.
   - The complainant has the right to lodge a complaint against this decision with the Federal Administrative Court within four weeks of delivery, and must pay a fee of 30 euros for the complaint.

7. **SANCTIONS**: The decision does not impose any sanctions on BG or GIL.

8. **FURTHER PROCEDURE**:
   - The complainant has the right to lodge a complaint against this decision with the Federal Administrative Court within four weeks of delivery.
   - The DSB has the option of amending its decision within two months either by making a preliminary decision on the complaint or by submitting the complaint with the files of the proceedings to the Federal Administrative Court.

9. **LEGAL REMEDIES**:
   - A written complaint can be lodged against this decision to the Federal Administrative Court within four weeks of delivery.
   - The complainant must provide the name of the contested decision (reference number, subject), the name of the authority concerned, the reasons on which the claim of illegality is based, the request, and the information required to assess whether the complaint was lodged in time.

10. **FEE**:
    - A fee of 30 euros must be paid for a complaint against this decision.
    - The fee must be paid into the Austrian tax office account, stating the intended purpose "EEE complaint fee", the date of the notice as the period, and the amount.
    - Proof of payment of the fee must be provided when submitting a complaint to the DSB.

11. **SUSPENSIVE EFFECT**:
    - A timely and admissible complaint to the Federal Administrative Court has a suspensive effect.
    - The suspensive effect may have been excluded in the ruling of the decision or excluded by a separate decision.
