Based on the detailed analysis of the decision, here are the key points and conclusions:

### Key Points:
1. **Jurisdiction and Responsibility**:
   - The data protection authority (DSB) is responsible for subsequent data processing after cookies have been set or read under the ePrivacy Directive.
   - The legality of cookie consent must comply with both the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive.

2. **Consent Validity**:
   - The initial cookie banner did not provide an immediate option to reject consent, which violates the principle of fair processing (Art. 5(1)(a) GDPR).
   - The burden of proof for valid consent lies with the controller (BG).

3. **Notification Obligation (Art. 19 GDPR)**:
   - The BG deleted the complainant's data but failed to notify recipients of the deletion, violating Art. 19 GDPR.
   - No valid exception (e.g., disproportionate effort) was presented by the BG.

4. **Right to Erasure (Art. 17 GDPR)**:
   - The complainant’s data is no longer stored, so no current violation of Art. 17 GDPR exists.
   - However, the initial processing was unlawful due to invalid consent.

5. **Performance Orders**:
   - The BG must modify its cookie banner to ensure:
     a) A "Reject" option is as easily accessible as "Accept" at the first level (Art. 4(11), Art. 7 GDPR).
     b) Clear instructions on how to revoke consent are provided in the banner.
     c) Prior consent is obtained for non-essential cookies (e.g., analytics cookies like J\*\*\*Data Analytics).

### Conclusions:
- The BG’s initial cookie banner design was non-compliant with GDPR requirements due to the lack of a clear rejection option and revocation mechanism.
- The failure to notify recipients after deletion violated Art. 19 GDPR, necessitating corrective action.
- The authority issued performance orders to ensure future compliance with data protection principles.

### Recommendations for Compliance:
1. **Cookie Banner Design**:
   - Provide "Accept" and "Reject" buttons at the first level with equal prominence.
   - Include a clear explanation of how consent can be revoked within the banner itself.

2. **Consent Management**:
   - Obtain explicit, granular consent for non-essential cookies (e.g., analytics).
   - Ensure the consent mechanism is user-friendly and does not favor acceptance over rejection.

3. **Data Subject Rights**:
   - Implement processes to notify third-party recipients of deletions or corrections in a timely manner.
   - Maintain records of consent and data processing activities to demonstrate compliance.

This decision underscores the importance of transparency, fairness, and accountability in data processing practices under the GDPR and ePrivacy Directive.
