# Summary of the Decision

The Swedish Data Protection Authority (IMY) has issued a decision against Tele2 Sverige AB for violating Article 44 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The violation pertains to the transfer of personal data to the United States via Google Analytics without ensuring an adequate level of protection.

## Key Points:

1. **Violation of GDPR**: Tele2 transferred personal data to the US using Google Analytics, which does not guarantee the same level of data protection as required by EU law.

2. **Inadequate Protections**: The additional measures taken by Tele2 and Google (such as IP address truncation) were deemed insufficient to prevent access by US intelligence agencies or render such access ineffective.

3. **Penalty Fee**: IMY imposed an administrative penalty fee of SEK 12,000,000 on Tele2 for the violation. This amount was determined based on the seriousness of the breach, the duration of the violation, and Tele2's turnover.

4. **Appeal Process**: The decision can be appealed by submitting a written appeal to IMY within three weeks from receiving the decision. If the appeal is timely received, it will be forwarded to the Administrative Court in Stockholm for review.

## Conclusion

The decision highlights the importance of ensuring adequate data protection when transferring personal data outside the EU, especially to countries where local laws may not align with EU standards. Companies must conduct thorough assessments and implement effective measures to mitigate risks associated with such transfers.
