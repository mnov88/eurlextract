Based on the provided decision text, here's a summary of the key points:

### **Summary of Decision**

The Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB) imposed a fine of €5,900 on an organization for violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The violations involved:

1. **Late Reporting of a Security Breach** under **Article 33(1) GDPR**:
   - The organization failed to notify the supervisory authority within the required 72-hour timeframe after discovering a security breach.
   - The DSB considered this negligence, as the organization was aware of its obligations but did not comply.

2. **Incomplete Information in the Security Breach Report** under **Article 33(3) GDPR**:
   - The report lacked mandatory details (e.g., nature and consequences of the breach).
   - The DSB found this to be intentional, as repeated requests for additional information were ignored.

3. **Lack of Cooperation with the Supervisory Authority** under **Article 31 GDPR**:
   - Despite multiple reminders, the organization refused to provide necessary details.
   - This was deemed a serious breach of trust and cooperation obligations.

### **Key Legal Points**

- **Absorption Principle (Art. 83(3) GDPR)**:
  The DSB applied this principle since all violations were related to the same processing operation (the security breach). Thus, only one penalty framework (€10M or 2% of global turnover) was considered.

- **Fault & Intent**:
  - Late reporting and incomplete information were deemed negligent.
  - Lack of cooperation was seen as intentional, as the organization ignored repeated requests.

- **Penalty Calculation**:
  The fine was set at €5,900 (0.03% of the maximum penalty range), justified by:
  - No prior GDPR violations by the organization.
  - Need for deterrence and compliance awareness.

### **Implications**
This case highlights the importance of:
- Timely breach reporting under **Art. 33(1) GDPR**.
- Providing complete information in breach notifications (**Art. 33(3) GDPR**).
- Cooperating fully with supervisory authorities (**Art. 31 GDPR**).

The DSB’s decision underscores that even minor negligence or non-cooperation can lead to significant penalties under the GDPR.
