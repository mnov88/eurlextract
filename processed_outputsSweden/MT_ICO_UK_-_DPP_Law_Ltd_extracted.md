# Key Takeaways from the ICO Penalty Notice against DPP Law Ltd

## Summary of the Case
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) issued a penalty notice against DPP Law Ltd for breaches of UK GDPR, specifically:
- Failing to implement appropriate security measures (Article 5(1)(f))
- Failing to ensure technical and organisational measures were in place (Article 32(1))
- Failing to notify the ICO within 72 hours of a data breach (Article 33(1))

## Key Findings

2. **GDPR Violations**:
   - The firm failed to implement adequate security measures
   - They didn't notify the ICO within the required 72-hour window after discovering the breach

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - Starting point: £17.5 million (maximum for Article 5(1)(f) breaches)
   - Adjusted to 17% of maximum penalty based on seriousness
   - Further adjusted by 0.8% for DPP's turnover (£3,486,494)
   - Initial calculation: £23,800
   - Increased to £60,000 after considering effectiveness and deterrence

## Important Lessons for Law Firms

4. **Financial Impact**:
   - Even for medium-sized firms, penalties can be substantial (£60,000 in this case)
   - The penalty represents 1.7% of DPP's annual turnover

## Recommendations
1. Law firms should:
   - Conduct regular security audits
