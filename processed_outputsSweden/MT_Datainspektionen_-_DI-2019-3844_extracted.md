### Summary of the Decision

The Swedish Data Inspectorate (Datainspektionen) issued a decision against Aleris Sjukvård AB for violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The key points are:

1. **Violation of GDPR and National Laws**:
   - Aleris failed to implement appropriate security measures to protect personal data in their medical record system, TakeCare.
   - They did not conduct a proper needs and risk analysis before allocating user permissions, which is required by the Patient Data Act and the National Board of Health and Welfare's regulations.

2. **Inadequate Access Restrictions**:
   - All professional profiles except technicians had unrestricted read access to patient data in TakeCare.
   - The access restrictions were based on rough occupational categories rather than specific tasks or organizational needs, violating the principle that access should be limited to what is necessary for each user's role.

3. **Coherent Record Keeping Issues**:
   - Aleris did not restrict access to patient data from other caregivers within the unified record-keeping system, prioritizing patient safety over privacy protection.

4. **Penalty Fee**:
   - The Data Inspectorate imposed an administrative penalty fee of SEK 15,000,000 (approximately €1.4 million) on Aleris Sjukvård AB for the violations.
   - This decision was based on the seriousness and interconnected nature of the infringements, as well as the company's significant turnover.

### Key Takeaways

- **Needs and Risk Analysis**: Organizations must conduct a thorough needs and risk analysis before allocating user permissions to ensure access is limited to what is necessary for each role.
- **Access Restrictions**: Access to personal data should be granular and based on specific tasks, not just broad occupational categories.
- **Compliance with GDPR**: Failure to comply with GDPR's security measures can result in significant penalties, especially when dealing with large volumes of sensitive data.

This decision highlights the importance of implementing robust data protection measures and conducting regular assessments to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.
