Based on the provided document, here's a summary of the key points regarding the ICO's monetary penalty on Ticketmaster UK Limited:

### Key Points:
1. **Incident Overview**:
   - A malicious code was injected into an Inbenta-hosted chat bot on Ticketmaster's payment page in February 2018.
   - The code extracted copies of any data submitted on the payment page, including payment card details.

2. **Timeline and Notifications**:
   - Multiple notifications were received from banks (Monzo, Commonwealth Bank of Australia) and security researchers about fraudulent activities linked to Ticketmaster as early as April 2018.
   - Despite these warnings, Ticketmaster did not take immediate action to remove the chat bot or investigate thoroughly.

3. **ICO Investigation**:
   - The ICO initiated an investigation after Ticketmaster reported a personal data breach on June 23, 2018.
   - The ICO found that Ticketmaster failed to comply with GDPR requirements, specifically:
     - **Article 5(1)(f)**: Inadequate security measures (negligence in protecting personal data).
     - **Article 32(1)(d)**: Failure to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

4. **Penalty Details**:
   - The ICO proposed an initial penalty of £1,500,000.
   - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic's financial impact on Ticketmaster, the penalty was reduced to £1,250,000 as a proportionate measure.

5. **Mitigating and Aggravating Factors**:
   - **Mitigating**: Ticketmaster cooperated with the ICO, removed the chat bot promptly after detection, and offered credit monitoring to affected customers.
   - **Aggravating**: The breach was severe due to the sensitivity of the data (payment card details) and the prolonged period during which the vulnerability existed without proper action.

6. **Enforcement**:
   - The penalty must be paid by December 15, 2020.
   - Ticketmaster has the right to appeal against this decision within 28 days.

### Conclusion:
The ICO's decision highlights the importance of robust security measures and prompt response to potential data breaches. The penalty reflects both the severity of the breach and the financial context of the pandemic, balancing regulatory compliance with practical considerations.
