The decision from the Swedish Data Protection Authority (IMY) concerns Verifiera AB's processing of sensitive personal data, specifically health-related information from judicial decisions in psychiatric and substance abuse cases. The key points are:

### Key Points:
1. **Applicable Laws**:
   - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), particularly Articles 9, 85(1), 85(2), 6(1)(f), and 4(7).
   - Swedish Media Freedom Act (Tryckfrihetsf√∂rordningen) and the Freedom of Expression Act (Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen).

2. **Facts**:
   - Verifiera AB operates a service that provides access to judicial decisions, including those involving mental health and substance abuse cases.
   - The data processed includes sensitive personal data (health information), which is generally prohibited under Article 9 of the GDPR unless an exception applies.

3. **Legal Analysis**:
   - **Article 9(1) GDPR**: Prohibits processing of sensitive personal data, but exceptions exist under Article 9(2).
   - **Article 85 GDPR**: Balances data protection with freedom of expression and information.
   - **Swedish Media Freedom Act (Ch. 1 Section 7)**: Provides exemptions for journalistic purposes, but IMY found that Verifiera's processing did not qualify as journalistic activity.

4. **IMY's Findings**:
   - The processing was found to violate Article 9 GDPR because:
     - No valid consent was obtained.
     - No other exceptions under Article 9(2) were applicable.
   - The data collection was deemed to be far from the purposes protected by freedom of expression and information.

5. **Decision**:
   - IMY issued a reprimand (not a fine) due to special circumstances, including Verifiera's constitutional protection under Swedish media laws and lack of prior enforcement of Ch. 1 Section 20 YGL.
   - Ordered Verifiera to stop allowing searches by personal name, social security number, or address in the relevant services within eight weeks.

### Implications:
- The decision highlights the tension between data protection and freedom of expression, particularly when dealing with sensitive data.
- It clarifies that even constitutionally protected activities (like journalism) must comply with GDPR when processing sensitive data unless specific exceptions apply.
- The reprimand instead of a fine reflects IMY's cautious approach due to the novel application of Ch. 1 Section 20 YGL.

This case is significant for organizations handling sensitive personal data, especially those operating in media or public interest contexts.
