Based on the provided decision text from the Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB), here's a summary of the key points:

### Key Facts:
- The accused installed and operated an image processing system (camera) in public toilet facilities to test its technical capabilities.
- The system was hidden (covered) and not marked, meaning those affected were unaware they were being recorded during intimate moments.
- The recordings captured personal data (images) of numerous individuals without their knowledge or consent.

### Legal Violations:
1. **Unlawful Processing** (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR):
   - The accused lacked a valid legal basis for processing the images, as "technical interest" does not qualify as a legitimate purpose under GDPR.
   - The processing violated principles of data minimization and purpose limitation.

2. **Lack of Transparency** (Article 5(1)(a) GDPR):
   - The accused failed to inform affected individuals about the processing or provide any markings at the scene, violating transparency obligations.

### Sentencing Considerations:
- **Aggravating Factors**:
  - Serious interference with fundamental rights (privacy and data protection).
  - Intentional and repeated violations over a two-month period.
  - Processing of intimate image data.
- **Mitigating Factors**:
  - No prior GDPR violations by the accused.
  - Cooperation during investigations and admission of guilt.

### Fine Imposed:
The DSB imposed a fine of **€25,000** on the accused. This amount was determined based on:
- The severity of the violation (high due to the intimate nature of the data).
- The accused’s income (monthly net income of €3,979) and financial circumstances.
- General preventive goals to deter similar conduct.

### Key Takeaways for Compliance:
1. **Legal Basis**: Ensure any image processing has a valid legal basis under Article 6 GDPR (e.g., consent or legitimate interest).
2. **Transparency**: Always inform individuals about data processing, especially in sensitive contexts like toilets.
3. **Technical Measures**: Avoid hidden surveillance; ensure compliance with marking requirements for video systems.

This case highlights the importance of GDPR compliance in even seemingly minor technical tests, where privacy violations can lead to significant fines.
