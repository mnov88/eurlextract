The decision from Datainspektionen (Sweden) outlines several key points regarding Google's handling of personal data and compliance with the GDPR. Here are the main takeaways:

### Key Points:
1. **Infringements Identified**:
   - Google was found to have violated Articles 5(1)(b), 6, 9, 10, and 17 of the GDPR.
   - Specific issues included failing to comply with previous orders to cease processing certain data and misleading individuals about the transmission of their personal data.

2. **Penalties Imposed**:
   - Google was ordered to pay an administrative penalty fee of 75 million SEK (approximately â‚¬6.8 million) for the infringements.
   - The penalties were based on Google's global annual sales, with a focus on ensuring the penalties are effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

3. **Corrective Measures**:
   - Google was instructed to stop informing webmasters about URLs when removal requests are granted unless explicitly requested by the individual.
   - Google was also ordered to cease displaying misleading information in their web form for removal requests.

4. **Context and Justification**:
   - The decision emphasized that the infringements were not minor and involved sensitive data, which warranted significant penalties.
   - The length of the infringements and Google's systematic procedures contributed to the severity of the penalties.

### Implications:
- This decision highlights the importance of compliance with GDPR requirements, especially regarding the handling of sensitive personal data and transparency with individuals about how their data is processed.
- It also underscores the regulatory authorities' willingness to impose substantial penalties for non-compliance, particularly when previous orders have been disregarded.
