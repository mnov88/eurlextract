Okay, let's start by going through the user's query and the provided decision text to extract the required information. The user wants exactly 22 lines of answers in English, each starting with "Answer n: " and containing only specific tokens or patterns.

First, I need to identify the country of the deciding DPA. The authority mentioned is Datatilsynet (Norway), so Answer 1 should be NO.

Next, the decision date is given as 05.05.2021, which in YYYY-MM-DD format is 2021-05-05. So Answer 2 is that date.

For Answer 3, the number of defendants explicitly named: The parties are NIF and their full name, but they're listed as one entity, so it's 1.

Answer 4 asks for the top-level category of the primary defendant. Since NIF is a sports organization, which is a business, Answer 4 is BUSINESS.

Answer 6 relates to the core activity sector. The case involves data processing for member administration in sports, which doesn't fit into the predefined sectors exactly, so it's OTHER.

Answer 7 checks if NIF is an SME. There's no mention of SME status, so UNKNOWN.

Answer 8: The role of the primary defendant is a controller since they process personal data, so CONTROLLER.

Answer 9: It's not a cross-border case as per the information given, so NO.

Moving to measures and penalty:

Answer 10: The decision mentions evaluating Article 83(2) factors, so YES.

Answer 11: A fine was issued (NOK 1,250,000), so YES.

Answer 12: Convert NOK to EUR. The text says about â‚¬123,656, but the exact amount is NOK 1,250,000. Since the user wants the currency in ISO code and integer, it's 1250000 NOK.

Answer 13: Other measures used besides a fine? The text mentions no other Article 58(2) measures explicitly, so NONE.

Answer 14: Not found not in breach; they were found in breach, so NO.

Legal basis and infringements:

Answer 15: Breached articles are A5, A6, A32. So A5;A6;A32.

Answer 16: No mention of ePrivacy rules, so NO.

Processing context:

Answer 17: The data includes children's info (Art9) and no Art10, so ART9.

Answer 18: Data subject groups are members, volunteers, others connected to sports. The predefined options don't include "others", but the closest is CONSUMERS_CUSTOMERS or USERS_ONLINE. However, the text mentions members, volunteers, etc., which might be better as OTHER. But looking at the allowed tokens, maybe CONSUMERS_CUSTOMERS and USERS_ONLINE? Wait, the exact groups are members, volunteers, others with connections to Norwegian sports. The options include CONSUMERS_CUSTOMERS (which could fit members), but "others" isn't listed. Since the answer must be from the given list, perhaps OTHER is acceptable if not matching.

Answer 19: Number of data subjects affected is 3.2 million, so 3200000.

Answer 20: Processing context includes testing a service (Elasticsearch) for member administration, which might relate to PRODUCT_ANALYTICS or DATA_BROKERAGE? The text mentions testing a cloud solution for member administration, but the exact context isn't in the predefined list. However, there's mention of data breach via Elasticsearch, which is part of cloud services. Maybe TRANSFERS_THIRD_COUNTRY isn't right. Alternatively, since it's about processing personal data for testing, perhaps PRODUCT_ANALYTICS? But I'm not sure. The allowed options include DATA_BROKERAGE, but that might not fit. If unsure, maybe OTHER.

Procedure and history:

Answer 21: Trigger was a breach notification from NCSC, so BREACH_NOTIFICATION.

Answer 22: No prior infringements mentioned, so DISCUSSED_NO_PRIOR.
