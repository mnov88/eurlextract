Decision on reservation right on Legelisten.no

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has decided that health personnel should be able to reserve themselves from being assessed on Legelisten.no. Legelisten.no will appeal this decision, and any right of reservation will not apply until the Privacy Board has completed the case.

At Legelisten.no you can enter anonymous assessments of GPs or health personnel in the specialist health service. On the basis of the assessments, health personnel are ranked in relation to each other. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has received many inquiries from health personnel who feel that the site does not balance the consideration for freedom of expression and the consideration for privacy in a good enough way. After assessing the case, the Data Inspectorate has come to the conclusion that health personnel must be given the right to make reservations in order to better protect the individual's privacy.

The medical list will appeal this decision point. Therefore, the right of reservation will not take effect until our appeal body, the Privacy Board, has completed the case and provided that the board reaches the same result.

Legelisten.no can be misused

Healthcare professionals often have to make unpopular decisions, such as not prescribing painkillers or antibiotics, not giving sick leave or not referring to unnecessary tests. If health personnel make health-related correct but unpopular decisions, they may experience being punished for this by someone leaving negative assessments on Legelisten.no. Many of the doctors who have contacted the Norwegian Data Protection Authority find this very uncomfortable and challenge their professional integrity.

Those who use Legelisten.no can also not be sure whether the person writing the assessment has actually been a patient with the doctor. Positive reviews can be written by close relatives, while negative reviews can be written by someone who wants to blacken the health personnel. It is therefore difficult to know which of the assessments one can trust, and the value of the assessments is limited.

Anyone who applies for the doctor's name will get the assessments that have been posted about them. This can affect personal relationships. One doctor said that she wanted to quit as a GP because she found it stressful to think that anyone in her circle of friends could see all the assessments. Other doctors have pointed out that the assessments primarily affect their children and that children can experience bullying if the parents have received negative assessments.

Doctors have the opportunity to respond to assessments on the website, but since the assessments are anonymous, it is difficult for the doctor to know which situation a negative assessment originates from. Even if the doctors understand which patient has written the assessment, the duty of confidentiality prevents them from giving an exhaustive answer.

Decision on reservation access

Privacy and freedom of expression are two equal human rights, and in this type of case where the two rights come into conflict with each other, the consideration of freedom of expression and the consideration of privacy must be balanced.

The Data Inspectorate believes that this balance is not good enough in this case and that Legelisten.no must introduce reservation access to improve the balance.

Rating pages are generally allowed

Strict requirements are set for doctors' independence and professional integrity. Healthcare professionals are a professional group that sometimes have to make unpopular decisions. Therefore, doctors are not very suitable for evaluation on rating sites. The fact that a doctor has bad assessments may in some cases be due to the person in question having done his job in a good way.

On the other hand, there are many professional groups whose task is to appease customers or clients. There is greater access to assessment and ranking of these occupational groups. As long as such rating sites have guidelines, moderation and similar measures that safeguard privacy to a sufficient degree, the main rule is that considerations of freedom of expression take precedence - and that the websites are legal without reservation access.

Legelisten.no is not allowed to process sensitive personal data

When you leave an assessment on Legelisten.no, you must provide an e-mail address. For many, the email address contains names. Therefore, email addresses are often considered personal information.

If you have been to a specific doctor, it can often say something about your own health situation. For example, if you have a cancer doctor, it often indicates that you have cancer. If you post an assessment of this doctor on the website, legelisten.no potentially sits on a register that can say something about the users' health problems.

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority therefore orders Legelisten.no to delete the e-mail addresses of users who have assessed health personnel in the specialist health service.

Legelisten.no has the right to appeal

The Data Inspectorate's decision is final, but has a three-week appeal period. This means that Legelisten.no can appeal the decision. In that case, the Privacy Board will take a final position on the case.
