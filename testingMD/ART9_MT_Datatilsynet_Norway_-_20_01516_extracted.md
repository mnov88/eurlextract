Okay, let's start by going through the user's query and the provided decision text to extract the required information. The user wants exactly 22 lines of answers in English, each starting with "Answer n: " and containing only specific tokens or patterns.

First, I need to identify the country of the deciding DPA. The authority mentioned is Datatilsynet (Norway), so Answer 1 should be NO.

Next, the decision date is given as 15.03.2021, which in YYYY-MM-DD format is 2021-03-15. So Answer 2 is that date.

For Question 3, how many defendants are explicitly named? The parties section lists "Asker municipality" as the only defendant, so Answer 3 is 1.

Answer 4 asks for the top-level category of the primary defendant. Since Asker is a municipality, it's a PUBLIC_AUTHORITY. 

Question 5 is only applicable if Answer 4 is PUBLIC_AUTHORITY. The type here would be LOCAL_GOVERNMENT because municipalities are local governments.

For Question 6, since the defendant is a public authority, this question isn't applicable, so N_A.

Answer 7 asks if the defendant is an SME. Since it's a municipality, which is likely not an SME, but the text doesn't mention SME status explicitly, so UNKNOWN or N_A? Wait, the user instructions say to use only explicit info. The decision doesn't mention SME, so Answer 7 should be N_A.

Answer 8: The role of the primary defendant. The municipality acted as a controller, so CONTROLLER.

Question 9: Is it a cross-border case? The text mentions Norway and no other countries involved, so NO.

Moving to Measures & Penalty:

Answer 10: Did they evaluate Article 83(2) factors? The decision discusses various factors like nature of the breach, duration, etc., which are part of Article 83. So YES.

Answer 11: Was a fine issued? Yes, 1,000,000 NOK is mentioned, so YES.

Answer 12: Total fine amount is 1000000 NOK.

Answer 13: Other measures besides the fine. The decision mentions ordering compliance (ORDER_COMPLIANCE) and possibly reprimand or warning? Wait, looking back, the text says "imposed a violation fee" but doesn't mention other Article 58(2) measures like reprimand or warning. So NONE.

Answer 14: Was the defendant found not in breach? No, they were found in breach, so NO.

Legal Basis/Infringements:

Answer 15: Breached articles are 5,6,24,32(1)(b). The text mentions Articles 5, 6, and 32(1)(b) GDPR. So A5;A6;A24;A32.

Answer 16: Did they rely on ePrivacy rules? No mention of ePrivacy, so NO.

Processing Context:

Answer 17: Special categories or criminal data? The text mentions special categories (Article 9/10) but not Art.10 specifically. Wait, the breach included decisions on PPT, which might be sensitive, but the answer options are ART9, ART10, BOTH, NO, UNKNOWN. Since it's mentioned under Article 9 and 10, maybe ART9? The text says "special categories of information provided for in Articles 9 and 10", so Answer 17 is BOTH.

Answer 18: Data subject groups. The text mentions children, employees, and others. So CHILDREN;EMPLOYEES;OTHER.

Answer 19: Number of data subjects affected. It says "at least 120 persons" but also 170 documents. However, the exact number isn't clear. Since it's at least 120, maybe UNKNOWN? But the instruction says if no explicit integer, answer UNKNOWN. The text doesn't state an exact number, so Answer 19 is UNKNOWN.

Answer 20: Processing contexts mentioned. The breach was in mailing lists, which could be under EMPLOYMENT_HR or MARKETING_ONLINE_TRACKING. Also, the documents involved decisions on PPT and housing subsidies, which might relate to employment. But looking at the options, maybe EMPLOYMENT_HR;MARKETING_ONLINE_TRACKING? Or other contexts? The text mentions "mailing lists" which could be part of employment records or public information. Alternatively, since it's a municipality's website, perhaps PUBLIC_INFORMATION? But that's not an option. The available options include EMPLOYMENT_HR and others. Given the context, I'll go with EMPLOYMENT_HR;MARKETING_ONLINE_TRACKING.

Procedure & History:

Answer 21: Trigger of the case was a breach notification (from a private individual), so BREACH_NOTIFICATION.

Answer 22: Did the decision reference previous infringements? The text says "no previously relevant infringements can be identified," so DISCUSSED_NO_PRIOR.
