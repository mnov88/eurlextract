Okay, let's start by going through the user's query and the provided decision text to extract the required information. The user wants exactly 22 lines of answers in English, each starting with "Answer n: " and containing only specific tokens or patterns.

First, I need to identify the country of the deciding DPA. The authority mentioned is Datatilsynet (Norway), so Answer 1 should be NO (since Norway's ISO code is NO).

Next, the decision date is given as 08.11.2017, which in YYYY-MM-DD format is 2017-11-08. So Answer 2 is that date.

For Question 3, how many defendants are explicitly named? The parties section lists "Legelisten.no AS" as the only defendant, so Answer 3 is 1.

Answer 4 asks for the top-level category of the primary defendant. Legelisten is a company, so it's BUSINESS.

Question 5 isn't applicable here since the defendant is a business, not a public authority.

For Question 6, the core activity sector: The website allows anonymous reviews of healthcare personnel, which might relate to ONLINE_MEDIA_ADTECH or another category. However, looking at the lexicon hints, "review website" could be considered ONLINE_MEDIA_ADTECH. But I need to check if there's a more precise fit. Since it's a platform for user reviews, maybe ONLINE_MEDIA_ADTECH is appropriate.

Question 7 asks if the defendant is an SME. The text doesn't mention anything about being an SME, so Answer 7 is UNKNOWN.

Answer 8: The role of the primary defendant. Legelisten is the controller because they determine how data is processed, as per the decision. So Answer 8 is CONTROLLER.

Question 9: Cross-border One-Stop-Shop? The case seems to be within Norway, so Answer 9 is NO.

Moving to Measures & Penalty:

Answer 10: Did the authority evaluate Article 83(2) factors? The text doesn't mention systematic evaluation of these factors, so Answer 10 is UNKNOWN.

Answer 11: Was an administrative fine issued? The summary says "Fine: None", so Answer 11 is NO.

Since no fine was issued, Answers 12 and others related to fines are N_A or NONE as per the rules.

Answer 13: Other Article 58(2) measures. The decision mentions requiring erasure policies, allowing opt-out, deleting data, etc. These could be ORDER_COMPLIANCE (like ensuring data deletion), ORDER_DSR (data subject rights). But looking at the lexicon, "erasure policy" might map to ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT. Also, allowing opt-out could be considered as ORDER_COMPLIANCE. However, the exact terms used in the decision need to match the tokens. The text says they must delete data and ensure correct information, which might fall under ORDER_COMPLIANCE or ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT.

Answer 14: Was the defendant found not in breach? No, the outcome was "Violation Found", so Answer 14 is NO.

Legal Basis/Infringements:

Answer 15: Breached articles. The decision references GDPR Articles like Article 6(1)(f), Article 9(2)(a), etc. But the question asks which were explicitly found breached. The text states that processing lacked legal basis, so maybe Articles 6 and 9 are involved. However, the exact articles cited in the breach need to be checked. The decision mentions that Legelisten didn't have a legal basis for processing special category data under Article 9(2)(a), which was based on consent (Article 6(1)(a)), but they couldn't rely on that. So perhaps Articles 6 and 9 are the ones breached.

Answer 16: ePrivacy rules? The text doesn't mention ePrivacy, so Answer 16 is NO.

Processing Context:

Answer 17: Special category data (Article 9) and criminal-offence data (Article 10). The decision mentions special category data related to users' visits to specialists, so Answer 17 is ART9.

Answer 18: Data subject groups. Healthcare personnel are mentioned, as well as users who reviewed them. So PATIENTS and HEALTHCARE_PATIENT might be relevant, but the lexicon options include PATIENTS and others. The text mentions healthcare personnel (maybe EMPLOYEES?), but the exact terms in the decision need to match. The primary groups here are healthcare professionals (EMPLOYEES?) and users (USERS_ONLINE). However, looking at the lexicon, "healthcare personnel" might be considered as EMPLOYEES or HEALTHCARE_PATIENT. But the options include PATIENTS, which might not fit. Alternatively, maybe CONSUMERS_CUSTOMERS if they are users of the service. The text says "users who have assessed health personnel", so perhaps USERS_ONLINE is appropriate.

Answer 19: Number of data subjects affected. The decision doesn't specify a number, so Answer 19 is UNKNOWN.

Answer 20: Processing contexts. The site processes reviews, which might relate to MARKETING_ONLINE_TRACKING or other categories. However, the lexicon options include BIOMETRICS_ID, BREACH_SECURITY, etc. Since it's about user reviews and data processing for a website, maybe MARKETING_ONLINE_TRACKING isn't right. Alternatively, since they process personal data of healthcare personnel, perhaps HEALTHCARE_PATIENT is part of the context. But looking at the lexicon options, "processing context" might be better categorized under other contexts like ONLINE_MEDIA_ADTECH or similar. However, the exact terms in the decision need to match. The text mentions processing for reviews and special category data, which could relate to BIOMETRICS_ID if it's about personal identifiers, but that's not clear. Alternatively, since they process data for reviews, maybe MARKETING_ONLINE_TRACKING isn't accurate. This might be a tricky one; perhaps NONE or OTHER is the safest answer here.

Procedure & History:

Answer 21: Trigger of the case. The initial complaints were from healthcare personnel, so Answer 21 is COMPLAINT.

Answer 22: Previous infringements? The text mentions that the decision was appealed and overturned, but it doesn't explicitly state prior infringements by the same defendant. So Answer 22 is DISCUSSED_NO_PRIOR or UNKNOWN. However, since the case went through multiple appeals, maybe there were previous issues discussed, but the exact answer depends on whether "previous infringements" are mentioned. The text says the decision was overturned and taken to courts, but not that prior infringements were referenced. So Answer 22 is DISCUSSED_NO_PRIOR.

Now, compiling all these into the required format with exactly 22 lines.
