Okay, let's start by looking at the decision text provided. The user wants me to extract facts from the EU data protection authority (DPA) decision and output exactly 15 lines in English following specific rules.

First, I need to determine the top-level category of the defendant. The defendant here is "Legelisten.no AS," which is a company running a website for reviews. Since it's a business entity, Answer 1 should be BUSINESS.

Next, since the answer for Q1 is BUSINESS, we move to Q3 about core activity sector. The site allows users to post anonymous reviews of healthcare personnel, so this seems related to online media or adtech. However, looking at the sectors listed in the instructions, "ONLINE_MEDIA_ADTECH" might fit here because it's a platform where users can leave reviews, which could be considered part of online tracking or marketing. But I need to check if there's a better match. The site is more about user-generated content rather than advertising, so maybe "OTHER" under Q3? Wait, the instructions mention that for Q3, if it's BUSINESS or NON_PROFIT, choose from specific sectors. Since the core activity isn't explicitly listed in the given options like telecom, finance, etc., but the site is a review platform, perhaps "ONLINE_MEDIA_ADTECH" is the closest fit even though it's not exactly adtech. Alternatively, maybe "OTHER" if none of the provided categories match. However, the example given for ONLINE_MEDIA_ADTECH includes platforms and social networks, which might be applicable here as a review site.

For Q4 (SME status), there's no mention of whether Legelisten is an SME in the decision text, so Answer 4 should be UNKNOWN.

Q5 asks if the authority evaluated Article 83(2) factors. The decision mentions that the DPA found a lack of legal basis and ordered erasures, but there's no explicit evaluation of individual factors like severity or duration of the breach as per Article 83(2). Therefore, Answer 5 is NO.

Q6 checks if an administrative fine was issued. The original decision in 2017 didn't impose a fine ("Fine: None"), and even though there were appeals, the final ruling by the Supreme Court in 2021 confirmed that Legelisten had a legal basis under Article 6(1)(f). However, the initial DPA decision required erasures and other measures but no fine. So Answer 6 is NO.

Q7 would be N_A since there's no fine mentioned.

For Q8 (Article 58(2) powers), the DPA ordered Legelisten to allow opt-out, establish erasure policies, delete information, ensure data correctness, stop processing special category data, and provide information. These actions correspond to ORDER_COMPLIANCE, ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT, and ORDER_DSR (since they had to comply with specific access/erasure requests). The decision also mentions deleting data, which is part of ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT. So the codes would be ORDER_COMPLIANCE;ORDER_RECTIFY_ERASE_RESTRICT;ORDER_DSR.

Q9 asks about EDPB/WP253 reference. There's no mention of these guidelines in the decision text, so Answer 9 is NO.

Q10 (previous infringements) – the case was appealed and went through multiple courts, but the decision doesn't explicitly state previous infringements by Legelisten. It mentions complaints since 2012, but not prior infringements. So Answer 10 is NOT_DISCUSSED.

Q11 (not in breach): The final Supreme Court ruling said Legelisten had a legal basis under Article 6(1)(f), so the initial DPA decision was overturned. However, the original decision found a violation, but after appeal, it's not clear if they were exonerated on all grounds. Since the case was appealed and the outcome changed, Answer 11 is UNKNOWN.

Q12 (role of defendant): The DPA found Legelisten to be the controller for processing personal data, so Answer 12 is CONTROLLER.

Q13 (cross-border OSS) – the jurisdiction is Norway, and there's no mention of cross-border aspects or One-Stop-Shop. So Answer 13 is NO.

Q14 (special/criminal data): The decision mentions special category data (e.g., diagnosis under Article 9(2)(a)), so Answer 14 is ART9.

For Q15 (processing context), the site processes reviews of healthcare personnel, which relates to HEALTHCARE_PATIENT. Also, there's mention of personal data about healthcare personnel and users' visits to specialists, which might fall under EMPLOYMENT_HR if it's related to their professional status, but more accurately, HEALTHCARE_PATIENT is the main context here. Additionally, since they process reviews that could be considered as part of journalistic purposes (though the DPA found no exemption), but the explicit contexts mentioned are healthcare personnel data and special category data from users' visits. So the codes would be HEALTHCARE_PATIENT;EMPLOYMENT_HR (if applicable). Wait, looking back, the processing includes information about warnings and penalties from the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision, which might relate to employment or professional status. However, the primary context is healthcare personnel data. The special category data from users' visits to specialists could be under HEALTHCARE_PATIENT as well. So the main codes are HEALTHCARE_PATIENT and possibly KYC_AML if there's any mention of due diligence, but that's not here. Alternatively, since they process reviews about healthcare professionals, which is part of their professional activities, maybe EMPLOYMENT_HR? But the primary context seems to be healthcare-related data. So Answer 15 would be HEALTHCARE_PATIENT.
