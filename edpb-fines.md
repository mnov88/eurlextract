# (a) Nature, gravity and duration of the infringement

## (a1) Nature of the infringement

**[2.G]** a) The nature of the infringement, assessed by the concrete circumstances of the case. In that sense, this analysis is more specific than abstract classification of Article 83(4)–(6) GDPR. The supervisory authority may review the interest that the infringed provision seeks to protect and the place of this provision in the data protection framework. In addition, the supervisory authority may consider the degree to which the infringement prohibited the effective application of the provision and the fulfilment of the objective it sought to protect. >>  
**[2.A]** Recital 148 introduces the notion of “minor infringements”. Such infringements may constitute breaches of one or several of the Regulation’s provisions listed in article 83 (4) or (5). The assessment of the criteria in article 83 (2) may however lead the supervisory authority to believe that in the concrete circumstances of the case, the breach for example, does not pose a significant risk to the rights of the data subjects concerned and does not affect the essence of the obligation in question. In such cases, the fine may (but not always) be replaced by a reprimand. >>

## (a2) Gravity (integrative factors)

**[2.B]** The nature of the infringement, but also “the scope, purpose of the processing concerned as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them”, will be indicative of the gravity of the infringement. >>  
**[2.H]** b) The gravity of the infringement, assessed on the basis of the specific circumstances. As stated in Article 83(2)(a) GDPR, this concerns the nature of the processing, but also the “scope or purpose of the processing concerned as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them,” will be indicative of the gravity of the infringement. i. The nature of the processing, including the context in which the processing is functionally based (e.g. business activity, non-profit, political party, etc.) and all the characteristics of the processing.22 When the nature of processing entails higher risks, e.g. where the purpose is to monitor, evaluate personal aspects or to take decisions or measures with negative effects for the data subjects, depending on the context of the processing and the role of the controller or processor, the supervisory authority may consider to attribute more weight to this factor. Further, a supervisory authority may attribute more weight to this factor when there is a clear imbalance between the data subjects and the controller (e.g., when the data subjects are employees, pupils or patients) or the processing involves vulnerable data subjects, in particular, children. >>

## (a3) Purpose of the processing

**[2.D]** The purpose of the processing must also be assessed. The WP 29 opinion on “purpose limitation”11 previously analysed the two main building blocks of this principle in data protection law: purpose specification and compatible use. When assessing the purpose of the processing in the context of article 83 (2), the supervisory authorities should look into the extent to which the processing upholds the two key components of this principle12. In certain situations, the supervisory authority might find it necessary to factor in a deeper analysis of the purpose of the processing in itself in the analysis of article 83 (2). >>  
**[2.J]** The purpose of the processing, will lead the supervisory authority to attribute more weight to this factor. The supervisory authority may also consider whether the processing of personal data falls within the so-called core activities of the controller. The more central the processing is to the controller’s or processor’s core activities, the more severe irregularities in this processing will be. The supervisory authority may attribute more weight to this factor in these circumstances. There may be circumstances though, in which the processing of personal data is further removed from the core activities of the controller or processor, but significantly impacts the evaluation nonetheless (this is the case, for example, of processing concerning personal data of workers where the infringement significantly affects those workers’ dignity >>

## (a4) Scope of the processing

**[2.I]** ii. The scope of the processing, with reference to the local, national or cross-border scope of the processing carried out and the relationship between this information and the actual extent of the processing in terms of the allocation of resources by the data controller. This element highlights a real risk factor, linked to the greater difficulty for the data subject and the supervisory authority to curb unlawful conduct as the scope of the processing increases. The larger the scope of the processing, the more weight the supervisory authority may attribute to this factor. >>

## (a5) Number of data subjects

**[2.C]** The number of data subjects involved should be assessed, in order to identify whether this is an isolated event or symptomatic of a more systemic breach or lack of adequate routines in place. This is not to say that isolated events should not be enforceable, as an isolated event could still affect a lot of data subjects. This will, depending on the circumstances of the case, be relative to, for example, the total number of registrants in the database in question, the number of users of a service, the number of customers, or in relation to the population of the country, as appropriate. >>  
**[2.K]** iv. The number of data subjects concretely but also potentially affected. The higher the number of data subjects involved, the more weight the supervisory authority may attribute to this factor. In many cases, it may also be considered that the infringement takes on "systemic" connotations and can therefore affect, even at different times, additional data subjects who have not submitted complaints or reports to the supervisory authority. The supervisory authority may, depending on the circumstances of the case, consider the ratio between the number of data subjects affected and the total number of data subjects in that context (e.g. the number of citizens, customers or employees) in order to assess whether the infringement is of a systemic nature >>

## (a6) Level of damage

**[2.E]** If the data subjects have suffered damage, the level of the damage has to be taken into consideration. Processing of personal data may generate risks for the rights and freedoms of the individual, as illustrated by recital 75: >>  
**[13]** v. The level of damage suffered and the extent to which the conduct may affect individual rights and freedoms. The reference to the "level" of damage suffered, therefore, is intended to draw the attention of the supervisory authorities to the damage suffered, or likely to have been suffered as a further, separate parameter with respect to the number of data subjects involved (for example, in cases where the number of individuals affected by the unlawful processing is high but the damage suffered by them is marginal). Following Recital 75 GDPR, the level of damage suffered refers to physical, material or non-material damage. The assessment of the damage, in any case, be limited to what is functionally necessary to achieve correct evaluation of the level of seriousness of the infringement as indicated in paragraph 60 below, without overlapping with the activities of judicial authorities as tasked with ascertaining the different forms of individual harm >>

## (a7) Duration

**[2.F]** Duration of the infringement may be illustrative of, for example: a) wilful conduct on the data controller’s part, or b) failure to take appropriate preventive measures, or c) inability to put in place the required technical and organisational measures. >>  
**[14]** The duration of the infringement, meaning that a supervisory authority may generally attribute more weight to an infringement with longer duration. The longer the duration of the infringement, the more weight the supervisory authority may attribute to this factor. Subject to national law, if a given conduct was also illicit within the previous regulatory framework, both the period after the GDPR's effective date and the previous period may be taken into account when quantifying the fine, taking into account the conditions of that framework >>

---

# (b) Intentional or negligent character

## (b1) Definitions and assessment

**[3.A]** In general, “intent” includes both knowledge and wilfulness in relation to the characteristics of an offence, whereas “unintentional” means that there was no intention to cause the infringement although the controller/processor breached the duty of care which is required in the law. >>  
**[3.C]** 4.2.2 - Intentional or negligent character of the infringement 55. In its previous guidance, the EDPB stated that “in general, intent includes both knowledge and willfulness in relation to the characteristics of an offence, whereas ’unintentional’ means that there was no intention to 20 Adopted cause the infringement although the controller/processor breached the duty of care which is required in the law.”23 Unintentional in this sense does not equate to non-voluntary. Example 4 – Illustrations of intent and negligence (from WP 253)24 “Circumstances indicative of intentional breaches might be unlawful processing authorised explicitly by the top management hierarchy of the controller, or in spite of advice from the data protection officer or in disregard for existing policies, for example obtaining and processing data about employees at a competitor with an intention to discredit that competitor in the market. Other examples here might be: amending personal data to give a misleading (positive) impression about whether targets have been met – we have seen this in the context of targets for hospital waiting times the trade of personal data for marketing purpose i.e. selling data as ‘opted in’ without checking/disregarding data subjects’ views about how their data should be used Other circumstances, such as failure to read and abide by existing policies, human error, failure to check for personal data in information published, failure to apply technical updates in a timely manner, failure to adopt policies (rather than simply failure to apply them) may be indicative of negligence”; 56. The intentional or negligent character of the infringement (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR) should be assessed taking into account the objective elements of conduct gathered from the facts of the case. The EDPB highlighted that it is generally admitted that intentional infringements, “demonstrating contempt for the provisions of the law, are more severe than unintentional ones”25. In case of an intentional infringement, the supervisory authority is likely to attribute more weight to this factor. Depending on the circumstances of the case, the supervisory authority may also attach weight to the degree of negligence. At best, negligence could be regarded as neutral. >>

## (b2) Indicators and examples

**[3.B]** Circumstances indicative of intentional breaches might be unlawful processing authorised explicitly by the top management hierarchy of the controller, or in spite of advice from the data protection officer or in disregard for existing policies, for example obtaining and processing data about employees at a competitor with an intention to discredit that competitor in the market. Other examples here might be:  amending personal data to give a misleading (positive) impression about whether targets have been met – we have seen this in the context of targets for hospital waiting times  the trade of personal data for marketing purpose ie selling data as ‘opted in’ without checking/disregarding data subjects’ views about how their data should be used Other circumstances, such as failure to read and abide by existing policies, human error, failure to check for personal data in information published, failure to apply technical updates in a timely manner, failure to adopt policies (rather than simply failure to apply them)may be indicative of negligence. Enterprises should be responsible for adopting structures and resources adequate to the nature and complexity of their business. As such, controllers and processors cannot legitimise breaches of data protection law by claiming a shortage of resources. Routines and documentation of processing activities follow a risk-based approach according to the Regulation. There are grey areas which will affect decision-making in relation to whether or not to impose a corrective measure and the authority may need to do more extensive investigation to ascertain the facts of the case and to ensure that all specific circumstances of each individual case were sufficiently taken into account. >>

# (c) Actions taken to mitigate damage

## (c1) General role of mitigation

**[4]** Although aggravating and mitigating factors are particularly suited to fine-tune the amount of a fine to the particular circumstances of the case, their role in the choice of appropriate corrective measure should not be underestimated. In cases where the assessment based on other criteria leaves the supervisory authority in doubt about the appropriateness of an administrative fine, as a standalone corrective measure, or in combination with other measures in article 58, such aggravating or attenuating circumstances may help to choose the appropriate measures by tipping the balance in favour of what proves more effective, proportionate and dissuasive in the given case. This provision acts as an assessment of the degree of responsibility of the controller after the infringement has occurred. It may cover cases where the controller/processor has clearly not taken a 13 reckless/ negligent approach but where they have done all they can to correct their actions when they became aware of the infringement. Regulatory experience from SAs under the 95/46/EC Directive has previously shown that it can be appropriate to show some degree of flexibility to those data controllers/processors who have admitted to their infringement and taken responsibility to correct or limit the impact of their actions. This might include examples such as (although this would not lead to a more flexible approach in every case):  contacting other controllers/processors who may have been involved in an extension of the processing e.g. if there has been a piece of data mistakenly shared with third parties.  timely action taken by the data controller/processor to stop the infringement from continuing or expanding to a level or phase which would have had a far more serious impact than it did. >>

## (c2) Concrete mitigation actions (timeliness/effectiveness)

**[16]** - Actions taken by controller or processor to mitigate damage suffered by data subjects 73. A first step in determining whether aggravating or mitigating circumstances have occurred, is to review Articles 83(2)(c), which concerns “any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects.” 74. As recalled in Guidelines WP253, data controllers and processors are already obliged to “implement technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, to carry out data protection impact assessments and mitigate risks arising from the processing of personal data to the rights and freedoms of the individuals.” However, in case of an infringement, the controller or processor should “do whatever they can do in order to reduce the consequences of the breach for the individual(s) concerned32. 75. The adoption of appropriate measures to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects may be considered a mitigating factor, decreasing the amount of the fine. 32 Guidelines WP253, p. 12. 27 Adopted 76. The measures adopted must be assessed, in particular, with regard to the element of timeliness, i.e. the time when they are implemented by the controller or processor, and their effectiveness. In that sense, measures spontaneously implemented prior to the commencement of the supervisory authority’s investigation becoming known to the controller or processor are more likely to be considered a mitigating factor, than measures that have been implemented after that moment. >>

---

# (d) Degree of responsibility (Arts 25 & 32)

## (d1) Design and security obligations as “means” obligations

**[5]** Article 25 and article 32 of the Regulation require that the controllers “take into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms for the natural persons posed by the processing”. Rather than being an obligation of goal, these provisions introduce obligations of means, that is, the controller must make the necessary assessments and reach the appropriate conclusions. The question that the supervisory authority must then answer is to what extent the controller “did what it could be expected to do” given the nature, the purposes or the size of the processing, seen in light of the obligations imposed on them by the Regulation. In this assessment, due account should be taken of any “best practice” procedures or methods where these exist and apply. Industry standards, as well as codes of conduct in the respective field or profession are important to take into account. Codes of practice might give an indication as to what is common practice in the field and an indication of the level of knowledge about different means to address typical security issues associated with the processing. While best practice should be the ideal to pursue in general, the special circumstances of each individual casemust be taken into account when making the assessment of the degree of responsibility >>

## (d2) Assessing responsibility and documentation

**[17]** 5.3 - Degree of responsibility of the controller or processor 77. Following Article 83(2)(d), the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor will have to be assessed, taking into account measures implemented by them pursuant to Articles 25 and 32 GDPR. In line with Guidelines WP253, “the question that the supervisory authority must then answer is to what extent the controller ‘did what it could be expected to do’ given the nature, the purposes or the size of the processing, seen in light of the obligations imposed on them by the Regulation33”. 78. In particular, with regard to this criterion, the residual risk for the freedoms and rights of the data subjects, the impairment caused to the data subjects and the damage persisting after the adoption of the measures by the controller as well as the degree of robustness of the measures adopted pursuant to Articles 25 and 32 GDPR must be assessed. 79. In this respect, the supervisory authority may also consider whether the data in question was directly identifiable and/or available without technical protection.34 However, it should be borne in mind that the existence of such protection does not necessarily constitute a mitigating factor (see paragraph 82 below). This depends on all the circumstances of the case. 80. In order to adequately assess the above elements, the supervisory authority should take into account any relevant documentation provided by the controller or processor, e.g. in the context of the exercise of their right of defence. In particular, such documentation could provide evidence of when the measures were taken and how they were implemented, whether there were interactions between the controller and the processor (if applicable), or whether there has been contact with the DPO or data subjects (if applicable). 81. Given the increased level of accountability under the GDPR in comparison with Directive 95/46/EC,35 it is likely that the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor will be considered an aggravating or a neutral factor. Only in exceptional circumstances, where the controller or processor has gone above and beyond the obligations imposed upon them, will this be considered a mitigating factor. >>

---

# (e) Previous infringements

## (e1) Quick assessment questions

**[6]** supervisory authority should assess:  Has the controller/processor committed the same infringement earlier?  Has the controller/ processor committed an infringement of the Regulation in the same manner? (for example as a consequence of insufficient knowledge of existing routines in the organisation, or as a consequence of inappropriate risk assessment, not being responsive to requests from the data subject in a timely manner, unjustified delay in responding to requests and so on). >>

## (e2) General rule

**[18]** 5.4 - Previous infringements by the controller or processor 82. Previous infringements are infringements already established before the decision is issued. In case of cooperation under Chapter VII GDPR, prior infringements are those already established before the draft decision (in the sense of Article 60 GDPR) is issued. 83. According to Article 83(2)(e) GDPR, any relevant previous infringements committed by the controller or processor must be considered when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and deciding on the amount of the administrative fine. Similar wording is found in Recital 148 GDPR. >>

## (e3) Time frame

**[19]** 5.4.1 - Time frame 84. Firstly, regard must be given to the point in time when the prior infringement took place, considering that the longer the time between a previous infringement and the infringement currently being investigated, the lower its significance. Consequently, the longer ago the infringement was committed, the less relevance shall be given by the supervisory authorities. This assessment is left at the discretion of the supervisory authority, subject to applicable national- and European law and principles. 85. However, since infringements committed a long time ago might still be of interest when assessing the “track record” of the controller or processor, fixed limitation periods are not to be set to this purpose. However, some national laws do prevent the supervisory authority from considering previous infringements after a settled period. Likewise, certain national laws impose a record deletion obligation after a certain period of time, which prevents the acting supervisory authorities from taking into account these precedents. 86. For the same reason, it should be noted that infringements of the GDPR, since they will be more recent, must be considered as more relevant than infringements of the national provisions adopted for the implementation of Directive 95/46/EC (if national laws allow such infringements to be taken into account by the supervisory authority). >>

## (e4) Subject matter

**[20]** 5.4.2 - Subject matter 87. For the purpose of Article 83(2)(e) GDPR, previous infringements of either the same or different subject matter to the one being investigated might be considered as “relevant”. 88. Even though all prior infringements might provide an indication about the controller’s or processor’s general attitude towards the observance of the GDPR, infringements of the same subject matter must be given more significance, as they are closer to the infringement currently under investigation, especially when the controller or processor previously committed the same infringement (repeated infringements). Thus, same subject-matter infringements must be considered as more relevant than previous infringements concerning a different topic. 89. For example, the fact that the controller or the processor had failed in the past to respond to data subjects exercising their rights in a timely manner must be considered more relevant when the infringement being investigated refers also to a lack of response to a data subject exercising their rights than when it refers to a personal data breach. 90. However, due account must be taken of previous infringements of a different subject matter, but that were committed in the same manner, as they might be indicative of persisting problems within the controller or processor organisation. For example, this would be the case for infringements arising as a consequence of having ignored the advice provided by the Data Protection Officer. >>

## (e5) Other considerations & cross-SA precedents

**[21]** 5.4.3 - Other considerations 91. If considering a previous infringement of the national provisions adopted for the implementation of the Directive 95/46/EC, the supervisory authorities must take into account the fact that the requirements in the Directive and the GDPR might differ (if national laws allow such infringements to be taken into account by the supervisory authority). 92. When considering the relevance of a previous infringement, the supervisory authority should take account of the status of the procedure in which the previous infringement was established – particularly of any measures taken by the supervisory authority or by the judicial authority – in accordance with national law. 29 Adopted 93. Previous infringements could also be considered when they were found by a different supervisory authority concerning the same controller/processor. For example, the lead supervisory authority dealing with an infringement through the cooperation (one-stop-shop) mechanism in accordance with Article 60 GDPR could take into account infringements previously determined in local cases, by another supervisory authority, concerning the same controller/processor. Likewise, infringements previously determined by the lead supervisory authority could be taken into account when a different authority must handle a complaint lodged with it in cases with only local impacts under Article 56(2) GDPR. Where there is no lead supervisory authority (for example, in case the controller or processor is not established in the European Union), supervisory authorities could also take into account infringements previously determined by another supervisory authority concerning the same controller/processor. 94. The existence of previous infringements can be considered an aggravating factor in the calculation of the fine. The weight given to this factor is to be determined in view of the nature and frequency of the previous infringements. The absence of any previous infringements, however, cannot be considered a mitigating factor, as compliance with the GDPR is the norm. If there are no previous infringements, this factor can be regarded as neutral. >>

---

# (f) Degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority

## (f1) Cooperation beyond mandatory duty

**[7]** The Regulation does not give a precise answer to the question how to take into account the efforts of the controllers or the processors to remedy an infringement already established by the supervisory authority. Moreover, it is clear that the criteria would usually be applied when calculating the amount of the fine to be imposed. However, where intervention of the controller has had the effect that negative consequences on the rights of the individuals did not produce or had a more limited impact than they could have otherwise done, this could also be taken into account in the choice of corrective measure that is proportionate in the individual case. One example of a case where cooperation with the supervisory authority might be relevant to consider might be:  Has the entity responded in a particular manner to the supervisory authority’s requests during the investigation phase in that specific case which has significantly limited the impact on individuals’ rights as a result? This said, it would not be appropriate to give additional regard to cooperation that is already required by law for example, the entity is in any case required to allow the supervisory authority access to premises for audits/inspections. >>

## (f2) Degree of cooperation under Art. 83(2)(f)

**[22]** 5.6 - The manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority 95. Article 83(2)(f) requires the supervisory authority to take account of the degree of the controller’s or processor’s cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement. 96. Before further assessing the level of cooperation the controller or processor has established with the supervisory authority, it must be reiterated that a general obligation to cooperate is incumbent on the controller and the processor pursuant to Article 31 GDPR, and that lack of cooperation may lead to the application of the fine provided for in Article 83(4)(a) GDPR. It should therefore be considered that the ordinary duty of cooperation is mandatory and should therefore be considered neutral (and not a mitigating factor). 97. However, where cooperation with the supervisory authority has had the effect of limiting or avoiding negative consequences for the rights of the individuals that might otherwise have occurred, the supervisory authority may consider this a mitigating factor in the sense of Article 83(2)(f) GDPR, thereby decreasing the amount of the fine. This may for instance be the case when a controller or processor “has responded in a particular manner to the supervisory authority’s requests during the investigation phase in that specific case which has significantly limited the impact on individuals’ rights as a result”36 >>

# (g) Categories of personal data affected

## (g1) Key questions

**[8]** (g) the categories of the personal data affected by the infringement; Some examples of key questions that the supervisory authority may find it necessary to answer here, if appropriate to the case, are:  Does the infringement concern processing of special categories of data set out in articles 9 or 10 of the Regulation?  Is the data directly identifiable/ indirectly identifiable?  Does the processing involve data whose dissemination would cause immediate damage/distress to the individual (which falls outside the category of article 9 or 10)? 15  Is the data directly available without technical protections, or is it encrypted13? >>

## (g2) Sensitive types & volume

**[15]** 4.2.3 - Categories of personal data affected 57. Concerning the requirement to take account of the categories of personal data affected (Article 83(2)(g) GDPR), the GDPR clearly highlights the types of data that deserve special protection and therefore a stricter response in terms of fines. This concerns, at the very least, the types of data covered by Articles 9 and 10 GDPR, and data outside the scope of these Articles the dissemination of which causes immediate damages or distress to the data subject26 (e.g. location data, data on private communication, national identification numbers, or financial data, such as transaction overviews or credit card numbers).27 In general, the more of such categories of data involved or the more sensitive the data, the more weight the supervisory authority may attribute to this factor. 58. Further, the amount of data regarding each data subject is of relevance, considering that the infringement of the right to privacy and protection of personal data increases with the amount of data regarding each data subject. >>

---

# (h) Manner in which the infringement became known

## (h1) General considerations

**[9]** ) the manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority, in particular whether, and if so to what extent, the controller or processor notified the infringement; A supervisory authority might become aware about the infringement as a result of investigation, complaints, articles in the press, anonymous tips or notification by the data controller. The controller has an obligation according to the Regulation to notify the supervisory authority about personal data breaches. Where the controller merely fulfils this obligation, compliance with the obligation cannot be interpreted as an attenuating/ mitigating factor. Similarly, a data controller/processor who acted carelessly without notifying, or at least not notifying all of the details of the infringement due to a failure to adequately assess the extent of the infringement may also be considered by the supervisory authority to merit a more serious penalty i.e. it is unlikely to be classified as a minor infringement >>

## (h2) Self-reporting vs. neutral notifications

**[23]** 5.6 - The manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority 98. Following Article 83(2)(h), the manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority could be a relevant aggravating or mitigating factor. In assessing this, particular weight can be given to the question whether, and if so to what extent, the controller or processor notified the infringement out of its 36 Guidelines WP253, p. 14. 30 Adopted own motion, before the infringement was known to the supervisory authority by – for instance – a complaint or an investigation. This circumstance is not relevant when the controller is subject to specific notification obligations (such as in the case of personal data breaches according to Article 33)37. In such cases, this notification should be considered as neutral38. 99. Where the infringement became known to the supervisory authority by, for instance, a complaint or an investigation, this element should also, as a rule, be considered as neutral. The supervisory authority may consider this a mitigating circumstance if the controller or processor notified the infringement out of its own motion, prior to the supervisory authority’s knowledge of the case. >>

# (i) Compliance with previously ordered measures (same subject matter)

## (i1) Reminder to consider prior SA measures

**[10]** ) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned with regard to the same subject-matter, compliance with those measures; A controller or processor may already be on the supervisory authority’s radar for monitoring their compliance after a previous infringement and contacts with the DPO where they exist are likely to have been extensive. Therefore, the supervisory authority will take into account the previous contacts. As opposed to the criteria in (e), this assessment criteria only seeks to remind supervisory authorities to refer to measures that they themselves have previously issued to the same controller or processors “with regard to the same subject matter”. >>

## (i2) Application and limits

**[24]** 5.7 - Compliance with measures previously ordered with regard to the same subject matter 100. Article 83(2)(i) GDPR states that “where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned with regard to the same subject-matter, compliance with those measures” must be considered when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and deciding on its amount. 101. As opposed to Article 83(2)(e) GDPR, this assessment only refers to measures that supervisory authorities themselves have previously issued to the same controller or processor with regard to the same subject matter39. 102. In this respect, the controller or processor might hold reasonable expectations that compliance with measures previously issued against them would prevent a same subject-matter infringement from taking place in the future. However, since compliance with measures previously ordered is mandatory for the data controller or processor, it should not be taken into account as a mitigating factor per se. On the contrary, a reinforced commitment on the part of the controller or processor in the fulfilment of previous measures is required for this factor to apply as mitigating, e.g. taking additional measures beyond those ordered by the supervisory authority. 103. Conversely, non-compliance with a corrective power previously ordered may be considered either as an aggravating factor, or as a different infringement in itself, pursuant to Article 83(5)(e) and Article 83(6) GDPR. Therefore, due note should be taken that the same non-compliant behaviour cannot lead to a situation where it is punished twice. >>

# (j) Adherence to codes of conduct or certification

## (j1) Measures within the monitoring scheme

**[11]** authority may be satisfied that the code community in charge of administering the code takes the appropriate action themselves against their member, for example through the monitoring and enforcement schemes of the code of conduct itself. Therefore, the supervisory authority might consider that such measures are effective, proportionate or dissuasive enough in that particular case without the need for imposing additional measures from the supervisory authority itself. Certain forms of sanctioning non-compliant behaviour may be made through the monitoring scheme, according to article 41 (2) c and 42 (4), including suspension or exclusion of the controller or processor concerned from the code community. >>

## (j2) Relevance under Art. 83(2)(j)

**[25]** 5.8 - Adherence to approved codes of conduct or approved certification mechanisms 104. Article 83(2)(j) GDPR states that adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 GDPR or approved certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42 GDPR may be a relevant factor. 105. As recalled by Guidelines WP253, adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 GDPR or approved certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42 GDPR may in some circumstances constitute a mitigating factor. Approved codes of conduct will, according to Article 40(4) GDPR, contain “mechanisms which enable the (monitoring) body to carry out mandatory monitoring of compliance with its provisions.” Certain forms of sanctioning non-compliant behaviour may be made through the monitoring scheme, according to Article 37 It should be underlined that a personal data breach does not necessarily imply a GDPR infringement. 38 This is underlined by Guidelines WP 253, p. 15. 39 Ibid. 31 Adopted 41(4) GDPR, including suspension or exclusion of the controller or processor concerned from the code community. Although the supervisory authority can take into account previously imposed sanctions pertaining to the self-regulatory scheme, the powers of the monitoring body are pursuant to Article 41(4) GDPR “without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the competent supervisory authority”, which means that the supervisory authority is not under an obligation to take into account any sanctions by the monitoring body40. 106. On the other hand, if failure to comply with the codes of conduct or certification is directly relevant to the infringement, the supervisory authority may consider this an aggravating circumstance. >>

# (k) Any other aggravating or mitigating factors

## (k1) Financial benefits/losses avoided

**[12]** (k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the infringement. The provision itself gives examples of which other elements might be taken into account when deciding the appropriateness of an administrative fine for an infringement of the provisions mentioned in Article 83(4-6). Information about profit obtained as a result of a breach may be particularly important for the supervisory authorities as economic gain from the infringement cannot be compensated through measures that do not have a pecuniary component. As such, the fact that the controller had profited from the infringement of the Regulation may constitute a strong indication that a fine should be imposed. >>

## (k2) Open-ended contextual factors

**[26]** 5.9 - Other aggravating and mitigating circumstances 107. Article 83(2)(k) GDPR gives the supervisory authority room to take into account any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case. In the individual case there may be many elements involved, which cannot all be codified or listed and which will have to be taken into account in order to ensure that the sanction applied is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case. 108. Article 83(2)(k) GDPR mentions examples of “any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,” i.e. financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the infringement. It is considered that this provision is of fundamental importance for adjusting the amount of the fine to the specific case. In this sense, it is considered that it should be interpreted as an instance of the principle of fairness and justice applied to the individual case. 109. The scope of this provision, which is necessarily open-ended, should include all the reasoned considerations regarding the socio-economic context in which the controller or processor operates, those relating to the legal context and those concerning the market context41. 110. In particular, economic gain from the infringement could be an aggravating circumstance if the case provides information about profit obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR. 111. Exceptional circumstances that can lead to significant changes in the socio-economic context (e.g. the onset of a serious pandemic emergency that could radically change the way processing of personal data is carried out) could also be considered under Article 83(2)(k) GDPR. >>
