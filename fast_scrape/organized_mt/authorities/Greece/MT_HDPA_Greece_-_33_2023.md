## English Summary

### Facts

A municipality uploaded on a public portal (“diavgeia”) a decision where the personal data of an employee including her full name, position, place of employment and involvement in a criminal complaint were mentioned. A separate decision regarding her participation in the municipality's financial council was also discovered by the data subject on the portal. The complainant requested the erasure of her personal data from the public portal by exercising her right to erasure under [Article 17 GDPR.](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR")

The DPO of the municipality rejected her request on the grounds that the municipality had the legal obligation to upload onto this portal every act, decision or document relating to the performance of its duties, under national law.

On 25 October 2021, the data subject lodged a complaint before the Hellenic DPA ("HDPA") against the municipality.

### Holding

After considering all the facts of the case, the Hellenic DPA fined the municipality a total of €5000.

They fined the them €2,000 for breaches 6(1)(c) and Articles 5(1)(a) GDPR. The muncipality had processed data unlawfully. The HDPA considered the national law and concluded that the decisions fell outside its scope, therefore the municipality could not rely on Article 6(1)(c) GDPR as a legal basis. This made the processing also unlawful under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.

The HDPA fined the municipality €1,000 for violating Article 5(1)(c) GDPR as the municipality had not adhered to the principle of data minimisation by having no filter for the selection of decisions which had to be published on the online portal.

The HDPA fined the muncipality €2,000 for violating Article 17(1) GDPR. This was because the DPO refused to erase the data when requested to do so by the data subject.

The HDPA also ordered the municipality to remove the two decisions concerning the data subject from its website within a 20-day period.
