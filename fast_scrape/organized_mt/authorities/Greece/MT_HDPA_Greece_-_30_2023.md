## English Summary

### Facts

The Athens Public Transport Authority's (OASA) established a new electronic ticketing system. The system used passengers' passport number or other official identification document, their 8-digit code (PIN), their month and year of birth, and if applicable, their category of social beneficiary (for instance, if a passenger received social welfare benefits).

In 2017, the HDPA had issued two opinions regarding the OASA's electronic ticketing system. In these opinions, the HDPA considered that the OASA, as the controller, should carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for their electronic ticketing system.

On 18 November 2019, the Authority carried out an on-site inspection at OASA to determine compliance with the previously issued opinions. Following this inspection, the HDPA found remaining issues and ordered OASA to make amendments to their system.

In March 2020, the OASA made new submissions to the DPA. These included a new DPIA, their record of prior processing activities, as well as a technical report from their contracted processor, "HELLAS SMARTICKET S.A.". Following these submissions, the HDPA still considered there to be issues with OASA's systems and requested additional information from them.

After receiving this information, the HDPA deemed it to be unsatisfactory, and on 25 September 2023, the DPA proceeded to issue a decision.

### Holding

The DPA found that the controller had violated [Article 5(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 35(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR "Article 35 GDPR").

(a) The DPA found that the controller had breached the principle of storage limitation under [Article 5(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1e "Article 5 GDPR"). In the course of their investigation, the DPA found that the controller aimed to retain personal data collected from their customers for 20 years, without demonstrating why this was necessary.

(b) The DPA found that the controller had violated [Article 35(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR#1 "Article 35 GDPR"), as their DPIA insufficiently identified the data retention purposes in relation to their records of processing. Moreover, the DPIA was unclear in terms of the risks arising from processing.

As a result, the Greek DPA fined OASA €50,000 for breaching the principle of storage limitation, and issued a reprimand for the violation of [Article 35(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR#1 "Article 35 GDPR"). In addition, the DPA issued a compliance order against the controller, to identify and document within one month, all data retention periods for their various processing purposes. In addition to these, the DPA issued a compliance order against the controller to revise their DPIA within three months, because their DPIA still contained ambiguities in its risk assessment.
