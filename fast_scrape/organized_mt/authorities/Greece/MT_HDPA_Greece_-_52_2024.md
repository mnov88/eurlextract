## English Summary

### Facts

On 1 March 2021 the data subject filed a complaint with the DPA, for the fact that they had received unsolicited communication via email, and in particular the commercial promotion of digital advertising services, without having any prior relation with the controller.

The data subject further stated that in response to their question regarding how their data became available to the controller, they received the generic answer that these had been collected through _market research_.

After the DPA had made numerous attempts to contact the controller without response, they issued decision no. 23/2023, where:

*   According to [Article 58 (2)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR") they reprimanded the controller.
*   According to [Article 58(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR") they instructed the controller to immediately reply to the filed complaint.
*   Informed the controller that in case of non-compliance, they will impose an administrative fine according to [Article 83 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR "Article 83 GDPR").

### Holding

The DPA held that:

According to [Article 11 (1) Act 3471/2006](https://search.et.gr/el/fek/?fekId=334206) _(Protection of personal data & privacy in electronic communications_) the making of unsolicited communications by any means of electronic communication, \[...\] for any kind of advertising purposes, shall be permitted only if the subscriber has given his or her express prior consent_._

As the e-mail account to which the unsolicited promotion e-mail was sent, did not correspond to a natural person but to a legal person the GDPR is not applicable. However [Article 11 (7) Act 3471/2006](https://search.et.gr/el/fek/?fekId=334206) _(Protection of personal data & privacy in electronic communications)_ also applies to legal persons.

For the above reasons and because the controller did not implement the aforementioned decision no. 23/2023, the DPA imposed on the controller a total fine of €10,000 for the violation of [Article 11 (1) Act 3471/2006](https://search.et.gr/el/fek/?fekId=334206) _(Protection of personal data & privacy in electronic communications_).

## Comment

This case highlights the fact that under national Greek law, not only natural but legal persons, as well, are protected by unsolicited communications.

Case No. 3610
Decision 52/2024
The Personal Data Protection Authority convened, following an invitation from its President, in a meeting via videoconference on Wednesday
13.11.2023 at 10:00, in order to examine the case referred to in the background of this case. Present were Georgios Batzalexis, Deputy

services of the company “SOCIAL COOPERATIVE ENTERPRISE OF COLLECTIVE

On 16-09-2021 the Authority, following a telephone conversation with WEDOO, resent, upon request, the above documents to the email address indicated without any relevant response. On 15-10-2021 the Authority again sent via registered mail the initial information document with no. proc.

were served on WEDOO by the Chaidari Police Department on 04-02-2022,
as is apparent from the no. C/ΕΙΣ/1797/04-02-2022 proof of service, without
there being any response from WEDOO to the relevant document.
WEDOO was summoned to a hearing with the no. prot. C/ΕΣΕ/2664/21-10-2022
document of the Authority which was served by the Chaidari Police Department on
24/10/2022. No one from the company attended the meeting.
Subsequently, the Personal Data Protection Authority issued decision 23/2023, the operative part of which states the following: 3 The Authority: 1. Exercising the corrective powers conferred on it by Article 58 par. 2 b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation - hereinafter GDPR), reprimands the accused company under the name "SOCIAL COOPERATIVE ENTERPRISE OF COLLECTIVE AND SOCIAL BENEFIT wedoo Digital Agency", as controller for the reasons extensively mentioned in the previous section. 2. Exercising the corrective powers conferred on it by Article 58 par. 1 a) of the GDPR, instructs the respondent to respond
immediately to the complaint.
3. Informs the respondent that in case of non-compliance with
the order of the previous paragraph within seven (7)
calendar days from the service of this letter, it will proceed, exercising the corrective powers granted to it by
article 58 par. 2 letter i) of the GDPR, to impose an administrative fine
pursuant to article 83 of the GDPR.
Finally, the Authority notified the above decision to WEDOO with the
registered letter No. Prot. C/ΕΙΣ/1466/23-05-2024 which was received
by a representative of the said company on 29/05/2024 according to the

Because WEDOO did not comply with the operative part of the above decision,
the Authority summoned the company to a hearing with the document no. Γ/ΕΣΕ/2024/2755
. The summons was served by the Egaleo Police Department on 13/1-
/2024. No one from the company attended the meeting.
CONSIDERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW
1. According to article 11 par. 1 of Law 3471/2016 “The use of automatic calling systems, in particular using fax machines or 
4 e-mail, and more generally the making of unsolicited communications by any means of electronic communication, \[with or\] without 
human intervention, for the purposes of direct marketing of products or services and for any kind of advertising purposes, 
is permitted only if the subscriber expressly consents in advance.”
It is noted that, based on paragraph 7 of the same article, “The above regulations also apply to subscribers who are legal entities.”
2. According to Article 1, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the GDPR: “
1. This Regulation establishes rules concerning the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and rules concerning the free movement of personal data.
»
3. The Authority, by Decision 23/2023, ordered WEDOO, exercising the corrective powers conferred on it by Article 8, paragraph 1, subparagraph a) of the GDPR, to respond immediately to the complaint. The company in question did not respond within the seven (7) calendar day period referred to in point 2 of the operative part of the decision.
4. The email account to which the commercial services promotion email was sent according to the complaint form does not correspond to a natural person but to a legal person as it is the central contact address (dalnave@dalnave.com) of a company and is not otherwise related to any natural person. Therefore, taking into account WEDOO's refusal to cooperate with the Authority and that according to paragraph 7 of article 11 of law 3471/2006 the provisions of this article also apply to subscribers who are legal persons, it is established that WEDOO, by sending an email with the aim of promoting its products or services to a legal person, violated article 11 paragraph 1 of law 3471/2006. 5. WEDOO, according to the "Announcement of Registration of Decision for the Conversion of 
5
Company into IKE"
1 published on 17/05/2023, changed its corporate form
from a Social Cooperative Enterprise (KOINSEP) to a private capital
company (IKE) with No. GEMI 166386961000, and Tax Identification Number (TIN) Audit Firm: 193.
6. Based on the above, the Authority considers that it is appropriate to exercise the powers under
article 21 of Law 2472/1997 in conjunction with article 13 par. 1 of Law 3471/2006, taking into account article 84 of Law 4624/2019, for
the established violation of article 11 par. 1 of Law 3471/2006. In order to calculate the sanction, the Authority takes into account the actual facts of the case under examination, the continued refusal of the audited company to respond and cooperate with the Authority even after the issuance of the previous decision, the gravity of the established violation, which is considered minor, the small number of complaints and the size of the company's turnover2.

FOR THESE REASONS
The Authority
Imposes, on WEDOO DIGITAL AGENCY SINGLE-PERSON IKE, based on
article 21 of Law 2472/1997 in conjunction with article 13 par. 1 of Law 3471/2006,
the effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative fine that
is appropriate in this specific case according to the specific circumstances
of this case, amounting to ten thousand (10,000) euros, for the above-identified
violation of article 11 par. 1 of Law 3471/2016 as analyzed in paragraphs 3
and 4 of this.
