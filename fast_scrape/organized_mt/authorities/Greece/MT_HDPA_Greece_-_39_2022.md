## English Summary

### Facts

A number of complaints and notifications of incidents were submitted to the Authority of personal data breaches related to incidents of non-compliance with the unauthorised replacement of a subscriber's sim card (sim swap) and other procedures (e.g. call diversion, issuance of new telephone numbers) by third parties not holding the connections in question.

### Holding

The Authority, following complaints and related notifications, has become aware of incidents of unauthorised access by malicious third parties to mobile subscriber data. The access took place following requests to change the SIM card of subscribers and was due to problems with the identification process of subscribers when submitting such requests, either as a result of inadequate security measures or after defective implementation of existing measures. The Authority assessed the number of incidents, as well as the actions taken by the controller to address them, and imposed a fine of EUR 150,000 for the above violations of the provisions of Article 12 of Law No. 3471/2006.
