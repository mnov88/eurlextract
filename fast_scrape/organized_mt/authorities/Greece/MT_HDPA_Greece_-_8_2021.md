## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant received an SMS from the political candidate which was promoting the candidate’s participation at the municipal elections without having granted a consent to do so. The political candidate, wasn’t able to provide proof that the complainant and other data subjects gave their consent for the processing.

### Dispute

Was the political communication legal under article 4 GDPR?

### Holding

The DPA held that in the light of Article 4 GDPR, Article 13 of the national law 3471/2006 and Article 11 of the national law 3471/2006, the political communication for the purposes of the promotion of the candidate’s political campaign, can be considered legal only after the granting of explicit consent. Political communication without consent is possible only if the data subject has been given his personal details and was informed that the details will be used for the purposes of the political communication. Moreover the data subject should be able to withdraw and refuse this processing.

For this reason the DPA fined the candidate for unlawful processing of data by a 2000€ fine.
