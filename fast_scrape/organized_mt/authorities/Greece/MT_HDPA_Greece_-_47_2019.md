## English Summary

### Facts

Alien asked the erasure of his data from SIS and EKANA. The HDPA invited the Aliens Division of Attica to provide supporting documentation. The complainant exercised his right to erasure twice before EKANA, but his request was rejected both of the times, since he hadn't submitted the documents needed to prove a legal residence in Greece.

### Dispute

### Holding

The HDPA found that the complainant had been arrested because he didn't have residence documents. He was also sentenced in prison for eight months by the Greek Courts for other violations, while a return decision against him is still pending. Therefore, the HDPA found that the complainant was lawfully registered in both registers for reasons of public order and public security and there has been no reason for the registration's reassessment since the three-year period after the last registration is still ongoing.

On these grounds, the HDPA rejected the complaint as unfounded.
