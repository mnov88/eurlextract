## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject complained to the Greek DPA (the HDPA) about having received a press release via email by a member of the Hellenic Parliament (the latter being considered the data controller in the context of this decision), without the data subject's consent. Furthermore, the data subject's email address was visible to other recipients (the "To" field was used instead of BCC).

### Holding

The HDPA issued a warning towards the data controller, recommending the use of the BCC field in order for mass email communication to remain compliant with [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). No other measures were deemed necessary, because of the data controller's stance that the inclusion of the subject's email was made by mistake (more particularly, the controller had wrongly thought the data subject was a journalist, and that the data processing would thus be in accordance to [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR")), and because the controller took corrective measures by removing the data subject's personal details from the mailing list.

    Summary
              The Authority reprimanded a controller who sent e-mails to a large number of recipients, placing the recipients' details in the "To" field. When an e-mail address is addressed to a large number of recipients who are natural persons, the controller must take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipients' addresses are not disclosed to a large number of persons. Therefore, in these cases it is better to use the "hidden notification" option or to send individual messages, when possible.
