## English Summary

### Facts

The Greek bank Eurobank Ergasias S.A. appealed before the HDPA to challenge HDPA's older decision. The appealed decision provided advises on what measures the Bank should have taken to properly respond to a data subject's access request and to guarantee the exercise of the right to object. The Bank claimed that the appealed decision imposed disproportionate obligations on it and on other creditors violating the former national data protection law and the law on the establishment of debtor notification companies.

### Dispute

The issue at stake was mainly the determination of the period within which the Bank had to notify the personal data to the data subjects, in order for the debtors to be able to exercise their rights to access and to object. The appealed decision recommended that the Bank provide the debtors with a reasonable period of 10-15 days starting from the notification of the debtors until the Bank distributes their personal data to the debtor notification companies.

### Holding

The HDPA ruled that there is no ground for re-examination of this case. Thus, it rejected the appeal.
