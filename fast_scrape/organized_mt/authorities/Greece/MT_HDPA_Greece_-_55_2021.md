## English Summary

### Facts

In July 2020, an individual sent an e-mail to the Hellenic DPA reporting that when they attempted to submit an application on the tourism4all.gov.gr platform, they discovered a personal data breach. Indeed, when they entered their credential the application data of a third party (not related to the complainant) which included his full name, Tax Identification Number, Social Security Number (SSN), postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, and disability status all appeared.

Additionally, when the individual tried to find the Ministry of Tourism's Data Protection Officer to inform them of this issue, they found it did not have one - in contravention of [Article 31(1) and (7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_31_GDPR "Article 31 GDPR"). Thus, the Hellenic DPA launched an investigation to determine whether the Ministry of Tourism contravened Articles [33](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR"), [34](/index.php?title=Article_34_GDPR "Article 34 GDPR") and [37](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR "Article 37 GDPR") GDPR.

### Holding

First, the Ministry of Tourism argued that whilst it is the data controller of the platform, its involvement was not of a technical nature because it was the obligation of the contractor it hired to design to ensure the platform's proper functioning and to take all necessary security measures to safeguard users' personal data.

In addition, it argued that because the incident in question was isolated, dealt with immediately, and the personal data was not widely exposed, the affected person was not put at risk. As such, in the Ministry's view, it was not possible to consider that it contravened Articles [33](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR") and [34](/index.php?title=Article_34_GDPR "Article 34 GDPR") GDPR.

Finally, the Ministry of Tourism asserted that it believed that it was actually the Ministry of Digital Governance's responsibility to "operate" the dpo@mintour.com email address, as it had not instructed the contractor to use this email address.

However, the Hellenic DPA held that the Ministry of Tourism was responsible for the processing on the platform. This was evidenced in a Joint Ministerial Decision which explicitly stated the Ministry of Tourism was the controller of any users of the platform's personal data. As such, it was liable under the GDPR for the data breach and lack of a DPO.

Further, the DPA determined that an 'ad hoc' incident response procedure was followed following the data breach. This procedure failed to uncover the source of the incident, and even after investigating the different parties questioned could only speculate as to the cause of the incident. The DPA held this constituted "a breach of the fundamental requirements to take appropriate organisational and technical measures to security of processing, in accordance with [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"), in connection with [Article 24 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR "Article 24 GDPR"), as the controller did not take into account the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons in determining security measures."

Finally, the DPA held that the Ministry of Tourism violated [Article 33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR") by failing to report the aforementioned data breach, and [Article 37(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR "Article 37 GDPR") by not appointing a DPO (at the time the breach took place).

In light of all these breaches, the Hellenic DPA fined the Ministry of Tourism €75,000.

No implementation problems were detected and the event could not be reproduced. Therefore, any possibility that the event was due to an implementation error concerning the digital platform was ruled out. Then, data related to the implementation of OAuth2.0, on which the TaxisNet Login service of GIS is based, as well as the service infrastructure of the application were examined.

In addition, check the relevant logs in detail. c) The GGPSDD sent by e-mail the same day and time… the relevant logs kept at the Interoperability Center and related to call reports in oAuth 2.0. d) During the first days of operation of the platform, KED. / GGPSDD informed the Ministry of Tourism with statistics on the use of online services for monitoring the action. e) The oAuth 2.0 authentication service of KED is widely used and used in a number of electronic services of public bodies. Calls to Auth2.0 within 2020 reached 54,185,731, while in the first half of 2021 86,396,905 calls have already been made, without any malfunction in this mechanism being reported or ascertained. Furthermore, the GGPSDD states that in order for a web application to utilize multiple simultaneous users, the application needs to be in control of the sessions that are created, so that in the end each user is served with functionality and data related to it. Note 16 of oAuth2.0 and web services to KED. as well as their responses, are controlled by the respective application that calls them. The separation of information for each individual must be done through the separate management of the session ids from the Web Application ("Tourism for All"). As for the further investigation of the issue, apart from issues exclusively within the competence of KED, the GGPSDD is considered incompetent. The above-mentioned memorandum of the Ministry of Tourism, which was submitted after the hearing before the Authority, repeats the description of the procedures followed to deal with the incident (as they had already been described in previous documents of the Ministry), the content of the above information is attached. note of the GGPSDD, while also repeating the content of the report of the DPO of the Contractor (Threenitas). Furthermore, the Ministry of Tourism states that, after hearing before the Authority, it requested further clarifications from the contractor company, which with the no. … (Ministry of Tourism)'s letter (attached to the Ministry's memorandum to the Authority) states: GSIS Authentication service. The library uses unmodified methods provided by Microsoft to manage multiple sessions. In the case examined, where the appearance of another user's data was observed, the issue was identified in the fact that the data returned by GSIS to the infrastructure after the redirection of authentication, concerned another user than the one for whom the authentication process took place. The authentication process and the session management, ie the management of the sessions that are created in the context of the relevant requests for user service, was performed exclusively using the methods provided by this library. Given that: a) the mechanism for managing multiple connections is made using Microsoft libraries which does not justify the question of their correctness b) its operation was confirmed by performing tests, as well as in artificial 17 load conditions, when they were applied in host) the application, c) operated generally without problems during the heavy load conditions observed in all subsequent phases of system operation we consider as the only possible possibility that this issue is caused by mismanagement in any of the intermediate network infrastructure between of the implementation and the KED. These infrastructures are not under the control of Threenitas and the Ministry of Tourism, and are used as they are. Indicatively, the infrastructure used the services Application Load Balancer and Web Application Firewall, as provided by Amazon Cloud, which could under certain conditions lead to the mismanagement of multiple active connections to the infrastructure of KED. As mentioned proper operation of the application, and after the introduction of additional controls to deal with the phenomenon that was observed, in order to prevent the possibility of malfunction even due to events that are not under the control of the application, the problem was addressed and not observed again ". Furthermore, from the e-mail that took place on the day of the incident, it appears that the User with ΑΦΜΧΧΧΧΧ Λ (Λ) made two (2) connections, namely… Μ ΜΜ (…) and…… ΜΜ from the same IP address…, and the User with VAT ΧΧΧΧΧ… (Α) also in two (2) connections…… ΜΜ and…… ΜΜ, from two different IP addresses,… and… and the Ministry of Tourism speculates that during the first connection the application was submitted and in the second an attempt was made to retrieve it, whenever the incident of retrieving the request of the other user was observed. The reason that the incident was not notified to the Authority, in accordance with Article 33 of the GIP, is that: a) The report was made directly to the Data Protection Authority by the citizen (A) with notification to the affected person, who took any action, b) The controller took action and took appropriate action by entering a additional level of security when logging in and identifying users, who ensured that such an incident did not occur again. The incident was assessed as minor and the risk was negligible to non-existent, ie 18 that is, there is no possibility of endangering the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In its memorandum, the Ministry also states that given that a) the implementation of the digital application for the "Tourism for All" program was developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Digital Governance, which guided the Ministry of Tourism to plan and develop interoperability of services through of the Interoperability Center of the GGPSDD and the sponsoring company THREENITASAE cooperating with the Ministry of Digital Government, and k) in the Cooperation of the Offices of the two Ministers (Tourism and Digital Governance), the Strategic Planning Department of the Ministry of Tourism immediately informed the Ministry of Digital Governance and the GGSDDD supervised by it about this incident.  The Ministry of Tourism did not know the terms of the contract with the contractor. For the above reasons it was also considered - incorrectly - that the e-mail address dpo@mintour.gov.gr included in the terms of use of the application was an e-mail address which would be operated by the Ministry of Digital Government and would not be managed by the Ministry of Tourism . Besides, as mentioned in the Memorandum of Cooperation, the platform in terms of its content was designed according to instructions of the Ministry of Tourism, which, however, never provided this email address for the Program, but only its own email address tourism4all@mintour.gr. Besides, all the electronic addresses of the Ministry of Tourism are in the form xxxxxxx@mintour.gr without being included in these weapons of the Ministry, this electronic address was created on 16.06.2020 in order to receive questions / complaints / complaints, etc. regarding the Program. This complaint was also sent to this e-mail address and there was an immediate reaction, as described in all the documents of the Ministry to the Authority. Finally, the Ministry of Tourism states that with no. 23/2021 (ADMA: 19 21SYMV008841946 2021-06-30) contract assigned the provision of services of Personal Data Protection Officer to the company Interactive OE and submitted it with no. … Announcement to the Data Protection Authority (APD) for the appointment of the Data Protection Officer. Therefore, the Ministry of Tourism has already appointed a Data Protection Officer. On 16.07.2021 the Terms of Use and Data Protection Policy of the application www.tourism4all.gov.gr were updated with the electronic contact address of the DPO, namely: dpo@mintour.gr. The Authority, after examining all the elements of the file and after hearing the rapporteur and the assistant rapporteurs, who (assistants) left after the discussion of the case and before the conference, after a thorough discussion THOUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW 1. According to provisions of articles 51 and 55 of the General Regulation of Data Protection (EU) 2016/679 (hereinafter, GCC) and article 9 of law 4624/2019 (Government Gazette A '137), the Authority has the authority to supervise the implementation of its provisions GPA, of this law and other regulations concerning the protection of the individual from the processing of personal data. 2. According to article 4 lit. 7 of the IGC, the controller is defined as "the natural or legal person, public authority, service or other body which, individually or jointly with others, determines the purposes and manner of processing personal data; The procedure for such processing shall be laid down in Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for his appointment may be laid down in Union or Member State law. 8 is defined as the executor of the processing "the natural or legal person, public authority, service or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the controller". 203. The same article defines the breach of personal data as "breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed". 4. Pursuant to Article 5 (2) of the GIP, the controller is responsible and must be able to demonstrate compliance with the processing principles established in paragraph 1 of the same article, which include legality, objectivity and transparency of the processing according to article 5 par. 1 lit. a ’, and the confidentiality and integrity of the data in accordance with article 5 par. 1 lit. f. As a result of this provision, the FGAP has adopted a central pillar compliance model with this accountability principle, according to which the controller is required to design, implement and generally take the necessary measures and policies to ensure that data processing is consistent with the relevant legislative provisions and, in addition, must prove himself and at all times his compliance with the principles of article 5 par. 1 GKPD. 5. With regard to the principle of transparency of processing, the GCC imposes specific obligations on controllers as to the information they must provide to data subjects. In particular, in accordance with Article 12 (1) of the GPA, the controller shall take appropriate measures to provide the data subject with all information referred to, inter alia, in Article 13 - which states that "when personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller, upon receiving the personal data, provides the data subject with all the following information: a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where appropriate, the representative of the controller, b) his contact details (c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended, as well as the 21 legal bases for the processing, (…) "(see paragraph 1 of Article 13 of the GIP). Furthermore, paragraph 2 of Article 12 of the GCP provides that "the controller shall facilitate the exercise of the rights of data subjects (…)". the processor does not hire another processor without the prior special or general written permission of the controller. In the event of a general written authorization, the controller shall inform the controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of the other processors, thereby enabling the controller to object to such changes. Furthermore, paragraph 3 of the same article stipulates that the processing resulting from the processing is governed by a contract or other legal act under the law of the Union or the Member State, which binds the processor in relation to the controller and determines the object and duration of the processing. , the nature and purpose of the processing, the nature of the personal data and the categories of the data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. In addition, paragraph 4 of the same article stipulates: "When the controller hires another executor to perform specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data protection obligations provided in the contract or other legal act between the controller in accordance with paragraph 3, shall be imposed on the other executor by contract or other legal act under the law of the Union or of the Member State, in particular to provide sufficient assurances that appropriate technical and organizational measures will be Paragraph 9 of the same article clearly states that "the contract or other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be in writing, inter alia in electronic form". 227. In accordance with Article 24 (1) of the GIP, the controller, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks of different probability of occurrence and seriousness for the rights and freedoms of natural persons implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing is carried out in accordance with the GIP, and that such measures must be reviewed and updated when necessary. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 32 of the GIP, "taking into account the latest developments, implementation costs and nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, measures to ensure an appropriate level of security against risks, including, inter alia, where appropriate: . In addition, paragraph 2 provides that "in assessing the appropriate level of security, account shall be taken in particular of the risks arising from the processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access to personal data transmitted, stored or or otherwise processed ".  8. With regard to incidents of personal data breach, the GCP imposes specific obligations on those responsible for processing. In particular, Article 33 thereof stipulates that in the event of a breach of personal data, the controller shall promptly and impossibly notify the competent supervisory authority of the breach of personal data within 72 hours upon receipt of the breach of personal data, unless the breach Article 55 of the GATT on the responsibilities of the supervisory authorities responsible for this incident is the Personal Data Protection Authority 23 may endanger the rights and freedoms of natural persons. When notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by a justification for the delay. Paragraph 3 of Article 33 stipulates that such information must at least be included in such disclosure, including - inter alia - "(b) the name and contact details of the Data Protection Officer or other contact point from which more information can be obtained). (d) μέτρα the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to deal with the breach of personal data and, where appropriate, measures to mitigate any adverse effects. " In case and when it is not possible to provide the information at the same time, they can be provided gradually without undue delay. Furthermore, according to Article 34 of the GIP, when the breach of personal data may endanger the rights and freedoms of individuals, the controller shall promptly notify the breach of personal data to the data subject. This notice shall clearly describe the nature of the breach of personal data and shall contain at least the information and measures referred to in Article 33 (3) (b), (c) and (d). Notification to the data subject is not required if one of the conditions described in this paragraph is met. 9. According to article 37 par. 1 of the GCC, "the controller and the controller designate a data protection officer in each case in which: a) the processing is carried out by a public authority or body (…)". Furthermore, in par. 7 of the same article, it is mentioned that the controller or the processor publishes the contact details of the data protection officer and communicates them to the supervisory authority. 24 In addition, as mentioned above, contact details of a data protection officer must also be made available to data subjects. Regarding the role of the Data Protection Officer, it is pointed out that, inter alia, as provided for in Article 38 (4) of the ICCPR, "data subjects may …) ». 10. In this case, the Ministry of Tourism is responsible for processing, within the meaning of Article 4 (7) of the GCC, for the processing of personal data which takes place within the "tourism4all" platform, according to the above documents of the Ministry and based on the relevant information . This does not follow from the Joint Ministerial Decision No. 9022/2020 "Program" Tourism for all "year 2020" (Government Gazette B '2393). In particular, in article 1 par. 2 of K.Y.A. no. 9022 / 16.06.2020 as amended by no. 12181 / 31-07-2020 Κ.Υ.Α. (Government Gazette B '3155), it is provided that for the inclusion in the program an application is required, which is submitted by the beneficiaries in the electronic application of the Ministry of Tourism www. tourism4all.gov. r through the Single Digital Portal of Public Administration "while in article 7 par. 4 of the same JMC it is provided that" By submitting the application for participation is provided the consent to the Ministry of Tourism for the processing of the above personal data of the applicant and its beneficiary members The above data are maintained by the Ministry of Tourism for two (2) years from the issuance of the Final Register of Beneficiaries and the Final List of Excluded and in any case until the completion of the program ". Therefore, the reference to consent (which can not be used as a legal basis for the processing of personal data for the performance of a duty performed in the public interest in the exercise of public power delegated to the controller) 2511. The Ministry of Digital Governance, through the GGPSDD, is executing the elaboration for the implementation and operation of the platform, since in article 7 of the above K.Y.A. It is defined that, “for the inclusion in the Program an application is required, which is submitted by the beneficiaries in the electronic application of the Ministry of Tourism www.tourism4all.gov.gr through the Unified Digital Portal of the Public Administration. The application requires the prior authentication (verification of identity) of the beneficiaries using the credentials of the General Secretariat of Information Systems of Public Administration of the Ministry of Digital Government (taxisnet) and that "Upon electronic application through the Interoperability of the General Secretariat of Information Systems of Public Administration of the Ministry of Digital Governance internet services, in order to be pumped and provided to the Ministry of Tourism, by the information systems of A.A.D.E., of HDI. Κ.Α. SA and the Citizens' Register of the Ministry of Interior, (…) personal data of the applicant (…) ». The company THREENITAS SA, contractor company, collaborating with the Ministry of Digital Government for this processing, is also the executor of the processing (and if it has contracted with the performer of the processing, it is essentially a sub-executor, as described in article 28 par.2touGKPD). Furthermore, this conclusion also emerges from the facts, as arising from the case file, even in the initial period during which there was no contract and written assignment of the processing, the application was implemented in the manner described above. Furthermore, as it appears from the documents submitted by the controller to the Authority, EDYTE SA, a supervised body of the Ministry of Digital Governance, is also the executor of the processing. 12. With regard to the incident of data breach under consideration, it appears that immediate action was taken by the controller to investigate and deal with it. It is noted that for technical issues of processing security, it appears that the relevant responsibility lies with the processors, ie the Ministry of Digital Government regarding part 26 in particular of user authentication and THREENITAS SA. as to the implementation of the evoucher platform under the program - therefore, the action of the controller to immediately contact the Ministry of Digital Government, but also to temporarily suspend the operation of the platform, is considered appropriate. Also, the additional security measure that was implemented to deal with it, as proposed by THREENITAS SA. (ie the use of a second authentication factor) is in the right direction, although it is not related to the congenital cause of the incident - which in fact could not be determined. The issues raised in relation to this breach are as follows: Specifically, there was no contract of the Ministry of Digital Governance (processing) with THREENITAS SA. (sub-executing the processing), since it was signed in September 2020, while it does not appear that the (even general type) permission of the Ministry of Tourism, as controller, was requested for this assignment (although it appears that the controller was aware of this assignment). Furthermore, the memorandum of cooperation between the Ministry of Tourism, in charge of processing, and the Ministry of Digital Government, performing the processing, in which the role of EDYTE SA is defined, was also drawn up in September 2020, ie after it had initiate such processing and then investigate a breach incident. According to the controller, this delay is due to the urgency of starting this processing, due to the pandemic and in order to strengthen domestic tourism and support the domestic tourism market (a purpose that is clearly in the public interest).  However, the unwritten contract or other legal act, in addition to being a violation of article 28 par. 9 of the GCP, does not allow the definition of a 6 Cf. See also Guidelines 7/2020 of the European Data Protection Council on the concepts of controller and processor, which clearly state: '(…) non-written agreements (regardless of how thorough or effective they are dealing with breaches, with a clear distinction and definition of the role and responsibility of each body (both the controller and the executors). It was not possible for the perpetrators to find out the source of the incident: as it emerged from the case file, the person in charge of the process, of - further views from t the Ministry of Digital Governance, without receiving a response. About a year after the incident (ie June 2021), he requested and received a response from the contractor Threenitas, according to which there was no scope for the incident while the specific error could not be reproduced, and finally, the views of the Ministry , while also after the hearing the views of THREENITAS were requested again and received. In any case, only speculation as to the operative cause of the incident is made, which relates in particular to the possible error of ready-made software libraries used, without clearly identifying the cause. The above constitutes a breach of the fundamental conditions for the taking of appropriate organizational and technical measures for the security of processing, in accordance with Article 32 of the GIP, in conjunction with Article 24, as the controller did not take into account the risks to rights and freedoms. of natural persons to determine security measures. It should also be noted that the lack of identification of processors leads to increased risks, such as the use of subprocessors which may not meet the requirements of the GCP, or appropriate measures have not been taken for use. consideresufficient to meet the requirements laid down by Article 28 GDPR ”(available at the online link https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021- 07 / eppb\_guidelines\_202007\_controllerprocessor\_final\_en.pdf) 28 of them. Special mention is made of the use of Amazon's cloud computing services, which may mean that personal data has been transferred outside the EU. In any case, the use of this computing cloud adds another processor in the present activity for which, given that Amazon appears to be a group of companies subject to U.S. law, an analysis of legality should have been carried out and NAPincl 7, while the Ministry of Tourism, as the person in charge of processing, did not indicate that it was aware of this during the period when it received a land incident since, apart from the absence of contracts, it does not make any relevant report. B) There was no notification of this incident to the Authority as required by Article 33 of the GCP. It is noted that, according to this article, the notification is made without delay and, if possible, within 72 hours from the moment of becoming aware of the event, unless the violation of personal data may not endanger the rights and freedoms of natural persons. persons. Based on the evidence in the case file, the controller, knowing the information he had within the first 72 hours of becoming aware of it, could not consider that there could be no risk to victims, as he did not a clear picture of the source of the incident, while the incident itself, based on the knowledge of the controller, already involved disclosure of data, including health data, to third parties. Therefore, a notification should be submitted to the Authority, taking into account that, according to paragraph 4 of the same article, "in case and when it is not possible to provide the information at the same time, it can be provided gradually without undue delay". The allegations of the controller as to the fact that he did not notify the Authority because on the one hand the citizen had already informed the Authority and 7Recommendations 01/2020 on measures that supplement transfer tools to ensure compliance with the EU level of personal data protection - https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our- documents / recommendations / recommendations-012020-measures-supplement-transfer\_en 29 there is no reason for the controller to be released from the obligation to disclose under Article 33. 13. The controller had not appointed a Data Protection Officer during the period concerned by the case, in violation of Article 37 1 1 of the GIP, as his appointment was made in July ie after the lapse of three (3) years from the entry into force of the FGM, while the announcement process has started April 2021. Furthermore, despite the lack of appointment of DPO, there was inaccurate information on the website of this platform about the existence of DPO with its contact details, which - as the Authority found - were not valid. The controller states that this contact information was provided by the executor and considered that it was an email address corresponding to the executor. However, this allegation is irrelevant in relation to the question whether there is a violation of the above provision since, as the controller, he has the obligation to fully and correctly inform the data subjects, as well as the obligation to facilitate the exercise of rights (purpose for which this address could be used, according to article 38 par. 4 of the GCP). In each case, it does not appear that the controller made such an assignment to the controller (see also above for lack of written contract or other legal act). As a result, there has been a breach of the obligations of Article 13 of the GCC regarding the information provided to data subjects. 14. In view of the above, the Authority considers that there is a case to exercise its corrective powers according to article 58 par. 2 of the GCC in relation to the established infringements. 15. The Authority further considers that, based on the circumstances identified, it should be imposed, pursuant to the provision of article 58 par. 2 par. i) of the IGC, an effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative fine under Article 83 83 of the IGC both for the restoration of compliance and for the punishment of unlawful conduct. 16. Furthermore, the Authority took into account the criteria for measuring the fine set out in Article 83par. of the public sector, and the Guidelines for the implementation and setting of administrative fines for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 issued on 03-10-2017 by the Working Party of Article 29 (WP 253) 8, as well as the actual data of the case under consideration and in particular (ii) the fact that the controller was late in responding to the Authority's documents; iii) the controller does not yet have a clear picture, nor source of the breach, iv) the fact that the data subjects v) the fact that the appointment of the DPO by the controller was delayed by more than three years, while the relevant procedures, which led to the definition of the as an external company, did not move even after the original document of the Authority which pointed out this issue only after the lapse of two months from the reminder document of the Authority on 01-02-2021, resulting in, among others, the responsible significant financial benefit from the breach of its obligation, 8 See https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/611237 (last accessed: 10/9/2021) vi) the fact that the controller took immediate action to deal with the incident, vii) the fact that no previous corresponding breach has been found by the controller, viii) the fact that brought to the attention of the Authority and on the basis of which it found the above violations of the FGM, it does not appear that the controller caused material damage to the affected person as a result of the data breach, ix) The fact that the regarding the rights of the subjects is subject, in accordance with the provisions of article 83 par. 5 ed. b) GPD, in the higher foreseen category of the system of grading the administrative fines.

17. In view of the above, the Authority decides unanimously that they should be imposed on

   complainant controller referred to in the operative part

   administrative sanctions, which are considered proportionate to their severity

   infringements.

                              FOR THOSE REASONS
