## English Summary

### Facts

In a previous case, a data subject informed the Hellenic DPA (HDPA) that during the period from July to September they were getting frequent phone calls and nuisances by the representatives of a Greek bank on debt matters from a consumer loan, and filed a complaint on the grounds that this practice constitutes automated decision-making (including profiling) according to [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR").

The Hellenic DPA rejected the claim and did not apply legal remedy since there was no substantial documentation or essential proof that any processing activity through automated decision-making had taken place, or that the data subject's rights were infringed upon.

The data subject then submitted a new complaint regarding the same issue.

### Holding

The HDPA rejected this new complaint on the grounds that there was no new evidence brought forward by the claimant in this case. Moreover, the HDPA stated that the data subject could exercise their rights through the right to object under [Article 21(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#1 "Article 21 GDPR"), which should be addressed to the controller first (the Greek bank in this case). The HDPA also indicated there is a specific national legal framework ([Law 3758/2009](https://www.e-nomothesia.gr/sunegoros-tou-katanalote/n-3758-2009.html)) regulating information related to bank clients and debtors.
