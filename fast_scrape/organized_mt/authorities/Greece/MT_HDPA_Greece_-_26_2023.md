The Greek DPA held that genealogical research on a family surname did not fall within the scope of Article 15 GDPR, as _"personal data concerning \[the data subject\],"_ because the data subject requested access to the Directorate's entire database (containing other data subject's personal data), not access to data _directly_ relating to him.

## English Summary

### Facts

On 5 August 2022, the data subject filed a complaint against the Directorate of Primary Education.

The data subject wanted to conduct a genealogical investigation on his family surname. He sent an email to the Directorate of Primary Education (the controller), requesting access to their pupil registration database to search the entries of his surname therein. In addition, the data subject requested in his complaint that the Authority order the Directorate of Primary Education to allow him immediate research access to the books of the closed/abolished Primary School's curriculum, to research the surname entries in them. The controller replied that they were only able to provide him with numerical data (number of pupils per year) and not the names, as this would be an unlawful disclosure of personal data.

The Authority dismissed the complaint, holding that there was no violation of the data subject's rights and that access requests for research purposes was not within the competence of the Authority to order. In particular, the Authority considered that his request to the controller (Directorate Primary Education) did not constitute an exercise of the right of access to personal data concerning him/her under Article 15 GDPR, but a request to carry out scientific research.

On 26 October 2022, the data subject lodged an objection to the decision and a request for a review of his case, in which he alleged that his request was _"not a request to carry out scientific research, but a personal genealogical research, which is far from scientific research and the data in the requested search concern him and thus fall under Article 15 GDPR."_

### Holding

The DPA rejected the request for review. Genealogical research on a family surname did not fall within the scope of Article 15 GDPR, as _"personal data concerning \[the data subject\]."_ The data subject's request was not an access request for the purposes of Article 15 GDPR. He requested access to the Directorate's entire database (containing other data subject's personal data), not access to data _directly_ relating to him.

Protocol C/EIS/11343/26-10-2022 objection-request for a review of the case
which has the status of a request for treatment, in which he briefly alleges,

It is not a scientific inquiry.
- the data of the requested search concern him and constitute his right
to access his family's historical past, and he requests a review of the data
and requests its reconsideration.
The Authority, after examining the evidence in the file and after hearing the rapporteur
and the clarifications of the Assistant Rapporteur, who was present without the right to vote,
after a thorough discussion,
HAS CONCLUDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW

2. Because the above provisions of Article 24 of the Code establish a right

complains about the legal correctness of the filing act and reiterates

The presumption of compatibility for the processing of personal data for scientific
or historical research (as further processing of data for the purposes of
