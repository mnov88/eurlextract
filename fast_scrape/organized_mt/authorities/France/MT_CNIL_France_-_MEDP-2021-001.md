## English Summary

### Facts

Francetest.fr is a website operated by a French company (hereafter 'Francetest') for the management of antigenic testing against COVID-19. In particular, data subjects can register themselves and receive the results of their antigenic tests via this website.

On 27 August 2021, following an anonymous report, the CNIL checked for potential data security issues on the website "francetest.fr". Those checks confirmed the existence of a data breach. A few days later, on 9 September 2021, auditors fro the CNIL carried out an on-site check at Francetest to verify that the processing of personal data was carried out in accordance with the GDPR and the French law n°78-17 of 6 January 1978 implementing the GDPR (hereinafter: the Information Technology and Freedoms Act). During this audit, it was found that several security shortcomings persisted, despite Francetest having already taken several measures after becoming aware of the data breach. These deficiencies were posing a risk to the confidentiality of the personal data processed via the website.

By a decision dated 4 October 2021 (the Decision), the President of the CNIL delivered an injunction against Francetest to put an end to the data breach within two months, in application of Article 32 GDPR and Article 20 of the Information Technology and Freedoms Act.

Subsequently, pursuant to Article 20, last paragraph of the Information Technology and Freedoms Act, a commission was convened by the President of the CNIL on 11 October 2021 to rule on the publication of the decision (hereinafter, the Commission).

### Holding

The Commission considered that the publication of the Decision was justified in view of the sensitivity of the data processed (i.e. health data) and the need to ensure that all persons involved in the processing operations concerned, including the organisations using the services, would be fully informed of the existence of persistent data breaches.

The Commission emphasised that, in addition to the results of antigenic tests taken by data subjects, Francetest was also processing large amount of other personal data which enable to directly identify the data subjects, including social security numbers.

The Commission also emphasised that the publication of the Decision was also justified based on the need to alert all actors in the healthcare sector, including other controllers or processors that may be offering or using similar services, on the importance to remain vigilant in ensuring the security of personal data.

Finally, the Commission found that the publication of the Decision is also in line with the CNIL's priorities listed in its 2021 audit strategy. Consequently, the Commission decided to publish on its website the Decision, as well as the deliberations of the Commission reaching that conclusion.
