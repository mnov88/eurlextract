## English Summary

### Facts

In June 2022, DPP Law Ltd (controller) suffered a cyber-attack.

Threat actors were able to obtain administrator status on a legacy case management system and extract 32GB worth of data. The data was comprised of Court documents, PDFs, photos and videos relating to their clients, some of which related to sexual offences and child sexual abuse material. In July 2022, the National Crime Agency (NCA) informed the controller that some of their data was published on the dark web.

43 days after the incident, the controller reported the breach to the ICO (UK DPA).

### Holding

The DPA found that the controller infringed the integrity and confidentiality principle in Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR & the obligation to implement appropriate technical and security measures under Article 32(1) UK GDPR.

The DPA’s investigation identified critical failings in the controller’s network security which allowed the cyber-attack. The account through which the threat actors gained access, sqluser, was over-privileged and allowed full access to the controller’s network. This account was not needed by the controller on a day-to-day basis and should have been identified as a risk in an audit. The legacy case management system in use was also shown to have been outdated as support for the system had also ended in 2019.

The DPA also found that the controller infringed the obligation to report a personal data breach to the DPA withing 72 hours under [Article 33(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR#1 "Article 33 GDPR").

The DPA was critical of the fact that the controller’s notification came 43 days after the breach and after the communication from the NCA. The DPA accepted that the controller focused their efforts on getting their systems working again, but noted that the risks posed to data subjects were not properly assessed and addressed at the time of the breach.

In assessing the amount of the fine to impose, the DPA was influenced by the sensitivity of the personal data in question, the extent of the controller’s negligence, and the need for a dissuasive penalty. A fine of £60,000 (€69,781) was imposed on the controller.

                                  14 April 2025For Public Release

                       DATA PROTECTION ACT 2018

   ENFORCEMENT POWERS OF THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER

                              PENALTY NOTICE

To:   DPP Law Ltd

Of:   Pinnacle House,

      Stanley Road,

      Bootle L20 7JF

 I.   INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

1.    Pursuant to section 155(1) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA”), the

      Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), by this written notice

      (“Penalty Notice”) requires DPP Law Ltd (“DPP”) to pay the

      Commissioner £60,000.

2.    This Penalty Notice is given in respect of infringements of the UK General
                                                 1
      Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”). It contains the reasons why

      the Commissioner has decided to impose a penalty, including the

      circumstances of the infringements and the nature of the personal data

      involved.

1Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, as it forms
part of the law of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland by virtue of section 3 of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018.
For the period 25 May 2018 to 31 December 2020, references in this Penalty Notice to the UK GDPR should be read
as references to the GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016
on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such
data) as it applied in the UK during that period.

                                      2For Public Release

3.    On 11 December 2024, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Schedule 16

      to the DPA, the Commissioner issued DPP with a Notice of Intent which

      set out the Commissioner’s reasons for proposing to issue a penalty

      notice. In that notice, the Commissioner indicated that the amount of

      the penalty he proposed to impose was £60,000.

4.    On 29 January 2025, DPP provided written representations about the

      Commissioner’s Notice of Intent to issue a penalty notice. In reaching
      the decision to issue this Penalty Notice, the Commissioner has taken full

      account of DPP’s representations and, where appropriate, the Penalty

      Notice makes specific reference to them.

5.    The Commissioner finds that DPP has infringed Articles 5(1)(f), 32(1),

      32(2) and 33(1) UK GDPR for the reasons set out in this Penalty Notice.

      In summary:

           a) The infringements of Articles 5(1)(f), 32(1), 32(2) and 33(1) UK
              GDPR relate to DPP’s provision of legal services to its clients (the

              “Relevant Processing”). In particular, the processing of

              personal data relating to DPP’s clients and experts instructed to

              give evidence in legal proceedings to which DPP’s clients were a

              party.

           b) The infringements of Articles 5(1)(f), 32(1) and 32(2) UK GDPR
              occurred because the Relevant Processing was not carried out in

              a manner that ensured appropriate security of the personal data

              of DPP’s clients and experts, including protection against

              unauthorised processing, and using appropriate technical and

              organisational measures as required by Articles 5(1)(f), 32(1)
              and 32(2) UK GDPR. In particular, DPP failed to adopt the

              principle of least privilege and failed to regularly audit

              administrative accounts on its network.

                                      3For Public Release

           c) As a consequence of DPP not having appropriate security
              measures in place as required by Articles 5(1)(f), 32(1) and

              32(2) UK GDPR, the personal data of 791 individuals (clients and

              experts) were exfiltrated by a threat actor and posted on the

              dark web (the “Cyber Incident”).

           d) The infringement of Article 33(1) UK GDPR occurred because DPP

              did not notify the Commissioner without undue delay or within

              72 hours of becoming aware of the personal data breach (i.e.

              that there was a loss of access to the personal data it was

              processing and this was likely to result in a risk to data subjects).
              By focusing its efforts on bringing its systems back online and

              neglecting to undertake an assessment of the risks posed to data

              subjects, DPP did not notify the Commissioner until 43 days after

              the Cyber Incident. Furthermore, DPP demonstrated a lack of

              understanding of its obligation to notify the Commissioner of a
                                                                             2
              personal data breach in accordance with Article 33 UK GDPR.

6.    This Penalty Notice is issued in respect of the infringements on the basis

      that, in all the circumstances, and having regard to the matters listed in

      Articles 83(1) and 83(2) UK GDPR, a financial penalty in the sum of
      £60,000 is an effective, proportionate and dissuasive measure.

II.   RELEVANT LEGAL FRAMEWORK

7.    Section 155(1) DPA provides that, if the Commissioner is satisfied that

      a person has failed, or is failing, as described in section 149(2) DPA, the

      Commissioner may, by written penalty notice, require the person to pay

      to the Commissioner an amount in sterling specified in the penalty

      notice.

8.    The types of failure described in section 149(2) DPA include, at section

      149(2)(a), “where a controller or processor has failed, or is failing, to

      comply with… a provision of Chapter II of the UK GDPR… (principles of

      processing)” and at section 149(2)(c), “where a controller or processor

      has failed, or is failing, to comply with… a provision of Articles 25 to 39
      of the UK GDPR… (obligations of controllers and processors).”

9.    Chapter II UK GDPR sets out the principles relating to the processing of

      personal data that controllers must comply with. Article 5(1) UK GDPR

      lists these principles and includes the requirement at Article 5(1)(f) UK

      GDPR that “personal data shall be… processed in a manner that ensures

      appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
      unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss,

      destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational

      measures”. This is referred to in the UK GDPR as the “integrity and

      confidentiality” principle.

10.   Article 32 UK GDPR (security of processing) materially provides:

          “(1) Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of

          implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of

          processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for
          the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the

          processor    shall   implement      appropriate    technical    and

          organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate

          to the risk…

          (2) In assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be

          taken in particular of the risks that are presented by processing,

          in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
          alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data

          transmitted, stored or otherwise processed”.

                                       5 For Public Release

 11.   Article 33(1) UK GDPR (notification of a personal data breach) provides:

           “In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without
           undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after

           having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the

           Commissioner, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result

           in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the

           notification under this paragraph is not made within 72 hours, it

           shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay”.

 12.   Article 4(1) UK GDPR defines a personal data breach as:

           “a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful

           destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access

           to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed”.

 13.   The legal framework for setting penalties is set out in Section V: ‘Decision

       to impose a penalty’ below.

III.   BACKGROUND TO THE INFRINGEMENTS

 14.   This section summarises the relevant background to the findings of

       infringement. It does not seek to provide an exhaustive account of all
       the details of the events that have led to the issue of this Penalty Notice.

A.   Cyber Incident

16.   On 4 June 2022 at approximately 11:30, DPP’s email server stopped

      working and staff had no access to DPP’s IT network. DPP’s in-house IT

      manager established that all files across its servers had been corrupted.  5

      DPP’s external IT supplier believed that DPP had suffered a ransomware

                                                                6
      incident, despite not receiving any payment demands.

17.   The timeline of events leading up to (and following) the Cyber Incident

      was as follows:

      19 February 2022

18.   DPP told the Commissioner that, following an analysis of log files by a

      third party consulting firm, there was evidence to suggest brute force
                                                                7
      attempts on its network as early as 19 February 2022. This occurred a

      further 12 times and there were in total 400 attempts to gain access to

      the   network. 8  The   brute   force  incidents   were   targeted   at   an

      administrator account for a legacy case management system (see

      further points on ‘sqluser’ below at paragraph 25 to 28) which was only

      available online sporadically.9

      3 June 2022

19.   An administrator account, sqluser, authenticated onto

                                     .0 It is considered likely that an end-user

      laptop was compromised by the threat actor and subsequently

      authenticated onto the network. It was this compromise that allowed the
                                      11
      threat actor to access sqluser.   Following this login, there are indicators

       that Cobalt Strike was deployed onto the network and the threat actor

       began running PowerShell commands.         12At the time of the incident DPP

       had multi-factor authentication (“MFA”) for the purposes of connecting

                                  13
       to its network via a VPN.     However, the administrator account, sqluser,
                                                                          14
       did not have MFA due to its role as a service-based account.

       4 June 2022

20.    DPP’s email server stopped working but incoming emails remained

       available through its firewall. 15,16In the early hours, logs show Windows

       Defender being disabled on                   and a Virtual Machine backup

       service stopping on                         .7 Forensic investigators believe

                                                                18
       at this point the threat actor deployed ransomware.

21.    During the incident MegaSync and Rclone software were installed on

                   .19 The threat actor utilised tools to perform the exfiltration

       of data from the network. Towards the end of the incident the threat

       actor utilised the administrator account, sqluser, to download and run an

       anti-virus which acted as a form of clean-up for the incident (and thus

       making the incident response investigation more difficult).      20

       5 June 2022 to 12 June 2022

22.    DPP reviewed firewall and server logs and it assessed that no data had

                         21
       been exfiltrated.    At the time of the Cyber Incident, DPP's firewall logs

       did not record egress data flows, it would therefore not have been

       possible for DPP to ascertain if data had in fact been exfiltrated. DPP

       established that data was recoverable by off-site backups within 24

      hours. However, DPP’s systems were not operating properly for around

      one week leaving it unable to access the personal data it was processing.

      Whilst DPP staff did not have access to DPP’s case management software

      for eight days, DPP told the Commissioner that staff retained the ability

      to access, and respond to, incoming emails with no impact on client

      cases.22

      15 July 2022

23.   The National Crime Agency (“NCA”) contacted DPP to advise them that

      three folders of DPP’s data, totalling 32.4Gb, had been published on the

      dark web. This included court bundles, PDFs, Word documents, photos

      and video (including police body cam footage) relating to DPP’s clients

      and experts instructed to give evidence in legal proceedings to which

      DPP’s clients were a party.

      17 July 2022

24.   43 days after the Cyber Incident, DPP reported the personal data breach

      to the Commissioner. DPP were unaware that the loss of access to

      personal data constituted a personal data breach and therefore that they

      were required to notify the Commissioner about the Cyber Incident.

B.   Sqluser account

25.   Sqluser was an administrator account for a legacy case management

      system. The account was setup by FWBS Ltd (subsequently acquired by

      Thomson     Reuters)   in  2001    for  the   purposes   of   automating
                                              23
      communication between DPP’s servers.       Despite having a limited role

      on the network, it had full administrator rights (i.e. unrestricted access)
                             24
      across DPP’s network.    DPP were aware of the sqluser account as far

                     25
      back as 2011.    DPP told the Commissioner that previous attempts to

      change the password had blocked access to the legacy case management
              26                                                         27
      system.    DPP did not know the password and could not reset it.     The

      password was only known by FWBS Ltd/Thomson Reuters.

26.   DPP stated that they did not conduct a risk assessment to understand

      the risks associated with the sqluser account because FWBS Ltd told

      them that the sqluser account was “critical to the data replication of the

      servers” and because DPP was “reliant on our suppliers for the correct
                                                 28
      functioning and protection of our system”.

27.   The legacy case management system was taken out of service on 30

      April 2019 as DPP changed case management systems to DPS Software

      Ltd.29DPP’s service agreement for the sqluser account later came to an

      end in 2021. However, due to DPP’s data retention policy of six years,

      this system was still operational as DPP needed to access data in the

              30
      system.    DPP stated that its retention policy was in accordance with

      guidance issued by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA).

28.   The threat actor used sqluser to authenticate onto             , a remote

      desktop machine that facilitated access to the legacy case management

      system (as outlined above in paragraph 19). By compromising the

      sqluser account the threat actor was able to perform lateral movement

      across DPP’s network.

      affected data subjects, in line with its obligations under Article 34 UK

      GDPR.

IV.   THE COMMISSIONER’S FINDINGS OF INFRINGEMENT

A. Controllership and jurisdiction

                                                                        34
32.   DPP was the controller in respect of the Relevant Processing.        DPP

      determined the purpose and means within the meaning of Article 4(7)

      UK GDPR.

33.   The UK GDPR applied to the Relevant Processing by virtue of Articles

      2(1) and 3(1) UK GDPR. The Relevant Processing was structured

      processing of personal data, it took place in the context of the activities

      of a controller established in the UK, and none of the exceptions in Article

      2 UK GDPR applied.

34.   Part 2 of the DPA applied to the Relevant Processing by virtue of section

      4 DPA.

B. Nature of the personal data and context of the Relevant Processing

34The processing of personal data of DPP’s clients and experts that took place in DPP’s provision of legal services to
clients.

                                       11For Public Release

35.   DPP processes personal data in order to provide legal services to its

      clients. This includes personal data relating to its clients and ongoing
      court cases. As a law firm that specialises in criminal defence (including

      sexual offences), family law and actions against the police, DPP

      processes highly sensitive personal data, including special category data

      (e.g. data concerning a natural person’s sex life), DNA data, legally

      privileged information and allegations of criminal offences (including

      child sexual abuse).

36.   This information is likely to reveal private details about individuals,

      including the offences of which they are accused and DPP’s confidential

      legal advice. As a law firm, DPP has responsibilities to its clients both as

      a data controller and as a law firm to protect the personal data that it

      processes, particularly that which is protected by legal privilege.

37.   Several categories of DPP’s clients are vulnerable, including children and

      victims of sexual offences. Recital 38 of UK GDPR explains that children

      merit specific protection with regard to their personal data.

C. The infringements: Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 UK GDPR

38.   The fact that the Cyber Incident took place is not, in and of itself,

      sufficient to make a finding that DPP has infringed Articles 5(1)(f) and
                   35
      32 UK GDPR.     The Commissioner has considered whether the facts set
      out at paragraphs 16 to 31 above constitute infringements of the UK

      GDPR.

39.   In order to assess DPP’s compliance with Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 UK
      GDPR, the Commissioner must necessarily exercise his judgement, as a

      regulator, as to what “appropriate” security and “appropriate” technical

      and organisational measures would be in the circumstances (that is,

35
  See the CJEU’s recent judgment in VB v Natsionalna agentsia za prihodite (Case C-340/21) at paragraphs 22-39,
which the Commissioner has had regard to.

                                      12For Public Release

      taking into account “the state of the art, the costs of implementation and

      the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk

      of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural

      persons”).

40.   For the reasons set out below, the Commissioner’s view is that DPP has

      infringed Articles 5(1)(f), 32(1) and 32(2) UK GDPR. The infringements
      involved DPP’s failure to use appropriate technical and organisational

      measures to ensure appropriate security of the personal data subject to

      the Relevant Processing.

Appropriate security of the personal data

41.   In assessing the “appropriate security of the personal data” under Article

      5(1)(f) UK GDPR (and, equivalently, the “level of security appropriate to

      the risk” under Article 32 UK GDPR), the Commissioner has considered
      the risk to the rights and freedoms of DPP’s clients and experts which

      the Relevant Processing presented. Recital 75 UK GDPR states that such

      risk “may result from personal data processing which could lead to

      physical, material or non-material damage”.

42.   As explained in paragraphs 35 to 37, DPP processes highly sensitive

      personal data relating to its clients. The disclosure of this personal data
      to the public is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms

      of DPP’s clients, in particular:

           a) It risked jeopardising ongoing criminal proceedings in that details

              of privileged legal communications between DPP and its clients

              may now be in the hands of malicious actors.

           b) It  risked  identifying  DPP’s  crime   clients  under   criminal

              investigation, but who had not been charged, in circumstances

                                      13For Public Release

               where they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of

               that investigation.36

           c) DPP’s instructions included identities of victims and witnesses of

               crime. It therefore risked enabling the identification of individuals

               afforded statutory protection through the legal process. For

               example:

                  i. victims of sexual offences; 37

                 ii. child victims and witnesses of crime.  38

           d) The highly sensitive nature of the personal data processed by

               DPP may leave its clients susceptible to bad actors exploiting that

               information for their own nefarious purposes.

43.   The Commissioner considers all three categories of damage as identified

      in Recital 75 UK GDPR (physical, material and non-material) would be

      likely to flow from the risks identified at paragraph 42 above.

44.   Recital 75 provides certain examples of damage. Of those examples, the

      Commissioner considers the following examples of damage were

      reasonably foreseeable from the Cyber Incident given the categories of

      personal data processed by DPP (see paragraph 35) and the risks

      identified at paragraph 42 above:

           a) Loss of control over personal data.

           b) Deprivation of rights and freedoms (right to life, right to respect

               for private and family life, peaceful enjoyment of property).

           c) Loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional

               secrecy.

           d) Financial loss.

                                         14For Public Release

           e) Damage to reputation.

45.   Paragraphs 85 to 91 below set out the types of damage which

      materialised as a result of the Cyber Incident.

46.   In ensuring a level of security appropriate to the risk, Article 32(1) UK

      GDPR requires a controller to take into account the likelihood and
      severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

47.   Regarding the likelihood of the risk, DPP should have been aware that
      any unauthorised access to confidential information relating to ongoing

      criminal cases was likely to jeopardise such cases, including heightening

      reputational risks and risking the identification of individuals afforded

      protection (e.g. victims of sexual assault).

48.   The factors above indicate that a high level of security was appropriate

      to the risk presented by the Relevant Processing. DPP was required to

      implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure

      this high level of security.

49.   The Commissioner notes that guidance is widely available to assist

      organisations (such as DPP) to make decisions on the implementation of

      appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the secure
      processing of personal data. For example:

                                                                 39
           a) The  Commissioner’s    guidance   on ransomware        relevantly
              provides:

                 i. “The security of privileged accounts should be a high
                   priority for you. Basic account hygiene can support you in

                   protecting these accounts, such as:

                        •  regular reviews of permissions;

                         •  following the principle of least privilege;

                         •  risk assessments of membership into privileged

                            groups; and

                         •  senior    level   approval    of   privileged   group

                            membership.”

                 ii. Organisations should “regularly audit… user accounts to

                    ensure they are still required and contain the appropriate
                                40
                    privileges”.

           b) The National Cyber Security Centre’s (NCSC) guidance on
                                             41
              protecting bulk personal data     provides:

                 i. User access and privilege | "User access to data is

                    limited to the minimum necessary".

                 ii. Administrator access | "The list of system administrators

                    with access has been reviewed within the last 12 months".

                iii. All external dependencies | "You understand which of

                    your suppliers would have the ability to compromise your

                    data".

           c) The   NIST    SP   800-53    security   framework    outlines   that

              organisations should “employ the principle of least privilege,

              allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting

              on behalf of users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned
                                     42
              organizational tasks”.    This is a well-established rule within IT

              security which significantly reduces the chance a threat actor can

              perform lateral movement across a network. Sqluser was only

              required on a single server and system, yet it had privileges

              which afforded it access to the full suite of network devices within

              the DPP infrastructure.

Assessment of compliance

50.   Under the UK GDPR, it is for DPP to demonstrate compliance with Article
      5(1)(f) (by virtue of Article 5(2)). It is also for DPP to demonstrate

      compliance with Article 32(1) and (2) (by virtue of Article 24).

51.   The Commissioner finds that whilst DPP attempted to secure the external

      perimeter of the network there were critical failings in the provisioning
      and management of the sqluser account. These included:

           a) Sqluser was an over privileged account, the compromise of which
                                                                     43
              enabled the threat actor full access to DPP’s network.

           b) It was not necessary for DPP to access the sqluser account on a

              day-to-day basis, particularly following:

                 i. the migration of its case management system from sqluser

                    in April 2019; and

                ii. the closure of the maintenance support window for sqluser

                    in 2021.

           c) Whilst DPP was aware of sqluser, it did not undertake a risk
              assessment. DPP explained to the Commissioner that this was

              because it viewed sqluser as a supplier account which it did not

              consider it had any need to risk assess.44

52.   DPP failed to have in place measures to audit all accounts on DPP’s

      servers and to limit the privileges associated with these accounts or

43
44DPP response to ICO dated 8 February 2024, 7.

                                       17For Public Release

      disable them where they were not necessary. DPP’s failure to implement

      these measures constituted a failure to implement appropriate technical

      and organisational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security

      over the personal data it was processing.

53.   The Commissioner also finds that DPP failed to ensure the ongoing

      confidentiality of its systems, as required by Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR.

54.   DPP failed to perform any kind of asset management or suitable

      alternative measure, which should have been audited and risk assessed

      periodically in accordance with the Commissioner’s Accountability
                  45
      Framework.

55.   Upon carrying out an asset management audit, DPP would have

      discovered that sqluser had a narrow scope of duties and was only

      required on a single server and system but that it had privileges that

      afforded it access to the full suite of network devices within the DPP

      network.

56.   DPP should have carried out a risk assessment based on the excessive

      privileges granted to sqluser. Following this risk assessment, DPP should

      have given the sqluser account the minimal set of privileges that it

      required to perform its function.

57.   In its written representations, DPP highlighted the unsophisticated

      nature of its internal IT function. DPP noted that tasks routinely

      undertaken by its internal IT team only required qualifications such as

      “IT studies at college” or a “government apprenticeship scheme with the
                                           46
      aim of becoming Microsoft certified”.  As such, DPP did not have its own

      technical  resources   and was “totally    reliant”  on third   party IT
                  47
      contractors.

58.   DPP itself should have had full visibility of the sqluser account (including

      the password). Furthermore, at the end of the service agreement for the

      sqluser account, it would have been reasonable for DPP to have

      convened a meeting with its service provider to understand the

      implications of operating the out-of-support account on its network.

      Support for the legacy case management system ceased on 30 April
      2019.

59.   It appears to the Commissioner that there were alternative ways in which

      DPP could have mitigated the risks associated with its continued
      operation of the sqluser account:

           a) DPP could have suspended sqluser or limited how and when

              sqluser was used. Particularly given support for the legacy case
              management system ceased on 30 April 2019.     48

           b) DPP could have assigned sqluser fewer privileges and kept those
              privileges under tight control according to the principle of least

              privilege.

           c) DPP should have had full visibility of the sqluser account at the
              end of the service agreement enabling it to assess the risks

              presented by the continued operation of the account (as noted

              at paragraph 58 above) and consider appropriate mitigating

              measures.

           d) As demonstrated in the steps taken by DPP after the Cyber

              Incident (see paragraphs 29 to 30 above), there were alternative

              means of operating the sqluser account which were available to

              DPP. The Commissioner has not been provided with any evidence

              to suggest DPP considered these (or other) alternative means of

              operating sqluser between the end of the service agreement and

              the Cyber Incident.

60.   The assessment of risks presented by the continued use of the sqluser

      account   following  the  end   of the   service  agreement,   and   the

      implementation of alternative means of continuing to operate the

      account, would have, in high likelihood, prevented the Cyber Incident

      from occurring.

61.   In its written representations, DPP told the Commissioner that it had

      worked alongside its suppliers to ensure it was fully compliant with Lexcel

      standards (to which     it  was accredited).  49 Lexcel   is a practice

      management and client care standard introduced by the Law Society of

      England and Wales. The Commissioner notes that the Lexcel self-

      assessment checklist 50 for accreditation states “Practices… should be
                                             51
      accredited against Cyber Essentials”.     DPP’s written representations

      confirmed that, at the time of the cyber incident, DPP did not have Cyber

      Essentials accreditation, although it was working towards accreditation.
                                                                       52
      The Commissioner understands that this has now been obtained.

62.   The Commissioner finds that DPP failed to implement appropriate

      technical and security measures to ensure the security of personal data

      it was processing on the sqluser account. DPP’s isolation of the legacy

      case management system following the Cyber Incident demonstrated

      that alternative methods to secure its IT environment were available.

63.   The Commissioner finds that the DPP’s failure to audit and adequately

      manage the accounts on its servers (including password administration

      and access privileges) constituted a failure to implement appropriate

      technical and organisational measures to ensure appropriate security.

      For this reason, the Commissioner finds that DPP has infringed Articles

      5(1)(f), 32(1) and 32(2) UK GDPR.

D. The infringements: Article 33(1) UK GDPR

64.   Controllers must notify the Commissioner within 72 hours of becoming

      aware of a personal data breach unless it is unlikely to result in a risk to

      the rights and freedoms of natural persons. The Commissioner considers

      that the Cyber Incident constituted a personal data breach about which

      DPP should have notified the Commissioner.

65.   A personal data breach includes the “loss of availability of personal

      data”.53

66.   As set out in paragraphs 16 and 20, when the Cyber Incident occurred

      DPP’s email server stopped working and staff no longer had access to

      the personal data on its IT network. Given that DPP processes personal

      data relating to ongoing court cases including confidential information,

      which is subject to legal professional privilege, the loss of availability of

      that personal data, even for a few days, was likely to result in a risk to
      the rights and freedoms of its clients.4

67.   DPP did not notify the Commissioner within 72 hours of becoming aware

      that the Cyber Incident had caused a notifiable personal data breach. It

      took DPP 43 days to notify the Commissioner about the breach, and it

      only made a notification after being contacted by the NCA regarding the

      exfiltration of personal data from its network (see paragraph 23 and 24).

manner, result in physical, material or non-material damage to natural persons such as… the loss of confidentiality of
personal data protected by professional secrecy”.

                                      21For Public Release

68.   DPP told the Commissioner that its efforts had been initially focused on

      bringing its systems back online, and it did not believe that, in the

      absence of any evidence of third party access to personal data, it had an

      obligation to notify the Commissioner.55

69.   It was the responsibility of DPP to assess the Cyber Incident and

      determine whether it met the threshold for notification to the

      Commissioner    as  required   by  Article  33(1)   UK  GDPR.    In  the

      circumstances, DPP was required to notify the Commissioner within 72

      hours of becoming aware of the personal data breach. If DPP did not

      have all the required information for the notification, it should have made

      an initial notification and provided a further update once more

      information became available (as stated in Article 33(4) UK GDPR and

      the Commissioner’s guidance).   56 In its written representations, DPP

      accepted that, in hindsight, it “should have made the notification at the

      time of the incident”.7

70.   The Commissioner finds that:

           a) DPP focused its efforts on bringing its systems back online after

              the Cyber Incident.

           b) In so doing, DPP neglected to undertake an assessment of the

              risks likely to be caused to data subjects resulting from their

              personal data becoming unavailable.

           c) Consequently, DPP only notified the Commissioner of the

              personal data breach 43 days after the Cyber Incident that had

              caused a personal data breach.

                                      22For Public Release

          d) The delay in DPP’s notification to the Commissioner was

             compounded by DPP’s lack of understanding of the circumstances

             in which it was required to make a notification to the

             Commissioner under Article 33 UK GDPR.

71.   The Commissioner therefore finds DPP to have infringed Article 33(1) UK

      GDPR.

 V.    DECISION TO IMPOSE A PENALTY

72.   For the reasons set out below, the Commissioner has decided to impose
      a penalty on DPP in respect of the infringements of Article 5(1)(f), 32(1),

      32(2) and 33(1) UK GDPR.

A.   Legal Framework – penalties

73.   When deciding whether to issue a penalty notice to a person and

      determining the appropriate amount of that penalty, section 155(2)(a)

      DPA requires the Commissioner to have regard to the matters listed in

      Article 83(1) and (2) UK GDPR, so far as they are relevant in the
      circumstances of the case.

74.   Article 83(1) UK GDPR requires any monetary penalty imposed by the

      Commissioner to be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive in each

      individual case.

75.   Article 83(2) UK GDPR requires the Commissioner to have due regard to

      the following factors when determining whether to issue a penalty notice

      and the appropriate amount of any such penalty in each individual case:

         “(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement taking

         into account the nature scope or purpose of the processing
         concerned as well as the number of data subjects affected and the

         level of damage suffered by them;

                                     23For Public Release

          (b) the intentional or negligent character of the infringement;

          (c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the
          damage suffered by data subjects;

          (d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor

          taking into account technical and organisational measures

          implemented by them pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;

          (e) any relevant previous infringements by the controller or

          processor;

          (f) the degree of cooperation with the Commissioner, in order to

          remedy the infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects

          of the infringement;

          (g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

          (h) the manner in which the infringement became known to the

          Commissioner, in particular whether, and if so to what extent, the
          controller or processor notified the infringement;

          (i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously

          been ordered against the controller or processor concerned with

          regard to the same subject-matter, compliance with those

          measures;

          (j) adherence to approved codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40

          or approved certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42; and

          (k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the

          circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits gained, or
          losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the infringement”.

                                      24For Public Release

B.   The Commissioner’s decision on whether to impose a penalty

76.   Paragraphs 78 to 134 below set out the Commissioner’s assessment of

      whether it is appropriate to issue a penalty in relation to the

      infringements set out above. That assessment involves consideration of

      the factors in Articles 83(1) and 83(2) UK GDPR. The order in which

      these considerations are set out below follows the Commissioner’s Data

      Protection Fining Guidance, (the “Fining Guidance”):     58

           a) Seriousness of the infringements (Article 83(2)(a), (b) and (g))

           b) Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors (Article 83(2)(c)-(f),

              (h)-(k))

           c) Effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness (Article 83(1))

77.   The Commissioner has not conducted a separate assessment for each

      infringement. As explained further below (paragraphs 136 to 138), the

      Commissioner considers the four infringements relate to the Relevant

      Processing. An assessment of whether it is appropriate to issue a penalty
                                                                         59
      has been taken in relation to the four infringements collectively.

Seriousness of the infringements: Article 83(2)(a) the nature, gravity and

duration of the infringements

78.   In assessing the seriousness of the infringements, the Commissioner has

      given due regard to their nature, gravity and duration.

Nature of the infringements

evidently distinct provisions of the UK GDPR. Had he calculated penalties for infringements of these provisions
separately, the Commissioner would have had to ensure, in accordance with Article 83(3) UK GDPR, that the total
penalty did not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement (that of Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR). However,
in this Penalty Notice, the Commissioner has simply calculated a single penalty ensuring that the amount does not
exceed the maximum amount specified for the infringement of Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR.

                                       25For Public Release

79.   Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR (integrity and confidentiality) is a basic principle

      for processing. An infringement of this provision is subject to the higher

      maximum fine,  60 reflecting its seriousness. Meanwhile, infringements of

      Articles 32(1), 32(2) and 33(1) UK GDPR are subject to the standard

      maximum amount.     61

Gravity of the infringements

80.   In assessing the gravity of the infringements, the Commissioner has

      considered the nature, scope and purpose of the Relevant Processing, as

      well as the number of data subjects affected by the Relevant Processing

      and the level of damage they have suffered.  62

81.   Nature | The nature of the Relevant Processing concerned DPP’s delivery

      of legal services and advice to clients (including the instruction of

      experts, where required). In the absence of appropriate security

      measures, the nature of the processing was likely to result in a high risk

      to the data subjects if unauthorised access and processing took place (as

      discussed in paragraphs 41 to 49). Some of the data subjects were

      vulnerable, including children and victims of sexual offences. The

      personal data impacted included sensitive personal data. It also included

      information relating to ongoing court cases, including DNA data, legally

      privileged information and police body-cam footage. In line with the

      Fining Guidance, the Commissioner gives more weight to this factor

      where the processing involves children’s personal data and personal data

      of other vulnerable people, which is the case here. Recital 38 UK GDPR

      explains that children merit specific protection with regard to their

      personal data.

                                       26For Public Release

82.   Scope | The Commissioner notes that the territorial scope of the
      Relevant Processing extended to clients and experts from across England

      and Wales.

83.   Purpose | The purpose of the Relevant Processing was to provide legal

      advice in both criminal and civil proceedings, which has the possibility of

      significantly affecting people’s rights and freedoms. The Commissioner

      considers this to increase the gravity of the infringements.

84.   Number of data subjects and level of damage suffered | The

      number of data subjects affected by the infringements carries significant

      weight. The Cyber Incident affected 791 data subjects in total. This

      included: 306 crime clients, 225 family clients, 14 matrimonial clients,
                                                                       63
      137 actions against the police clients and 109 expert witnesses.   791 is
      not an insignificant number considering the sensitivity of the personal

      data involved. This included highly sensitive information relating to court

      proceedings and DPP’s legal advice to its clients. The Commissioner has

      also had regard to complaints received (discussed in paragraphs 86 to

      86.b) below).

85.   In relation to the level of damage suffered by affected data subjects, the

      Fining Guidance states:

          "The Commissioner’s assessment of the level of damage suffered

          by data subjects will be limited to what is necessary to evaluate

          the seriousness of the infringement. Typically, it would not involve

          quantifying the harm, either in aggregate or suffered by specific
          people. It is also without prejudice to any decisions a UK court

          may make about awarding compensation for damage suffered”.

86.   In assessing the level of damage suffered as a result of the

      infringements, regard has been given to both potential and actual

                                      27For Public Release

      damage suffered by data subjects as a result of the Cyber Incident.

      Complaints lodged by data subjects under Article 77 UK GDPR can assist

      with the assessment of the level of damage. Two complaints were made

      to the Commissioner:

           a) The first complaint related to an individual who was accused of

              sexually assaulting a child. The police wrote to this individual
              explaining that following the Cyber Incident details of the

              allegation were published online. As outlined in paragraph 42,

              this individual had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation

              to the police investigation. In the complaint to the ICO, the

              complainant described his reaction: “I'm now a prisoner in my

              own home again. In fear of my life. My family's also”. The
              individual further explains: “I'm seriously worried again and I

              don't think I can cope. It's dredged everything back up. I haven't

              been allowed to see my children… because of these allegations

              and it's very nearly ended me. I can't do this again, I'm just

              trying to live my life while fighting a losing battle with social
              services. It's a nightmare”.

           b) The second complaint related to an individual who was informed

              by the police that their personal data was now online following

              the Cyber Incident. The information disclosed related to a closed

              criminal investigation in which the complainant was a suspect.

              Again, this individual had a reasonable expectation of privacy in

              relation to the police investigation. The complainant requested
              compensation to increase security at his home. This individual

              also complained to DPP directly.

87.   DPP received five potential claims for professional negligence related to

      the Cyber Incident. However, two of these came from individuals whose

      data had not in fact been exfiltrated in the Cyber Incident. The remaining

      three individuals cited in their claims that they suffered distress (as well

                                      28For Public Release

      as shock, anxiety, worry and lack of sleep), loss of control (and

      autonomy) of their personal data and the possibility of fraud. One of

      these individuals is a vulnerable individual as per his GP records.

88.   The Commissioner considers that, in particular, three types of (non-

      material) damage (actual or foreseeable) arose from the infringements.

      These are:

           a) Loss of control of personal data | The loss of control of

              personal data is evident from DPP’s loss of access to its network

              and the exfiltration of personal data from its network.

           b) Loss of human dignity | Loss of human dignity is evident from

              the nature of the personal data affected. For example, the data

              relating to victims of crime, special category data relating to an

              individual’s sex life and bodycam footage of individuals during

              their interactions with police.

           c) Psychological harms (distress, shock, anxiety, worry and lack

              of sleep, anxiety and embarrassment from sensitive details

              regarding allegations made public; reputational loss; loss of

              confidence in the legal profession) | The psychological harm is

              adequately demonstrated by the personal account of the

              complainant (cited at paragraph 86.a) above).

89.   The release of personal data of the type in this case on the dark web is

      likely to increase distress to the affected individuals, not least given:

           a) the vulnerability of some individuals to whom the data related;
                                                                          64
           b) the dark web’s common association with nefarious activity;

64It is common for threat actors to exploit victims of cyberattacks by threatening publication of exfiltrated data on
the dark web. The dark web enables threat actors to sell stolen data to other individuals / organisations with an
interest in exploiting it.
                                       29For Public Release

           c) that individuals expect that information they disclose to their

              legal representatives is kept confidential and secure;

           d) that experts involved in judicial proceedings also have an

              expectation that law firms will treat their personal data

              confidentially and securely.

90.   DPP stated in notification letters to affected data subjects that the
      personal data “is not in the public domain, but in a place on the dark web

      that is not indexed by search engines”. However, this is not necessarily

      accurate given that the data exists in an online space and the dark web

      is accessible to anyone with the correct browser. DPP also further stated

      that only six pieces of information were readily accessible, while the rest

      was in an encrypted format that is “very difficult to access”. Whilst the
      Commissioner acknowledges that a level of encryption may mean the

      data is not immediately accessible, it does not necessarily mean it is

      difficult to access as the level of encryption that the threat actor applied

      to the other information may be simple; alternatively, the threat actor

      could publish the decryption key making the information immediately
      accessible.

91.   Given the sensitivity of the personal data involved there is a greater

      potential for rights and freedoms of data subjects to be adversely

      affected, the Commissioner has therefore given significant weight to this

      factor in his assessment of the gravity of the infringement.

92.   With regards to the infringement of Article 33(1) UK GDPR, Recital 85

      UK GDPR makes it clear that one of the purposes of notification to the
      Commissioner is to limit the damage to individuals as a result of a

      personal data breach. If DPP had notified the Commissioner when the

      personal data breach occurred (i.e. at the time of the Cyber Incident),

      the Commissioner may have initiated an investigation earlier that would

      have prompted DPP to take steps to mitigate the breach. DPP may have

      acted sooner rather than waiting to hear from the NCA about the

                                      30For Public Release

      personal data being uploaded onto the dark web. The delay of 43 days

      before reporting the matter to the Commissioner also caused a delay in
      the Commissioner’s investigation.

93.   To summarise the Commissioner’s assessment of the gravity of the
      infringements: the scope of the Relevant Processing was across England

      and Wales, the nature and purpose of the Relevant Processing, the

      number of data subjects affected, and the level of damage suffered by

      them all increase the gravity of the infringements. The gravity of the

      infringements increases their seriousness.

Duration of the infringements

      Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 UK GDPR

94.   The duration of the infringements was from at least 25 May 2018 (the

      date of commencement of the DPA and application of the UK GDPR)      65

      until the 4 June 2022 (the date of the Cyber Incident, which caused DPP

      to suspend sqluser from its network and move its case management,

      accounts and email system to the new managed hosted environment

      operated by a case management software supplier).

95.   The risk of damage (i.e. potential damage) to data subjects existed from

      at least as early as 25 May 2018 and could have materialised at any

      point during this lengthy period. The risk materialised on 4 June 2022.

96.   The infringements subsisted for (at the very least) four years before the

      risk materialised. The duration of the infringements increases their

      seriousness.

      Article 33(1)

65
 DPP was aware of the sqluser account as far back as 2011 but despite being aware, failed to ensure the ongoing
confidentiality of its systems, as required at the commencement of the DPA 2018 and application of the UK GDPR.

                                     31For Public Release

97.   Article 33(1) UK GDPR requires personal data breaches within the

      meaning of Article 4(12) UK GDPR to be notified to the Commissioner

      without undue delay and where feasible not later than 72 hours after

      having become aware of it. DPP had 72 hours from becoming aware of

      the Cyber Incident on 4 June 2022 to notify the Commissioner.

98.   The duration of this infringement was from 7 June 2022 until 17 July
      2022 (i.e. the date on which DPP notified the Commissioner about the

      personal data breach). It is important to emphasise that this delay meant

      that the infringements were not satisfactorily dealt with and caused a

      consequential delay to the Commissioner’s investigation.

Conclusion on the nature, gravity and duration of the infringements

99.   The nature, gravity and duration of the infringements all increase the

      seriousness of the infringements.

Seriousness of the infringements: Article 83(2)(b) the intentional or negligent

character of the infringements

100. The Commissioner does not consider that DPP acted intentionally in
      committing the infringements. The Commissioner does, however, find

      that the infringements were negligent in character.

101. While the personal data breach occurred due to a malicious and criminal

      cyberattack, it was successful due to DPP’s negligent security practices.

      DPP acted negligently in failing to implement appropriate technical and

      organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the
      risk. In particular, DPP failed to have in place measures to audit all

      accounts on DPP’s servers and to limit the privileges associated with

      these accounts or disable them where they were not necessary. It failed

      to recognise the risk associated with an administrator account that had

      unrestricted access across the network. These were all routine measures

      that could have been taken by DPP to secure its network and the

                                      32For Public Release

      personal data it was processing (see guidance referred to at paragraph

      49 above).

102. It would have been straightforward for DPP to implement measures that

      ensured appropriate security of the personal data (such as: suspending

      the account when not needed; being (at least) aware of the password;

      and performing risk assessments on the account). Any risk assessment

      may have identified further ways in which the account could have been
      secured more appropriately. Each of these measures could have been

      implemented prior to the incident at minimal cost.

103. In addition, DPP ought to have known that the unavailability of systems
      constituted a personal data breach, about which DPP should have notified

      the Commissioner. The Commissioner’s guidance on personal data

      breaches states: “Personal data breaches can include… loss of availability

      of personal data”.66 The guidance also states that organisations should

      notify the Commissioner within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach,

      even if they don’t have all the required information. For instance, the

      guidance provides an example of a comparable situation, which

      demonstrates that DPP ought to have notified the Commissioner earlier

      when investigating the incident:

                                      33For Public Release

104. The clearly negligent character of the infringements increases their

      seriousness.

affected

                                                                     67
105. The personal data exfiltrated in the Cyber Incident included:

           a) Relating to 306 crime clients:

                 i. Name

                 ii. Address

                iii. Date of birth

                iv. Details of offence

                v. Police station instructions, which includes a significant

                    amount of sensitive information. For example, special

                    category data including ethnicity and disability (where

                    applicable). It also includes details of the police station,

                    arrest and detention, previous advice and assistance that

                    DPP offered, samples taken, whether searches and seizures

                    were made, relevant medical conditions, DPP’s instructions

                                        35For Public Release

106. The Fining Guidance sets out at paragraph 70: “The UK GDPR… make\[s\]

      clear that the processing of certain categories of personal data deserves
      special protection. These categories include… special category data

      (Article 9 UK GDPR); personal data relating to criminal convictions and

      offences (Article 10 UK GDPR)”. Infringements that involve the

      processing of such data are regarded by the Commissioner as being

      particularly serious.1

107. The Fining Guidance further states at paragraph 72:

          “In assessing seriousness, the Commissioner may also take into

          account other types of personal data affected by the infringement

          where that data may be regarded as particularly sensitive. This

          includes where the dissemination of the personal data is likely to

          cause damage or distress to data subjects, for example:… private

          communications (particular those involving intimate details or

          confidential information about the data subject)”.

108. The personal data exfiltrated in the Cyber Incident included a significant

      proportion of personal data that deserves special protection and is

      sensitive, including special category data, personal data relating to
      criminal convictions and offences, and privileged communications.

109. As discussed in paragraphs 35 to 37, this information revealed intimate
      details about individuals, including the offences of which they were

      accused and DPP’s confidential legal advice, as well as information

      relating to children. This points to the seriousness of the infringements

      and is given significant weight in the Commissioner’s findings.

Conclusion on seriousness of infringements

71
  Paragraph 71 of the Fining Guidance.

                                      36For Public Release

110. The nature, gravity and duration as well as the clearly negligent

      character of the infringements coupled with the impact on sensitive

      information militates towards a high degree of seriousness. However,

      when the relatively limited number of data subjects is taken into account

      the Commissioner categorises the infringements as having a medium
      degree of seriousness.

111. In   the  absence    of  any   aggravating   or  mitigating  factors,  the

      infringements would warrant a monetary penalty. The Commissioner’s

      consideration of any aggravating or mitigating factors follows below.

Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors: Article 83(2)(c) any action taken

by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data

subjects

112. In line with Article 34 GDPR requirements, DPP notified affected

      individuals of the personal data breach by letters, email and phone. DPP
      notified the majority of data subjects by the end of August 2022. Where

      the data subjects were children, DPP notified the children’s guardian via

      CAFCAS (the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service),

      rather than directly with the parents, as the children were subject to care

      proceedings and did not live with their parents. Where DPP identified

      data subjects as having mental health difficulties, DPP considered the
      most appropriate means of contact was via a phone conversation.

113. DPP stated that when notifying those affected, DPP enclosed information

      from the NCA with advice on how to protect personal data and stay safe

      in the digital environment. This cannot be considered a mitigating factor

      given that this information would not mitigate the possible damage

      suffered by data subjects as a result of the Cyber Incident.

114. Following the Cyber Incident, steps were taken to improve DPP’s security
      system, including moving its complete case management, accounts and

                                      37For Public Release

      email system to a managed hosted environment operated by its case

      management software suppliers, The Access Group. DPP also removed

      the legacy case management system from the DPP Network and it is now

      only accessible through                                    .

115. The Commissioner considers that these actions (notifying affected data

      subjects and improving the DPP security system) do not amount to a
      mitigating factor in his decision on whether to impose a penalty. These

      actions were all legal requirements and include what would reasonably

      be expected of an organisation in response to a personal data breach.

Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors: Article 83(2)(d) the degree of

responsibility of the controller or processor

116. DPP was the sole controller in respect of the Relevant Processing. DPP

      therefore bears full responsibility for the infringements. While the

      compromised administrator account was originally setup for third party

      access to the network, DPP as controller is ultimately responsible for the
      security measures that it has in place.

117. The Commissioner considers DPP’s degree of responsibility to be an

      aggravating factor in his decision to impose a penalty.

Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors: Article 83(2)(e) any relevant

previous infringements by the controller or processor

118. The Commissioner is not aware of any relevant previous infringements.

      This factor is therefore not relevant to his decision.

Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors: Article 83(2)(f) the degree of
cooperation with the Commissioner

119. Controllers   and processors    are expected    to cooperate    with  the

      Commissioner in the performance of the Commissioner’s tasks, for

                                      38For Public Release

      example by responding to requests for information and attending

      meetings. The Commissioner considers that the ordinary duty of

      cooperation is required by law and meeting this standard is therefore not

      a mitigating factor.

120. DPP provided full cooperation with the Commissioner throughout the

      investigation. DPP did not however go above and beyond the normal
      level of expected cooperation. The Commissioner considers this to be a

      neutral, rather than mitigating, factor.

Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors: Article 83(2)(h) the manner in

which the infringements became known to the Commissioner

121. DPP reported the Cyber Incident to the Commissioner but not until 43

      days after its systems went offline. However, this is not considered as

      an aggravating factor given it has already been taken into account in the

      consideration of the seriousness of the infringement of Article 33(1) UK
      GDPR.

Relevant   aggravating  or mitigating   factors:  Article 83(2)(i)  measures
previously ordered against the controller or processor

122. There are no measures referred to in Article 58(2) UK GDPR which have

      previously been ordered against DPP concerning the same subject

      matter. This factor is therefore not relevant to the Commissioner’s

      decision.

Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors: Article 83(2)(j) adherence to

approved codes of conduct or certification mechanisms

123. There were no approved codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 UK

      GDPR or approved certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42 UK
      GDPR. This factor is therefore not relevant to the Commissioner’s

      decision.

                                     39For Public Release

Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors: Article 83(2)(k) any other

applicable aggravating or mitigating factors

124. The Commissioner has considered whether DPP has adhered to approved
      codes of conduct set out by its regulatory body.

125. The SRA has a published 'Code of Conduct for Firms'. Of particular

      relevance are the requirements to:

           •  Paragraph 2.1(a) | "Have effective governance structures,

              arrangements, systems and controls in place that ensure

              \[compliance\] with all the SRA’s regulatory arrangements, as

              well as with other regulatory and legislative requirements,
              which apply to you";

           •  Paragraph 2.5 | "…identify, monitor and manage all material

              risks to your business…";

           •  Paragraph 3.1 | "…keep up to date with and follow the law and

              regulation governing the way you work"; and

           •  Paragraph 5.2 | "…safeguard money and assets entrusted to

              you by clients and others" – the reference to “assets” is defined
              to include documents.

126. The Commissioner finds the determination of compliance or otherwise

      with the SRA Code of Conduct is a matter for the SRA and therefore does

      not consider this as an aggravating factor in his assessment. As far as

      the Commissioner is aware, no action has been taken by the SRA against

      DPP in respect of the Cyber Incident. However, the Commissioner finds

      that as an SRA regulated firm and, by virtue of the elements of the SRA
      Code of Conduct listed at paragraph 125 above, DPP should have had

                                      40For Public Release

      greater awareness of the importance of compliance with the security
      principles under UK GDPR.

127. DPP explained in its written representations that it had worked with the

      NCSC regarding the attack.  72 However, this was not considered to be a

      mitigating factor as DPP did not take steps to pro-actively report the

      attack to the NCSC at the time of the incident and did not go beyond

      what was required in the circumstances.

128. There are no other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the

      circumstances of the case.

Conclusion on relevant aggravating and mitigating factors

129. The Commissioner has taken into account the degree of DPP’s

      responsibility as an aggravating factor.

130. Consideration of the seriousness of the infringements (the first stage of

      the assessment) indicated that a penalty is appropriate. The aggravating

      factor strengthens that assessment.

131. The    final stage   involves  a   consideration   of  the  effectiveness,
      proportionality and dissuasiveness of a penalty.

Effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness

132. The Commissioner considers the imposition of a penalty would be

      effective and dissuasive. It would both promote compliance with data
      protection legislation and provide an appropriate sanction for the

      infringements. It would deter DPP from infringing the UK GDPR’s security

      provisions, including the requirement to notify the Commissioner within

      72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach. There is also a

72
 DPP Written Representations, 29 January 2025, p.4.

                                      41For Public Release

      need to deter other organisations, such as law firms, that hold sensitive

      personal data from acting in the same way.

133. Taking into account the seriousness of the infringements and DPP’s size

      and financial position (discussed in paragraph 146 below), the

      Commissioner considers that the imposition of a penalty would be

      proportionate (i.e. it would not exceed what is appropriate and necessary
      in the circumstances to ensure compliance with data protection

      legislation and to provide an appropriate sanction for the infringements).

      DPP will continue to process personal data as it offers legal services to

      vulnerable individuals and it will continue to need to implement

      appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect sensitive

      information, including legally privileged advice.

C.   Conclusion on decision on whether to impose a penalty

134. In light of the assessment above, the Commissioner has decided to

      impose a penalty.

VI.   CALCULATION OF PROPOSED PENALTY

135. The Fining     Guidance sets out     a five-step   approach    which the

      Commissioner proposes to apply to calculate the amount of a penalty:

      Step 1: Assessment of the seriousness of the infringement.

      Step 2: Accounting for turnover (where the controller or processor is

      part of an undertaking).
      Step 3: Calculation of the starting point having regard to the seriousness

      of the infringement and, where relevant, the turnover of the undertaking.

      Step 4: Adjustment to take into account any aggravating or mitigating

      factors.

      Step 5: Assessment of whether the fine is effective, proportionate and

      dissuasive.

                                      42For Public Release

Statutory maximum penalty

136. Article 83(3) UK GDPR states that “if a controller or processor

      intentionally or negligently, for the same or linked processing operations,

      infringes several provisions of the UK GDPR, the total amount of the
      administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest

      infringement”. The four infringements set out in this Penalty Noticeall

      relate to the same or linked processing operations (the Relevant

      Processing). The gravest infringement was that of Article 5(1)(f) UK

      GDPR.

137. The infringement of Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR, which is one of the

      principles of processing, is subject to the higher maximum statutory

      penalty of £17.5 million (Article 83(5)(a) UK GDPR) or 4% of an

      undertaking’s worldwide turnover in the preceding financial year
      (whichever is higher). As an undertaking, DPP’s turnover in the

      preceding  financial  year  was   £3,486,494   (see  paragraph   146).

      Therefore, had the Commissioner imposed a separate penalty for each

      of the four infringements, the total of those four penalties could not have

      exceeded £17.5 million (given that this is higher than 4% of DPP’s

      turnover in the preceding financial year).

138. In this case, however, the Commissioner has calculated a single penalty

      for all four infringements. This is because the four provisions infringed

      all relate to the same or linked processing operations: they all related to

      the failure to ensure the security of personal data processing including

      the response to personal data breaches. The calculation proceeds on the
      basis of a single statutory maximum of £17.5 million.

A. Step 1: Assessment of the seriousness of the infringement

73
 Infringements of Articles 5(1)(f), 32(1), 32(2) and 33(1) UK GDPR.

                                     43For Public Release

139. As set out at paragraphs 109 to 115 of the Fining Guidance, the
      Commissioner determines a starting point for the penalty first by

      assessing the seriousness of the infringement. The Commissioner

      categorises the infringement according to its degree of seriousness and

      then chooses a starting point based on a percentage of the relevant

      applicable statutory maximum.

140. In this Penalty Notice (paragraph 110 above), the Commissioner has

      categorised  the   infringements  as   having  a   medium    degree   of

      seriousness. This means that the starting point will be between 10% and

      20% of the relevant legal maximum (£17.5 million).

141. The Commissioner has decided that the infringements warrant a starting

      point of 17%.

142. A starting point lower than 17% is not warranted due to the seriousness
      of the infringements, for the reasons set out at paragraphs 78 to 111

      above. The Commissioner does not repeat those reasons here.

143. A starting point higher than 17% is not warranted for the following

      reasons:

           a) the fact that the infringements were not intentional; and

           b) there were no direct financial gains from the infringements.

B. Step 2: Accounting for turnover

144. Having assessed the seriousness of the infringements, the Commissioner

      next determines any adjustment to reflect the size of the recipient of the

      penalty.74This is consistent with the need to ensure the amount of the

      penalty is effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

74
 As set out at paragraph 128 of the Fining Guidance, any such adjustment is discretionary.

                                     44For Public Release

145. Where the recipient is an undertaking, the Commissioner will determine

      the adjustment by reference to the undertaking’s turnover.

146. DPP provided a copy of its most recent financial statement. For the

      financial year in the 2023/2024 period, DPP had a turnover of

      £3,486,494.

147. As set out in the Fining Guidance, in the case of an undertaking with an

      annual turnover of between £2 million and £10 million, the Commissioner
      may apply an adjustment factor of 0.4% to 2% to the starting point (see

      below). The Commissioner considers this range of adjustment is also

      appropriate in DPP’s case.

148. The Commissioner has decided that an adjustment of 0.8% is

      appropriate to reflect DPP’s size.

C. Step 3: Calculation of the starting point

149. The starting point of the penalty is calculated as follows:

         Fixed statutory maximum amount (£17.5 million) x adjustment

         for seriousness (17%) x turnover adjustment (0.8%) = £23,800

150. The starting point of £23,800 represents a figure which is 0.68% of DPP’s
      turnover for the financial year 2023/2024,

D. Step 4: Adjustment to take into account any aggravating or

     mitigating factors.

151. The Commissioner next takes into account any aggravating or mitigating

      factors. These factors may warrant an increase or decrease in the level

      of the penalty calculated at the end of Step 3 (the starting point of

      £23,800).

                                      45For Public Release

152. On this occasion, the Commissioner has decided that no mitigating

      factors are present allowing for the adjustment of the fine.

153. The Commissioner has carefully considered the potential arguments in

      respect of compliance or otherwise with the SRA Code of Practice arising

      from the Cyber Incident. However, as the SRA has made no findings

      against DPP as a result of the Cyber Incident, the Commissioner decides
      not to take this factor into account as an aggravating factor.

154. Whilst DPP’s degree of responsibility was considered as an aggravating

      factor in the decision to impose a penalty, the Commissioner has decided

      that, as this factor is taken into account in the assessment of the

      seriousness of the infringements at Step 1, it is not an aggravating factor

      which would merit the adjustment of the fine.

155. There are no other aggravating or mitigating factors and so there is no
      adjustment at Step 4.

E. Step 5: Adjustment to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate and

     dissuasive

156. The Fining Guidance provides that:

          “the aim of Steps 1 to 4 of the calculation is to identify a fine

          amount that is effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The

          purpose of Step 5 is to provide the opportunity for the

          Commissioner to check that is the case”.

157. In evaluating the level of the fine, and in the exercise of his discretion,
      the Commissioner considers that a penalty of £23,800 (representing only

      0.68% of DPP’s turnover for the financial year 2023/2024) will neither

      be effective nor dissuasive for the following reasons:

                                      46For Public Release

           a) A fine at this level is insufficient to serve as an effective

              deterrent. The Commissioner has reached this view having taken
              into consideration the categories of personal data affected (and

              which will continue to be processed by DPP) and the level of fines

              imposed in other cases involving security breaches.    75 In the

              Commissioner’s judgement the penalty requires an increase to

              be effective and demonstrate the importance of compliance with

              Articles 5(1)(f), 32 and 33 UK GDPR.

           b) It would not be dissuasive because a fine of £23,800 is not

              sufficient to discourage similar infringements. DPP could have

              implemented a solution to protect the personal data that it

              processes at minimal cost. A penalty representing a fraction of a

              percent of DPP’s turnover would not be severe enough to secure

              specific and general deterrence. That is:

                i. Deterring DPP from infringing the security of processing

                   provisions of the UK GDPR and encouraging compliance
                   with the same (specific deterrence).

                ii. Deterring other organisations generally from infringing
                   security of processing provisions of the UK GDPR and

                   encouraging    compliance    with    the   same    (general

                   deterrence).

158. Where a penalty is a very small percentage of an organisation’s total

      turnover, the impact of the penalty on that organisation may be very

      limited. It is only when the penalty imposed is sufficiently high to make

      a meaningful impact on the controller that the Commissioner can be

      confident that the infringing controller will take its compliance with data

      protection law seriously in the future.

International Inc, monetary penalty notice, British Airways monetary penalty notice

                                      47For Public Release

159. The Commissioner finds that a fine at the level of £23,800 is not

      proportionate insofar as it would not deliver the objective of enforcing

      compliance with the UK GDPR and providing an appropriate sanction for

      the findings of infringement. Having taken into account the seriousness
      of the infringements, the impact on data subjects and DPP’s size and

      financial position, the Commissioner is of the view that a fine of £23,800

      is less than is necessary in the circumstances to meet those objectives.

160. The Commissioner therefore considers that a penalty of £60,000 would

      be more appropriate. A penalty of this amount represents 1.7% of DPP’s

      turnover for the financial year 2023/2034 and is likely to have a genuine

      deterrent effect. This is so taking into account both the specific

      deterrence to DPP and the general deterrence to other organisations

      (e.g. other law firms). This would send a message to other organisations

      that they must implement appropriate security measures to protect

      personal data. This penalty would not be more than is appropriate or

      necessary in the circumstances. Therefore, a penalty of £60,000 would
      be proportionate.

161. In its written representations, DPP sought to argue that the fine proposed
      in the Notice of Intent was not in line with the Penalty Notice issued by

      the Commissioner to Tuckers Solicitors LLP (Tuckers) on 28 February

      2022 on the basis that Tuckers are a similar business to DPP in that a

      substantial part of their legal activities is legally aided criminal law.

162. DPP submitted that taking into account fees generated on an annual

      basis and numbers of staff employed in both firms, the fine proposed in

      the Notice of Intent was not comparable on a per employee basis. DPP

7Tuckers Solicitors LLP monetary penalty notice (https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-
taken/mpns/4019746/tuckers-mpn-20220228.pdf).

                                      48For Public Release

      further submitted that a penalty of less than £20,000 would be more

      appropriate.

163. Having considered DPP’s written representations on this issue, the

      Commissioner remains satisfied that the Fining Guidance has been

      correctly applied to the outcome of his investigation into DPP’s
      infringements. In particular, the Commissioner is satisfied that:

          a) The monetary penalty notice issued to Tuckers cannot be directly

             comparable to DPP because the fine imposed on Tuckers was
             calculated under the Commissioner’s previous guidance for

             calculating monetary penalties.  77 In any event, it is not

             appropriate for the Commissioner to compare enforcement

             action taken in previous cases because each case turns on its

             own facts and circumstances.

          b) Neither the UK GDPR nor the DPA 2018 provide any legal basis

             for calculating a fine by reference to the number of people

             employed by an organisation.

          c) In calculating the fine imposed on DPP, due regard has been

             given to all the factors set out in Article 83(2) UK GDPR (in

             particular, applicable factors aggravating or mitigating the

             circumstances of the case). These factors differ case-to-case and

             must be considered on the facts of each case.

          d) Upon considering all the circumstances of the case, a fine in the

             sum of £60,000 is effective, proportionate and dissuasive,

             therefore an appropriate adjustment was required when applying
             Step 5 of the Fining Guidance to the facts of DPP’s case. In

             determining the appropriate adjustment to make at Step 5 to

77
 The fine in Tuckers was calculated under the Commissioner’s Regulatory Action Policy; whereas, the fine imposed
on DPP has been calculated under the Fining Guidance.

                                     49For Public Release

              ensure the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive, the

              Commissioner has exercised his evaluation and judgement

              taking into account all the relevant circumstances of this case.

164. In making his decision and setting the amount of the penalty, the
      Commissioner has also had regard to the desirability of promoting

      economic growth (as required by section 108(1) of the Deregulation Act

      2015). In particular, the Commissioner has taken into consideration:

           a) the nature and level of risk associated with non-compliance with

              data protection legislation (including risks to economic growth);

           b) the steps taken by DPP to achieve compliance and the reasons

              for its failure;

           c) the willingness and ability of DPP to address its non-compliance;

           d) the likely impact of the proposed intervention on DPP’s business

              and   the  likely impact   of  the   Commissioner’s    regulatory

              intervention on the wider legal services sector (both in terms of
              deterrence and the economic benefit to legal services firms); and

           e) the necessity and proportionality of imposing a penalty on DPP

              in the sum of £60,000 in respect of its infringements of the UK

              GDPR.

      Having regard to the factors stated above, the Commissioner considers

      that this Penalty Notice is unlikely to have an impact on any measure of

      economic activity or growth in the United Kingdom, including levels of
      employment and Gross Domestic Product.

F. Conclusion - Penalty

                                      50 For Public Release

 165. For the reasons set out above, the Commissioner decides to impose a

       monetary penalty on DPP in the amount of £60,000.

 G. Financial hardship

 166. The Fining Guidance outlines that, in exceptional circumstances, the

       Commissioner may reduce a fine where an organisation is unable to pay
                                  78
       due to its financial position.

 167. The Notice of Intent given to DPP on 11 December 2024 indicated that

       the amount of the penalty the Commissioner proposed to impose was

       £60,000. The Commissioner received no representations from DPP in
       relation to financial hardship.

VII.   PAYMENT OF THE PENALTY

 168. The penalty must be paid to the Commissioner’s office by BACS transfer

       or cheque by 19 May 2025.

 169. Under paragraph 9(1) of Schedule 16 to the DPA, the Commissioner

       cannot take action to recover a penalty unless:

            a) the period specified in this Penalty Notice (i.e. by 19 May 2025)

               has ended;

            b) any appeals against this Penalty Notice have been decided or
               otherwise ended;

            c) if this Penalty Notice has been varied, any appeals against the

               penalty variation notice have been decided or otherwise ended;
               and

            d) the period for DPP to appeal this Penalty Notice, and any

               variation of it, has ended.

 78
   Fining Guidance at paragraph 151.

                                      51     For Public Release

     170. Under paragraph 9(2) of Schedule 16 to the DPA, in England and Wales,

           the Commissioner is able to enforce the payment of the penalty. The

           penalty is recoverable:

                a) if the County Court so orders, as if it were payable under an order

                   of that court; or

                b) if the High Court so orders, as if it were payable under an order

                   of that court.

VIII.   RIGHTS OF APPEAL

     171. By virtue of section 162 DPA, DPP may appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

           (General Regulatory Chamber) (Information Rights) against this Penalty

           Notice. DPP may appeal to the Tribunal against the amount of the
           penalty, whether or not it appeals against the Penalty Notice.

     172. Information about the appeals process is set out in the Annex. Any notice

           of appeal should be sent or delivered to the Tribunal so that it is received

           within 28 days of the date of this Penalty Notice.
