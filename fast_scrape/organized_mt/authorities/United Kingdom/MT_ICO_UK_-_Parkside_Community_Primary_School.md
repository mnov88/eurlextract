DATA PROTECTION ACT 2018 AND UK GENERAL DATA
                       PROTECTION REGULATION

                                REPRIMAND

The Information Commissioner (the Commissioner) issues a reprimand to
Parkside Community Primary School (Parkside) in accordance with Article

58(2)(b) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) in
respect of certain infringements of the UK GDPR.

The reprimand

The Commissioner has decided to issue a reprimand to Parkside in respect
of the following infringements of the UK GDPR:

     Article 5 (1)(f) which states that personal data shall be processed in

      a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data,
      including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing
      and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
      appropriate technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and
      confidentiality’).

There are also infringements of Article 24 (1) (Responsibility of the
controller) and Article 32 (Security of processing).

The reasons for the Commissioner’s findings are set out below.

The investigation found that Parkside inappropriately disclosed personal
data, including special category data, of a sensitive nature in a classroom
environment. There were four data subjects affected, three of whom were

children.

The Commissioner considers that in relation to the infringement of Article
5(1)(f) (and by extension Article 24 (1) and Article 32), that Parkside did
not have adequate:

     Policies. The ICO is satisfied that the both of the employees

      concerned acted in contravention of Parkside’s data protection
      policies by failing to report the breach internally. However,
      shortcomings with Parkside’s policies were noted. Specifically, the
      data protection policies did not outline the course of action for

      employees to adopt to ensure security and confidentiality when
      sharing personal data internally by email and also when it was
      appropriate to open emails which contained personal data. This is
      particularly pertinent due to the classroom environment which
      Parkside employees operated in.

                                      1      Also noted was a lack of policy relating to         (
                                   ).         is a case management system
      specifically used for the management and monitoring of

      safeguarding, wellbeing and pastoral issues related to children. The
      personal data being processed by            was likely to be sensitive
      and contain special category data, so the ICO would expect a
      controller to have adequate technical and organisational measures
      around the use of          to prevent a security breach.

     Procedure and guidance. There was a lack of written guidance for
      employees in respect of using security and confidentiality
      classifications on emails. Specifically and in relation to this incident,

      it was noted that emails generated by           did not have any
      security classification or labelling to indicate they contained
      personal data of a sensitive nature (including special category
      data).

      Further, there was no written procedure or guidance for employees
      in respect of when it was appropriate during the school day to open
      emails generated by          .

      In addition to this, there was no written procedure or guidance

      available to employees in relation to the safe operation of the
      electronic whiteboards, particularly when screensharing from an
      employee’s electronic device.

Mitigating factors

In the course of our investigation we have noted that:

     Parkside had overarching data protection policies in place. In
      particular, Data Protection and Security Policy (dated July 2020)
      stipulated that employees should follow the security incident / data

      breach response plan if they know or suspect a personal data
      breach has occurred. The Data Breach Response Plan Parkside
      Community Primary School (undated) directed employees that if
      they become aware of a suspected or actual personal data breach,
      then the incident should be reported to the Headmaster without

      delay.

     Once the incident was discovered by Parkside, the children who
      witnessed the disclosure were reassured that what they read was

      unfortunate and that if they wanted to talk about the content that
      they were able to do with the Deputy Headteacher. It was stressed
      to the children that the content was not to be discussed with their
      peers. There is no evidence that the disclosed           content has
      been shared or disseminated.

                                      2     Parkside referred the incident immediately to the Local Authority
      Designated Officer (LADO) and followed the recommendations made
      by the LADO.

     Chair of Governors agreed with commissioning the Human
      Resources team at Herts for Learning to carry out an investigation
      and it was conducted under the school’s disciplinary policy.

     Formal disciplinary action was taken against one of the employees
      concerned. This employee made a statement of apology for breach
      and for their failure to report the incident.

Remedial steps taken by Parkside

The Commissioner has also considered and welcomes the remedial steps
taken by Parkside in the light of this incident. In particular we have noted
that:

     The governor responsible for the strategic management of UK GDPR
      reviewed the Parkside’s current practices in line with the Data
      Protection policy and made recommendations to the full governing
      body.

     All staff were issued with a formal notice and guidance about how
      incidents should be reported on the school’s internal          .

     New guidance has been issued to staff around the recording and
      accessing of work emails /           records in light of the breach.

     Staff have been instructed that all alerts sent via         are only to
      be read at specific times of the day and never when children are

      present or in the vicinity of the classroom.

     All staff have been instructed to use “SENSITIVE/HIGHLY
      SENSITIVE” in the subject line of an email informing the recipient of
      the nature of the content before it is opened. Such emails should

      only be read before and after the school day.

     Governors are to be alerted to an incident as soon as it becomes
      known to the headteacher.

     Cases of a complex and sensitive nature can only be accessed on
              by the Headteacher, Deputy Headteacher and Parental and
      Pastoral Officer and shared with relevant members of staff on a
      need-to-know basis at scheduled meetings.

                                       3     All staff and governors received UK GDPR refresher training (which
      included the caveat not to check emails during teaching time) as
      per the Herts for Learning training module. Part of the training

      instructed staff to use the internal secure data transfer system
      when sending information of a highly sensitive nature.

     All staff to be issued with the Parkside’s UK GDPR policy and to be
      familiar with its content. A record will be made on personnel files in

      this respect.

     Staff have been signposted on where to access the school’s Data
      Protection Policy as a point of reference should they require it.

     Parkside’s Data Protection Policy has been reviewed and an
      appendix added for review at the first full governing body meeting
      of the new academic year. The updated policy instructs staff how to
      report a breach, what constitutes a breach, who to report it to and

      what happens once this has been do. This is to help staff
      understand the complexities of reporting a breach.

     All staff to sign an electronic document to say they have read and
      understood the school’s Child Protection and Data Protection Policy

      in September 2022 alongside the latest and updated version of
      Keeping Children Safe in Education (Part 1).

Decision to issue a reprimand

Taking into account all the circumstances of this case, including the
mitigating factors and remedial steps, the Commissioner has decided to
issue a reprimand to Parkside in relation to the infringements of Article
5(1)(f), Article 24 (1) and Article 32 of the UK GDPR set out above.

Further Action Recommended

The Commissioner recommends that Parkside should take certain steps to
ensure its compliance with UK GDPR. With particular reference to Article

5(1)(f), Article 24 (1) and Article 32 of the UK GDPR, the following steps
are recommended:

1.   Parkside should consider refresher training on the operation of
     electronic whiteboards for all relevant employees. This should be

     underpinned by written guidance for employees to follow and
     Parkside should satisfy itself that security is enshrined in the training
     and guidance. Emphasis should be given to the relevant steps for
     employees to take to avoid a personal data breach when operating
     an electronic whiteboard.

                                       42.   At the time of the breach, it was noted that there was no written
     guidance in place for employees for the use of           . Whilst it is
     appreciated that Parkside have now issued some written guidance in

     relation to the operation of         , Parkside should evaluate whether
     this is sufficient and adequate to reduce the risk of a recurrence of a
     similar incident.         refresher training should also be considered
     for all relevant employees.

3.   Consideration should be given to refresher data protection training to

     all members of staff, as it was noted that both members of staff
     involved in this incident failed to report the breach. Emphasis should
     be given on the requirement to report a suspected or actual personal
     data breach. Parkside should satisfy itself that all employees
     understand the consequences of failing to report a breach,

     particularly as it can mean a delay in mitigating action being
     deployed. This is especially important, as mitigating action can lessen
     the effects of a personal data breach and the potential impact on the
     data subject/s.

4.   Parkside should satisfy itself that it has adequate technical and

     organisational measures in place to ensure the security and
     confidentiality of emails sent internally which include personal data,
     particularly when these contain sensitive or special category data.

5.   Parkside’s policies and procedures should have prominent, sufficient
     and adequate practical guidance for employees in order to avoid a

     similar breach occurring again. This also needs to include regular
     reviews, and proactive work to increase staff awareness of these.

6.   Parkside should take steps to test all of the new processes introduced
     as a result of this incident and ensure they are embedded within the
     organisation.

                                       5
