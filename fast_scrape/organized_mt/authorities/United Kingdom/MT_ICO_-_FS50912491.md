## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant requested information regarding a grievance process within the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland (the Department) under FOIA. The information included interview notes and statements as well as names, ranks and job roles of interviewees in the evidence gathering process. The Department refused disclosure for reasons of data protection, relying on section 40 (2) FOIA.

### Dispute

Does the information in question constitute personal data and would disclosure contravene data protection principles?

### Holding

The ICO decides that the Department correctly refused to disclose the requested information under section 40(2) FOIA, by way of section 40(3A) a.

The requested information constitutes personal data and can not be anonymised to prevent identification of data subjects from the data released.

The ICO considers Article 6 (1) (f) as a potential basis for processing, confirms legitimate interest and necessity but concludes that the rights and freedoms of the data subjects outweigh the legitimate interest in disclosure. It takes into consideration the extent of a potential disclosure under FOIA (to the wider public), the data subjectsâ€™ reasonable expectation of confidentiality and potential stress in case of disclosure.
