The Information Commissioner’s Officer (ICO) imposed a fine of € 20.7 million on Marriott International Inc (“Marriott”) for failing to ensure appropriate security when processing its costumers’ personal data, thus violating [Article 5(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

Investigations began following notification of an attack on Marriott’s IT systems that took place over a period of time that includes May 2018 (when the GDPR came into force) to September 2018 . As a result, the attacker(s) had access to vast amounts of costumers’ personal data: Marriot estimated that they accessed 339 million guest records, with 30.1 million being EEA members’ records and 7 million being associated with the UK.

## English Summary

### Facts

Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc’s (“Starwood”) IT system were first compromised by unknown attackers in 2014. Marriot subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but did not detect this attack at any time between that moment and September 2018. Therefore, between 2014 and 2018, the attackers had access to Starwood’s systems through use of Remote Access Trojan malware, and kept extracting Starwood databases. Marriott became aware of potential attacks following an alert from a system applied to one of its most confidential databases on September 2018. After that Marriot found malware installed and proof that databases had been extracted over the years, so they promptly notified both the ICO and relevant data subjects of the breach. The ICO found that the attackers had obtained unencrypted personal data of the likes of: passport numbers, identifying information of the costumers such as name, date of birth and gender, plus credit card details in encrypted form.

### Dispute

### Holding

Although the ICO and the relevant victims were notified promptly of the breach, the ICO found that there were many failures in placing the technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal data in Marriott’s system as required under Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32 GDPR. Marriott’s shortcomings, as outlined by the ICO, were the following: insufficient monitoring of privileged accounts and their user activity, insufficient monitoring of databases, poor control of critical systems and systems that have access to large amounts of personal data, and the fact that only certain type of sensitive data was encrypted (e.g. credit card numbers) but not all (e.g. many passport numbers). The ICO fined Marriott in line of [Article 83 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR "Article 83 GDPR") but also took into account mitigating factors such as the efforts that Marriott made to inform and help the victims of the breach, the $19 million investment it made on security the following year and the financial impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, lowering the final amount of the fine from £24 million to £18.4 million.

          PENALTY NOTICE

Section 155, Data protection Act 2018

        Case ref: COM0804337
      Ma10400 Fernwood Roadl Inc
                Bethesda
               M DUSA0 8 1 7

             30 October 20201 INTRODUCTION              & SUMMARY

1.1.    This   Penalty    Notice   i   given   to   Marriott   International    Inc
        (“Marriott”)   pursuant to section 155 and Schedule        16 of the Data

        Protection Act 2018    (the “DPA”).   I relates to infringements of the
        General   Data  Protection  Regulation   (the “GDPR”),     which  came   to

        the    attention     of   the    Information      Commissioner       (“the
        Commissioner”)      as a result of an attack on Marriott’s IT systems?

        that took   place over   a period   that included   25   May  2018   to 17
        September    2018 (the “Attack”).

1.2.    Insummary,     i 2014 the IT systems of Starwood       Hotels and Resorts

        Worldwide    Inc (“Starwood”)      were  compromised      by an unknown
        attacker  or attackers   (referred  to, for ease   of reference,   as “the

        Attacker”),   utilising an unknown     attack vector. In 2016,     Marriott
        acquired  Starwood.    Marriott did not detect the Attack at any time
        between   acquiring Starwood     and September     2018, including i the

        period after the entry into force of the GDPR       i May 2018.     During
        this latter period, the Attacker continued      to traverse through     the

        Starwood    systems   and  had  gained   access  to the cardholder     data
        environment within the Starwood       network. This access allowed the

        Attacker   to export   the  personal   data  of Starwood    customers    to
        “dmp”   files on the Starwood     systems,    potentially with a view    to
        taking a copy of that data. I was only when        the Attacker triggered

        an alert i relation to a table containing      cardholder   data that the
        Attack was discovered and could be mitigated. The personal data of

        a large number    of individuals was   involved  in the Attack,   including
        cardholder   data,   although   the  Commissioner     has   not  seen  any
        evidence   of  financial  harm    to  individuals.  Following   the   alert,

        Marriott   promptly    informed    affected   data   subjects   and    took
        immediate steps to mitigate the effects of the Attack and to protect

        the interests of data subjects by implementing       remedial measures.

1.3.    Marriott   i    an \_ international    hotel   chain,    with   operational
        headquarters    i the USA. The provisions of the DPA and the GDPR

        apply to the processing     of personal    data  by Marriot   by virtue of

1 References i this decision to Marriott’s systems / network / security etc. concern the IT systems
etc. that Marriott acquired from Stai September2016 and retained and continued to use
post-acquisition.        section 207(2)   DPA and Article 3(1) GDPR.       Marriott has confirmed
        that Marriott Hotels Limited i Marriott’s main establishment within

        the EU, as defined i Article 4(16) GDPR.

1.4.    The   data  subjects   affected   by  this  breach   were    customers    of

        Starwood, which was at the relevant time owned          by Marriott, i the
        United  Kingdom,   elsewhere    in the EU, and  in the rest of the world.

1.5.    Marriott was   the controller i respect of the personal         data  of its

        customers    within the meaning     of section   6 DPA   and   Article 4(7)
        GDPR,   as i determined    the purposes    and means    of the processing

        of the personal data. By inter alia collecting, recording, organising,
        structuring and storing the personal data of its customers,        Marriott
        was  processing   that data within the meaning       of section 3(4) DPA

        and Article 4(2) GDPR.

1.6.    Marriott has not admitted liability for breach of the GDPR.      However,

        for the reasons set out i this Penalty Notice, the Commissioner         has
        found that Marriott failed to process personal data i a manner that
        ensured    appropriate    security   of  the   personal   data,   including

        protection against unauthorised      or unlawful processing and against
        accidental loss, destruction or damage,      using appropriate technical

        and  organisational    measures,    as required   by Article   5(1)(f)  and
        Article 32 GDPR.

1.7.    The  Commissioner     has  found   that,  in all the  circumstances,    and

        having  regard,   i particular, to Marriott’s representations      and the
        matters   listed i Article 83(1)     and  (2) GDPR,    the   infringements
        constitute   a  serious   failure   to  comply    with   the   GDPR    and,

        accordingly,   that the imposition    of a penalty    i appropriate.    The
        amount    of the   penalty   that  the  Commissioner      has   decided   to

        impose,   having taken into account a range of mitigating factors set
        out further below and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, i £18.4
        million.

1.8.    Pursuant   to Article 56 GDPR,     the Commissioner      i acting   as lead
        supervisory   authority i respect of the cross-border        processing   at

        issue i this case.2.LEGAL       FRAMEWORK

GDPR

2.1.    On   25   May   2018,   the  GDPR    entered    into  force,  replacing   the
        previous EU law data protection regime that applied under Directive

        95/46/EC     (“Data   Protection     Directive”)\*?.   The   GDPR    seeks  to
        harmonise     the   protection   of fundamental      rights   i  respect    of

        personal    data  across   EU   Member     States   and,   unlike  the  Data
        Protection Directive, i directly applicable i every Member          State.?

2.2.    The GDPR     was developed     and enacted    i the context of challenges

        to the protection of personal data posed by, i particular:

        a.   the substantial increase i cross-border flows of personal data

              resulting from the functioning    of the internal market;\*+ and

        b.   the   rapid  technological    developments     which    have   occurred

              during a period of globalisation.> As Recital (6) explains: “.. The
             scale   of the    collection  and   sharing   of personal     data   has

             increased     significantly.   Technology      allows’   both    private
             companies and public authorities to make         use of personal data

             on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue their activities....”

2.3.    Such   developments      made    i necessary     for “a strong    and   more

        coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by strong
        enforcement,    given   the importance     of creating the trust that will

        allow the digital economy     to develop across the internal market...”.®

2.4.    Against that background,      the GDPR    imposed    more   stringent duties
        on controllers and significantly increased the penalties that could be

        imposed    for a breach     of the obligations     imposed   on   controllers
        (amongst others).’

§ Recital 7.
7 See, i particular, Recitals 11, 148, 150, and Article 5, Chapter IV and Article 83.        The relevant obligations

2.5.    Chapter 1 GDPR sets out the general provisions. Article 5 of Chapter

        I GDPR sets out the principles relating to the processing of personal
        data. Article 5(1) lists the six basic principles that controllers must
        comply with i processing personal data, including:

            1. Personal data shall be:

            ..(f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security
            of   the    personal     data,   including    protection § against

            unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental
            loss, destruction   or damage,    using appropriate     technical or
            organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’)

2.6.    Article  5(2)  GDPR    makes    i clear   that   the  “contro/ler  shall be

        responsible   for,  and   be  able   to demonstrate      compliance    with,
        paragraph   1 (‘accountability’)”.

2.7.    Chapter    IV,  Section    1 addresses      the   general   obligations    of

        controllers and processors. Article 24 sets out the responsibility of
        controllers for taking    appropriate   steps to ensure    and   be able to

        demonstrate    that processing    i compatible    with the GDPR.    Articles
        28-29   make    separate    provision   for the   processing    of data   by
        processors, under the instructions of the controller.

2.8.    Chapter IV, Section 2 addresses security of personal data. Article 32
        GDPR   provides:

            1. Taking    into account    the state   of the art, the costs     of
            implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes
            of processing    as well as the risk of varying likelihood and
            severity for the rights and freedoms       of natural persons,    the
            controller  and   the processor     shall implement     appropriate

            technical and organisational measures         to ensure   a level of
            security   appropriate    to  the  risk,  including   inter  alia  as
            appropriate:

               (a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;
               (b) the  ability  to   ensure    the  ongoing     confidentiality,

                   integrity,  availability  and    resilience   of  processing
                  systems and services;
               (C)...
               (d)a   process     for   regularly   testing,    assessing    and

                   evaluating     the   effectiveness     of    technical    and                  
                   organisational    measures    for ensuring   the security   of
                  processing.

            2. In assessing the appropriate level of security, account shall
            be  taken   in particular of the risks that are presented         by
            processing,    in   particular   from    accidental   or   unlawful
            destruction,  loss,  alteration,  unauthorised    disclosure  of, or

            access   to, personal   data  transmitted,   stored   or otherwise
            processed.

2.9,    Article 32 GDPR    applies to both controllers and processors.

        Penalties

2.10.   Article 83(1) GDPR     requires supervisory authorities to ensure that

        any   penalty    imposed     i   each   individual   case    i   “effective,
        proportionate and dissuasive".

2.11.   The principle that penalties ought to be effective, proportionate and
        dissuasive i a longstanding      principle of EU law. The Commissioner

        i under an EU law obligation to ensure         that infringements    of the
        GDPR   are penalised i a manner that i effective, proportionate and
        dissuasive.

2.12.   Further,   Recital  148   emphasises,     inter alia,  that  “in  order   to
        strengthen the enforcement of the rules of this Regulation, penalties

        including   administrative     fines   should    be   imposed     for   any
        infringement    of this   Regulation,   in addition    to,  or instead    of
        appropriate    measures     imposed     by   the   supervisory    authority

        pursuant to this Regulation.” I also records that due regard should
        be given to the:

             . nature,   gravity  and   duration   of the   infringement,    the
            intentional character of the infringement,        actions  taken  to
            mitigate the damage suffered, degree of responsibility or any
            relevant previous    infringements,    the manner     in which   the

            infringement    became    known   to the supervisory      authority,
            compliance    with measures    ordered against the controller or
            processor,   adherence    to a code   of conduct    and any    other
            aggravating   or mitigating factor...

2.13.   Recital 150 provides as follows:

            In  order    to  strengthen     and   harmonise     administrative
            penalties    for  infringements     of   this   Regulation,    each
            supervisory    authority  should   have    the  power    to impose           
            administrative     fines.   This   Regulation    should    indicate
           infringements and the upper limit and criteria for setting the
           related administrative fines, which should be determined by

            the competent supervisory authority in each individual case,
            taking into account all relevant circumstances of the specific
           situation, with due regard in particular to the nature, gravity
           and duration of the infringement and of its consequences and

            the measures taken to ensure compliance with the obligations
            under   this  Regulation   and   to  prevent    or  mitigate   the
           consequences     of the   infringement.    Where    administrative
           fines are imposed on an undertaking, an undertaking should
           be   understood    to be  an   undertaking   in accordance     with

           Articles  101   and   102   TFEU   for  those   purposes.   Where
           administrative fines are imposed on persons that are not an
            undertaking, the supervisory authority should take account of
            the general level of income    in the Member    State as well as
            the  economic   situation  of the   person   in considering    the

           appropriate amount     of the fine. The consistency mechanism
           may    also be  used   to promote    a consistent   application  of
           administrative fines. It should be for the Member        States to
           determine    whether   and   to which   extent public authorities
           should   be   subject   to administrative    fines.  Imposing    an

           administrative   fine or giving a warning     does not affect the
           application of other powers     of the supervisory authorities or
           of other penalties under this Regulation.

2.14.   In line with the above, when    deciding whether to impose a fine and

        the  appropriate   amount    of any   such   fine, Article  83(2)   GDPR
        requires the Commissioner to have regard to the following matters:

            (a) the nature,   gravity  and   duration   of the  infringement
               taking into account    the nature scope    or purpose    of the
               processing   concerned    as  well as the    number    of data
               subjects   affected and   the level of damage     suffered by
               them;

            (b) the intentional or negligent character of the infringement;

            (c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate

               the damage    suffered by data subjects;

            (d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor,
               taking into account technical and organisational measures
               implemented by them pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;            
               
            (e) any relevant previous infringements by the controller or
                processor;

            (f) the degree of co-operation with the supervisory authority,
                in order   to remedy     the infringement     and   mitigate  the
                possible adverse effects of the infringement;

            (g)the    categories     of  personal     data   affected    by    the
                infringement;

            (h) the manner     in which the infringement became        known    to
                the supervisory authority, including whether, and if so to
                what   extent,   the   controller  or processor     notified   the

                supervisory authority of the infringement;

            (i) where    measures      referred   to  in   Article  58(2)    have
                previously    been    ordered     against   the    controller   or

                processor    concerned    with regard    to the same     subject-
                matter, compliance     with those measures;

            (   adherence     to approved     codes   of conduct    pursuant    to

                Article 40 or approved certification mechanisms pursuant
                to Article 42; and

            (k) any other aggravating      or mitigating factor applicable      to

                the case,    including  financial benefits gained,     or losses
                avoided, directly or indirectly from the infringement. ®

2.15.   Article  83(5)    GDPR    provides    that   infringements    of the    basic

            operations  pursuant   to Article 62, in particular for carrying
            out investigations  or for monitoring   the implementation    of a
            measure   concerning a controller or processor established in
            another Member State.

            3.  The  lead   supervisory   authority   shall,  without   delay,

of their views.

4. Where any of the other supervisory authorities concerned
within a period of four weeks after having been consulted in
accordance    with paragraph     3 of this Article,  expresses    a

relevant and reasoned objection to the draft decision, the lead
supervisory authority shall, if i does not follow the relevant
and reasoned objection or is of the opinion that the objection
is not   relevant   or  reasoned,   submit   the  matter    to  the
consistency mechanism      referred to in Article 63.

5. Where the lead supervisory authority intends to follow the
relevant and reasoned objection made, i shall submit to the
other   supervisory   authorities   concerned    a revised    draft
decision for their opinion. That revised draft decision shall be

subject to the procedure referred to in paragraph       4 within a
period of two weeks.

6. Where none of the other supervisory authorities concerned
has  objected   to the draft decision    submitted    by the lead

authorities concerned    agree   to dismiss or reject parts of a

complaint   and   to act on other parts     of that complaint,    a

the matter.   The lead supervisory     authority shall adopt    the
decision  for the part concerning     actions  in relation  to the

           establishment of the controller or processor on the territory
           of its Member State and shall inform the complainant thereof,

            while the supervisory authority of the complainant shall adopt
            the decision for the part concerning dismissal or rejection of
            that complaint,   and shall notify i to that complainant      and
           shall inform the controller or processor thereof.

            10. After being notified of the decision of the lead supervisory

           authority pursuant to paragraphs       7 and 9, the controller or
           processor    shall  take  the  necessary    measures    to ensure
           compliance    with the decision as regards processing activities
           in the context    of all its establishments    in the Union.   The

           controller or processor shall notify the measures        taken  for
           complying with the decision to the lead supervisory authority,
            which   shall   inform   the   other    supervisory    authorities
           concerned.   .

2.21.   Article 60(4)   refers to the   consistency   mechanism,     which   i i

        Section 2 of Chapter VII GDPR.      Article 63 provides that: “In order
        to  contribute   to  the  consistent   application  of this   Regulation

        throughout   the Union,   the supervisory authorities shall cooperate
        with each other and, where relevant, with the Commission,        through
        the consistency mechanism      as set out in this Section.” Article 65

        GDPR   provides, insofar as relevant, that:

                  and reasoned objection to a draft decision of the lead

                  authority or the lead authority has rejected such         an
                  objection   as  being   not  relevant   or reasoned.    The

            Board are split, the decision shall by adopted by the vote of
            its Chair.

            4, The supervisory authorities concerned shall not adopt a
            decision on the subject matter submitted to the Board under
           paragraph    1 during the periods referred to in paragraphs        2

            and 3.

            5. The Chair of the Board shall notify, without undue       delay,

            notified the final decision referred to in paragraph 6.

            6. The lead supervisory authority or, as the case may be, the
           supervisory    authority  with   which  the complaint    has   been
            lodged  shall adopt    its final decision   on  the  basis  of the

            the case may    be, the supervisory authority with which        the

            complaint has been lodged, shall inform the Board of the date
            when its final decision is notified respectively to the controller

2.32.   On 4 May    2018,  the Commissioner      opened   a consultation   process
        on  how   the  Commissioner     planned    to discharge   her  regulatory
        powers   under the DPA. The consultation       attracted  responses   from

        across  civil society,  commentators,      and  industry   (including  the
        finance and insurance, online technology and telecoms, and charity

        sectors). The consultation ended on 28 June 2018. Having taken all
        the views received during the consultation process into account, the
        Regulatory Action Policy (the “RAP”) was submitted to the Secretary

        of State and laid before Parliament for approval.

2.33.   Pursuant   to section  160(1)   DPA,  the Commissioner      published  her

        RAP   on  7 November     2018.   Under   the  hearing   “Aims”,  the   RAP
        explains that i seeks to:

          e  “Set out the nature of the Commissioner’s         various powers    in

             one place and to be clear and consistent about when         and how
             we use them”;

          e  “Ensure that we take fair, proportionate and timely regulatory
             action with a view to guaranteeing that individuals’ information
             rights are properly protected”;

          e  “Guide   the Commissioner     and our staff in ensuring     that any
             regulatory action is targeted, proportionate and effective...”°

2.34.   The objectives of regulatory action are set out at page 6 of the RAP,
        including:

          e  “To respond swiftly and effectively to breaches        of legislation

             which fall within the ICO’s remit, focussing on \[inter alia\] those
             adversely affecting large groups of individuals”.

          e “To be effective, proportionate, dissuasive and consistent in our
             application of sanctions”, targeting action taken pursuant to the
             Commissioner’s      most.   significant   powers    on,   inter  alia,

             “organisations and individuals suspected of repeated or wilful
             misconduct or serious failures to take proper steps to protect
             personal data”.

1 RAP, page 5
                                                                                152.35.   The   RAP  explains   that the   Commissioner     will adopt   a selective

        approach to regulatory action.‘ When       deciding whether and how to
        respond   to  breaches    of information    rights  obligations   she   will
        consider criteria which include the following:

          e  “the nature and seriousness of the breach or potential breach”;

          e  “where    relevant,  the   categories   of personal    data  affected

             (including whether any special categories of personal data are
             involved) and the level of any privacy intrusion”;

          e  “the number of individuals affected, the extent of any exposure

             to physical, financial or psychological harm, and, where i is an
             issue, the degree of intrusion into their privacy”;

          e  “whether the issue raises new or repeated issues, or concerns
             that technological    security measures     are not protecting     the

             personal data”;

          e  “the cost of measures to mitigate any risk, issue or harm”;

          e  “the  public   interest  in regulatory    action  being   taken   (for

             example,    to provide    an   effective  deterrent   against   future
             breaches or clarify or test an issue in dispute)”.++

2.36.   The  RAP  explains  that, as a general   principle, “more   serious,  high-
        impact,   intentional,  wilful, neglectful   or repeated    breaches   can
        expect stronger regulatory action”.13

2.37.   Pages   24-25   of the RAP    identify the circumstances     i which    the
        issuing of a Penalty Notice will be appropriate.      They explain, inter

        alia, that i “   considering the degree of harm       or damage    we may
        consider that, where there is a lower level of impact across a large

        number   of individuals, the totality of that damage     or harm may be
        substantial, and may require a sanction.” The     RAP stresses that each
        case will be assessed     objectively  on its own    merits.  However,    i

        explains  that,  i accordance     with the Commissioner’s       risk-based
        approach,   a penalty i more     likely to be imposed   in, inter alia, the

        following  situations:

1 RAP, pages 10-11.
1 RAP, page 12.
                                                                                 16          e  “a number   of individuals have been    affected”;

          e  “there  has  been   a degree   of damage     or harm    (which  may

             include distress and/or embarrassment)”;       and

          e  “there  has   been   a failure   to apply   reasonable    measures
             (including relating to privacy by design) to mitigate any breach

             (or the possibility of it)”.

2.38.   The process the Commissioner will follow i deciding the appropriate

        amount    of penalty   to be   imposed    i described    from   page   27
        onwards.   In particular,  the  RAP   sets out the following    five-step
        process:

        a.   Step  1. An ‘initial element’   removing   any financial gain from
             the breach.

        b.   Step 2. Adding    i an element to censure the breach       based on

             its scale and  severity, taking   into account  the considerations
             identified at section 155(2)-(4) DPA.

        c    Step 3. Adding i an element to reflect any aggravating factors.

             A list of aggravating factors which the Commissioner would take
             into account, where relevant, i provided at page 11 of the RAP.

             This list i intended  to be indicative, not exhaustive.

        d.   Step 4. Adding    i an amount for deterrent effect to others.

        e.   Step 5. Reducing the amount      (save that i the initial element)

             to  reflect any   mitigating   factors,  including   ability to  pay
             (financial  hardship).  A list of mitigating    factors  which   the
             Commissioner     would   take  into  account,   where   relevant,  i

             provided  at page 11-12    of the RAP. This list i intended to be
             indicative, not exhaustive.

3. CIRCUMSTANCES              OF THE FAILURE:            FACTS

Marriott’s acquisition of the Starwood           network

3.1.   Marriot   acquired    Starwood     i   September     2016.    During   the
       acquisition  process,  Starwood   shareholders    received  0.8 shares of
       Marriott,  as well  as $21    per Starwood    common     stock.  After the

       acquisition, the Marriott and Starwood     computer systems were kept

                                                                               17       separate,   and   they   remained    separate   throughout    the  relevant

       period.  Marriott  did, however,    plan  on integrating   aspects   of the
       Starwood    network    into the   Marriott  network   over   an  18-month
       period i order to create a single, unified network within Marriott’s

       security footprint.

3.2.   Upon    acquisition,   but  prior  to  decommissioning      the  Starwood

       network, Marriott made     enhancements     to the security of Starwood’s
       existing IT network.

3.3.   During the acquisition process, Marriott states that i was only able

       to carry out limited due diligence on the Starwood        data processing
       systems    and  databases.'\*    For the   avoidance   of any    doubt,  the

       Commissioner     i not making    any finding   of infringement   in respect
       of the period    between   Marriott’s acquisition   of Starwood    and  the

       entry   into force  of the GDPR     on 25   May   2018.  Accordingly,   the
       Commissioner     has not determined whether or not i was possible for
       Marriott to conduct due diligence during a takeover. There         may   be

       circumstances    i which in-depth due diligence of a competitor i not
       possible during a takeover.

3.4.   This Penalty   Notice concerns    the extent to which,     after the GDPR
       came   into effect on 25 May 2018, Marriott adequately prepared the
       Starwood    systems    to protect   personal   data.  In particular,   i i

       necessary to assess whether the Attack disclosed a failure to ensure
       compliance with Articles 5.1(f) and 32 of the GDPR following its entry

       into force.

The planned integration of the Starwood              and Marriott networks

3.5.   The   integration  of Starwood    into the Marriott   hotels group   began

       following the acquisition. While this involved the transferring of data
       from   the Starwood    systems   to the  Marriott  network,   the  systems

       accessed    by the Attacker    remained   segregated    from  the Marriott
       network.

3.6.   As a result, the Attack did not involve access to the wider Marriott
       network   and the Attacker would      not have    had access   to personal
       data   that  was   processed    only  on   non-Starwood     systems.    The

       planned    migration    and  the   decommissioning      of the   Starwood

1 See, for example, the representations served by Marriott i response to the Commissioner’s Notice
of Intent (“Marriott's First Representatiopara 1.33.
                                                                                18       systems was expedited by Marriott after discovery of the Attack and

       the   decommissioning      of   the  relevant   Starwood     systems    was
       completed    on 11 December     2018.

The   Attack

3.7.    What follows i a summary       of the key stages of the Attack.

        Pre-acquisition infiltration of the Starwood    IT systems

3.8.    The Attacker installed a web shell on a device within the Starwood

        network   on 29 July 2014.       This  device  was   used  to support    an
        Accolade    software   application.   That   application   was    used   by
        Starwood   to allow employees     to request changes to any content of

        Starwood's website.

3.9.    The installation of a web    shell on the server gave the Attacker the

        ability to remotely    access  the system,    therefore  allowing   for the
        accessing   and  editing of the contents    of that system.   This access
        was exploited i order to install Remote Access Trojans (“RATS”)           -

        malware which     enables remote administrator control of the system.
        Administrator   access   allows a user to perform     actions above    that

        permitted   by a normal    user. As a result, the Attacker would      have
        had   unrestricted   access  to the   relevant   device,  and   any   other

        devices on the network to which that administrator account would
        have had access.

3.10.   On   an  undetermined     date,  the  Attacker   installed  and  executed

        “Mimikatz”.   This   i  a post-exploitation     tool  which   allows  login
        credentials   temporarily    stored   i   the  system    memory      to  be

        harvested.    I  scanned    the   server   for  all the  usernames     and
        passwords    stored  i this manner      i the system     and  allowed   the
        Attacker   to continue   to compromise      user  accounts,   which   were

        secured   using a mixture of single and multi-factor authentication.‘
        These   accounts were then used to perform        further reconnaissance

        and,  ultimately,   to run  commands      on  the  Starwood    reservation
        database,   as described  below.

3.11.   On  15 April 2015,    a file named    “Reservation \_Room\_sharer.dmp”
        was created on a Starwood      device. This file could have been created

1 Marriott’s First Representations, para 1.40 and page 63.
                                                                                 19        by the Attacker with a view to exfiltrating all the data contained       i

        the table at once.®

3.12.   On 21 April 2015, a file named     “Consumption\_Roomtype.dmp”         was
        created. This file could   have  been   created  by the Attacker with a

        view to exfiltrating all the data contained   i this table at once.!”

3.13.   On 17 May 2016, a file named “reservation\_Room\_Sharer.dmp” was

        created. This file could   have  been   created  by the Attacker with a
        view to exfiltrating all the data contained   i this table at once.\*®

3.14.   Following Marriott’s acquisition of Starwood,     on 31 December     2016

        or 1 January 2017,1° additional malware which searched devices for
        payment    card  data,  known   as “memory-scraping       malware”,   was

        installed on multiple Starwood Devices. Marriott believes, but cannot
        be certain, that this action was carried out by a different attacker to

        the one   responsible  for the actions   described   immediately   above.
        The memory-scraping      malware    was  executed   on 10 January    2017
        on eight property management        systems,   but the malware    was not

        successful i collecting payment     card data from any of the devices.
        The eight properties   involved were   not in the European    Union.

        Continued   Attack, post-acquisition and following the GDPR        coming

        into force

3.15.   On  7 September     2018,   the Attacker   performed   a “count”   on the
        “Guest\_Master\_profile”    table, which   would   have told the Attacker

        how many    rows the table contained.

3.16.   This count triggered an alert on the Guardium      system placed on the

        database   (“the  Guardium      Alert”).  Such   alerts were   applied  to
        tables which included card details.2°      The other tables mentioned
        above   did  not  contain  payment    card   information   and  were   not

        protected by Guardium     software. Thus, no alarm could be triggered
        by the actions of the Attacker.

Second Representations, page 37).
2 “Guardium” i a data protection software produced by IBM.
                                                                                203.17.   The Attacker also exported the “Guest\_Master\_profile” table into a

        “dmp” file (as had previously occurred i relation to the other tables
        referred to above).

        Discovery and reporting of the breach

3.18.   On  8 September      2018,   Accenture,   the   company    managing     the

        Starwood    Guest   Reservation   Base,   contacted   Marriott’s  IT team
        regarding the Guardium     alert of the previous day. This was the first

        Guardium    alert relating  to the Attack    that Marriott   had  received
        since its acquisition of Starwood.

3.19.   On  10 September     2018, the “PP\_Master”      table was exported     to a

        “dmp” file on the Starwood      system.

3.20.   Following  the  Guardium    alert, on  9/10   September    2018,   Marriott

        instigated  its Information   Security and   Privacy Incident    Response
        Plan. On   12 September     2018,   Marriott began   to deploy   real-time

        monitoring   and forensic tools on 70,000      legacy Starwood    devices.
        The purpose    of this measure   was to monitor the local system       and
        identify  potentially  malicious   activity i   real-time,  with   findings

        reported back to Marriott’s central monitoring server.

3.21.   On 15/16 September      2018, Marriott identified further unauthorised

        activity from   7 July   2018,  specifically  the  use  of credentials   of
        Accenture employees.

3.22.   On  17 September      2018,   the  presence   of a RAT     was  identified.

        Marriott took action to contain the RAT, by blocking the command-
        and-control IP addresses used by the RAT.

3.23.   In early to mid-October     2018, the Attacker’s use of Mimikatz      ona
        number of occasions since 2014 was identified, as was the memory-

        scraping  malware,    referred  to i paragraph     3.14.  On   29 October
        2018,   Marriott  contacted    the  United   States   Federal   Bureau   of
        Investigation.

3.24.   On 13 November      2018, two compressed,      encrypted   and previously
        deleted    files   were     identified.   These    files   were     named

        “guest\_master\_profile”     and “pp\_master”.     On  19 November      2018,
        the aforementioned files were decrypted, and i was found that they
        respectively contained    an export of the Guest\_Master\_Profile       table

        and the PP\_Master table.

                                                                                 213.25.   On  22 November      2018,   Marriott  notified the Commissioner      of a
        personal data breach.

3.26.   On   25  November     2018,   Marriott  discovered   that  a file  named
        “Reservation\_room\_sharer.dmp”        had  been   created  on a Starwood

        device,  and on 26 November      2018,  Marriott identified a second   file
        named   “Reservation\_room\_sharer.dmp” which had been created on
        a   Starwood     device,    and \_ established     that   a   file  mamed

        “consumption\_roomtype.dmp”        had also been created.

3.27.   On 30 November      2018, Marriott provided    a follow-up report to the

        Commissioner     regarding   further  personal  data   breaches.   On  the
        same   day,  Marriott  issued  a press   release  about   the Attack   and
        established   a dedicated   Starwood    incident website.   Marriott  also

        began   sending  email  notifications to affected   data subjects on 30
        November    2018.   In the initial email  notification to data subjects,

        Marriott informed them that a dedicated call centre had been set up
        i order to receive complaints. The email notification did not provide
        the telephone   number    for the call centre, however    i did contain a

        link to the dedicated website, which included the telephone number
        of  the  call  centre.   Following   telephone    contact   between    the

        Commissioner’s     office and   Marriott,  the  email   was   updated   to
        include the telephone    number   for the call centre, and Marriott sent
        the revised version on 9 December      2018.2!

4.PERSONAL          DATA     INVOLVED         IN THE FAILURE

4.1.    The  Attacker   appears    to have   obtained    personal   data  i   both
        encrypted   and   unencrypted    forms.  The   unencrypted    information
        included:

        a.   On the “Guest\_Master\_Profile\_table” file: a numerical identifier
             to identify   the  guest,  guest   name,    gender,   date  of birth,

             whether   the guest has been     identified as a VIP, whether     the
             guest i a member of the Starwood       loyalty programme    and their
             account information (“SPG”), mailing address, passport country

             code,  phone   number,   fax  number,    email  address,  and  credit
             card expiration date.

2 Marriott First Representations, page 65.
                                                                                22             On the “reservation\_room\_sharer\_table”:        a central reservation
             confirmation number, a unique numerical room identifier, guest

             name,   SPG   account   information,  whether   the guest has been
             identified   as  a VIP,    a  separate    VIP   code,   5.25   million

             unencrypted    guest passport numbers      (935,000    of which were
             passports associated with EEA member         state records), country
             of guest’s   passport,   arrival  time,  departure    date,  address,

             phone   and fax numbers,    email address,   whether   the guest has
             checked    in, flight  number    and  airline  code,  and   the  total

             number    of guests i the room.

             On    the    “consumption\_room\_type\_table”:           a   reservation

             confirmation   number,    the Guest    Master  profile ID, a unique
             numerical   room   identifier, room  type, number    of child guests,

             number    of adult guests,    number   of cribs used    i the room,
             number of rollaway beds designed for adults and the number of
             rollaway beds designed for children, guest arrival date;

             On the “PP\_master\_table”:      the passport number record specific

             decryption    key.  Marriott  considers   that   this would    not  be
             sufficient  to  decrypt   the   passport    numbers    as  a master
             encryption   key i also required, and does not appear to have

             been obtained by the attackers.

4.2.    The encrypted    information was as follows:

        a.   18.5 million encrypted     passport  numbers,   4,290,000    of which

             were associated with EEA member        state records.

             9.1  million  encrypted   payment    cards,  873,000    of which   are
             associated with EEA member       state records.2?

4.3.    Marriott’s estimate i that 339 million guest records were affected.

        Of these,   30.1  million were   EEA  records,\*\* of which    7 million are
        associated   with the United    Kingdom.    All data  subjects  who   were

        affected pre-GDPR were also affected by the actions of the Attacker
        post-GDPR,    as the   entire   contents   of the  affected   tables  were
        exported    to “dmp”    files  on  the   Starwood    system    each   time.

        individual data subjects.

5. PROCEDURE

5.1.   This section summarises      the procedural steps the Commission       has
        taken. The Annex     to this Penalty Notice provides a more      detailed
        chronology.

5.2.    Marriott notified the Commissioner     of the Attack on 22 November
        2018.  In response,  the Commissioner     commenced     an investigation

        into the incident. That investigation included various exchanges with
        Marriott and considering detailed submissions and evidence.

5.3.    On 5 July 2019, the Commissioner       issued Marriott with a Notice of

        Intent to impose    a penalty,  pursuant   to section   155(1)  DPA   and
        Schedule   16 of the DPA    (the “NOI”).    The  proposed   penalty was

        £99,200,396.00.

5.4.    Marriott made   written representations   in response  to the NOI on 23
        August  2019,   which  are referred   to i this Notice as “Marriott’s

        First Representations”.     Marriott did not request an opportunity to
        make  oral submissions.

5.5.    Between   August and October 2019, Marriott and the Commissioner
        exchanged   correspondence    about a number     of issues, including (a)
        the  application  of the  Commissioner’s     Draft  Internal  Procedure,

        which   i  discussed    further  below;   (b)  the   application   and/or
        operation  of the Article   60  GDPR    consultation   process;  and   (c)

        Marriott’s request for further opportunities to make     submissions    or
        representations prior to and during the Article 60 process.

5.6.    In a letter dated 6 December    2019, the Commissioner:

        a.   confirmed that she no longer intended to exercise her discretion
             to convene the Panel;

        b.   confirmed that the Draft Internal Procedure would not be taken
             into account  in setting any penalty imposed    on Marriott, having

             considered  the detailed representations     Marriott had made    on
             this issue i its First Representations. The letter confirmed that

             the Commissioner would continue to apply the EU and domestic

                                                                               24             legislative framework i conjunction with the Regulatory Action
             Policy;

        c    outlined   how   the  Article  60  consultation    process   would   be

             conducted    i this case; and

        d.   agreed    to  give   Marriot   the   opportunity    to  make \_ further

             representations on the Commissioner’s draft decision i Marriott
             agreed   to extend    the six-month     period  for the issuing    of a

             penalty notice prescribed i paragraph        2 of Schedule    16 of the
             DPA. The Commissioner        proposed   a new deadline of 31 March
             2020.

5.7.    The   Commissioner’s     position   on  these   issues  was   informed,    i
        particular,    by     careful    consideration      of    Marriott’s    First

        Representations.         Given    the   length    and    detail   of   those
        representations     and   the  overall   complexity    of the   case,   that
        consideration   took time and     considerable   resources.   That  process

        also resulted in changes     and clarifications to the form and content
        of the draft decision.

5.8.    The Commissioner      was also especially mindful of the fact that she
        acted as lead supervisory authority pursuant to Article 60 GDPR            i
        this case, and that i was therefore important that her investigation

        and   decision  be as comprehensive        as possible,    since  the  draft
        decision   must    be   submitted     for  the   consideration    of   other

        supervisory authorities pursuant to Article 60(3).

5.9.    Although   not required   by law, the Commissioner       considered   that a
        further   opportunity    for  Marriott  to   make    representations    was

        appropriate,   provided    that  an  agreement     could   be  reached    on
        extending   the statutory timetable     having   regard,  i particular, to:
        (   the complexity    of the case, (ii) Marriott’s representations,      and

        (iii) the fact that this i one of the first major decisions made      under
        the new EU data protection regime.

5.10.   Following    further   correspondence,      Marriott   confirmed     on   17
        December    2019   its agreement   to a statutory extension   of time to 31
        March   2020.   On  20 December      2019,   the Commissioner      provided

        Marriott with a draft decision, and    invited i to make    further written
        representations and to provide any other relevant evidence i wished

        the Commissioner     to take into account.
                                                                                  255.11.   On  31 January    2020,   Marriott  provided   further  detailed  written
        representations   on the Commissioner’s     draft decision (“Marriott’s

        Second   Representations”).

5.12.   On   12   February   2020,    the  Commissioner      wrote   to  Marriott
        requesting further information and documents which arose from her

        consideration of the Second    Representations.

5.13.   In  the   light  of  the   length   and   complexity    of  the   Second

        Representations,   on 13 February 2020 the parties agreed a further
        statutory extension   of time until 1 June 2020.

5.14.   Between   28 February 2020 and 28 April 2020, Marriott provided the

        Commissioner     with  the   information   she  had   requested    on  12
        February 2020.

5.15.   On 3 April 2020 the Commissioner       invited Marriott to make   further

        representations specifically i respect of the financial impact on its
        business  caused   by the Covid-19     pandemic.    Marriott  provided   a
        response  to this request on 17 April 2020.

5.16.   Due to the impact of the Covid-19      pandemic,   on 17 April 2020 the
        parties agreed  a further statutory extension of time for the issuing

        of a penalty notice to 30 September     2020.

6. CIRCUMSTANCES              OF THE FAILURE:            BREACHES

Marriott’s failures

6.1.    The Commissioner’s conclusion i that between        25 May 2018, when
        the GDPR   entered  into force, and 17 September    2018, Marriott failed

        to comply   with its obligations under Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32
        GDPR.   Marriott failed to process    personal  data  i a manner     that

        ensured   appropriate    security   of  the  personal    data,  including
        protection against unauthorised    or unlawful processing and against
        accidental loss, destruction or damage,     using appropriate technical

        and  organisational   measures    as required    by Article  5(1)(f)  and
        Article 32 GDPR.

6.2.    This section describes the specific failures to comply with the GDPR

        that the Commissioner     has found   and   responds  to Marriott’s First
        and Second    Representations   on the Commissioner’s      NOI and draft
        decision.

                                                                               26        The  relevant standard

6.3.    As set out above, Article 5 GDPR       requires that personal data shall

        be processed    in a manner    that ensures appropriate security of the
        personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful

        processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage,        using
        appropriate    technical    or  organisational     measures.     The   data
        controller, in this case Marriott, i responsible for, and must      be able

        to demonstrate compliance with, that requirement.

6.4.    Article 32 GDPR    concerns the security of processing       personal data

        and,   taking   into  account   the   state  of the    art,  the  costs   of
        implementation     and  the nature,    scope,  context   and   purposes   of
        processing as well as the risk of varying      likelihood and severity for

        the rights and freedoms     of natural persons, requires a controller to
        implement    appropriate    technical  and   organisational   measures    to
        ensure   a level of security   appropriate   to the risk. Such   measures

        may include encryption of personal data and a process for regularly
        testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of such technical

        and organisational measures.2°

6.5.    Not every instance of unauthorised      processing or breach of security
        will necessarily amount     to a breach   of Article 5 or Article 32. The

        obligation under Article 5 GDPR       i to ensure appropriate     security;
        the obligation under Article 32 i to implement appropriate technical

        and   organisational   measures    to ensure    an   appropriate   level  of
        security,  taking   account   of the   state   of the   art, the   costs  of
        implementation     and  the nature,    scope,  context   and   purposes   of

        processing, as well as the risk to the rights of data subjects.

6.6.    When   considering whether there has been a breach of the GDPR and

        whether   to impose     a penalty,   the Commissioner      must   therefore
        avoid   reasoning   purely  with  the   benefit  of hindsight.   The  focus
        should   be on the adequacy      and  appropriateness    of the measures

        implemented     by the data controller, the risks that were       known   or
        could reasonably have been identified or foreseen, and appropriate

        measures    falling within Article 5 and/or Article 32 GDPR      that were
        not, but could and should have been, i place.

                                                                                  2/6.7.    Having   carefully  examined    the  available  evidence,    including  the
        evidence     and    submissions      from     Marriott    and     Marriott’s

        Representations,    the  Commissioner      i satisfied   that  there  were
        multiple failures by Marriott to put i place appropriate technical or

        organisational    measures     to  protect   the   personal   data   being
        processed on Marriott’s systems, as required by the GDPR

6.8.    The NOI and draft decision identified a number of failures by Marriott

        to put i    place  appropriate   security  measures.    Following   careful
        consideration of the detailed representations received from Marriott,

        four principal failures by Marriott are now the subject of this Penalty
        Notice, which   are outlined  below.

        Preliminary issue: revised scope of the findings made

6.9.    In the NOI   and  the draft decision,  concerns   were   raised in relation

        to the gaps which the Attack identified i the application of multi-
        factor   authentication    (“MFA”)    within    the   relevant   Starwood

        network. The Attacker was able to access the Starwood          Cardholder
        Data   Environment    (“CDE”)    because   MFA   was   not applied   to a
        accounts and systems with access to the CDE.

6.10.   Marriott has explained that:

        a.   i believed that MFA was i place across the CDE because i had

             received   assurances    from   Starwood’s    management       to this
             effect;2° and

        b.   this belief was    corroborated   by two    Reports  on Compliance
             (“ROCs”),    issued  by independent     PCI DSS?’   assessors   on 29
             April   2016    (pre-acquisition)    and   23    May    2017    (post-

             acquisition),  which   stated  that MFA   was   i place for anyone
             requiring access into the segmented       CDE   and was enabled     on

             the jump-server v    ia                          2° Marriott placed
             particular reliance i its representations on 23 May 2017 report.

6.11.   Having considered, i particular,     Marriott’s Second   Representations

        i response    to the draft decision,\*? the Commissioner        i satisfied
        that  Marriott  did  not breach    its obligations  under   the GDPR     by

2 Marriott’s First Representations, para 1.40(a).
2 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”).
2 Marriott’s First Representations, para 1.40(b).
2 Marriott’s Second Representations, paras 3.2 - 3.7 and 3.20-3.24.
                                                                                 28       relying upon the ROCs   (in particular, the ROC issued i May 2017)
       issued by the PCI DSS assessors to conclude that access to the CDE
       was   protected   by  MFA   (albeit  erroneously).  The   incomplete
       implementation   of MFA  i not therefore the subject of this Penalty

       Notice (and consequently   was  not taken  into account i assessing
       the appropriate penalty).

       The four principal failures

6.12.  Taking  into account  the representations   made  by Marriott,\*° the
       following four principal failures are the subject of this Penalty Notice.

       (1)   Insufficient Monitoring of Privileged Accounts

6.13.  As explained  above, the Attacker was able to obtain access to the

       CDE   by exploiting an unknown   gap  i the scope   of application of
       MFA.  This failure to secure the ‘outer ring’ of the CDE   i not the
       subject of this Penalty Notice. Instead, i i of concern that once the

       Attacker  gained  access  to the   CDE,  appropriate  and  adequate
       measures   were  not i place to allow for the identification   of the
       breach   and  to prevent   further unauthorised   activity (including
       further unauthorised   processing  of personal  data). This  concern

       arises first i respect of Marriott’s failure to put i place appropriate
       Ongoing   monitoring   of  user   activity, particularly activity  by
       privileged accounts.

6.14.  Marriott had itself determined that there was insufficient monitoring
       o p rivleged u sr a ccount|

       Whilst  Marriott did deploy  a Security  Operations  Centre  (“SOC”)

       P      E     ,             this was insufficient for the reasons given
       at para 6.23  below.

6.15.  The  National Cyber  Security  (“NCSC”)  guidance,  published  on 17

       November   2018, entitled “10 Steps to Cyber Security: Guidance on
       how organisations can protect themselves in cyberspace,     including
       the 10 steps   to cybersecurity",  lists “monitoring” as one  of the
       relevant steps. I explains the importance of monitoring to detecting

3 See,for exampleMarriott’s SecRepresentationparas2.2(b)-(c3.1(b)3.8-3.13and
3.25-3.29.
                                                                   ee
                                                                          29        or  responding    to  attacks   which   have   already   taken   place   or
        commenced:

            Detect    attacks: Either    originating    from     outside’   the
            organisation or attacks as a result of deliberate or accidental
            user  activity.  Attacks   may    be  directly  targeted   against
            technical infrastructure   or against   the services   being   run.

            Attacks   can  also  seek   to  take   advantage    of legitimate
            business services, for example by using stolen credentials to
            defraud payment services.

            React to attacks: An effective response to an attack depends

            upon  first being aware    than an attack has happened        or is
            taking place. A swift response is essential to stop the attack,
            and to respond and minimise the impact or damage          caused.

            Account    for   activity: You    should     have    a   complete
            understanding of how systems, services and information are

            being used by users. Failure to monitor systems and their use
            could lead to attacks going unnoticed and/or non-compliance
            with legal or regulatory requirements.?2

6.16.   The  NCSC   guidance   also explains that monitoring     activities should

        include,  inter alia,   the  monitoring    of network    traffic and  user
        activity. This NCSC   guidance builds upon earlier guidance published
        by the NCSC    which i to similar effect. See, for example, the NCSC

        guidance entitled “Introduction to identity and access management”
        published i January 2018?       which refers to: (a) “basic principles to

        follow when    designing  user access    management”;     and   (b) “basic
        architectural good practice when designing and administering access
        management     systems”.   Such  basic principles and practices include

        “operations   and    monitoring    -  the   supporting    processes    and
        technology to identify and enable investigation of breaches of policy

        or controls”. The guidance explains that:

            Given  the high value to an attacker of compromising          your
            identity and   access  management      systems    they should    be
            given priority for security maintenance.    This means, amongst

            other things, prompt    application   of security patches   across
            your   estate   (or  otherwise    mitigating    security   issues),
            practicing good   user and privileged user management,         and

to-cyber-security/the-10-steps/monitoring

                                                                                30            applying   appropriate   protective  monitoring.   Additionally,  we
            recommend:

           e designing     your   access   control   systems    to allow   for easy
               monitoring of account usage and accesses
           e being able to tie all user actions in the system to the user that

               performed them...”

6.17.   Both examples     of NCSC   guidance detail the basic need for multiple

        security techniques,    processes and technologies      i order to secure
        systems.    Accordingly,    Marriott ought   to have   been   aware   of the

        need   to have    multiple   layers   of security   i   place  i   order   to
        adequately    protect  personal   data. Although     Marriott  had  assured
        itself that i had    MFA   i place\*\* (which,     as explained   above,   the

        Commissioner     accepts that Marriott did), and had certain additional
        security measures     i place, this was not sufficient. Marriott ought to

        have   had  i  place  better monitoring     of user activity to aid i the
        detection of an attack, as an additional layer of security.

6.18.   A forensic    report  into  the   incident,  dated   11  April  2019,    was

        commissioned     by Marriott and    prepared   by Verizon    (the “Verizon
        Report”).    I  notes   that  Marriott   had   not  configured   logging   i

        respect of “access to systems and/or applications within the CDE.”?°
        Marriott  did   have  the   results  of the   ROCs   and   its own   annual

        penetration     tests.   However,      these    did   not    evaluate’   the
        appropriateness    of the way    i which   Marriott monitored     (including
        through   logging) the Starwood      system   or the configurations     used

        for any such monitoring     (including logging).   Logging configurations
        are not within the scope of these tests. This i not a criticism of the

        ROCs or the penetration tests themselves.        Rather i reflects the fact
        that Marriott   ought   to have   taken   steps  to irmplement    measures
        which would identify vulnerabilities which the ROCs and penetration

        tests   would     not   identify.   Such    steps    would     include   the
        implementation     of effective     monitoring   (including   logging)   and

        alerts as part of Marriott’s wider security measures.       This i the gap
        identified by the Verizon Report.

6.19.   In  this  case,   appropriate   monitoring    would    have   included   the

        appropriate    logging   of  user   activity,  especially   i   relation   to
        privileged users. The logging of user activity once within the CDE, i

                                                                                  31        addition to the logging done by the Guardium        software, would have

        aided i the detection of unusual account activity (such as where, i
        this case,   the Attacker    regularly  utilised legitimate   accounts   to
        perform unauthorised user activity within the CDE). Marriott's failure

        to log user activity i this way was inconsistent with its obligations
        under the GDPR.

6.20.   Marriott states that “no amount      of logging would necessarily have
        identified an attacker unless the attacker operated from an identified
        suspicious IP address,    which is not the case in this matter.’\*© I i

        right to say that no security      measure    “would   necessarily”  work,
        there  being   no  guarantee    that  any   security  measure    i wholly

        effective. I i also true that i i harder to detect an attacker who i
        not  operating    from   a suspicious    IP address.    However,    this  i

        precisely why the monitoring of legitimate user accounts (including
        through  logging)  within the network   for unusual   activity i vital. This
        i recognised    by the NCSC,    which states i relation to monitoring:

        “these solutions should provide both signature-based capabilities to
        detect known    attacks, and heuristic capabilities to detect unusual

        system behaviour".?’

        (2)    Insufficient Monitoring of Databases

6.21.   In addition to the insufficient monitoring     of user accounts    and the
        user activity linked to those accounts, Marriott failed to adequately

        monitor    the  databases    within   the  CDE.    In  this  respect,   the
        Commissioner     i concerned     by the    following  three  failures:  (a)

        deficiencies i Marriott’s setup of security alerts on databases within
        the CDE;   (b) the failure to aggregate logs; and (c) the failure to log

        actions taken on the CDE      system, such as the creation of files and
        the exporting of entire database tables.

6.22.   Marriott deployed   IBM Guardium     to monitor activity on the database

        within the CDE. As configured      by Marriott, IBM Guardium      had two
        functions.  First, i logged   activity (such as efforts to create, read,

        update, or delete data within a database). Secondly, i issued alerts
        i certain circumstances.     The problems with the approach       adopted
        are as follows.

° Marriott’s Second Representations, para 3.39.
3 NCSC “10 Steps to Cyber Security” Guidance, dated2018:ovember
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps-to-cyber-security/the-10-steps/monitoring
                                                                                 326.23.   With respect to logging, there were two main problems:

        a.   First, whilst Marriott had a security incident event management

             system (“SIEM”) and a SOC to collect the logs being generated
             by the system, Marriott did not ensure sufficient logging of key

             activities such as user activity or actions taken on a database.
             The insufficient logging rendered the SIEM and SOC ineffective.
             Marriott also insufficiently logged i other areas of its network,

             such as firewall and access logs.

        b.   Second,    Marriott  did  not engage    i    server   logging  of the
             creation   of files  (or  alternatively   i did   not  use   the  IBM
             Guardium     software   i   a similar   way),   which    allowed   the

             Attacker to export entire databases to ‘dmp’ files undetected.
             Such logging i likely to have been feasible for Marriott as such

             mass export of data does not regularly occur within the normal
             course of business so as to generate        an unhelpful   number   of
             false-positives.  This form   of logging   on the system,     and  the

             evaluation of the created     logs, could have enabled     Marriott to
             detect unexpected     activity within the CDE.

6.24.   In response to the concerns raised, Marriott has referred to its use
        of Proventa and McAfee’s IntruShield (two systems which generate
        and aggregate logs).\*® These are not, however, sufficient to address

        the risks faced by the Starwood      network.   McAfee’s Intrushield aids
        in the   detection   of zero-day,    DoS   attacks,  spyware,    malware,

        botnets and VoIP threats, while Proventia operated         as an intrusion
        detection system.    Like Proventa, IntruShield     does not address the
        shortcomings     identified  above,   namely    the   failure  to  monitor

        database activity and user actions on network devices.

6.25.   Marriott stated   i its First Representations,    and the Commissioner
        agrees, that such logging would not have prevented the Attack i of

        itself, but “merely informs a response once the system         operator is
        aware   of the malicious     activity”.7°  However,    regular  and   close

        monitoring   and evaluation of logs can assist i the early detection
        of attacks, their mitigation,    and the prevention     of future attacks.
        That Marriott did not detect the Attack until alerted by Guardium         i

3 Marriott’s Second Representations, para 3.40.
3 Marriott’s First Representations, para 1.61.
                                                                                 33        indicative of Marriott failing regularly to test, assess, and evaluate
        the effectiveness of its security measures.

6.26.   With   respect  to the Guardium      alerts, the   problem   was   that the
        circumstances     i  which   IBM   Guardium     would   issue  alerts  were

        limited i a way which undermined        its ability to detect unauthorised
        activity within the databases.

6.27.   In particular,   alerts  were   only  placed   on  tables  that  contained

        payment    card  information,   and  only specific queries    (where   table
        names    were   directly  referenced,   such   as i   a count)    triggered

        warnings i the system. Although the database as a whole did have
        some    protection   from   Guardium,\*2      the  known    actions   of the
        Attacker prior to 7 September      2018 did not meet the conditions for

        the triggering   of an alert.\*4   Marriott   has  explained   that  specific
        alerting  rules  and  tables   were  chosen    i order   to reduce    false-

        positives.  However,    this explanation     i insufficient  to justify   an
        approach    where   only tables   including    payment    card   data  were
        placed   within  the  scope   of Guardium     rules.  Marriott’s  focus   on

        payment     card   information    illustrates  a   failure  to  implement
        appropriate   technical   and  organisational    measures    to ensure    an

        appropriate level of overall security for all other personal data.

6.28.   A risk-based approach     was required    i this case (as acknowledged
        i para 1.45 of Marriott's First Representations).      Payment card data

        i likely to be the highest risk category,      and the tables containing
        payment    card  data   could  therefore   warrant   higher  security than

        other tables depending      on the sensitivity of the other data       held.
        However,    while a risk-based    approach   may   require payment     card
        data   to have   additional   security  alerts,  this does   not justify   a

        complete    lack of alerts on tables containing      other  personal   data.
        Moreover, the other data held may vary i its sensitivity, requiring
        different  security  measures    to be applied     to the tables/relevant

        processing.

6.29.   Marriott stated that i reasonably assumed,       based upon the PCI DSS

        testing results, that the Guardium     alerts i respect of the CDE were
        appropriately configured.\*2 However,       the PCI DSS    tests concerned

40 Namely i terms of detecting unauthorised access based on IPs or failed login attempts, which the
Attacker i this incident bypassed through comprouser credentials.
+ As confirmed by Marriott in its correspondence dated 20 D2018, page 6.
4 Marriott’s First Representations, paras 1.43-44.
                                                                                  34        the perimeter    defences   against  an attack   rather than   monitoring
        systems   concerned    with    the detection   of an attacker    who   had

        already   penetrated    the   CDE.    The   tests  did   not  assess    the
        appropriateness of the discriminatory application of the alerts across

        the CDE segment, nor what this meant for the security of categories
        of personal data stored i tables which did not contain payment card
        information.   They    do   not,  therefore,   provide    the  reasonable

        assurance which Marriott claims.

6.30.   Finally,  Marriott  suggested    that   because   i believed     MFA   was

        implemented     across  the CDE,    this rendered    its reliance  on that
        authentication    tool   and   the   Guardium     alerts   as \_ configured
        reasonable and therefore i compliance with Articles 5(1)(f) and 32

        GDPR.   This  i not accepted,    monitoring   (including  logging)   of the
        types discussed    i paras 6.13 to 6.29 above      are standard    security

        measures.   Control of access through    MFA does not displace the need
        for adequate   monitoring   (including logging) of activities that assist
        i detecting a breach once i i i train (see paras 6.15-6.17 above).

        (3)   Control of critical systems

6.31.   As  discussed   at paragraphs     6.13-6.30   above,   Marriott   failed to
        ensure   that the actions taken     on its systems    were   appropriately

        monitored.   In addition to the use of monitoring and security alerts,
        i would   have been appropriate for Marriott to implement        a form of
        server  hardening    as a preventative     measure,    which   could  have

        prevented    the   Attacker   from   gaining   access   to  administrator
        accounts and performing      reconnaissance before traversing across a
        network.

6.32.   In particular, the implementation     of whitelisting i one way   in which
        Marriott could   have  performed    server hardening.    Whitelisting  i a

        form of programming     which only allows certain users or IP addresses
        to access certain systems or software, as required for their specific
        role. I i important i reducing attack surfaces and reducing the risk

        of attackers being able to traverse through a network after gaining
        entry to a single user account.

6.33.   Whitelisting   should   be  deployed    where    appropriate    on  critical
        systems, and those systems which have access to large amounts            of
        personal data. The NCSC Guidance states that: “you should develop

        a strategy   to remove     or disable   unnecessary    functionality  from

                                                                                 35        systems.”\*? Whitelisting i also described        i NCSC    Cyber Essentials

        guidance as a defence against malware.\*\* This supports advice given
        i earlier guidance by NIST. In October 2015 NIST published a guide

        to whitelisting    which   shows   how   whitelisting   can   be utilised  to
        prevent    unauthorised    software from    being installed on a device.\*°
        In  this   incident,  whitelisting   could   have   aided    i   halting  the

        reconnaissance and privilege escalation stage of the Attack.

6.34.   There are many forms of whitelisting. Binary software whitelisting i

        a form of access control where only authorised software and scripts
        can be installed on a given system or user areas. For example, only

        allowing pre-approved software such as Microsoft Word and Outlook
        to be installed on work laptops.     This can be distinguished from other
        forms of whitelisting, such as the process by which only authorised

        IP addresses can gain access to network resources.\*© Whilst i i not
        possible   to list the devices   i   relation to which    whitelisting  could

        have    been   appropriate,    at  a minimum       whitelisting   would    be
        expected    on:  (a) devices   which   could  be remotely     accessed;   (b)

        devices   which   store large amounts      or, or sensitive categories     of,
        personal   data;   (c) any   other  systems    which   Marriott  regards   as

        ‘critical’ to their network    operations;   (d) any   POS   terminals   at a
        property level; and any other devices which         process payment      card
        transactions.\*”? The   implementation     of binary software     whitelisting

        would   — i correctly implemented       - have  prevented    the installation
        and execution    of a RAT. While i i true that the RAT was installed

        and executed on the system both pre-acquisition and pre-GDPR, and
        was therefore    not attributable to Marriott, the continued      absence   of

        whitelisting   post-GDPR     left the  systems    for which    Marriott  was
        responsible vulnerable to further RAT installations and executions.

6.35.   Marriott   stated  i   its First Representations     that  binary   software

        whitelisting was rarely implemented       by companies at the time of the

        However,    binary  software   whitelisting   was  a well-recognised     and
        established security practice for some       time before the GDPR      came

        into force,   and  certainly  by that date. The      NCSC    Guidance    lists
        whitelisting (“prevent unknown       software from being able to run or

        install itself...") as a “Cyber Essential”. That guidance was published
        in October   2015,   and  therefore  pre-dates   the GDPR.\*°    In addition,

        there i guidance     published   by the National Institute of Standards
        and Technology (“NIST”), which recognises whitelisting as a better
        option than anti-malware.°° The NIST Guidance was published                i

        2015,   and therefore    significantly pre-dates   the implementation      of
        the GDPR.

6.36.   Marriott also stated i its First Representations that binary software
        whitelisting could be circumvented       by attackers ‘side loading’ RATS

        by using legitimate executable      code.>! Whitelisting,   like all security
        measures,    cannot   be entirely  resistant to attack.   However,    where

        side-loading did take place i the Attack, that appears to have been
        because    Marriott’s   systems    vaguely    or  improperly    specified   a

        dynamic-link    library (DLL) which allowed such side-loading to take
        place.°\* Whilst Marriott i right to suggest that these are risks which
        cannot be fully eliminated from any third-party software,>? this only

        highlights the fact that Marriott ought to have carried out regular
        audits,   updates    of  software    and   restricted  file  and   directory

        permissions. The existence of outdated/obsolete software i also an
        issue noted i both the 2017 and 2018 PCI DSS            Reports, and these

        could have been mitigated by properly reacting to issues discovered
        i the penetration tests.

6.37.   In any event, no single security measure        can fully protect a system
        against attack or compromise.        I would   have been appropriate for

        Marriott to have implemented      a ‘defence i depth’ strategy, of which
        whitelisting could   play an important     role, i order to protect their
        systems    against  attack   and  monitor   activity on their network      i

                                                                                  37        order to promptly     mitigate   any unauthorised     or malicious    actions

        that managed     to bypass their security controls.

6.38.   The   measures    discussed   above   are readily available     and   mature
        solutions (i.e. solutions that have been known        about i the industry

        for a long period    of time), which    are appropriate     and  could  have
        been   implemented     by Marriott,   to the extent     necessary,   without

        entailing excessive cost or technical difficulties. However,        i i only
        suggested     that   whitelisting    (or  equivalent     server   hardening
        measures which would limit the functionality of systems to only that

        which   i required of them)     could be appropriately deployed        on (a)
        critical systems which attackers may target whilst looking to access

        other, sensitive areas of the network,        or (b) systems    which   could
        access    other    (separate)    systems     containing     personal    data.

        Therefore, i would be appropriate to implement a server hardening
        measure     across    devices   with   access    to  the   CDE,    the   CDE
        environment    itself and any other network devices that could access

        either large quantities or sensitive categories of personal data.

        (4)    Encryption

6.39.   Payment    card   data  and,  i some     cases,  passport   numbers,    were

        encrypted     by   Marriott   using   AES-128,     an   industry    standard
        encryption   algorithm.   Oracle databases     (the Starwood     reservation
        database included tables stored i an Oracle database) provided the

        functionality to encrypt table entries in this way, and i was Marriot’s
        responsibility to ensure this was configured correctly.

6.40.   However,    i keeping    with Marriott’s focus on PCI DSS       compliance,
        encryption was not applied to other categories of personal data. The

        Commissioner      i   particularly   concerned     that   not  all  passport
        numbers    were encrypted.

6.41.   In its First and Second    Representations,     Marriott stated that i had

        adopted    a mature    and   risk-based   approach   to cyber    security  by
        targeting   its security  efforts on the tables     containing    cardholder

        information.\*\*    In support    of its position,   Marriott  relied  upon   a
        selective   quotation    from    the   NCSC     Guidance     i   its  written

Representations.
                                                                                   38        submissions.   However,   the Commissioner     notes that the full quote
        provides as follows:

             In some   scenarios, the use of encryption     to protect bulk data
             should be the norm.     For example,    where   data is transmitted

             over the internet, stored on a laptop, or stored on removable
             media.  However,    encryption relies on good key management,
             and in some    scenarios i is challenging to engineer a solution

             which makes    meaningful use of encryption to protect personal
             data. This is sometimes    the case in systems    which are always

             online, where   data needs    to be available to query. In these
             scenarios,    your   systems    architects   and   designers     will
             need to think carefully about how encryption can be used

             in a meaningful     way.”

6.42.   However,   Marriott  has  not provided    any  risk assessments     which

        demonstrate the evaluative judgement i arrived at and the rationale
        for its approach to the encryption of personal data. On the contrary,
        Marriott has taken an inconsistent approach by encrypting some but

        not all passport   numbers.   In addition,   while  i may   be true that
        cardholder   information   i of higher   risk than  other categories    of

        personal  data, this does not vitiate the risk to other categories of
        personal data. Thus, while the NCSC      guidance quoted     above, does
        not say that Marriott i required to implement encryption across all

        personal  data,  i does   require Marriott to explain why     i chose   to
        selectively encrypt data.°® Even i Marriott reasonably believed that

        the CDE   was  protected   by MFA,   i was   aware  - or ought to have
        been aware - that no system      i fully secure.>’

6.43.   Marriott, i its First Representations, also claimed that i would have

        been  impractical for i to have encrypted      any more    personal  data
        than i did.°° However     a number   of methods    exist to facilitate the
        identification of the user to which    a piece of data    refers, so that

        decryption   of personal    data  can  take   place  quickly  and   when
        necessary.   One  method    i through   the use of a unique     identifier

        (such  as an   UUID),   which   can   aid i   querying   and  decrypting
        individual pieces of data associated with individual customers where
        required  i   almost   real-time.  There  are  also  Hardware    Security

6.48.    In   addition    to  the    arguments      referred    to   above,     Marriott’s
         Representations      raised   a number      of more     general    legal  and/or

         factual arguments. This section addresses the following submissions
         made   by Marriott:

          oy   First, that the Commissioner        had assessed the issue of breach
              without reference to “any clear standards”°! reasoned with the

               benefit of hindsight and      regarded    the fact that the Attack was
              successful    as an    indicator   that the security      measures     were

               inappropriate.°\*    Marriott   claims    that  the   Commissioner       has
              applied an “impossibly high standard of care”.°?

          Ss  Second,      that   the  Commissioner       failed   to apply    a holistic

              approach.

          a   Third,     that   the   Commissioner       impermissibly      relied   upon

               Marriott’s  pre-GDPR     conduct,    and   incorrectly concluded      on a
               provisional basis that Marriott had failed to carry out sufficient

              and appropriate due diligence.

          Qo.  Fourth, that the Commissioner          erred i referring to Article 25
              GDPR    i the NOI.®

          @    Fifth, that the Commissioner        erred i reaching the provisional
              view    i the NOI     that Marriott     had   breached    the notification

               requirement under Article 33 of the GDPR.°”

              i the NOI that Marriott’s notification to data subjects breached
              Article 34 of the GDPR.®

6.49.   In its First and Second      Representations,    Marriott also advanced      a
        number of points i relation to: (a) the Commissioner’s approach to

        determining whether to impose a penalty; and (b) her methodology
        i calculating the proposed      penalty as set out i the Notice of Intent

        and the draft decision. These arguments are addressed            i Section 7
        below.

        (1) The correct approach/standard

6.50.   Marriott claims that: (a) the Commissioner’s          factual findings were
        inaccurate;    and/or    (b)  the  Commissioner      cannot    maintain    the
        conclusion   that appropriate    measures     were  available that Marriott

        failed to take to remove     and/or mitigate the risk of an attack of the
        kind   which   occurred   i   this case    because   she   had   applied   the

        incorrect standard or approach.®?

6.51.   In the analysis set out above, the Commissioner has clarified certain

        factual  findings   made    i the Notice    of Intent   i the light of the
        submissions     made     by   Marriott   i   both   its  First  and   Second

        Representations, including by, i particular, clarifying her position i
        respect of the incomplete application of MFA.

6.52.   Further,   paragraphs    6.3-6.8 above,    provide an accurate summary
        of   the   position   on   the   relevant   standard     and   set   out   the

        Commissioner’s response to Marriott’s argument that she applied an
        incorrect, unduly high, inappropriate or unclear standard i the NOI
        and/or draft penalty notice. The analysis set out i Section 6 above

        clearly explains the basis for the finding that Marriott failed to put i
        place appropriate     security arrangements      as required   by the GDPR

        by reference to the specific facts of this case. Contrary to the claims
        made    i Marriott’s First Representations, the Commissioner          has not

        applied    a   one-size-fits-all   approach     to   what    measures      are
        appropriate to secure different types of personal data.”°

RepresentationsExecutive Summary,,para 3.1.3—1.5  and  1.39-1.70; and Marriott’sSecond

                                                                                    426.53.   As the Commissioner      has set out above,    and  as she set out in the

        NOI, there were    a number    of appropriate    measure(s)   available to
        Marriott that an organisation of its scale would     be expected to take
        to secure   its data   operations.   Contrary   to the   claims  made    by

        Marriott,  this Penalty   Notice  (nor the NOI/draft     decision)  do not
        proceed on the basis that simply because the Starwood         system was

        the  victim  of the   Attack,   i follows   that  Marriott  breached    the
        GDPR.’! The reasoning     supporting this Penalty Notice, and the NOI
        and draft decision, does not adopt such a simplistic approach.

6.54.   For   essentially    the   same \_ reasons,      contrary    to   Marriott’s
        submissions,’\* the Commissioner’s findings do not involve applying

        the benefit of hindsight i an improper manner, or at a         (as already
        explained above). The Commissioner i satisfied that there were four

        distinct weaknesses     i   Marriott’s system    each  of which    Marriott
        ought to have    identified and   remedied,   using one of the range of
        options    available   to    Marriott   (as   discussed     above).    The

        Commissioner     does   not  rely on   the  ‘success’   of the  Attack   as
        evidence that a breach of the GDPR definitely occurred. Instead, the

        Attacker’s   ability  to  exploit  deficiencies   i   Marriott’s   security
        measures,    for  which   remedies    were   available,   discloses  wider
        failures to put appropriate     measures    i place.   In particular,   the

        failure to encrypt all passport numbers      was inadequate. There was
        also a failure to place Guardium      alerts on tables other than those

        which  contained   payment    information, thereby allowing the attack
        to go on undetected for a longer period.

6.55.   At para 1.12 of its First Representations,      Marriott also claims that
        there i no basis for the suggestion that, under the GDPR,          i ought
        to have   identified the type of Attack which      i the subject    of this

        Notice, or carried out any further improvements         on the Starwood
        systems,   because   the system    was   the “victim   of a sophisticated

        attacker, which adopted a multi-vectored approach to its attack and
        was able to circumvent numerous        protections that were in place”.
        However, the sophistication or specific vector of the attack i not the

        relevant focus. A controller has to implement appropriate measures
        to ensure   the security   of its systems.    The   measures    mentioned

        above could have been implemented         using standard   industry tools,
        and could have prevented, detected and/or mitigated the impact of

7 Marriott’s First Representations, §§1.8-1.9.
7 See, i particular, Marriott’s SRepresentations, paras 3.15-3.18.
                                                                                 43        the Attack. What the Attack disclosed was the failure by Marriott to
        put i place appropriate security measures to address attacks of this

        kind and/or other identifiable risks to the system.

6.56.   Furthermore,   Marriott was wrong     to state’? that the fact that the

        relevant Starwood    IT system   was due to be retired shortly means
        that i was   not necessary to put i place the types of appropriate
        measures   identified above   i order to comply    with Articles 5(1)(f)

        and/or 32 GDPR.

6.57.   In particular, Marriott relies on the fact that i originally intended to

        decommission    the Starwood    system   i the first quarter of 2018   i
        response  to the concerns    raised about its security measures.     I i
        important  to note that the intended     decommissioning     was  due to

        take  place approximately    a year and    half after the acquisition  of
        Starwood,   a long period of time during which data continued to be

        processed on the system. In fact, the intended decommissioning        did
        not take place i the first quarter of 2018; the timetable was altered
        such that i was only to be achieved     by the end of 2018. Whilst the

        Commissioner accepts that Marriott could not have known about the
        delay to the decommissioning       timetable  at the outset,’\*   i early

        2018  Marriott was aware that the GDPR      was coming    into force and
        that i would    be continuing   to process   data within  the Starwood
        network   for a number    of months    after that.  During  this period,

        appropriate monitoring    (including logging), and alerting tools could
        have  been   implemented    relatively quickly  i order to secure     the
        systems until their decommissioning     at the end of 2018.

6.58.   Many of the measures     identified i the discussion of the 4 principal
        errors above   could  have  been   easily implemented    as part of the

        security improvements which Marriott was already making over this
        period. With  regards to logging, the appropriate      changes   to what
        was i fact being logged could have been made        as part of Marriott’s

        SIEM  and SOC    projects. No additional steps as part of the “general
        IT lifecycle process” would have been required.”°    Similarly, changes

        to the Guardium     alert settings  could  have   been  made   relatively
        quickly  and   easily   when   IBM    Guardium    was    deployed.   The
        appropriate    server    hardening    measures     could    have    been

7 Marriott’s Second Representations, para 3.32-3.36.
7 Marriott’s Second Representations, paras 3.35-3.36.
7 Marriott’s Second Representations, para 3.38.
                                                                               44        implemented    within  6-12  months    (depending   on which   measures
        Marriott selected and how i chose to implement them).

6.59.   The  fact that an IT system     i due to be retired shortly does      not
        disapply the GDPR to the data being processed through that system.

        Marriott  was   still obliged to decide   what   appropriate   measures
        should  be i place i the light of the continued      use of the system.
        While the fact that a system      i to be decommissioned       may   be a

        relevant factor i determining what measures would         be appropriate
        i a given case, this ultimately does not remove the basic obligation

        to put i place security measures      appropriate to the risk posed    by
        the continued processing. This may mitigate against, for example, a
        requirement   that a controller,   even  one   of the size and   scale of

        Marriott, put i place expensive,     state-of-the-art measures,    where
        the system   i to be decommissioned       i the near future. However,

        where   other appropriate   measures    are available without    entailing
        disproportionate   cost or delay, they should    be put i place i they
        are required  to ensure   a level of security appropriate    to the risks

        posed   by continued   processing.   As explained    above,  the specific
        measures    identified i the discussion    of the four principal   errors

        above  are all ones which    could  have  been   put i place i a short
        amount   of time, and which would not have entailed excessive cost.

        (2) A holistic approach

6.60.   The Commissioner has had regard to Marriott’s detailed submissions

        on the security   measures    i had   i place generally,    and  those   i
        implemented     after  its limited  due   diligence   on  the   Starwood
        systems.’©   However,   the investigation   has identified a number     of

        appropriate   measures    or steps  that should    have  been   taken  by
        Marriott to address   the identified security risks within its system.

        The Attack,   and/or  other attacks which    could  have   occurred  as a
        result of the deficiencies   i Marriott’s   systems,   identified  above,
        mean    that,  even   judged    holistically, Marriott’s  technical   and

        organisational  data security arrangements      cannot   be regarded    as
        sufficient or appropriate.

6.61.   The Commissioner     has also considered Marriott’s submissions about
        the improvements      made   to Starwood’s    systems   post-acquisition,
        which   are  said  to   show   that  i engaged      i  appropriate    due

7 See, i particular, para 1.35 and paras 1.39-1.70 of Marriott’s First Representations.
                                                                               45        diligence.’”” However, i i notable that none of those steps identified

        the relevant,   easily detectable,   deficiencies   i Marriott’s security,
        which could have been easily addressed         but were exploited during
        the   Attack.   Marriott’s   submissions     i   this   regard   focus   on

        improvements     i made to its own systems, and which the Starwood
        systems / data would      benefit from when    they were migrated     to its

        network (paras 1.35(b)-(c) of Marriott’s First Representations).        But
        this does not meet the concern that Marriott continued          to use the
        Starwood    system   without   remedying    the clear deficiencies    i its

        security arrangements.     I i clear from Marriott’s Representations’®
        that  only  limited  changes    were   made    to the   Starwood    system

        because   i was    expected   to be decommissioned       sometime    i the
        future.  I i apparent      that these   changes    were   not sufficient to

        address   the   failings described    above   which    should   have   been
        addressed given the ongoing processing that was to take place prior
        to decommissioning.

        (3) Pre-GDPR conduct and due diligence

6.62.   Marriott i wrong to argue that the NOI relied upon Marriott’s failure
        to appropriately secure its systems and the personal data stored on

        them, prior to the period covered by the GDPR. The fact that no such
        reliance was placed on the pre-GDPR conduct was made clear i the
        NOI itself.7?

6.63.   Marriott’s argument    i this regard relies on the claim that any duty
        to undertake a due diligence process i one which would have to be

        discharged   prior to or shortly after acquisition.    Marriott submitted
        that i i not tenable to proceed       on the basis that acquisition due

        diligence i a “seemingly endless” process.®°

6.64.   While the Commissioner accepts that the acquisition of a company /
        data processing operations are a trigger for a controller to carry out

        due   diligence,  either  immediately    prior to acquisition    or shortly
        thereafter, this i not the only trigger point for such activity. The

        need for a controller to conduct due diligence i respect of its data
        operations    i   not  time-limited    or  a ‘one-off’   requirement.     In

Second RepresentationsSee also para 6.56 above.

1.20.
8 Marriott’s First Representations, para 1.20(a) and (b).
                                                                                  46        particular,  the coming    into effect of the GDPR     was,   for a global
        business like Marriott, a highly relevant factor.

6.65.   Controllers such as Marriott would      have been aware for some      time
        that the GDPR was going to come into effect on 25 May 2018. I was

        incumbent    on such controllers to ensure that their data processing
        complied   with the provisions of EU law from       that date.   However,
        after May 2018 Marriott continued to process personal data using a

        system   that  was   deficient  i   a number     of respects,   and  those
        deficiencies only came to light following the discovery of the Attack

        some   months   later.

6.66.   Given   Marriott’s ongoing   duty to ensure     that the systems     i had
        acquired  from   Starwood   were   GDPR   compliant,   i i no answer     to

        claim that certain due diligence steps were, or only needed          to be,
        taken i the period immediately after acquisition. Controllers cannot

        process personal data without appropriate security measures          being
        i place on the basis that the system was deficient prior to May 2018
        and has not been remedied. Even i adequate due diligence had been

        undertaken at the point of acquisition, that would not have removed
        Marriott’s  obligation   to  ensure,   on  a continuing     basis,  that  i

        complied with the GDPR,     once that Regulation came      into force.

6.67.   Marriott  recognises   this,  but  relies upon   inter alia its PCI    DSS
        assessment     process   as   the  means     by  which    this  continuing

        obligation  was   discharged.®t   However,   PCI DSS    assessments     are
        limited i their ability to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities within a

        network,   for the reasons    given at paragraph    6.29 above.    Rather,
        adequate    and   appropriate    due   diligence  would    have \_ included
        reviewing   the   adequacy    of the    monitoring    (including  logging)

        systems within the network.

6.68.   Thus, for the avoidance of any doubt, this decision relates solely to
        Marriott’s failures after 25 May     2018.  The   Commissioner     has not

        issued   a decision   under   the   Data   Protection  Act   1998   (“DPA
        1998”),   despite the historic, pre-2018      nature  of the concerns     i

        respect of the Starwood    system.

                                                                                 47 () A ticle 25

6.69.  The Commissioner     acknowledges that the NOI, at para 58, included

        an erroneous reference to Article 25 GDPR. This was a typographical
        error. The penalty figure set out i the NOI did not take into account
        any breach of Article 25.

(5) Article 33

6.70.  At the NOI stage, a provisional finding of breach of Article 33 GDPR
       was   proposed.   However,   this finding no  longer forms   part of the
        decision against Marriott.

6.71.   In reaching this decision, the Commissioner     did consider Marriott’s
        claims that ( the Commissioner failed to identify the date on which
        Marriott became   aware  of the breach;®   and (ii) the Commissioner

        misapplied the GDPR   rules on when a controller must be taken to be
        aware of a personal data breach.®?

6.72.   However,   i i not accepted   that the NOI failed to identify the date
        on which  Marriott became   aware of the breach for the purposes of
       Article 33 GDPR. The Commissioner      identified 8 September   2018 as

       the relevant date at para 52 of the NOI: “Marriott had been aware
       of unauthorised access to the Starwood systems since the Guardium
       alert on 8 September 2018... It would have been reasonable at that

       point for Marriott to conclude that personal data was likely to have
       been   accessed   by an unauthorised     party.” The   reference  to the

       “dmp”   files i para   53 of the NOI    cannot  reasonably   be read  as
        referring to the  identification of the dmp    files on  13  November
        2018.4 Rather, this was a reference to the fact that on 7 September

        2018  the Attacker   exported  the “Guest\_Master\_Profile”    table - a
       table that Marriott knew to contain personal data - into a “dmp’” file.
        Marriott was  alerted to the presence   of the Attacker   by Accenture

        on 8 September   2018, the day after this took place.

6.73.   Marriott was also incorrect to submit that the GDPR     requires a data

        controller to be reasonably certain that a personal data breach has
        occurred   before   notifying  the  Commissioner.     Rather,   a  data
        controller must  be able reasonably    to conclude   that i i likely a

                                                                             48        personal   data   breach    has  occurred    to  trigger  the   notification

        requirement under Article 33.

6.74.   Nevertheless,    the Commissioner      took  into account,   i particular,
        Marriott’s explanation that a count can be performed        on a database

        without   any  of the   personal   data   held  on  that  database    being
        accessed, and that Marriott’s position i that i was unaware           of the

        export of the “Guest\_Master\_Profile” table into a “dmp” file (which
        took place on 7 September       2018)   until 13 November     2018. ® The
        Commissioner has also taken into account Marriott’s submission that

        the   “Guest\_Master\_Profile”      contained    non-personal     data,   and
        therefore  i was   only with decryption     of that file on 19 November

        2018 that i became      aware of the personal data breach.

6.75.   Thus,   i   this  particular   case,   and   i   the   light of   Marriott’s

        Representations,    the   Commissioner     has  decided   not to make      a
        finding that Marriott breached Article 33 GDPR.

(6) Article 34

6.76.   The  NOI   contained   a provisional finding of a breach      of Article 34

        GDPR.   Marriott submitted    detailed submissions     i response to that
        proposal.®

6.77.   The Commissioner      recognises that Marriott established a dedicated
        website regarding the breach, and issued a press release which was
        widely-reported.®”    Marriott  claims   in its Representations      that  a

        dedicated website and press release would         have been sufficient for
        i to have    discharged    its obligations   under   Article 34.8° This    i

        incorrect.

6.78.   Article 34(1)   requires Marriott to “communicate       the personal data

        breach   to the data   subject”  (emphasis    added).   Where   this would
        involve   “disproportionate    effort”,  Marriott   may    issue  a   public
        communication     or similar measure     (Article 34(3)(c)).   Sending   an

        email to data subjects whose current email addresses are stored on
        Marriott’s systems   i not, on any view, a disproportionate       measure.

        I i a routine commercial activity. This i supported        by the fact that
        Marriott did inform the data subjects, via email, very soon after i

8 Marriott’s First Representations, paras 2.11-2.16.
8 Marriott’s First Representations, para 2.12.
8 Marriott’s First Representations, para 2.14.
                                                                                  49        identified the breach.   The  Commissioner     accepts  that some    data
        subjects  will not  have   been   contactable   i that way;     the  most

        obvious  example    being  individuals who   had changed    their contact
        details. In these   cases,  i may    have  involved  a disproportionate

        effort to track those individuals down    i order to communicate      the
        breach  and,  for such  individuals,  Marriott will have  discharged   its
        duty by way    of its press release and dedicated    website.   However,

        Marriott  i not   entitled  to rely upon    communications     which  are
        addressed   to the world    at large  (such   as its press   release  and

        website) as discharging    its duties under Article 34(1) i relation to
        all data subjects.

6.79.   The  Commissioner     i accordingly    entitled  to consider    Marriott's

        direct communications      (including  emails)  with  the  affected  data
        subjects  as the   means    by which    Marriott  sought   to satisfy  its

        obligations under Article 34 GDPR.

6.80.   The email sent by Marriot referred to a “dedicated call centre”, this
        being a specific telephone    line set up for affected data subjects to

        contact for further information, but i did not include the telephone
        number. The email, having communicated        the “name” of the contact

        point, did not communicate     the “contact details” of the point where
        more   information  could  be obtained.   While  plainly not deliberate,
        these omissions to some extent undermined       the effectiveness of the

        notification.

6.81.   The  Commissioner    has taken    into account  the fact that the email

        contained a link to the dedicated website, which i turn provided the
        telephone number for the dedicated call centre,®? although the email
        itself did not. On this occasion, and i light of the information that

        Marriott did i fact provide to affected data subjects, this Penalty
        Notice does not include any finding that Marriott breached Article 34
        GDPR.

7.REASONS          FOR IMPOSING          A PENALTY & CALCULATION

   OF THE APPROPRIATE               AMOUNT

7.1.    For the  reasons   set  out above,   the  Commissioner’s    view   i that
        Marriott  has failed to comply    with Articles  5(1)(f)  and  32 GDPR.
        These failures fall within the scope of section 149(2) and 155(1)(a)

8 Marriott’s First Representations, para 2.14(a).
                                                                               50        DPA.   For  the   reasons   explained   below,   the  Commissioner      has
        decided that i i appropriate to impose a penalty i the light of the

        infringements she has identified.

7.2.    In deciding   to impose    a penalty,  and   calculating  the appropriate

        amount,   the Commissioner      has had regard to the matters      listed i
        Articles 83(1) and (2) GDPR     and has applied the five-step approach
        set out in her RAP.

The imposition      of a penalty i appropriate         in this case

7.3.    Both  the   RAP  and   Article 83   GDPR   provide   guidance   as to the
        circumstances i which i i appropriate to impose an administrative

        fine or penalty for breaches of the obligations imposed      by the GDPR.

7.4.    Article 83(2) GDPR    lists a number of factors that must be taken into

        account. These are each discussed i detail below i determining the
        appropriate level of fine, i accordance with the steps outlined i the
        RAP. The   points made    below are also relied upon      i justifying the

        Commissioner’s     decision  to impose    a penalty,  i the light of the
        findings of infringement set out above.

7.5.    The RAP provides guidance on when         the Commissioner     will deem  a
        penalty to be appropriate.°° In particular, the RAP explains that a
        penalty i more likely to be imposed      where, inter alia, (a) a number

        of individuals have   been   affected;  (b) there has been    a degree   of
        damage      or    harm     (which    may \_   include’   distress    and/or

        embarrassment);      and   (c)  there   has   been   a failure   to   apply
        reasonable   measures    (including   relating to privacy   by design)   to
        mitigate any breach (or the possibility of it).

7.6.    As discussed in more detail below, each of those features i present
        i this case. Taking     together the findings    made    above  about   the

        nature of the infringements,     their likely impact,   and the fact that
        Marriott   failed   to   comply    with    its  GDPR\_    obligations,   the
        Commissioner      considers   i   appropriate   to   apply   an  effective,

        dissuasive and proportionate      penalty, reflecting the seriousness    of
        the breaches which have occurred.

        Step 1: an ‘initial element’ removing     any financial gain from the
        breach\*!

7.7.    Marriott  did not gain    any   financial  benefit,  or avoid   any  losses,
        directly or indirectly as a result of the breach.       The Commissioner

        has not, therefore, added an initial element at this stage.

        Step 2: Adding    i an element to censure the breach based on its
        scale and severity, taking into account the considerations identified
        at sections 155(2)-(4) DPA

7.8.    Sections 155(2)-(4)     DPA   refer to and reproduce    the matters    listed
        i Articles 83(1) and 83(2).

        The   nature,    gravity    and    duration    of  the   failure   (Article
        83(2)(a))

7.9.    Nature    and gravity of the failures: The nature of the failures i
        of significant   concern.    As  set  out   above,   there   were   multiple

        measures    that Marriott could     have  put i place that would        have
        allowed   for the detection    of or mitigated   the Attack    insofar as i
        continued after 25 May 2018.°2 What the Attack shows i that during

        the relevant period Marriott was      processing   data on a system     that
        had  multiple security failings that were      exploited   by the Attacker

        and could have been exploited by others.

7.10.   In Marriott’s submissions     i has placed a great deal of emphasis       on

        other security    measures    i had   i place, criticising the NOI/draft
        decision for failing to look at the matter holistically.?? This criticism
        i misplaced.     The Commissioner      has carried out a holistic analysis

        of the relevant systems and security processes operated by Marriott.
        What   that analysis    showed    was   that the   measures    identified  i

        section  6 above    were   appropriate   to secure   the CDE.     Marriott’s
        implementation     (or perceived     implementation)     of other   security

        measures    was   not sufficient.   I was   appropriate    for there   to be

directly or indirectly, from the infringement. ”

above.
° Marriott’s Second Representations, para 2.2(c).
                                                                                  52        multiple   layers of security    i this case    (for the reasons     given  at

        paragraph 6.17 above).

7.11.   An   extremely    large  number    of individuals    were   affected   by the

        breach,   specifically, 339   million guest   records, of which     — for the
        purposes    of this    penalty   - 30.1    million®\*  were    guest   records
        associated with EEA member        states. Marriott has explained that the

        total number     of affected   guests   i difficult to estimate    from   this
        figure as i may hold multiple records for an individual guest.°° Even

        taking into account that the true number of affected individuals may
        be 40%     lower than    initially estimated   by Marriott,°° this i still a

        significant number    of individuals.

7.12.   The mitigating steps taken by Marriott will have gone some             way to

        reassuring Marriott’s customers and therefore may have reduced or
        mitigated the distress that may otherwise have been caused             by the
        data breach. The assurances        given and the mitigating steps taken

        by Marriott are taken      into account   below.   I i nevertheless      likely
        that   some   of the    affected   individuals   will, depending     on  their

        circumstances, still have suffered anxiety and distress as a result of
        the disclosure of their personal information (including payment card

        information?”)     to  an   unknown      individual   or   individuals.   The
        Commissioner      has considered    i this regard the submissions       made
        by Marriott i i Representations.°° She notes the following points:

        a.   The   Commissioner      has   not  seen   any   evidence    of financial
              damage    and   i not required     to investigate    the existence    or
              otherwise of financial damage.°?      In calculating the appropriate

              level of penalty, the potential existence of such damage        has not
              been assumed     or taken into account.

        b.    I i possible that some       individuals may     have  cancelled   their
              payment     cards.  Contrary    to  Marriott’s   submissions,!°°     the
              Commissioner i not required to investigate or identify evidence

              of individuals actually cancelling their cards. In circumstances

             their   data,   including   some     credit  card   data    have   been
             compromised,      the Commissioner      considers   i likely that some
              individuals will have taken this step.

        c    The possibility that some     individuals may    have been prompted
             to cancel their payment cards i just one element of the overall

             assessment of whether the breaches of the GDPR           were likely to
             cause distress. The act of cancelling a card may        i and of itself
             only cause inconvenience. I i the reason why such action was

              necessary,   the  disclosure   of personal    information,    that  can
             cause distress amongst      some.

        d.   The   fact  that  the  Marriott  call  centre  received   57,000    calls
              between   30 November     2018 and 31 May 2019 (7,500 of these
              being   calls to  EU-based     call  centres)   i  indicative   of the

              potential  level of concern    amongst    affected  data subjects    on
              learning of the breach and subsequently.\*%

        e.    Further,  even   i individuals   opted   not to cancel     their credit
             cards,    the   Commissioner      considers     i  likely   that   some
              individuals  will  have   experienced     distress   at  having   their

              personal data exposed      i a large-scale data breach.      Marriott’s
             suggestion that distress will only arise i cases where they are

             advised by their banks to cancel their payment cards!° ignores
             the fact that a      personal   data  (not just financial data)     i of
             significance to individuals, a significance which        i reflected i

             the legal protections afforded to that data under the GDPR.

7.13.   Duration:    Although    the Attack   itself spanned   a four-year    period,
        the infringements     that the Commissioner       relies on i this Notice

        occurred between     25 May 2018 (the date when the GDPR came into
        force) and 17 September       2018. The Commissioner       considers this to

        be a significant period of time over which         unauthorised    access to
        personal data went undetected       and/or unremedied.?°%

        (Article 83(2)(b))

7.14.   The Commissioner      has had regard to the guidelines provided by the

        Article 29 Working   Party i relation to assessing the character of the
        infringement i issue. I explains that:

            . In general, “intent” includes both knowledge and wilfulness

            in relation   to  the  characteristics   of an   offence,  whereas
            “unintentional” means     that there   was  no intention   to cause
            the infringement although the controller/processor breached
            the duty of care which is required in the law.

            It   is  generally     admitted     that   intentional    breaches,
            demonstrating    contempt    for the provisions    of the law, are
            more   severe  than unintentional ones and therefore may          be
            more   likely to warrant   the application of an administrative

            fine. The relevant conclusions about wilfulness or negligence
            will be drawn   on the basis of identifying objective elements
            of conduct gathered from the facts of the case...1°

7.15.   The  Commissioner      recognises   that the   infringement    was   not an

        intentional or deliberate act on the part of Marriott. This has been
        taken into account i assessing whether a fine i appropriate i this

        case.

7.16.   The   Commissioner      does,   however,    consider   that  Marriott   was

        negligent    (within  the   meaning     of  Article  83(2)(b)    GDPR)    i
        maintaining    systems    that  suffered   from   the  vulnerabilities  and

        shortcomings    identified i Section 6 above.!°

7.17.   In making this determination, the Commissioner places some weight
        on the relevant context: a company of the size and profile of Marriott

        i expected to be aware that i i likely to be targeted by attackers,
        sophisticated or otherwise.    Marriott must be aware that the nature

        of its business involves processing     large volumes    of personal data,
        including sensitive personal data. The risk of any compromise of that

        information    may    have   significant   consequences     for   Marriott’s
        customers and its own business.

104 Pp.11-12.
105 Marriott’s general claim at par2.9(b) of its SecoRepresentationrefers to its specific
explanations i section 3 of those representations, which have been i section 6 above.
                                                                                  557.18.   In view    of these   factors,  the   Commissioner:     (a)  would   expect

        Marriott   to have    taken   appropriate    steps  or a combination       of
        appropriate steps to secure the personal data of its customers;          and
        (b) considers    that  Marriott  failed  to comply    with   the  standards

        imposed    by   the  GDPR     i   failing to  do   so.  Beyond    this,  the
        Commissioner has not treated the nature of Marriott’s conduct under

        Article 83(2)(b)   as an aggravating     factor i assessing     whether    to
        impose   a penalty, or how     much   that penalty should     be. However,
        she i obliged to take into account the character of the infringement

        under Article 83(2)(b).     Thus,  she does    not consider that she has
        erred  i “applying     this factor”,  as Marriott   submitted    i  its First

        Representations.1%

7.19.   Marriott relied upon the Article 29 WP Guidelines to argue that the

        draft decision   failed to treat the fact that the breaches       were   not
        deliberate   as a positive   factor  i favour    i  assessing   whether    to
        impose   a fine.‘°” These Guidelines      state that intentional breaches

        are  more    likely to warrant     the  application   of a fine.    Marriott
        submitted    that i this i the    case,  the  absence    of intention  must

        weigh   in the controller’s favour.

7.20.   I i unclear what additional weight Marriott considers the absence
        of intention should attract i this case. The mere        recognition i the

        Article  29 WP    Guidelines   of the   obvious   point that a deliberate
        breach i more likely to result i certain consequences does not alter

        the fact that a penalty may      be imposed    for a breach of a different
        nature (and nor would      i be consistent with Article 83 GDPR      i fines

        only applied   to deliberate   conduct).   The  Commissioner     has taken
        into account the fact that the breaches were not deliberate as part
        of her overall assessment      (as Marriott recognises?°\*).    However,    i

        circumstances    where,   as here, the breaches were       negligent within
        the meaning    of Article 83(2)(b), that fact must also be taken         into

        account when assessing whether to impose a fine and, i so, at what
        level.

7.21.   Marriott   also   criticised  the  Commissioner’s      analysis   as   being

        duplicative   because    she  had   regard   to, inter alia, the    scale  of
        Marriott’s  processing   operations    i assessing    whether    its actions

108 Ibid.
                                                                                  56        were  negligent   under   Article 83(2)(b),   as well  as i    assessing
        whether i complied with Articles 5 and 32 GDPR.!°?       While i i true

        that the  Commissioner     considered   some    of these  factors  when
        concluding  whether there was a breach of Articles 5 and 32, these

        factors are relevant i both contexts. The issue of whether a breach
        has arisen,  and  the nature    of Marriott’s responsibility for i    are
        clearly related issues.

       Any   action   taken  by the controller or processor        to mitigate
        the damage    suffered by data subjects (Article 83(2)(c))

7.22.  The Commissioner      has carefully considered    Marriott’s submissions
        to the effect that i could not discern from the draft decision how the
        mitigation action i took i response to the Attack has been taken

        into account  because   i was dealt with at this Step, rather than at
        Step 5.110

7.23.  The Commissioner      remains of the view that i makes      no difference
        to the ultimate decision on what, i any, penalty to impose whether
        the action taken   by the controller to mitigate the damage      i taken

        into account here, or under Step 5 i this Penalty Notice. However,
        she has decided    to consider this issue separately under Step      5 i

        this Penalty Notice.

        The  degree    of responsibility    of the controller    or processor
        (Article 83)(2)(d))

7.24.   As a controller,   Marriott  i responsible   under   the  GDPR   for the
        security of its systems   and the protection   of personal   data stored

        within those   systems.   I i required    by the GDPR     to implement
        security measures to reduce the vulnerability of those systems, and
        the  vulnerability  of the   personal   data  processed    within  those

        systems, to attack. While the entry of the Attacker into Starwood’s
        systems   pre-dates  Marriott’s acquisition of that company,     Marriott
        had  an  ongoing   duty  to ensure    the  safety  and  security  of the

        systems i was using to process personal data.

7.25.   As i clear from Section 6 above, there were multiple deficiencies i

        the security measures    i place i respect of the Starwood       system,
        which  Marriott continued to operate to process personal data after

109 Marriott’s Second Representations, para 2.9(c).
110 Marriott’s Second Representations, paras 1.9-1.10, and 1.34.
                                                                               5/        the  GDPR   came    into force.  As  a result,  the Attacker   was   able  to

        remain   present and    undetected    i the system     after 25 May    2018
        until the triggering of the Guardium     alert i September      2018.

7.26.   The  Commissioner     therefore  considers   that, for the duration   of the
        infringement    on  which   this penalty    i based,    Marriott  i wholly
        responsible   for the    breaches    of Articles   5(1)(f)  and   32  GDPR

        described above.

7.27.   In its Representations, Marriott highlighted the fact that the NOI did

        not   mention    that   Accenture     provided    i  with   third-party    IT
        services.'!! In response to the draft decision, Marriott explained that

        i its view, the fact that i engaged Accenture to assist i the security
        management      of the Starwood   network should be taken into account

        i assessing Marriott’s responsibility for the Attack.

7.28.   I i acknowledged       that Accenture     i an experienced      provider   of
        security   services   and   that  i provided     services   i   relation   to

        Marriott’s  security   environment.     However,    the  fact that    i was
        charged    with   implementing,     maintaining     or  managing     certain

        elements of the system does not reduce Marriott’s responsibility for
        the   breaches     of  the   GDPR     that   have    been    identified.   In

        circumstances    where    Marriott accepts   that i i the relevant data
        controller, and significant failures i its security measures have been
        identified, the engagement     of third parties cannot reduce its degree

        of responsibility.

7.29,   For the avoidance    of doubt,  however,   in taking a holistic view of the

        security  measures     put i   place,  account    has  been   taken  of, for
        example, the fact that Guardium was i place and certain alerts were

        applied under that system      (which Accenture monitored).

7.30.   Finally, Marriott  i correct to state    in its Representations     that the

        Article  29 WP    Guidelines   provide   that “industry    standards...  are
        important to take into account” when assessing compliance with the
        GDPR. The Commissioner        has taken into account Marriott’s detailed

        submissions on its compliance with PCI DSS standards, i particular
        i respect to the concerns which arose i respect of the application

111 Marriott’s First Representatpara 3.5, anMarriott’s SeconRepresentationsparas2.10-
2.11.
                                                                                  58        of  MFA   across   the   Starwood    network.!!2    However,    Marriott’s

        obligations under Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32 GDPR      go beyond the
        requirements    of the PCI DSS    and extend   to all personal  data, not

        just  cardholder    information    with  which    those   standards    are
        concerned.   The fact that Marriott may     have complied    with certain
        industry guidance focusing on specific      types of personal data does

        not obviate or reduce its responsibility for the security of all of the
        personal data i holds.

        Relevant previous infringements          (Article 83(2)(e))

7.31.   Marriott has no relevant previous infringements or failures to comply

        with past notices.

7.32.   Marriott claims that this fact should weigh      positively i its favour,

        rather  than   neutrally.1t? The   fact that  Marriott  has   no  relevant
        previous infringements i a matter that has been taken into account
        i the Commissioner’s decision whether to impose a penalty, and i

        her decision as to the appropriate level of that penalty.

        Degree    of cooperation      with   supervisory     authority    (Article

        83(2)(f))

7.33.   Marriott  has cooperated    fully with  her investigation   and   this has

        been taken into account.

        Categories of personal data affected (Article 83(2)(g))

7.34.   The Commissioner     has identified the relevant categories of personal
        data  in Section 4 above.   As noted  there, the data included    in some
        (but not all) cases unencrypted      passport details, details of travel,

        and  various   other   categories   of personal    information   including
        name,   gender,  date  of birth,  VIP status,  address,   phone  number,

        email address,   and credit card data.

        Manner    in which     the  infringement      became     known     to the

        Commissioner      (Article 83(2)(h))

112 See Marriott’s First Representations, para 3.6 and MarriRepresentationspara 2.12
and Section 3.
113 Marriott’s First Representations, para 3.7.
                                                                                597.35.   Marriott  notified the Commissioner     of the Attack   on 22  November
        2018 and i considered to have complied with its obligations i this

        respect.

        Conclusion at step 2

7.36.   Taking  into account:   (a) the matters set out i Sections 2-4 and 6

        above;  (b) the matters referred to in this section; and (c) the need
        to apply   an  effective,  proportionate   and   dissuasive   fine  i  the
        context   of a controller    of  Marriott’s   scale  and   turnover,   the

        Commissioner     considers  that a penalty     of £28   million would   be
        appropriate, before adjustment     i accordance with Steps 3-5 below

        and  the application   of the Commissioner’s      Covid-19    policy. This
        amount   i considered    appropriate to reflect the seriousness     of the
        breach and takes into account i particular the need for the penalty

        to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

        Step 3: Adding   i an element to reflect any aggravating factors
        (Article 83(2)(k))

7.37.   The amount of the penalty, as identified at Step 2, may be increased

        where   there  are ‘other’ aggravating     factors.'1+ In this case,   the
        Commissioner     does  not consider    there  to be any   other   relevant

        aggravating   factors. Thus,   no adjustment    i made    to the penalty
        level determined   at Step 2.

        Step 4: Adding   i an amount for a deterrent effect on others

7.38.   The Commissioner     i under an obligation to impose a penalty which

        i “dissuasive”. The need for the penalty to be dissuasive in relation
        to Marriott  itself i addressed    by the analysis    at Step   2. Having

        regard  to the amount     of the penalty   identified under   step 2, the
        Commissioner does not consider i necessary to increase the penalty
        further under Step 4 to dissuade others.!!°

7.39.   The Commissioner i not aware of widespread issues of poor practice
        that may    be particularly  deterred   by the   imposition   of a higher

        penalty.   Given  Marriott’s size and the scale of its operations,     and
        the fact that the Commissioner has decided to impose a penalty that
        already  takes  those   factors  into account   as part of the    need  to

        ensure  that any penalty i proportionate,       effective and dissuasive

114 Tn accordance with Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, section 155(3)(k) DPA. and page 11 of the RAP.
115 This makes redundant the points about this Step made by Marriott i i Representations.
                                                                                60        and  to  reflect the  seriousness    of the  breach,   the  Commissioner

        considers that no adjustment     i necessary under Step 4.

        Step 5: Reducing the amount       (save that i the initial element) to
        reflect any mitigating factors, including ability to pay (financial
        hardship) (Article 83(2)(k))

7.40.   As explained   above,   i principle, other relevant mitigating      factors
        could  be taken   into account   under   Step  2 or Step    5 of the RAP.
        Previously the Commissioner      considered   such matters i the round

        under Step 2 of the RAP, taking into account the factors in Article
        83 GDPR    and   section  155(3)  DPA   2018.   However,   i the light of

        Marriott’s representations for the purposes of this Penalty Notice the
        Commissioner     has considered the relevant mitigating factors under

        Step  5.

7.41.   Following  the guidance    set out at page   11 of the RAP,    and  having
        considered   Marriott’s Representations, the Commissioner       has taken

        into account the following mitigating factors:

        a.   Marriott had, prior to becoming     aware of the Attack, confirmed

             in 2018  a new   $19  million security investment    for 2019,  which
             raised  Marriott’s budgeted    spend   for that year on security to
             $49.5million.   Subsequent    investment    decisions  i 2019    have

             raised  Marriott’s  forecasted   IT security   budget   spend   on IT
             security for 2020 to $108.5million;

        b.   Marriott took   immediate    steps to mitigate    the effects of the
             Attack   and    protect   the   interests   of   data   subjects    by

             implementing    remedial measures;

        c    Marriott cooperated fully with the Commissioner's investigation,
             including responding    promptly to requests for information;

        d.   Widespread    reporting i the media of the Attack i likely to have
             increased   the awareness    of other data controllers of the risks

             posed by cyber-attacks and of the need to ensure that they take
             all appropriate measures to secure personal data; and

        e.   The  Attack   and  subsequent     regulatory  action  has   adversely

             affected  Marriott’s brand   and  reputation, which    will have  had
             some dissuasive effect on Marriott and other data controllers.

                                                                                 617.42.   More specifically, the Commissioner      has taken into account the fact
        that, upon   being alerted to the Attack,    Marriott acted   promptly to

        mitigate the risk of damage    suffered by data subjects, by way of the
        following technical remedial measures:

        a.   The deployment     of real-time monitoring     and forensic tools on
             70,000 devices on the Starwood       network;

        b.   Implementing     password   resets;

        c    Disabling known    compromised     accounts; and

        d.   Implementing     enhanced   detection tools.

7.43.   These measures should allow Marriott to prevent similar breaches i
        the  future,  including   by  identifying  any   additional  attackers   or
        malicious software being utilised on its servers.

7.44,   The Commissioner     has also taken into account the fact that Marriott
        also took steps to: (a) establish a notification and communication

        regime;    (b)  create   a  bespoke    incident   website   i   numerous
        languages;   (c) send 9.2 million notification emails to data subjects
        whose   country   of residence   was  recorded   i the Starwood      Guest

        Reservation Database as being i the EU); (d) establish a dedicated
        call centre;  (e) provide web    monitoring   to affected data subjects;

        (f) enhance its data subject rights programme;       (g) engage with card
        networks;    and    (h)  improve     its technical   and \_ organisational
        measures    generally.1?©  I i also    noted   that  Marriott  informed   a

        number   of other regulatory and law enforcement agencies.

7.45.   I i acknowledged       that the steps   outlined   above   will have  gone
        some   way   to reassuring   Marriott’s customers,    and  therefore   may

        have   reduced   or mitigated    any  distress   caused   by the   breach.
        However, the fact that the Marriott call centre received 57,000 calls

        between 30 November       2018 and 31 May 2019 (7,500 of these being
        calls to EU-based   call centres)?!’ i indicative of the level of concern
        amongst    affected   data  subjects   on  learning   of the  breach   and

        subsequently.1!®

116 Marriott’s First Representations, para 3.4.
117 Marriott’s Second Representations, para 2.7(b)(ii).
118 Contrary to para 2.7(a)(b)(i) of MarriottRepresentations, i i not being suggested that
all of those who called Marriott’s call centre were suffering from distrbut i i likely

                                                                                 627.46.   Contrary to Marriott’s submissions,!+9 the fact that very few of these

        calls  were   escalated    internally  or  resulted   i   a complaint      i
        irrelevant. The information     provided   by Marriott suggests    that call
        handlers had FAQs available to advise customers on how to respond

        to the breach etc, which was presumably         intended to address most
        situations arising.!2° Thus,    the fact that only a certain number       of

        individuals had their calls escalated / resulted i a complaint does
        not provide   any   real indication  of the extent to which     individuals
        were distressed or harmed      by the loss of their data.

7.47.   Marriot also relied i this regard on a claim that the Commissioner’s
        findings of distress and harm     were materially undermined       because

        the centre only received     57,000   calls when   millions of individuals
        were affected by the breaches.!\*! However, i circumstances where:

        (a)  Marriott   had   established    a dedicated     website   to   address
        concerns;   and   (b) individuals  may   have   sought  advice   from  third
        parties and/or acted on their own       knowledge    and experience,     the

        comparison     between     these   figures   does    not  undermine      the
        Commissioner’s findings. The number        of calls i sufficiently large to

        suggest that there were data subjects who were concerned.

7.48.   Thus, while the Commissioner        has taken   into account,   as outlined
        below,   the steps taken    by Marriott to mitigate     the impact    of its

        breaches   of the GDPR,    she  remains   of the view   that those  actions
        would not have    immediately neutralised all the concerns on the part

        of data subjects about their data being i the hands of criminals /
        outside of Marriott’s control.

7.49.   Having    regard   to  the  mitigating    factors  set  out   above,   i i
        appropriate to reduce the £28 million penalty by 20%,         i.e. to £22.4
        million.

7.50.   As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic,       Marriott has also argued that
        any penalty should     be reduced   because of the financial hardship      i

        would cause.

7.51.   The  Commissioner     has considered     Marriott’s representations,    and
        the evidence   i has provided. Although the Covid-19         pandemic   has

that - as stated here - the majority of callers were at least sufficiently concerned to make the call,
which i inconsistent with Marriott’s position that no or only trivial harm at all would have arisen.
119 Marriott’s Second Representations, para 2.7(b)(iii).
120 Marriott’s Second Representations, para 2.7(b)(iii).
121 Marriott’s Second Representations, para 2.7(b)(iv).
                                                                                  63        had  a significant impact   on Marriott’s revenues,     Marriott’s overall

        financial position i such that the Commissioner        does not consider
        that the imposition    of a penalty   i the range    being  proposed   will
        cause financial hardship, or that Marriott will be unable to pay such

        a penalty.

7.52.   However,   the Commissioner      has published   guidance   entitled “The

        ICO’s  regulatory   approach    during  the  Coronavirus    public  health
        emergency”.'?2    That  guidance    indicates  that “As set out in the
        Regulatory Action Policy, before issuing fines we take into account

        the economic    impact   and affordability.  In current circumstances,
        this is likely to mean the level of fines reduces.” While   the proposed

        penalty   will  not   cause    financial  hardship    for  Marriott,   the
        Commissioner     considers  i appropriate   to reduce   the penalty that

        would  otherwise   have  been   imposed,   i light of the current public
        health  emergency    and  associated   economic   consequences.    This i
        addressed   below, separately from Step 5.

7.53.   The Commissioner      has carefully considered    Marriott’s submissions
        that there   are other additional    mitigating  factors that should    be

        taken into account i this case.!23 However, none of the points raised
        justify a further  reduction   of the appropriate    penalty  beyond   the
        discount set out above. In particular:

             The Commissioner      does not consider i appropriate to further
             reduce the penalty by reference to costs to Marriott of taking

             measures    to rectify or mitigate the impact of its infringement,
             including the cost establishing a bespoke      website, call centre,

             web   monitoring,   the enhancement      of Marriott’s data   subject
             rights programme,     and any other customer-facing      remediation
             activities. The fact that Marriott was required to expend     a large

             amount   - on Marriott’s assessment     i excess of $50 million+
             - i    customer-facing    remediation    activities  i  not   directly

             relevant to the amount of any penalty. The fact that mitigating
             measures were taken, i accordance with Marriott’s obligations
             as a controller, has already been taken into account.

123 Marriott’s First Representations, para 3.13(c).
124 Marriott’s First Representations, paras 3.4(a) and 3.13(c)(vi).
                                                                                64             Marriott’s   preparations    for  the   introduction   of  GDPR     are
             noted.!2°  However,    these do not address      the Commissioner’s

             conclusions    on  Marriott’s   failure to   implement    appropriate
             security measures     i relation to the systems      i acquired   from

             Starwood.

             The   Commissioner     has   recognised   that  the Attack    involved
             persistent criminal activity.17© But this does      not alter the fact

             that the security    of Marriott’s   network   was   inadequate    i a
             number    of respects, and that those failings could and should

             have   been   addressed     on  a prospective     basis  through    the
             implementation      of  appropriate    measures.     I   i   Marriott’s
             breaches   of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32 GDPR      for which   i i being

             penalised, not the actions of third parties.

             The   security  measures    that were   deployed    on the Starwood

             security environment     and on the Starwood      Guest   Reservation
             Database     are  noted.!?”   However,     the  existence    of  these
             measures    do not detract from the Commissioner’s        conclusions

             on   Marriott’s   failure   to   implement     appropriate    security
             measures    (see section    6). That  Marriott took some      steps to

             secure the Starwood system i not considered to be a mitigating
             factor i the circumstances of an infringement of this scale and
             severity.

7.54.   Accordingly,    having   carefully  considered    the  mitigating   factors
        raised  by Marriott,   which   are relevant   to the assessment      of the
        appropriate   level of any    penalty,  the overall   penalty  payable    by

        Marriott after Step 5 i £22.4 million.

        Application of Covid-19    Policy

7.55.   As described    above,  having   regard  to the impact    of the Covid-19

        pandemic    (on Marriott and more      generally), and consistently with
        the  Commissioner’s      published   guidance,    a further   reduction   i
        appropriate    and   proportionate.    The   final  penalty   payable   will

        therefore be reduced to £18.4 million.

125 As relied upon at paras 3.13(c)(iii) of Marriott’s First Representations.
126 Marriott’s First Representations, para 3.13(c)(iv).
127 Marriott’s First Representations, para 3.13(c)(i)-(ii).
                                                                                  65        Application of the fining tier(s) (Articles 83(4) and (5) GDPR)

7.56.   The infringement of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR falls within Article 83(5)(a)

        GDPR,    whereas     Article  32   falls within   Article   83(4)(a).   The
        appropriate tier i therefore that imposed      by Article 83(5)(a) as this

        i the gravest breach i issue i this case.

7.57.   In any event, for the year ended       31 December      2017   Marriott has

        confirmed   that its relevant    worldwide   annual   turnover   i $4.997
        billion. The  penalty   the Commissioner      has decided    to impose   on
        Marriott i the sum     of £18.4 million. This i considerably less than

        4%, indeed considerably less than 1%, of Marriott’s total worldwide
        annual   turnover,  and   accordingly   well within the cap imposed       by

        Article 83(5) GDPR.

Marriott’s other representations           on the decision to impose         a

penalty    and the appropriate        Penalty amount

7.58.   Marriott’s   Representations      contained    detailed   submissions     i
        response to: (a) the Commissioner’s decision to impose a penalty at

        all; and (b) the proposed    penalty amount, as indicated i the Notice
        of  Intent.   The   Commissioner      has   carefully   considered    those

        submissions and, to the extent they have not been addressed above,
        responds to them     below.

7.59.   In summary,    Marriott submitted as follows:

        a.   First, the Commissioner misapplied Article 83(2) i deciding to
             impose    a fine  and   in determining     the  appropriate   level  of

             penalty. A proper application of that Article should result i no
             fine being imposed     at all or, i the alternative, i should result

             i the imposition of only a low level of penalty;!2°

        b.   Second,    the Commissioner      unlawfully applied an unpublished
             internal   document,     entitled  “Draft   Internal   Procedure    for

             Setting   and    Issuing   Monetary     Penalties”,   i   setting   the
             proposed   penalty on Marriott which was included i the NOI.+29

             However,    setting a proposed    penalty amount without the Draft

Representations, Section 2.

              draft decision, also offends the principle of legal certainty.1\*°

        c    Third, the Commissioner        erred   by relying on turnover as the

              sole metric i determining the level of fine proposed i the NOI,
              and i continuing to treat turnover the most important factor i

              its quantification analysis i the draft decision;+3!

        d.    Fourth,   the Commissioner       has applied   the wrong    fining Tier

              under Article 83 GDPR     i calculating the proposed fine;+%

        e.    Fifth, the Commissioner      erred  in the NOI   by applying   an uplift

              to ensure an appropriate deterrent effect; 17?

        f     Sixth,   the    Commissioner       breached     Marriott’s   legitimate

              expectation that she would operate her fining powers under the
              GDPR   i accordance with past precedents, i.e. decisions made,

              under the DPA 1998 and/or only applying incremental increases
              to the fines that would have been imposed         under the 1998 Act

              (which was subject to a £500,000       maximum     fine limit).1\*4 This
              same   failure, which   Marriott described    as a failure to comply

              with the “Precedents-Based Approach”,          i also said to amount
              to a breach of the principle of legal certainty.1\*° In its Second

              Representations,     i particular,   Marriott   contends   that  i the
              absence    of any   new    guidance    providing   clear  and   specific

              quantification   methodology     determining    how   fines are to be
              calculated,   any  decision   to issue   a fine would      breach   that

              principle.17©  In this regard Marriott also relies on a comparison
              with a case    decided   by the Financial    Conduct    Authority   (the

             “FCA”)    i respect of Tesco Bank.'?” I also relies on an alleged
              inconsistency   between    the penalty    proposed   i this case and
              those   imposed      through    other    decisions    issued    by   the

             authorities.+#8

        g.   Seventh,     the Commissioner       has  acted   contrary  to the RAP

              because she has failed to calculate the penalty proposed         i the
              NOI and the draft decision i accordance with its terms;+79 and

        h.    Eighth, the Commissioner proposed a penalty i the NOI            which

              i disproportionate on its face NOI, and the revised penalty set
             out i the draft decision remains disproportionate.14°

        (1) Application of Article 83(2)

7.60.   The Commissioner       has described    at paragraphs    7.3-7.53   how   the
        factors listed i Article 83(2) apply to the facts of this case. In its

        Representations,     Marriott criticised the Commissioner’s       findings i
        this regard. Where     necessary those criticisms have been addressed

        at each step of the analysis set out above and/or i Section 6 above.

        (2) Draft Internal Procedure

7.61.   Prior  to  issuing   the   NOI   i  this  case,   the   Commissioner      had
        developed a Draft Internal Procedure for calculating proposed fines,

        as a supplement to the RAP. Its purpose was to provide an indicative
        guide,   by reference    to the turnover     of the controller,   as to the

        appropriate   penalty. As the GDPR       i a new    regime, this additional
        tool was   intended to assist the decision-makers        i applying Article

        Internal Procedure    (she did not rely upon i for the purposes of her

        draft decision, and the same approach was adopted i preparing this
        Penalty  Notice).  She   has instead   relied only on Article 83 GDPR,

        section 155 DPA and the RAP. The approach taken to the calculation
        of the penalty for the purposes of this Notice i set out above.

7.64.   Marriott i wrong to assert that, but for its pressing for disclosure i

        correspondence,     the Commissioner      would   not have   disclosed   the
        draft guidance   document.!42 The     policy was   provided   on 2 August

        2019   i response to a request made       i a letter from Marriott dated
        24 July 2019. The NOI set out how the penalty was arrived at. The
        Commissioner     also   provided   further  information   about   how    the

        penalty   was    calculated   i   her   letter  of  17   July  2019.    The
        Commissioner i obliged to consult the controller on the NOI and she

        did so. Marriott took the opportunity to make       detailed submissions,
        and    the   Commissioner       has   carefully   considered     all  those
        submissions, and acted upon them to address the concerns raised.

7.65.   Marriott’s   First  Representations     also   criticised  the  use    of  a
        percentage range as part of its process for calculating the proposed

        penalty (applying    the Draft Internal Procedure)     and/or the way     i
        which the Commissioner       applied the turnover bands at the NOI.147
        As this approach    has not been adopted      i this Notice, nor has the

        Draft Internal Procedure     been applied, the Commissioner       does not
        respond to the individual points made       by Marriot on the application
        of the Draft Internal Procedure further here.

7.66.   In  its  Second    Representations,     Marriott   states   that  whilst   i
        welcomes    the fact that the Draft Internal      Procedure   i no longer

        relied upon by the Commissioner,       (a) the Commissioner cannot rely
        upon  the £99.2m     figure proposed    in the NOI as a reference      point
        when    assessing   the   legality  or  proportionality   of the    present

        proposed    penalty   figure;!\*\*  (b)  the   RAP   cannot   constitute   an
        adequate    basis for the calculation    of a penalty    i circumstances

        where the Commissioner       had previously devised the Draft Internal
        Procedure;!\*° and (c) i the absence of the Draft Internal Procedure,
        there   i   a  lack  of   clarity  governing    penalty   calculation   and

        following reasons.

7.67.   First, the Commissioner   does  not seek to use the figure of £99.2m,
        as proposed  i the NOI, as a “reference point” for the penalty set i

        the draft decision, or the present penalty. Rather, the Commissioner
        carried out a fresh calculation exercise having regard to the factors
        listed under Article 83 of the GDPR     and the RAP. See further para

        7.128  below.

7.68.   Second,  the Draft Internal   Procedure   was  not developed    to ‘cure’

        any gap i legal certainty left by the RAP. I was intended to be a
        helpful  supplement     to  the   RAP   for  internal  decision-making
        purposes. In deciding what level of penalty may (at the consultation

        stage) or i appropriate    i this case, the Commissioner     has always
        applied the approach set out i the RAP, and considered the factors

        under Article 83 GDPR.     The fact that a document     was   created  to
        provide supplemental    detail to the RAP does not render the RAP so
        deficient so as to prevent a penalty being calculated       i this case.

        Marriott’s submissions    on  legal certainty  are addressed    i more
        detail below.

        (3) The Commissioner’s    reliance on Marriott’s turnover

7.69.
        Marriott advanced    a number    of criticisms  of the Commissioner’s
        reliance on turnover i calculating her proposed      penalty in its First
        and Second Representations (see, for example, para 4.14 of its First

        Representations).

7.70.   First, Marriott submitted that the only metric the Commissioner used
        to calculate the penalty proposed     i the NOI was turnover. This i

        incorrect. As i clear from the NOI itself, while turnover was    used as
        a starting point in seeking to assess the appropriate penalty, a range

        of other relevant factors were considered i accordance with the RAP
        and the GDPR.    In any event, the turnover-bandings      set out i the
        Draft Internal Procedure has not been used i preparing this Notice.

7.71.   Second,  Marriott submitted   that turnover cannot be regarded       as a
        core metric  i a case such     as this where   the wrongdoer     has not

        profited from  the breach.   Marriot claimed   that there   i no logical
        relationship between   the breach and the controller’s turnover. The

146 Marriott’s Second Representations, para 1.5.
                                                                               70        Commissioner’s      approach,    Marriott   said,   simply   punishes    a
        controller  for being   a large  undertaking.    Marriott  compares    the

        penalty   proposed    i  this  case  to the    Commissioner’s     decision
        regarding   Doorstep   Dispensaree    Ltd, dated   20   December    2019,

        suggesting   that   this shows    that  the  Commissioner      i  treating
        turnover, unjustifiably, as the most important factor.\*\*’

7.7/2.  The Commissioner     does not accept these arguments.      She considers

        turnover   to   be  a   relevant   consideration    i   determining    the
        appropriate   level of penalty i this case (as well as i other cases

        not involving a controller profiting from a breach), for the following
        reasons:

        a.   A turnover-based     approach    i consistent   with  the approach
             taken to penalties i the GDPR.       The Data   Protection  Directive

             did  not   prescribe   the  level  of  fines   that  Member     State
             authorities should impose for data breaches. The GDPR departs
             from  that approach.    In doing   so, i expresses    the maximum

             penalty   in terms   of a percentage     of turnover.   Turnover    i
             therefore a relevant factor i determining the appropriate level
             of penalty to be imposed. This i also reflected i the Recitals,

             which make clear that the economic position of the controller i
             relevant even where the controller i a private person and not
             an undertaking:    “  Where administrative fines are imposed on
             persons that are not an undertaking, the supervisory authority

             should   take  account   of the general    level of income     in the
             Member    State as well as the economic situation of the person
             in considering the appropriate amount of the fine.”

        b.   Further,  and   i any    event,  the  Commissioner     i obliged   to
             ensure that any penalties imposed are “effective, proportionate

             and dissuasive”.   Having   regard to a data controller’s turnover
             complies   with this principle  by ensuring   that the level of any
             penalty  i not only proportionate,      but i also likely to be an
             effective and dissuasive deterrent for the undertaking on which

             i i imposed, and other equivalent controllers. I i self-evident
             that  imposing   the  same    penalty  on  an   undertaking   with  a
             turnover of billions of pounds as would     be imposed    on a small

             or medium    sized business would not be effective, proportionate
             or dissuasive.   Comparable    regulatory   regimes  that share the
             GDPR’s   emphasis    on deterrence,    such  as under    competition

147 Marriott’s Second Representations, paras 1.36-1.37.
                                                                                71             law, also take turnover into account i i some form in setting
             penalties.

        c     Marriott’s claim that the introduction of the maximum        amount
             safeguard   caps i Articles 83(4)     and  (5) does   not mean    that

             turnover can be treated as a relevant metric i incorrect, for the
             reasons articulated i points (a) and (b) above.!\*° In particular,
             Marriott’s  claim  that treating   turnover   as a relevant    metric

             “outside   of disgorgement      of profits   cases   is illogical and
             perverse”,   does   not withstand    scrutiny. I i plain from      the
             relevant   provisions  of the GDPR,     read  as a whole,    that the
             economic    position  of a controller    i one    relevant  factor  i

             determining what penalty i appropriate on the particular facts
             of any case. The GDPR     does not limit the relevance of turnover
             to cases involving disgorgement.

        d.   As to the    decision  i Doorstep,     the difference   between    the
             turnover of that controller and     Marriott i obviously     relevant.

             However,    each   case   i  considered    on   its individual  facts.
             Marriott’s attempts to compare the number of records involved,
             and then scale up the appropriate       level of fine (60 times the

             number of records, results i a maximum         60 times higher level
             of fine),  are   misconceived.    See  further   paras   7.116-7.119
             below.

7.73.   Third,  Marriott  submitted    that  any  penalty   regime   engages    the

        fundamental    rights of controllers, including their fundamental     right
        to property   as provided    for under   Article 1 of Protocol    1 of the

        European    Convention   on  Human    rights,  and  Article 17  of the   EU
        Charter   of Fundamental     Rights.149  The  Commissioner      recognises
        that i imposing a penalty on a controller, she must comply with any

        relevant fundamental     rights that are engaged,     including under the
        ECHR or the EU Charter. However,       i i not accepted that taking into

        account   a controller’s   turnover    i  determining    the   appropriate
        penalty i incompatible with those rights because         i i arbitrary or
        results  i grossly   disproportionate    levels of penalty    (as Marriott

        contended    at para  4.14(c)   of its First Representations).     I i an
        approach that complies with the regime established by the GDPR.

148 Marriott’s First Representations, para 4.14(d).
149 Marriott’s First Representations, para 4.14(c).
                                                                                 127.74.   Fourth,   Marriott   contended     that   the   turnover    approach \_ i

        inconsistent with the RAP.!°° This i incorrect.

7.75.   As explained   above, the calculation of the proposed      penalty i the
        NOI was   not exclusively based     on turnover,   contrary to Marriott’s

        claim. I took account of the various factors discussed        i the RAP.
        This Notice addresses each step of the process of the RAP in turn to

        make   even clearer that the penalty has been set i accordance with
        its terms. Turnover   i relevant to establishing whether a penalty i
        appropriate,  proportionate, effective and dissuasive i applying the

        steps set out in the RAP, as explained above.

7.76.   Moreover,   Marriott’s reliance in this regard  on reference   in the RAP

        to  circumstances    i   which   the  Commissioner      will convene    an
        advisory panel i misplaced.1>! The RAP describes “very significant”

        penalties as those “expected to be those over the threshold of 1M”
        i that particular context, i.e. the context i which the Commissioner
        may  convene   an advisory panel. This was not intended to be - and

        i any event cannot objectively be read as giving - an indication to
        controllers of the likely penalty they may face i the event of a data

        breach,  particularly in light of the provisions   of GDPR.   The  section
        of the RAP setting out how penalties will be calculated does not refer
        to the concept of “very significant” penalties at all.

7.77.   Consequently,   the RAP’s discussion of when     an advisory panel may
        be convened    i no basis for saying that turnover      i not a relevant

        factor i determining    penalty. Marriott was also therefore wrong      to
        claim in its Representations   that: (a) the £1million figure referred to

        i the discussion    of when    an advisory   panel  may   be appropriate
        should be the starting point for calculating fines i the most serious
        and  significant  cases   before  the   Commissioner;1>\*    and   (b)  the

        Commissioner    must justify imposing    any fine above that threshold
        figure. This i a misreading of the RAP, see further below.

7.78.   Firth, Marriott contended    that what the Commissioner      should  have
        done  i quantifying    the appropriate   penalty was to “(a) start with
        what an infringement of this nature is objectively worth in penalty

        terms having regard to its nature, gravity and duration, irrespective
        of the financial stature of the wrongdoer;    then (b) add or take away

150 Marriott’s First Representations, para 4.14(f).
151 Page 26 of the RAP. See also para 4.46 of Marriott’s First Representations.
152 Marriott’s First Representations, para 4.46.
                                                                                13        amounts    to reflect respectively aggravating and mitigating factors;

        before moving at the final stage of the analysis to (c) the question
        of whether,   in view of all the circumstances,     some   increase  in the
        penalty is required to ensure a deterrent effect.”'>?

7.79.   The Commissioner’s     approach    i set out above. She has considered
        each step of the RAP, and a of the factors listed i Article 83 GDPR,

        i order to arrive at the overall appropriate penalty. Given that the
        financial  stature  of the wrongdoer      would   need   to be taken    into
        account at least i considering whether an increase i fine would be

        necessary to secure a deterrent effect, i i not clear that adopting
        the  alternative   structure  proposed    by Marriott   would   make    any

        material difference to the outcome.

        (4) The appropriate    tier

7.80.   In response to the NOI, Marriott submitted        that the Commissioner

        had applied the wrong fining tier. I was said that the Commissioner
        incorrectly   categorised    the   breaches     i   issue   as   a  Tier   2
        infringement, allowing for a maximum       fine of 4% of turnover.!>4 This

        submission was based, i summary,          on the following points:

        a.   Article 5(1)(f)   i simply   a shorter,   summary     version,  of the

             more   detailed  and  specific obligation   i Article 32. Article 32
             GDPR    therefore amounts     to the /ex specialis of Article 5(1)(f)
             and should therefore take precedence.

        b.   The maximum      fine should  be 2%   in this case because:

             i    Any    ambiguity    in the   wording    of a   provision   of law
                   imposing a civil penalty should be resolved i favour of the

                   controller.

             i    |The wording of Article 83(4) makes clear that the intention
                  was   to impose    this lower maximum      cap for breaches     of
                  Article 32, which i the /ex specialis.

7.81.   The   Commissioner     does   not  accept   these   submissions,    for the

        following  reasons.

153 Marriott’s First Representations, para 4.15.
154 Marriott’s First Representations, paras 4.16-4.17.
                                                                                  747.82.   First, the GDPR addresses expressly what the appropriate maximum

        fine should   be when    a controller breaches     the “basic principles of
        processing” under    Article 5 GDPR. Article 5(1)(f), as one of the basic
        principles of processing, cannot be dismissed as simply a summary

        of a later new provision included i the GDPR. The EU legislature has
        made   i clear that a higher penalty i appropriate where a controller

        i found    to have   breached    the basic principles of processing      that
        underpin    the  regime.   Contrary   to Marriott’s   submissions,    Article
        83(5)(a)   provides   i clear i explicit and unambiguous         terms that

        4%   i the appropriate cap for breaches of Article 5, including Article
        5(1)(f).

7.83.   Second,    the   GDPR    also   recognises    that   the  same     or  linked
        processing    operations   may   give   rise to infringements     of several

        provisions of that Regulation. I addresses this by making clear that
        the total amount    of any penalty i to be the subject of the amount
        specified for the gravest infringement (see Article 83(3)).

7.84.   Third, the principle of /ex specialis means      that “where a legal issue
        falls within the ambit of a provision framed in general terms, but is

        also   specifically  addressed     by  another    provision,    the  specific
        provision   overrides   the  more   general   one.”!>>  The   Commissioner
        does   not accept that the application      of the /ex specialis    principle

        precludes   the Commissioner       from   treating  this case   as a Tier 2
        infringement.

7.85.   Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32 are evidently distinct provisions of the
        GDPR,   notwithstanding the degree of overlap. Article 32 applies to

        processors,    whilst   Article  5 does     not.   Contrary    to  Marriott’s
        submission,    there   i   no   basis  upon    which   to  give   Article  32
        precedence    over Article 5(1)(f). They can be applied to controllers

        at  the   same     time:   Article  32   does    not   override   the   basic
        requirements     laid down   in Article  5(1)(f),  read  with  Article  5(2),

        which establish the responsibility of the controller for demonstrating
        compliance    with   the  security  obligation   and   any  breach    of that
        principle.

7.86.   Further, and in any event, the provisions in Article 83(4)        and Article
        83(5)   are   distinct  provisions   which   make    explicit  provision   for

155 R (Hallam) v Secretary of State for Justice \[202 at \[144\]. See also Case T-60/06 RENV
I Italy v Commissio(2016), at \[81\].
                                                                                   15        different fining tiers to apply to breaches of Articles 5 and 32 GDPR.
        I i clear that any infringement of Article 32 falls within the scope

        of Article 83(4) whilst an infringement of Article 5(1)(f) falls within
        the scope   of Article 83(5). Article 83(4)   i not more     specific than

        Article 83(5). I i incapable of overriding or taking precedence over
        i   Rather,  any   issue  as to which    maximum      penalty   applies  i
        resolved  by the application    of Article 83(3)  which  states i terms

        that i these circumstances “the total amount of the administrative
        fine  shall  not  exceed    the   amount    specified   for  the  gravest

        infringement.”   The   legislation itself provides   the  mechanism     for
        addressing   circumstances    i which   processing   engages   more   than
        one obligation.

7.87.   The Commissioner notes that her interpretation of Articles 83(4)-(5)
        i supported    by the Article 29 Working      Party’s Guidelines   on the

        application  and  setting  of administrative  fines for the purposes     of
        the GDPR,   which  states:

          Specific infringements    are not given    a specific price tag in the

          Regulation, only a cap (maximum       amount).   This can be indicative
          of a relative lower degree     of gravity for a breach    of obligations

          listed in article 83(4),   compared     with  those  set out in article
          83(5).  The effective, proportionate     and dissuasive reaction to a
          breach of article 83(5) will however depend on the circumstances

          of the case...

          The   occurrence    of several   different  infringements    committed

          together in any particular single case means      that the supervisory
          authority is able to apply the administrative fines at a level which
          is effective, proportionate   and dissuasive    within the limit of the

          gravest infringement.     Therefore,  if an infringement    of article 8
          and article 12 has been discovered, then the supervisory authority
          may be able to apply the corrective measures as set out in article

          83(5)    which   correspond     to  the   category    of   the  gravest
          infringement, namely article 12....1°°

7.88.   Fourth, i any event, Marriott’s main objection to the use of the 4%
        maximum     penalty appears to be its impact on the turnover-bands
        applied  under  the Draft Internal    Procedure,   which  was   applied  i

        calculating the proposed   fine included i the Notice of Intent. As this

156 Pages 9-10.
                                                                                16        approach    has  not been   adopted    i determining     the final level of
        penalty to be imposed      by this Notice, the same      concerns    do not

        arise. I i noted that the final penalty imposed      i well below the 2%
        cap, and so the application of that cap i reaching the final decision,

        as opposed   to a 4%   cap, would have made      no difference.

7.89.   Marriott   also   asserted    i    a   single   paragraph    of   its  First
        Representations that the Commissioner’s approach to quantification

        i “wholly arbitrary”.'°’ This i not accepted, either as a criticism of
        the NOI   or this Notice.    I appears    that this argument     rested  on

        Marriott’s contention    that there are no clear and      precise   rules i
        place governing the setting of the penalty by the Commissioner. This
        claim i addressed     below.

        (5) An uplift to ensure a deterrent effect

7.90.   Marriott  claimed    that  the  proposal   i   the  NOI   to increase    the
        proposed   penalty for the infringement      to 2.5%    to ensure    that i

        would    have   a   sufficient  deterrent    effect  was    arbitrary   and
        unlawful.1°° This i not accepted.      The   Commissioner     i obliged   to
        consider whether such an uplift should be made         under the RAP and

        Article 83 GDPR.

7.91.   Marriott's  criticisms of the  NOI   in this regard  relied  heavily  on  its

        criticisms of the previous use made of the Draft Internal Procedure’s
        turnover-based    approach    i setting   the proposed     penalty  at that
        stage.'°°? These  points have been addressed       above.   I i   however,

        important to note that para 61(d) of the NOI explained that i the
        light of the   scale  and   severity  of the   infringement    and  factors
        discussed i para 61(a)-(c), a penalty of between        1.5 and 2% would

        be  appropriate    and   proportionate.   Para   61(f)  then   went   on  to
        consider what an appropriate uplift would       be to ensure a deterrent

        effect,  which   was   a separate     issue   that  warranted    individual
        consideration   at a later stage of the analysis. These       are separate
        steps under the RAP (see Section 2 above). I i therefore incorrect

        to assert, as Marriot did, that any uplift from the judged          starting
        point  means    that  the  Commissioner:      “is knowingly    imposing    a

        disproportionate penalty sum. °°

                                                                                  ae7.92.   In any event,   as set out above   under   Step 4, no additional   amount
        has been   added   in this case for deterrent effect.

        (6) Legitimate Expectation and Legal Certainty

        The alleged legitimate expectation

7.93.   In  response   to the    NOI   and  draft  decision,   Marriott  relied  on

        selective quotes from public statements made        by the Commissioner
        or her office about the new GDPR     regime to contend that fines under
        the GDPR    should   be set i accordance      with  past precedents,    i.e.

        decisions  made    under   the DPA   1998.'6!   What   Marriott  seeks,   i
        effect, i for the Commissioner      unilaterally to impose   the previous

        domestic cap and approach to fines which applied i the UK prior to
        the harmonised    regime under the GDPR.

7.94.   Plainly i i not open to the Commissioner,        as a matter of domestic

        or EU law, to adopt unilaterally an approach       that would   undermine
        the object and purpose of the new EU regime.

7.95.   The   GDPR,   and   consequently     the  DPA,   represent   a significant
        departure from the regime under DPA 1998 and the 1995 Directive.
        The GDPR    was expressly intended      to harmonise    the rights of, and

        protections   afforded   to, data   subjects  across   the  EU.  I differs
        markedly    from   the   1995   Directive,  most    obviously   i   that  i
        introduces   significantly higher   and  more   effective  penalties,  with

        maximum     penalties defined expressly by reference to turnover. The
        GDPR   also imposes    new   obligations  on controllers,   including  new

        organisational   requirements     such  as the    designation   of a data
        protection   officer   and   new    provisions   on   the   lawfulness   of
        processing. The GDPR      and the DPA    have significantly changed     the

        legal landscape i data protection and enforcement.

7.96.   Marriott’s submissions are to the effect that public statements made

        by the Commissioner      override these changes,      and  as such   she i
        bound to apply i effect the DPA 1998 and/or only apply incremental
        increases to the level of fine that would have been issued under that

        Act. Public statements made by the Commissioner or her staff, which
        are i any event quoted selectively and/or taken out of their proper

        context by Marriott, are incapable of achieving this outcome.

161 Marriott’s First Representations, paras 4.37-4.41. See also Marriott’s First Representations, paras
4.65-4.66, see also Marriott’s SRepresentations, para 1.28-1.31.
                                                                                 187.97.   More specifically, the public statements referred to by Marriott i its
        Representations   were   not intended   to be - and cannot objectively

        be read as - assurances      to any controller that the Commissioner
        would   not use   her powers    on a case    by case   basis, to impose

        effective, proportionate    and  dissuasive   penalties   i  appropriate
        cases.  Marriott disputes this, however, the Commissioner maintains
        her position for the following  reasons:

        a.   Marriott refers to a blog post published     by Elizabeth   Denham
             on 9 August 2017.1      Whilst i i true that the post states that

             the Commissioner     will not “simply scale up penalties” issued
             under the DPA    1998, i also states: “Don’t get me      wrong,  the
             UK  fought   for increased   powers   when   the GDPR    was   being

             drawn   up. Heavy   fines for serious breaches     reflect just how
             important personal data is in the 21°\* century world. We intend

             to use those powers proportionately and judiciously.”

        b.   Marriott refers to a speech made    by James Dipple-Johnstone at
             the Data Protection Practitioner’s Conference on 9 April 2018,/°

             however    the  quotation   which    Marriott  selectively  cited  i
             preceded   by a summary      of the approach     the Commissioner

             intended to take, including “we will look at each case on its own
             merits. We'll look at the features and context of each case. And,
             this is important, we will focus on area of greatest risk to people

             - potential or actual harm...    The more    serious,  high impact,
             deliberate,  wilful or repeated   breaches   can expect    the most

             robust response.”

7.98.   There i nothing within these quotations which can be read as giving
        rise to a legitimate expectation that the Commissioner would either:

        (a) issue fines i accordance with the previous maximum        limit which
        applied  under  the DPA   1998   and/or  past cases   issued  under that
        Act; or (b) only apply incremental increases to the level of fine that

        would  have been imposed     under the DPA 1998.16 As made        clear i
        the   blog  and    speech    to  which    Marriott  has    referred,  the

        Commissioner    had always been clear that she would (in accordance
        with her obligations) use her full powers ona case by case basis, to

163 Marriott’s Second Representations, para 1.29(b).
164 Marriott’s Second Representations, paras 1.30-1.31.
                                                                               19        impose    effective,   proportionate     and    dissuasive    penalties   i
        appropriate cases, which includes the possibility of large fines.

7.99.   Marriott   accepted     i    its  Second     Representations     that   the
        Commissioner      i   not   constrained    by   the   previous    statutory

        maximum     of £500,000.'©     But i practice, its attempt     to limit the
        Commissioner to only making       incremental increases to the fine level
        that would   have applied under the DPA 1998 amounts          to the same

        thing. The starting point i the application of Article 83 GDPR,          the
        DPA 2018 and the RAP. I i not what the decision would have been

        under a superseded     legal regime.

        The alleged lack of legal certainty

7.100. As set out above, the Commissioner          recognises that i imposing      a

        penalty   on   a controller,   she   must    comply   with   any   relevant
        fundamental    rights that are engaged,     including under the ECHR      or

        the EU Charter.     She  does   not accept,   however,   that the penalty
        regime    applicable   under,   i   particular,  Article  83  GDPR     lacks
        sufficient certainty such that i cannot be lawfully applied. That i i

        effect Marriott’s  case.   I contends    that unless   the Commissioner
        applies  a precedents-based       approach    based   on  decisions   made

        under the DPA 1998, i i impossible for the Commissioner            to meet
        the requirement of legal certainty.1®

7.101.  The   DPA   reflects  the  directly  applicable   EU  law  framework     for

        determining    penalties.   The   Commissioner     does   not  agree   with
        Marriott that Article 83 GDPR or section 155 DPA are so unclear that

        they  are  unlawful.   Taken   together,   those   provisions  specify  the
        circumstances i which a data protection authority has the power to
        impose an administrative penalty, and the matters that are relevant

        to that decision    and  the amount     of any   penalty.  The   legislative
        regime   i supplemented       by the   RAP,   which   provides   additional
        guidance   i this regard.    Contrary   to para 4.60    of Marriott’s  First

        Representations, the RAP cannot be dismissed as “unclear and open-
        ended”.

7.102. Marriott’s submissions on legal certainty are wrong for the following
        seven reasons.

165 Marriott’s Second Representations, para 1.30.
166 Marriott’s First Representations, paras 4.50-4.73.
                                                                                  807.103.  First, in accordance    with  section  161   DPA  2018   the  RAP  was   laid

        before Parliament for approval, and was duly approved.

7.104. In its Second     Representations,    Marriott emphasised      the fact that
        Articles 83(8)-(9) and 70(1)(k) GDPR       “directly envisage and expect”

        that the high-level    principles set out i the legislation will be the
        subject of national or supranational guidance.!®” Pursuant to section

        160 DPA, the Commissioner        i obliged to issue guidance      i respect
        of how   she will determine    the amount    of penalties to be imposed.
        She has done so through the RAP.

7.105.  Second,   the  RAP,  which   must   be read   alongside   the  DPA   and,  in
        particular,  Article  83  GDPR,    provides   sufficient  clarity and   legal

        certainty, as required under the ECHR and EU law. In particular, the
        RAP explains that Step 2 intends to “censure” the breach, and this

        requires taking into consideration its scale (including the number of
        data subjects    affected)  and the severity of the breach       itself, and
        expressly   refers to the factors     set out i the     DPA.   Examples    of

        aggravating    factors  are   set out   i   the  RAP   to assist   with  the
        interpretation   of Step    3, as well    as   mitigating   factors  (to  be

        considered    at Step   5).  Marriott’s  argument     appears   to be that
        because i i possible for the RAP to be more detailed, i must follow
        that the RAP    i insufficiently detailed to fulfil the requirements       of

        legal certainty.  That i not the case.

7.106. I i not suggested       that i i impossible     to produce    more   detailed

        quantification guidance.1®\* The GDPR        i a new regime. Whilst not
        necessary    for  the   purposes    of  legal  certainty,   more    detailed

        guidance may well be developed over time as the UK and EU Member
        States   gain   experience    in  applying   i   The   Commissioner      has
        committed     to  updating    the   guidance    available   i   the  future.

        However, the fact that there i potential for further development           of
        the guidance does not mean that the present guidance i so unclear

        as to be unlawful. The      RAP  provides   sufficient guidance   as to the
        circumstances    i which    penalties, including large penalties, will be
        applied.

167 Marriott’s Second Representations, para 1.9.
168 Marriott’s Second Representations, para 1.10.
                                                                                  817.107. Third,   i i neither    necessary   nor possible   to produce    a specific
        quantification framework which tells controllers precisely what level

        of fine they may face.

7.108.  In para 1.9 of its Second    Representations,   Marriott claims that the

        Commissioner    cannot lawfully impose     penalties without setting out
        a further   quantification   methodology.'®?    This   i  incorrect.  The
        guidance   available  from  Article 83 GDPR,     the DPA   and   the RAP,

        cannot  be rejected as legally uncertain     purely on the basis that i
        does  not attempt    to specify exactly what    levels of penalty   might

        attach to wrongdoing.'”°

7.109. I would be impossible for the Commissioner to specify all the types
        of situations, and   relevant circumstances,    i which   a penalty may

        be imposed     under  the GDPR.     Nor  could  any  guidance    permit  a
        controller to calculate specifically what any fine might be (especially

        by reference   to a particular fine). The    guidance   must   be general
        enough   i order to cover a wide range of potential situations, and
        respect the general discretion of the Commission       (subject to public

        law principles). The GDPR    also requires the Commissioner to take a
        case-by-case    approach,   guided   by the   need  to ensure    that any

        penalty i effective, proportionate and dissuasive, and subject to the
        prescribed turnover caps.

7.110. Fourth, contrary to Marriott’s submissions,‘7! there i also no flaw i

        the Commissioner’s approach because, on the particular facts of this
        case,  no adjustments    needed   to be made     at certain steps   i the
        process.  The draft decision explained clearly, i particular, that: (a)

        the need to ensure the penalty i dissuasive was taken into account
        sufficiently under Step 2 such that there was no need for a further

        uplift reflecting the need for the penalty sum to deter others under
        Step 4;172 and (b) the mitigating factors had been taken into account
        under   Step  2, so no adjustment      was   made   at Step    5 to avoid

        ‘double-counting’.   The   fact  that  certain   steps  did   not  require
        adjustments to be made     i a particular case particular case does not

        render  the  RAP,   which  i intended    to be of general     application,
        “deficient” .173

        the mitigating factors arising i this case under Step 5 of the analysis
        (rather than Step 2, see para 7.40 above)          so that i can see the

        impact of these factors on the overall level of penalty.

7.112. Fifth, as explained     at paragraph     7.68   above,   the  Draft  Internal

        Procedure was not developed and i not relied upon for the purposes
        of meeting    the legal certainty   requirement,    contrary to Marriott’s

        submissions    during the course of the investigation.1’\* While i was
        intended to be a helpful supplement to the RAP for internal decision-
        making   purposes,   i has been disregarded       for the purposes    of this

        Notice.

7.113. Sixth, for the reasons given above i respect of Marriott’s legitimate

        expectation   argument,    i i not open      to the  Commissioner     to re-
        impose the different, UK-only, legislative cap on fines i the manner

        sought   by Marriott. The bands which applied under the DPA           1998,
        and   the  decisions   made    under   i   cannot   be  relied  upon   as a

        justification for the Commissioner to fail to comply with EU law.

7.114. Finally, as to the claim made      by Marriott that other bodies, namely

        the FCA   and   the EU Commission,       apply  more   rigorous   and  more
        predictable    rules,  i  i   noted   that   each   regulator   must    take

        enforcement    action within the bounds      of its own   legal obligations,
        and i this case the Commissioner        i bound to comply, i particular,
        with Article 83 of the GDPR.\*7°

        Other decisions by the Commissioner / Decisions by other European
        authorities

7.115. Marriott submitted     i its Representations that the proposed        penalty
        i inconsistent with previous action by the Commissioner           and other

        EU supervisory authorities, contrary to the stated aim of GDPR         being
        to create a harmonised     regime. ?’° In its Representations,’”” Marriott

        states that the proposed penalty i (a) inconsistent with action taken
        by other EU supervisory authorities, (b) contrary to the stated aim

        of the GDPR    being a harmonised      regime;  and (c) inconsistent with

        specifically refers to the following cases:

        a.   the decision by CNIL to impose a €50 million penalty on Google.
             Marriott  contended    that the   infringements    i  Google’s   case

             were more serious than those considered        i this Notice.

        b.   the Austrian Data Protection Authority against Osterreichische

             Post AG, which    was fined €18   million;

        c    a €2.6   million  fine issued   by the   Bulgarian   Commission     of
             Personal   Data  Protection to the Bulgarian     Revenue   Agency   i

             relation to a cyber-attack     which  affected  over 5 million data
             subjects;

        d.   a fine   of €645,000     imposed    on   Morele.net   by   the  Polish
             supervisory authority for a cyber-attack affecting over 2 million

             data subjects;

        e.   a fine of €150,000   impose on Raiffeisen Bank by the Romanian
             supervisory authority concerning      the misuse of customer     data

             by employees    of the bank;

        f    the  Romanian    authority  on  UniCredit   Bank  SA.  The  company

             was  fined  of €130,000   for a breach   of Article 25 GDPR    due to
             the   compromise     of  payment     details,  when    its worldwide
             turnover for 2018    was  of €18  billion; and

        g.   the Commissioner’s     decision   regarding   Doorstep   Dispensaree
             Ltd, dated  20 December     2019.

7.116. The    purpose    of GDPR     i   as   Marriott  contends,    to  secure   a
        harmonised     regime.   However,     that  harmonisation     i   achieved

        through   the application  of harmonised     rules and standards    to the
        particular facts of the case at issue. Any      cross-border    processing
        decision must then be subject to the Article 60 process.

7.117. The   Commissioner,     along   with  other  EU  supervisory    authorities,
        must comply with her obligations under Article 83 and that means

        that she i required to impose a penalty which, i her own judgment,
        having regard to all the matters listed i Article 83, and on the facts

        of the individual case, i effective, proportionate, and dissuasive. In
        principle, ‘equivalent’ breaches should attach ‘equivalent’ penalties.

                                                                                 84        But i practice, each case will turn on its own particular facts. Whilst

        the Commissioner     has considered   the limited information available
        about  the cases  to which   Marriott  has referred,  she maintains   that
        simple comparisons     of the penalties imposed     i different cases do

        not show   that the Commissioner      has erred   i applying    Article 83
        GDPR,   DPA  and/or the RAP.

7.118. There   i a great degree     of variation   i the penalties    imposed   by
        supervisory   authorities  even   i the   context   of the   limited fines
        imposed   to date,?”®   which   are  - i   the  Commissioner’s     view  -

        indicative of a decision-making    process that i fact-specific. I would
        be premature     and  not necessarily    helpful to rely heavily   at this

        juncture  on   a survey   of the   action  taken   by other   supervisory
        authorities, given the relatively few decisions that have been taken

        under the new    regime. This i particularly the case where       there i
        limited  public  information    available  about   the  reasons   for the
        decisions taken by other authorities.

7.119. In any event, as the Commissioner       i acting as lead authority i this
        case, the way to ensure consistency i not by comparing the penalty

        to a selection of other penalties issued on different facts in the EU.
        Rather, the consistency    mechanism     provided   for by Articles 60(4)
        and   63  GDPR    will allow   for all of the   supervisory    authorities

        concerned to cooperate with the Commissioner, make enquiries, and
        contribute  their views   i order    to ensure   the consistency    of the

        ultimate penalty sum with penalties that have been ( there are any)
        and/or will be applied i similar situations. The Article 60 process i

        one  of the factors which,   as noted  in Article 63, contributes   to the
        consistent application of the GDPR and the Commissioner         i entitled
        to rely on the process as a contributory factor.

        (7) Application of the RAP

7.120. In response to the NOI and/or the draft decision, Marriott submitted
        that the Commissioner     had acted contrary to the RAP by: (a) failing

        to consider   separately  the appropriate    fines for the provisionally
        found  breaches of Articles 33 and 34 GDPR,       from those i relation
        to Articles 5(1)(f) and   32 GDPR;     (b) failing to adopt the starting

178 Notably the decision of the FrSA, the CNIL, to fine Goog50 million EuroSee also
https://www.enforcementtracker.cowhich suggests there i significant variation i the level of
fines that have been imposed to date, ranging from a few thousand to millions of pounds.

                                                                                85        point  that  any   penalty   of over   £1   million  i reserved    for very

        significant cases; and/or (c) failing to correctly apply the factors that
        the RAP categorises as determining whether a higher penalty can be
        imposed.+79

7.121.  As to the first issue, the Commissioner      has not included    in her final
        decision  a finding   that Marriott   breached   Article 33 or 34 GDPR.

        Thus, this issue no longer arises.

7.122. The   second    issue  i based    on a misreading     of the RAP.    Marriott
        misunderstood the discussion of the circumstances i which she may

        convene an advisory panel. This point has been addressed above at
        paras 7.76-7.77.

7.123. In   response    to the   draft  decision,   Marriott  submitted    that  the
        Commissioner     i seeking to “reinterpret” the wording       of page 26 of

        the RAP    i this regard.   That   i incorrect. The    section  of the RAP
        which addresses     specifically the setting of a penalty does not refer
        to this concept of “very significant” penalties at all. This language i

        used   only   to  describe    the  types    of  situations   i   which   the
        Commissioner     may convene an advisory panel.!®°

7.124.  Marriott also submitted that the fact that: “the ICO appears to have
        determined     that  this  case   is not   significant   enough    to merit
        convening    the  panel,  which   is entirely  inconsistent   with  the  fine

        imposed and further demonstrates the arbitrariness of this process.”
        181 This submission    i unfounded. The Commissioner         has discretion

        over whether to convene a panel. The reasons why a panel was not
        convened    i this case was      explained   i correspondence,      i.e. this

        decision would    be subject to the Article 60 consultation process. In
        such circumstances,     the panel was unnecessary.       I does not imply
        that this case lacks significance. For the reasons outlined above, this

        case has been found to involve significant breaches of the GDPR.

7.125. The    third   issue   was    also  based    on   a   misinterpretation     or

        misapplication of the RAP. Contrary to Marriott’s submissions, !      ®2 the
        RAP does not set out at page 27 the only categories of cases i which
        i i justifiable for the Commissioner      to impose a high penalty. The

        must be met i any case before a penalty exceeding         £1 million can
        be imposed.   They provide a general indication of the circumstances
        i which a penalty will be higher. The Commissioner       i not therefore

        departing from guidance i a manner which has to be justified.        This
        Penalty Notice explains why the fine set i appropriate.

7.126. The GDPR was enacted i 2016 and came into force two years later.
        Data   controllers,  especially  global  undertakings    of the   size  of
        Marriott, would   have  been   fully aware  of the maximum      penalties

        permitted  by GDPR.    The reference to the sum     of £1 million i the
        RAP  does   no more   than  describe  the circumstances     i which   the

        Commissioner    may   decide to convene    an advisory panel, and page
        27 of the RAP cannot be relied upon to confine the Commissioner’s

        power  to impose    penalties i the manner     sought   by Marriott. The
        decision  as to whether   a penalty   should  be imposed    and  at what
        level, i order to provide an effective, proportionate and dissuasive

        result has to be reached     through   the application  of Article 83(2)
        GDPR   and  section 155  DPA   2018.  It i clear from  the RAP   that the

        Commissioner     will adopt   a case-specific    approach,   taking   into
        account  all relevant considerations.   That i the approach      taken  i
        this case.

        (8) Proportionality

7.127.  Marriott contends that the proposed     penalty set out i the NOI was
        disproportionate   on its face.18? This argument     i not accepted     i

        respect of the provisional penalty that was proposed       i the light of
        the information available at that time.

7.128. I i also not accepted that the penalty proposed i the draft decision
        was  also disproportionate.   That proposed    penalty took account     of
        and reflected the submissions     made   by Marriott i response to the

        NOI. Marriott criticised the approach    taken i the draft decision on
        the basis that the claim that the fine proposed       was  proportionate

        rested inappropriately on a comparison with the level of penalty set
        out i the NOI1®\*, That was not the approach taken. Section 7 of the
        draft decision explained clearly the basis upon which, at that time,

        the proposed   penalty was proportionate. In any event, this Penalty
        Notice explains i clear terms why the level of final penalty imposed

       Commissioner    (see paragraphs 7.3-7.57 above).

7.129. The mathematical    error made   at para 5.43 of the draft decision i

       noted.?8° No such error i made    at para 7.57 above.

8. HOW     THE PENALTY         IS TO BE PAID

8.1.   The  penalty  must  be paid to the Commissioner’s     office by BACS
       transfer or cheque.

8.2.   The  penalty i not kept by the Commissioner      but will be paid into

       the Consolidated    Fund  which  i the Government’s     general  bank
       account at the Bank of England.

9. ENFORCEMENT           POWERS

9.1.   The Commissioner will not take action to enforce a penalty unless:

          e all or any of the penalty has not been paid;

          e all relevant appeals against the penalty notice and any variation
            of i have either been decided or withdrawn;    and

          e the period for appealing  against the penalty and any variation

            of i has expired.

9.2.   In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the penalty i recoverable
       by Order of the County    Court or the High Court. In Scotland, the

       penalty can be enforced i the same manner as an extract registered
       decree arbitral bearing a warrant for execution issued by the sheriff
       court of any sheriffdom i Scotland.

             b)    to the extent that the notice involved an exercise of
                   discretion by the Commissioner,     that she ought to have

                   exercised her discretion differently,

             the Tribunal will allow the appeal or substitute such other
             decision as could have been made      by the Commissioner.     In

             any other case the Tribunal will dismiss the appeal.

      3.     You may bring an appeal by serving a notice of appeal on the
