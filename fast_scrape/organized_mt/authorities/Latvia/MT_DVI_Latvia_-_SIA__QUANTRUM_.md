## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is a company which provides security services. In its premises, it uses a CCTV system which records both the video and the audio.

The data subject filed a complaint with the DPA and argued that, after they were recorded by the CCTV system, the footage was sent to them by an employee of the controller on WhatsApp and Telegram.

On 8 February 2023, the DPA opened an investigation.

The controller argued that none of its instructions to employees include copying video material onto any kind of private devices. Therefore, in the present case, the video footage was sent to the data subject by an employee without any instruction or order by the controller.

Moreover, the controller informed the DPA that the footage had been deleted and the employment relationship with the employee had been terminated.

### Holding

Firstly, the DPA noted that the controller has established procedures to manage access authorisations, access control, for organising video surveillance, for viewing the archive of video surveillance recordings, and for creating, issuing and storing a copy of recordings. The DPA held that these technical and organisational measures adopted by the controller comply with the requirements of [Article 25(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR#1 "Article 25 GDPR").

Moreover, the DPA found that the controller cannot be held liable for the action of its employees who deliberately disregarded the rules set by the controller and obtain CCTV footage without the appropriate authorisation.

On these grounds, the DPA did not find an infringement and dismissed the complaint.

However, the DPA decided ex officio to extend the scope of the investigation with regard to the fact that the CCTV was equipped with an audio recording function. The DPA noted that this audio recording had been conducted on the basis of the [Cabinet of Ministers Regulation of 21 June 2022 No. 369](https://likumi.lv/ta/id/333567-noteikumi-par-apsardzes-darbibas-registru-apsardzes-darbibas-registraciju-un-prasibam-apsardzes-vadibas-centram). Sub-paragraph 4.24 of this regulation states that the conversations between security personnel that take place by means of remote communication must be recorded and stored for three months.

The DPA, after asking an opinion to the Ministry of the Interior, stated that the audio recording through CCTV cameras does not fall into the scope of sub-paragraph 4.24, as it only recorded the voice of one of the two people having the conversation.

Therefore, the DPA found that this processing activity was not compliant with [Articles 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR") and [(c)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR") and [6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR").

On these grounds, the DPA ordered to the controller to cease the recording of audio in connection with the video surveillance.

done legally
      \[5.2.\] Regulation no. 369 4.24. subsection stipulates that there must be a security control center

sufficient Regulation No. 369 4.24. for the implementation of subsection, the Inspectorate asked for the opinion of the Internal Affairs
to the Ministry on whether the security merchant in the security control center should make an audio recording for them
for conversations that take place between persons in the security control center, or however this subsection
for enforcement, the security merchant must make a record only for the communication that took place through the communication
means (such as a telephone or radio).
                                                     7
      \[5.4.\] According to the opinion of the Ministry of the Interior, the security merchant is obliged to provide
the existence of means of communication (for example, a radio station, telephone) through which communication takes place between
employees of the security merchant with other employees located outside the control center,
for the security merchant's mobile groups, security service recipients, other persons and
institutions, and is also instructed to ensure the recording and storage of the mentioned communication information.

funds. The inspection takes into account that, when guarding the object, it is essential to have in the event of an incident

actions of the security guards, therefore it is essential that the communications provided during communication are recorded

information so that, if necessary, you can listen to what both participants of the conversation said.
      When making an audio recording with video surveillance, SIA does not provide Regulation No. 369
4.24. full implementation of the subsection, because the audio recording made by the video surveillance camera records
only what the security control center employee says, but what the other participant in the conversation says is not recorded.

to persons who are in the security control center, and these conversations may be unrelated to anyone
security incident.
      Taking into account the above, it can be established that the data processing carried out by SIA, when making an audio recording,
does not meet the requirements of Article 5(1)(a) and (c) and Article 6(1) of the Data Regulation.
