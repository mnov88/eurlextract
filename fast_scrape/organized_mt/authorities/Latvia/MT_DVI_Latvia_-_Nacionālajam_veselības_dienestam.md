## English Summary

### Facts

A Latvian court requested the Latvian National Health Service to share some data concerning a minor. In such an order, the data subject was identified by name and surname and a numerical code, which turned out to be wrong.

The National Health Service, the controller, identified a wrong data subject by means of the personal numerical code and disclosed their health data to the court.

The Latvian DPA started an investigation against the controller.

### Holding

The DPA pointed out that Latvian law imposes the use of a unique identifier as the safest way to store and process personal data of citizens. This system is the safest and minimises mistakes such as the unlawful disclosure of health data of people other than the one whose data are requested by a public institution – in this case the court.

However, the DPA also held that this system, taken alone, was not sufficient to avoid unlawful disclosures. In particular, the National Health Service should have relied on additional criteria, such as name and surname of the data subject - which was already known to them. The need of a double check became apparent in the case at issue, where matching the code with these additional pieces of information would have easily prevented the controller from disclosing sensitive data of another data subject.

Therefore, the controller did not put in place technical and organisational measures to minimise risks of unauthorised disclosure and violated [Articles 24(1)](/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR#1 "Article 24 GDPR") and [32(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1b "Article 32 GDPR"). Processing was thus unlawful and infringed [Articles 6(1)(a) and (f)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") and [9(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2 "Article 9 GDPR").

In light of the above, the DPA held proportionate to order the controller pursuant to [Article 58(2)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2d "Article 58 GDPR") to adapt its technical and organisational measures, without imposing a fine.

The findings in point 2 are concluded:
      \[3.1.\] GDPR aims to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, their rights
to the protection of personal data.

      According to Article 4, Clauses 1, 2 and 15 of GDPR, "personal data" is any information related to
to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"), "health data" means personal data,
related to the physical or mental health of an individual, including health care services

                                                                                          11
      The manager is responsible for the compliance of personal data processing with GDPR requirements. Appropriately
Cabinet of Ministers Regulation No. 134 of March 11, 2014 "Regulations on the unified health sector
electronic information system" to point 2 and published on the website of the E-health system

for information, the Service is considered the controller.
      In order to recognize the data processing performed by the controller as legal and lawful, the controller must comply with the GDPR
The principles of personal data processing determined in Article 5, Clause 1, according to which the processing carried out must be
for an appropriate legal basis 14 and personal data must be processed in such a way as to ensure

adequate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against
accidental loss, destruction or damage using appropriate technical or
organizational measures. 15

      Paragraph 1 of Article 6 GDPR states that the processing is legal only to the extent and only if there is
at least one of the legal bases is applicable: consent, contract performance, legal obligation,
public interest, protection of vital interests and observance of legitimate interests. According to the GDPR
Paragraph 1 of Article 9 prohibits the processing of personal health data, if it is not applicable to such processing

any of the justifications mentioned in Article 9, Clause 2 of GDPR. Thus, only if any of
GDPR Article 6, Clause 1, Article 9, Clause 2 of the legal grounds and in compliance with GDPR
The principles of personal data processing defined in Article 5, Clause 1, personal data processing performed by the manager
is recognized as legal.

      In accordance with GDPR Article 24, Clause 1, the manager implements appropriate technical and organizational measures
measures to ensure and be able to demonstrably demonstrate that the processing takes place in accordance with the GDPR. Yes
if necessary, the mentioned measures are reviewed and updated. Paragraph 1 of Article 32 GDPR states that taking

taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, extent, context and purposes of the processing, how
also different possibilities and degrees of severity of risk in relation to the rights and freedoms of natural persons,
the manager and the processor implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure
a level of security appropriate to the risk, including continuity of processing systems and services
                                                     16
confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience. On the other hand, in accordance with GDPR Article 32, Clause 2,
assessing the appropriate level of security shall take into account in particular the risks posed by the processing, in particular accidental or
illegal destruction, loss of sent, stored or otherwise processed personal data,
modification, unauthorized disclosure or access to them.

      At the same time, the GDPR leaves the controller a free choice in the selection of the mentioned measures, subject to its actions
existing resources, technical capabilities, etc. criteria. Namely, the legislator has determined the goal, which would be
achievable, but the means by which to ensure the security of personal data processing and compliance with the GDPR

requirements, must be chosen by the manager himself.
      \[3.2\] DVI concludes that in the specific case the Service has chosen to select data in the E-health system
only according to one selection criterion, i.e. personal code. In addition, when selecting information only by personal code,
The service does not have the possibility to compare the personal data specified in the requests of the institutions (name, surname,

personal code) with the personal data in the E-health system, because according to the created E-health
for the specifics of the system, only the following information is available to the Service employee: personal code and
the ID number of the relevant documents, the type of document and the medical institution where the specific documents were received
services.

      DVI shares the opinion of the Service that the personal code is the most secure identifier that is unique

and assigned to one person only. However, both the specific case and the other case in the Service
the received information indicates that using only one selection criterion (personal code) does not
correct and safe processing of personal data in the E-health system is ensured. Therefore, the Service

the technical and organizational measures implemented may not be sufficient to ensure safe and
Processing of personal data in accordance with GDPR requirements.
      At the discretion of DVI, if the Service, implementing technical and organizational measures, E-health
would have introduced additional selection criteria into the system, for example by first name or last name or if, by entering
personal code, the Service employee would be able to see a larger amount of information (at least of the data subject
name and surname), then this type of violation would not have occurred. Namely, if the institution in its request
would have indicated an incorrect personal code belonging to another person or an incorrect first and last name,

then the Service, entering these data in the E-health system, would have the opportunity to compare them with the E-health system
to the existing personal data (name, surname, personal code) and react accordingly, not allowing others
processing (acquisition and disclosure) of a person's personal and health data. Taking into account that myself
the name and surname are already indicated in the requests, the Service employees already know this information and
no additional information will be disclosed.
      Taking into account the aforementioned, the set of information obtained within the scope of the inspection is sufficient and allows to conclude,

that, the Service, choosing to select data in the E-health system only according to one selection criterion (persons
code), has not evaluated all possible risks of personal data processing and has not successively implemented appropriate ones
technical and organizational measures, thus allowing illegal third party persons and
processing (acquisition and disclosure) of health data. Thus, the Service has violated Article 5 of GDPR

      At the same time, DVI takes into account the fact that in the specific case the Orphan's Court itself provided the Service
incorrect information, as well as the fact that the Service has not received the data until the day of preparation of the decision
complaints of subjects in connection with the provision of incorrect information to the authorities. Likewise, DVI takes into account its own

      \[4\] According to Article 58, Clause 2, Subsection d) of GDPR, each supervisory authority has powers
to issue an order to the manager or processor to align the processing activities with GDPR regulations,

if necessary - in a specific way and in a specific period of time. Article 23 of GDPR stipulates that DVI,
when making decisions regarding the imposition of a legal obligation, the Law on Administrative Procedure shall be applied.
      Taking into account the above and the fact that a violation of the provisions of the GDPR has been found in the Service's operation, DVI
in accordance with the first part of Article 66 of the Administrative Procedure Law, it is necessary to decide on the administrative
the utility of issuing the act.
      \[4.1\] Evaluating the necessity and necessity of the administrative act, DVI concludes that the decision

adoption is both necessary and necessary to achieve the goal of preventing the GDPR provision
violation. Namely, to prevent unlawful personal and health data in the future operation of the Service
processing (acquisition and disclosure) in the E-health system.
      \[4.2.\] The administrative act is a suitable means to achieve the goal, because it creates a legal
the duty of the Service to prevent the detected violations, as well as to prevent the occurrence of similar violations
in the future.
      \[4.3\] The administrative act is considered the most proportionate means to achieve the goal, because

compared to the decision on the imposition of an administrative penalty, it is considered more lenient. At the same time
the imposition of the legal obligation is aimed at the data subject in GDPR, FPDAL and other regulatory acts

      In compliance with the above, DVI, based on Article 3, paragraph 2, Article 5, paragraph 1 a), f) of GDPR
