## English Summary

### Facts

On 10 January 2024, the DPA issued a decision ordering the controller to edit or delete personal data (a picture portraying the data subject half naked) published on its website and issuing a reprimand for the breach of [Article 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), [5(1)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"), [12(1)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR") to [(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#4 "Article 12 GDPR").

On 19 February 2024, the DPA re-examined the website of the controller noting that the personal data was still available.

Therefore, on 22 February 2024, the DPA opened an administrative offence case for failure to ensure compliance with the previous decision of the DPA.

The controller argued that it had not edited or deleted the publications because it did not have access to the archive material of the previous owner of the website.

### Holding

The DPA dismissed the controller’s argument. It noted that, in accordance with [Article 24(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR#1 "Article 24 GDPR"), the controller should have implemented appropriate measures to ensure compliance with the GDPR and, pursuant to [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR"), the controller should be able to demonstrate this compliance.

Therefore, the controller should have implemented appropriate measures in order to be able to edit or delete the content published on its website. The DPA recalled that one of the main priorities of the controller should be the accessibility of the information to the controller itself.

As a consequence, the DPA found a violation of [Article 58(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2 "Article 58 GDPR") as the controller failed to comply with the orders given in a previous decision of the DPA.

On these grounds, the DPA issued a fine of €1,000.

 Explanations). In the explanations, SIA states that \[..\] is talking about the articles that were on the website
published on January 23, 2011 and February 1, 2012, but the website of SIA Tīmekļa in its
took over the management only in June 2012, and the previous owners did not have access to it
archive materials.

      In order to deal with the situation, in December 2023, SIA concluded an agreement with "\[..\]" SIA, with
which are undergoing technical changes that allow access to old archives of previous owners
materials. Currently, after 3 (three) months of work, it has been possible to access the archived materials, and
both links pointed to by \[..\] have been deleted.

      Considering that by investing significant financial resources, which significantly lowered the company
profitability, the situation that arose through no fault of the company has been eliminated, SIA asks for an opportunity

      The contract of January 5, 2024 mentioned in the Explanation is attached to the Explanations
No. \[..\] between SIA and "\[..\]" SIA Regarding the development of the portal platform.
                                                                                12

a request for recognition as a victim in the Case, indicating the further justification of the victim's status
for allocation.
      \[..\] believes that the violation of his subjective rights is a harm in itself. Namely,
In Article 8, paragraph 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, there is the right to data protection

formulated as individual subjective rights inherent to a person, that is, every person has
the right to the protection of your personal data. Article 1, paragraph 2 of the Data Regulation also states that
the regulation protects the fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, their rights to the person
data protection, that is, the right to personal data protection is mentioned as one of the person

fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms, thus the violation of a person's fundamental rights is harm.
A contrary understanding would undermine the idea of fundamental rights based on personal dignity.
      Similarly, the actions of SIA in a long period of time, contrary to \[..\]requests, to distribute pictures in which he is
seen almost naked, has caused difficulties \[...\] in professional and private life. So far there hasn't been
no workplace or other collective that has not seen him in underwear even before he has

had the opportunity to meet these persons in real life conditions. Earlier discussions on various
holding positions have stopped at the fact that such photos are still publicly available, in which \[...\]
can be easily identified.

interests that require protection and are more important than the public interest; 2)
data processing is carried out with the aim of publishing information affecting the public interest; 3) data regulations
compliance with the rules is incompatible with or prevents the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information.
In addition, the concept of "journalistic needs" should be interpreted as broadly as possible, including activities with objective 7
publish information, opinions or ideas through any means of dissemination.   21
      This means that even after establishing the conditions of the second part of Article 32 of the Data Law, which exempts

controller from complying with the requirements of the Data Regulation, the controller remains bound by Article 5 of the Data Regulation
the established basic principles of data processing, namely, must be ensured from Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Data Regulation
The requirement arising from subparagraph a) to make sure that everything has been observed in the processing of personal data
processing conditions and the principle of minimality resulting from subsection (c), and it is not allowed,
that the processing of personal data is carried out in an amount that is not appropriate for the purpose, i.e. according to the principle "the more,

the better”. Therefore, the processing of \[..\] personal data carried out by SIA on the website of SIA could be recognized
legal if it complies with the basic principles set out in Article 5 of the Data Regulation.
      The purpose of the Data Regulation is to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular
the right to the protection of personal data, however, it should be noted that the right to personal data

protections are not absolute and must also be balanced with other fundamental rights. Although in this decision
in the mentioned case, SIA has the right to take photographs and
filming activities, in order to inform the public about current events in the city and county, including
for cultural events held, SIA needs to evaluate whether the publication of such images
would not conflict with the data subject's interests that require protection and are

more important than public interest.
      When exercising the mentioned right to freedom of speech and information, one must not violate another person
In the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia, in international and legal acts of the Republic of Latvia
the strengthened fundamental rights of others to privacy and protection of personal data. In accordance with
The processing of personal data of data regulations should be designed in such a way that it serves a person. The right to a person

data protection is not an absolute prerogative; they must be considered in relation to their f22ction in society and
must be balanced with other fundamental rights in accordance with the principle of proportionality. It follows from the above that
the right to freedom of expression can be exercised in the same sense as any other right possessed by a person
human rights, i.e. the right to freedom of speech, are not and cannot be superior to, for example, individuals
                                        23
the right to personal data protection, and the principle of proportionality must be observed in their implementation, in each
making an assessment in the specific case.
      When evaluating the rights, it must be taken into account that the public has the right to be informed about
issues of public importance and the mass media have the right to disseminate them. Considering that between
these two rights also include the right of a private person to the inviolability of private life,

the controller must balance all the above-mentioned interests. Namely, or the data of natural persons
processing (interference in a person's private life) is proportionate to the contribution that
a journalist/mass media/writer/blogger has wanted to make a contribution to society as well as a contribution
society cannot realize the natural person in less offensive ways (for example, without processing
data of natural persons in general). Also, whether the question in question is to be assessed in conjunction

necessary in a socially significant discussion (whether it can make a significant contribution to society and
is legitimately necessary).
      In this sense, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe emphasizes that every person is important
the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression because it is democratic

the foundation of society. These rights are neither absolute nor enforceable in a hierarchical order, because they are
equally important. However, the Assembly points out that in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights
the established right to the inviolability of private life provides for the protection of private individuals not only
against public authorities, but also against private individuals or private sector institutions, including the media

22 Recital (4) of the Data Regulation.
23 See, for example, Article 8, paragraph 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union: "Everyone has the right to his
protection of personal data" and paragraph 2 of Article 8: "Such data must be processed in good faith, for specific purposes and with
the consent of the person concerned or with other legal grounds provided for by law. Everyone has approaches
the right to the data collected about him and the right to have this data rectified."                                                  8
funds, interference in their private life. 4
      Taking into account what was found in the Case and what is indicated in this decision, the Inspectorate does not find that SIA would implement

Data Regulation-compliant and proportionate \[...\] processing of personal data by making publicly available \[...\] faces
and body images on the SIA Tīmekļa website, where the said images \[..\] are seen without outerwear
(only in swimming trunks, underpants or shorts with partially naked body) more than 12 years after
events mentioned in the publications.
      SIA continuing to process the mentioned \[..\] personal data even after the \[..\] Request for personal data
after receiving data deletion, such circumstances are implemented, as a result of which \[...\] the right to privacy and

the protection of personal data is violated to a higher extent than the rights of SIA and the company and
freedom of information.
      Based on the above, the Inspectorate concludes that the Data Law is being implemented in the specific case
to the requirements of the first and second parts of Article 32 and Article 5, paragraph 1 a) and
processing of personal data not in accordance with point c) \[..\].

      5.8.2 Regarding the observance of the rights of \[..\] as a data subject.
      It follows from the case materials that \[...\] on May 6, 2022, contacted SIA by telephone with the desire
about the removal of content from SIA's website, as a result of which \[...\] was invited to apply in writing to
Ltd. with the exact address of the article and your wish. The inspection finds that \[...\] on May 6, 2022 applied
at the website of SIA Tīmekļa with a request by sending it in an electronic mail to SIA Tīmekļa

the website's electronic mail address \[..\]@novaja.lv, where the website was requested to remove the pictures,
containing \[..\] images, from Publications.
      The case materials contain information that \[..\] has not received information (answer) to his
Request, i.e. SIA since May 6, 2022 and still has not informed \[..\] about the operation,
which was made after the Request, and also did not inform about the deadline for providing information

reasons for extensions and/or non-performance.
      Also, it can be concluded from the Case materials that SIA did not respond to several Inspections
invitations to fulfill \[..\] the data subject's Request .5
      In view of the above, the Inspectorate concludes that SIA has not complied with the Data Regulations in its operations
The requirements set out in clauses 1 - 5 of Article 12, thereby violating the rights of the data subject in accordance with

Article 17 of the Data Regulation.
      5.8.3. Regarding the execution of the Inspection Decision.
      It follows from the case materials that the Decision was adopted on January 10, 2024. In the decision
in accordance with Article 58, Clause 2, c) and d) of the Data Regulation, an order was issued to SIA to

wishes were an obstacle to receiving the document at the specified address.
      The decision was communicated to SIA by sending it to SIA on January 11, 2024 by registered mail.
No. \[..\] to SIA's legal address: Kastaniu iela 2A – 15, Jelgava, LV – 3008, as well as additionally to SIA
The postal address indicated on the website: Skolotāju iela 3, Jelgava, LV – 3001. According to State shares

      In addition to the above, the Decision was sent electronically to those indicated on the website of SIA
communication channels: jkmediagroup.lv@gmail.com, redaktors@jelgavniekiem.lv, \[..\]@novaja.lv,
\[..\]@novaja.lv.
      Taking into account the above, it can be concluded that the information (answer) provided by the Inspection SIA regarding the Decision
                                                        26
execution should be received, at the latest, on February 14, 2024.
      After evaluating the circumstances in the Case and the evidence obtained in the Case, the Official concludes that
SIA has not complied with the provisions of the Decision that SIA: 1) must provide Data Regulation-compliant \[..\]
processing of personal data on the SIA Tīmekļa website, editing the publications or those mentioned in the Decision
deleted as a whole, 2) the requirements of Article 12, paragraphs 1 - 5 of the Data Regulation must be fulfilled, i.e. must fulfill \[...\]

Request and must inform \[..\] about the action taken after the Request or about the action
reasons for non-implementation, 3) as well as the fact that SIA had to submit to the Inspectorate by February 6, 2024
information on the execution of the Decision, therefore, has not been observed by the supervisory authorities (Inspections)
order in accordance with Article 58, paragraph 2 of the Data Regulation and has not provided access to information,
in violation of Article 58, paragraph 1 of the Data Regulation.

      5.8.4. SIA explains that it did not have access to the archive of the previous owners
materials in order to edit the Publications or delete them, the situation did not arise due to the fault of SIA.
      In accordance with Article 24, paragraph 1 of the Data Regulation, taking into account the nature and extent of processing,
context and intentions, as well as risks of varying likelihood and severity with respect to
rights and freedoms of natural persons, the manager implements appropriate technical and organizational

measures to ensure and be able to demonstrably demonstrate that processing takes place in accordance with this regulation.
If necessary, the mentioned measures are reviewed and updated. In addition, in accordance with the Data Regulation
According to Article 5, paragraph 2, the controller is responsible for compliance with data processing principles such as Data
the principle of data integrity referred to in Article 5, paragraph 1 of the regulation, therefore the controller (SIA) has
must be able to demonstrably demonstrate that it implements personal data processing in accordance with the Data Regulation.

      In the context of the above, the Official concludes that the statement of SIA that it was not available
archive files of the previous owners of the Website, and therefore the manager (SIA) did not
it is possible to make changes to the content of Publications (for example, to delete \[...\] those containing personal data
text and image items) are not considered as justifications according to the Data Regulation of the person
for restricting and editing data processing, because the manager (SIA) is responsible for SIA Tīmekļa

the processing of personal data carried out on the website and the personal data processing conditions are determined directly by SIA
to how the website functions, what is published on it, etc., therefore directly to SIA, according to the Data
Article 24, paragraph 2 of the Regulation and Article 5, paragraph 2 of the Data Regulation, using various technical and
organizational measures, it is necessary to be able to transparently make changes to the Website, so that
prevent personal data processing activities that do not comply with the Data Regulation. One of the main ones

the manager's priorities are the availability of information to the manager himself. Thus, even if the owner does not
it is possible to edit a specific item on the Website because it is not available in the website archive,
the manager (SIA) is required to delete the specific item on the Website if the manager does not
it is possible to delete a specific item of the Website, it must then delete the specific Website

or illegal processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage using appropriate technical
or organizational measures ("integrity and confidentiality") 10
a collection of site publications that would contain, among other things, items from the Website
(Publications) that process \[...\] personal data. Anyway, the manager has to do everything possible,
using various technical and organizational measures to ensure Data Regulation
appropriate processing of personal data, including by deleting or editing Publications.
      5.8.5. SIA explained in the Explanations that SIA concluded a contract with "Advailo" SIA, with which

technical changes are made that allow access to archived materials that after 3 (three) months
investment of work and significant financial resources, has managed to access the archived materials and
delete links to Publications. In compliance with the above, SIA asks to find the possibility of an administrative violation
close the case.
      The official concludes that in the Decision SIA a specific deadline was set for both the execution of the Decision,
both for providing information to the Inspectorate about the execution of the Decision, but SIA as specified in the Decision
has not turned to the Inspection within the deadline and procedure, nor with information about what was imposed in the Decision

the initiation of execution of the order, nor with a request to extend the deadline for execution of the Decision, moreover,
In the Inspection report of February 19, 2024, it was established that both Publications were available
On the website, but in the inspection protocol of March 20, 2024, it was not possible to check SIA
Content posted on the website because the website was down. In addition, from SIA Patzerjumoos
from the information provided, it does not follow that SIA fulfilled the Request and informed \[..\] about
the action performed following the Request or for the reasons for not performing the action.
      In view of the above, the Official concludes that there are no such circumstances that would serve as a basis

For termination of cases.
      5.9. Checking the materials of the Case, evaluating the circumstances of the Case and the evidence in the Case,
The official finds that SIA carried out \[..\] personal data processing on SIA's website in violation
The provisions of Article 5, paragraph 1, subparagraphs a) and c) of the Data Regulation, as well as contrary to the Data Regulation
Article 12, paragraphs 1 - 5, after \[..\] Request received until this decision
at the time of acceptance, did not inform \[..\] about the actions carried out at the request of the data subject

in accordance with Article 17 of the Data Regulation, and also failed to fulfill the tasks assigned in the Decision in accordance with the Data Regulation
Article 58, Paragraph 2 and has not provided access to information in violation of Article 58 of the Data Regulation
Paragraph 1, thus committing the administrative offense for which it is intended to be committed
administrative responsibility in Article 83 paragraph 5 a), b) and e) of the Data Regulation.
      5.10. The official finds that SIA is guilty of Article 83, Clause 5 a), b) and
in the commission of an administrative violation provided for in subsection e) is proven by the Report and so
attachments and other case materials.

      6. Institutions (Officials) that examined the administrative violation case,

administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, up to 4%

of its total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is the case
the amount is greater.
      Recital (148) of the preamble to the Data Regulation explains that in order to strengthen the Data Regulation
enforcement of the rules, in addition to appropriate measures applied by the supervisory authority in accordance with
The Data Regulation, or instead, for violations of the Data Regulation should be sanctioned, including
administrative fines. In the case of minor violations or if a fine, which could
would impose a disproportionate burden on a natural person, a reprimand may be issued instead of a fine. However

due consideration should be given to the nature, severity and duration of the violation, whether the violation was committed
intentional, actions taken to reduce the harm suffered, degree of responsibility or any respectively
previous violations, how the supervisory authority became aware of the violation, compliance
measures against the controller or processor, compliance with the code of conduct and any
other aggravating or mitigating circumstances. For imposing sanctions, including administrative fines 11
appropriate procedural guarantees should be applied in accordance with general Union rules
legal principles and the Charter, including effective judicial protection and due process.
      6.2. Pursuant to Article 83(1) of the Data Regulation, the supervisory authority has an obligation
ensure that for the violations of the Data Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 in accordance with Data
the application of the administrative fines provided for in the regulations is effective in each specific case,

proportionate and dissuasive.
      In accordance with Article 83, paragraph 2 of the Data Regulation, when deciding whether to apply the administrative
fine, and when making a decision on the amount of the administrative fine, in each case
case, the following elements are duly taken into account: a) the nature, severity and duration of the violation, taking
taking into account the relevant type, extent or purpose of data processing, as well as the number of affected data subjects and
the extent of the damage caused to them; b) whether the violation was committed intentionally or due to negligence;
c) any action by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage caused to the data subjects;

d) the level of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account technical and organizational aspects
the measures they implement in accordance with Articles 25 and 32; e) any relevant manager or
previous violations of the processor; (f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to compensate
violation and mitigate its possible adverse consequences; g) the categories of personal data
affected by the breach; h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the violation, in particular,
whether the controller or processor has reported a breach, and in such case – to what extent; (i) if
The measures mentioned in Clause 2 of Article 58 have already been directed against the same subject

the relevant manager or processor, how the mentioned measures have been fulfilled; j) approved actions
compliance with codes in accordance with Article 40 or compliance with approved certification mechanisms
in accordance with Article 42; and (k) any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance that may apply
the circumstances of the case, for example the financial benefits directly or indirectly derived from the violation or avoided
losses.
      Article 13 of the AAL states that an administrative penalty is a means of influence that is

applied to the person who committed the administrative offense in order to protect public order,
justice would be restored, the offense would be punished, as well as the administrative offense would be deterred
the perpetrator and other persons from committing further administrative violations.
      According to Article 14 of the AAL, the following penalties can be applied for an administrative violation:
warnings, fines, deprivation of rights and prohibition of exercising rights.
      The second part of Article 19 of the AAL stipulates that the type and measure of the administrative penalty must be taken into account
the nature of the offense committed, the identity of the person to be held responsible (for a legal entity –

reputation), property status, circumstances of committing the offense, mitigating factors and
aggravating circumstances.
      In accordance with Article 23 of the Data Law, the Inspectorate, adopting the provisions of Article 58 of the Data Law
decisions, regarding the imposition of a legal obligation, the Law on Administrative Procedure is applied and
with regard to administrative punishments – the record keeping (process) of administrative violations
regulatory acts, as far as the Data Law and the Data Regulation do not stipulate otherwise. Data regulations
the conditions regarding the application of the administrative fine and its amount differ from the AAL

to the included provisions, i.e. the Data Regulation determines otherwise in the relevant matter, therefore
When determining the amount of the fine, the official shall apply the provisions contained in the Data Regulation, and
accordingly, the penalty is applied according to the provisions of the Data Regulation.
      6.3. When determining the penalty, the Official takes into account the nature, severity and duration of the violation, taking
taking into account the relevant type, extent or purpose of data processing, as well as the number of affected data subjects -
in the specific case, several types of processing specified in Article 5, Clause 1 of the Data Regulation can be found
violations of basic principles and data subject rights in accordance with Articles 12-22 of the Data Regulation, as well as

SIA has not ensured the execution of the order contained in the Decision, which SIA had to execute according to the Data
Article 58, paragraph 2, letter d) of the regulation, and did not provide information on the execution of the Decision,
thus in violation of Article 58(1)(e) of the Data Regulation, which corresponds to three of the Data Regulation
for administrative violations provided for in paragraph 5 of Article 83, which in essence continued and
were not reduced in more than a year and a half since \[..\] had sent SIA its Request, as 12
were also not completely eliminated within the scope of the Case. The official takes into account that in the committed
only one natural person is affected in the violation -\[..\]; whether the violation was committed intentionally or

due to carelessness - there is a sufficient basis to conclude that the violation was committed intentionally, because SIA is
aware of her actions, incl. inaction, unlawful nature, foresees its harmful consequences
and knowingly allowed these consequences to occur; any action by the controller or processor to mitigate
damage caused to data subjects – In the case, it has been established that the victim – \[..\], SIA's actions
resulted in non-material damage that was not prevented, mitigated or compensated; that
which category of personal data was affected by the violation - special categories of persons were not affected

data; manager's previous violations - SIA has not previously been administratively punished for this decision
committing the considered violation; the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority - even if it is an SIA
cooperated with the Inspectorate, provided explanations in the Case, there were no violations until the Case was considered
prevented; the way in which the Inspection found out about the violation - upon receiving a Complaint from the victim \[..\];
any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to the circumstances of the case - SIA

The Official did not find extenuating circumstances, but an aggravating circumstance
The Official acknowledges that the unlawful conduct continues despite the Official's demand
end it.
      In determining the amount of the fine, information from the Enterprise Register database was used, where 28
available information as of the date of this decision shows that the last one submitted by SIA

information on financial indicators, including annual turnover and profit of SIA, is indicated
in the 2022 report.
      Considering that in the sense of the Data Regulation, the provisions of Article 83, Clause 5 of the Data Regulation
violations are considered material violations, as well as the circumstances found in the Case and
The conclusions drawn by the official, the official using the ones developed by the Inspectorate

Administra29vo the mechanism for determining the amount of fines for companies and individuals
persons, recognizes the violation committed by SIA as moderately serious, in accordance with Article 83 of the Data Regulation
The administrative fine provided for in the framework of the sanction of sub-paragraphs a), b) and e) of paragraph 5 is EUR
in the amount of 332.01 (three hundred and thirty-two euros and one cent).
      6.4. At the same time, the Official assesses whether any additional charges are applicable to the particular Case

conditions or criteria not reflected in this tool. Also, the Official can take into account 30
Guidelines on the application of administrative penalties developed by the European Data Protection Board
(hereinafter – Guidelines for the Application of Administrative Penalties). The said guidelines stipulate that
determining the amount of the final penalty, incl. it should be taken into account whether several can be identified within one case
simultaneous violations. In cases where the violator is found to have violated several

legal provisions, separate fines may be applied.
      The official concludes that in the specific case SIA has made several Data Regulations
violations and is responsible for the violation provided for in Article 83, paragraph 5, letter a), b) and e) of the Data Regulation
in committing an administrative offense, and this aspect must be taken into account to determine a higher end
punishment.

      According to Article 83, paragraph 2, letter b) of the Data Regulation, it is necessary to take into account whether
the violation was committed intentionally or due to negligence. Although SIA has not previously been administratively fined,
The official, taking into account the evidence obtained in the Case, concludes that the administrative violation is
done on purpose. Namely, SIA deliberately did not react for almost two years and still does not react
neither to \[..\], as a data subject, the request for data deletion mentioned in the Request, nor to the Inspection

for several letters sent as part of the Inspection case, in which SIA was invited to comply
Inspections did not comply with the request and to stop illegal \[..\] data processing, even more so
Determined in the decision.

      At the same time, in accordance with the guidelines for the application of administrative penalties after the sentence
mathematical calculation, it is possible to adjust the penalty by evaluating whether it reaches the Data in the regulation
the set goals of punishment - is effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The amount of the penalty must be determined
according to the context of the offense. Regarding the effectiveness of the penalty, it must be assessed whether it is

suitable to ensure the compliance of personal data processing with the Data Regulation and to punish the controller.
The principle of proportionality dictates that the appropriate penalty should not exceed what it is
necessary to achieve the goal. When assessing proportionality, the infringement must be viewed as a single offence
whole, focusing on the gravity of the offense as such. The officer concludes that
although the penalty is appropriate to punish the controller, it is not adequate to promote compliance with the Data
regulation, therefore, the fine needs to be adjusted.

      In the specific case, the Official takes into account the fact that SIA has done several things, i.e. 3 (three)
Violation of Article 83, Clause 5 of the Data Regulation. Also, the Official takes into account the fact that
the violation is committed intentionally and not due to negligence, as well as the fact that the illegal behavior is
continued, despite the demands of the Inspectorate to terminate it.
      6.5. In view of the above, the Official considers that the fine adjustment by applying the money
a fine of EUR 1000.00 (one thousand euro 00 cents) would be adequate to deter SIA from

for further violations of personal data processing.
      Taking into account the above, based on Article 5, Part One, Clause 2 of the Data Law,
Article 23, Article 58(2)(i) of the Data Regulation, Article 14(1) of the AAL
Paragraph 2, Paragraph 4 of the second part of Article 41, Paragraph 4 of the first paragraph of Article 115, Paragraph 1 of Article 151

                                           decides:

recognize the Limited Liability Company "JK Media group" as guilty of Article 83 of the Data Regulation
in committing the administrative offense provided for in sub-paragraphs a), b) and e) of paragraph 5 and punish with
a fine of EUR 1000.00 (one thousand euros).

      In accordance with Article 156 of the AAL, we inform and invite within a reasonable period of time - until 2024
