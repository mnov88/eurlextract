## English Summary

### Facts

The Latvian DPA, in cooperation with the Estonian and the Lithuanian one, started a joint investigation about the processing of personal data in the context of car rental services. In particular, there were doubts about the lawfulness of processing activities undertaken by a company – the controller – in the context of a mobile app necessary to use the car rental services. Therefore, the DPA carried out data protection audits and requested access to personal data and other information necessary to the fulfilment of its tasks pursuant to [Article 58(1)(b) and (e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR"). The controller was “unreachable” and did not comply with the DPA’s instructions. The DPA formally opened a sanctioning procedure against the controller.

### Holding

The DPA noted that, as all the notification formalities were respected, the fact that the controller was “unreachable” did not exclude its liability pursuant to [Article 83(5)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#5e "Article 83 GDPR") and Latvian administrative law. Also, the controller did not provide any explanation why it failed to comply with the DPA’s order.

The DPA held that the adoption of a fine was the only way to force the controller to comply with the GDPR. In the quantification of such a fine pursuant to [Article 83(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2 "Article 83 GDPR"), the DPA particularly stressed as an aggravating factor the complete lack of cooperation on the side of the controller. Moreover, the DPA referred to [its own guidelines](https://www.dvi.gov.lv/lv/media/289/download) on fine determination under the GDPR to qualify the infringement as ‘moderately serious’.

In principle, the DPA held that a €15,000 fine was appropriate. However, in light of the economic difficulties affecting the controller and considering the risk of insolvency high, the DPA decided that a €1,000 was more proportionate in the case at issue.

to the person who committed the administrative violation in order to protect public order, restore
justice, punished for the offense committed, as well as deterring the perpetrator of the administrative offense

person and other persons from committing further administrative violations.
      According to the second part of Article 19 of the AAL, when determining the type and measure of the administrative penalty, it is taken into account
the nature of the offense committed, the identity of the person to be held responsible (for a legal entity -
reputation), financial position, circumstances of the violation, extenuating circumstances and
      According to Article 23 of the FPDAL, DVI, when adopting the decisions set out in Article 58 of the GDPR, regarding

the imposition of a legal obligation is applied by the Law on Administrative Procedure and in relation to
for administrative punishments - in the regulations regulating the administration (process) of administrative violations
acts, insofar as this law and GDPR do not stipulate otherwise. GDPR provisions in the matter of administrative
the application of the fine and its amount differ from the provisions contained in the AAL, i.e. GDPR
determines otherwise in the relevant matter, therefore the Official, when determining the amount of the fine, applies
the provisions contained in the GDPR, and accordingly the penalty will be applied according to the provisions of the GDPR.

      6.4. When determining the penalty, the Official takes into account the nature, duration and degree of cooperation with the violations
supervisory authority (DVI). In the specific case, SIA has not provided the necessary information to the IRS
for the performance of its tasks, in violation of Article 58, Clause 1, subparagraph e) of GDPR, i.e. - violation addressed
against the established administrative order. Violation committed by SIA, i.e. non-disclosure is long-standing
and has not been stopped, despite repeated appeals by DVI, the violation continues since 2022

August 27. The violation was committed with intent (intentionally), because Request No. 2 was actually received, therefore
it can be concluded that SIA was aware of the action and its consequences. The official finds that there is no cooperation with DVI
happened because, by the time the case was considered, DVI had not obtained what was necessary for the inspection
information. SIA has not previously been administratively punished for committing the violation considered in this decision.
      The Official has not found extenuating circumstances. For an aggravating circumstance

The official admits that SIA continued its illegal actions even after DVI Request No. 2
of receipt and did not provide the information requested by DVI, did not inform about non-provision of information
reasons and also does not provide it still.
      Official according to the guidelines developed by DVI on the amount of administrative fine
determination recognizes the violation committed by SIA as moderately serious.
      When determining the amount of the fine, information from the Enterprise Register database is used, where available

the information as of the day of this decision shows that the last financial information submitted by SIA
indicators, including the annual turnover and profit of SIA, are indicated in the 2021 annual report.
      Based on the mentioned sentencing criteria and taking into account the findings in the case
actual circumstances, SIA must be determined within the scope of the sanction of Article 83, Clause 5 of GDPR
administrative fine EUR 14,787.78 (fourteen thousand seven hundred and eighty seven

EUR and seventy-eight cents EUR).
      At the same time, the supervisory authority is obliged to take all cases into account when determining the applicable penalty
and the circumstances of the particular case under consideration, which are relevant to the case, even if they are not directly listed in the GDPR
Article 83, Clause 2, so that as a result, the goal of punishment is achieved in accordance with this decision above
to the mentioned Article 13 of the AAL.

      Considering the fact that the manager's main activity is not related to the processing of personal data (the manager offers
short-term rental of scooters and vehicles), as well as the fact that despite the 2021 net
turnover of EUR 899,590, the manager has not a profit in 2021, but a loss of EUR 246,372,

therefore, there is an increased risk that the company may become insolvent in the event of payment of the fine,
The official concludes that the determined fine of EUR 14,787.78 would not be proportionate
for the offense committed. At the same time, taking into account that the illegal behavior is continued, the Official
considers it possible to achieve the goal of administrative punishment so that it is effective and proportionate at the same time
and dissuasive as well as restorative and proportionate in reducing administrative fines
up to 1,000 (one thousand euros) approximately.

      6.5. Taking into account the above, based on FPDAL Article 5, Part One, Clause 2,
Article 23, GDPR Article 58, Clause 2, subparagraph i), AAL, Article 115, Part One, Clause 4, Article 151
Paragraph 1 of the first part, the second and third parts of Article 157, the first part of Article 166, Article 168, Article 262,

Article 269, Official:
