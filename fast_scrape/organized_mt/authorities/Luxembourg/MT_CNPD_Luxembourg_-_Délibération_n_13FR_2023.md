## English Summary

### Facts

Following a visit to the premises of two public bodies (the joint controllers), the agents of the Luxembourgish DPA found that the controllers applied a geo-localisation system on the companies' service vehicles and construction machines. Even though the system was not connected to the drivers, through the timesheets, which indicated which driver used which vehicle or machine, it was easy to find out which employee used which vehicle on which day.

On 13 December 2022, at the end of the investigation, a statement of objection was published by the rapporteur detailing breaches of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"), [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 5(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1b "Article 5 GDPR"). Following this, the joint controllers submitted observations, and on 13 June 2023, the rapporteur and the joint controllers presented oral observations to the DPA.

### Holding

Regarding the obligation to provide information, pursuant to [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"), the DPA considered that for data processing by an employer to be considered lawful, the data subjects must be informed of the monitoring, in accordance with [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") and [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

The joint controller had provided the employees information notes and e-mails in French and German in the vehicles and machines and on the Intranet. However, the DPA found that there had been non-compliance with [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") as the joint controllers did not provide all compulsory information. Namely the identity of the controllers and the DPO, the legal basis, the legitimate interests followed, the appropriate safeguards applied, and the rights of the data subjects to receive a copy and to submit a complaint to the supervisory authority. The information notes also contained the Privacy Shield as the legal basis for the transfer of personal data to the US - even though it was invalidated by the Court of Justice. Moreover, the content of the French and German versions was not identical.

Secondly, in relation to [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"), the DPA found that the joint controllers did not comply with the principle of data minimisation. The geolocation system was installed to track staff working in dangerous conditions or alone, to prevent the theft of vehicles and machines and to verify employees' working time. However, the system was used both during and outside working hours and did not have a deactivation button.

In addition, it found that the controllers did not comply with the principle of purpose limitations under [Article 5(1)(b) GDPR.](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") The joint controllers' reasoning that the materials transported by the machines and vehicles, dirt and rocks, were of a special nature could not justify the use of geolocation.

The DPA issued a fine of €2,500. It took into account the gravity of the violation, its duration (as the tracking system was deactivated during the proceedings) and the number of data subjects concerned (one-third of the employees). It also considered that the violation was not intentional, that interim measures had been taken and that the joint controllers did not financially benefit from the violation.

## Comment

Interestingly, there apparently was a transfer of personal data to the US, and this information was taken into account in determining the missing information given to the data subjects. However, no reference was made to the legal basis of transfers before the Transatlantic Data Privacy Framework entered into force.

Moreover, it was established that the purpose of securing and monitoring the materials transported for data processing was not legitimate, breaching the principle of purpose limitation. The authority requested for this purpose to be removed from the information notice to the data subjects. However, it can also be noted how no safeguards were ordered to prevent the geo-localisation data from being used for this illegitimate purpose.

    indicating which vehicle was used on which day by each employee. 5

        8. Those inspected produced written observations on the report relating to

the on-site visit by email of June 9, 2021.

        9. Subsequently, those inspected and the CNPD investigation service carried out

an exchange of letters. 6

        10. At the end of his investigation, the head of investigation notified those inspected on

a new statement of objections amending the initial statement of objections (hereinafter

after: the “statement of objections”).

The head of investigation maintained the failings that he considered to exist in this case, as well as

than the corrective measures he proposed.

However, on the basis of the information transmitted under the terms of the mail of those inspected in
date of February 2, 2023, it considered that the shortcomings identified in the communication

initial grievances had not been committed intentionally, but were part of a

gross negligence. Therefore, it reduced the amount of the administrative fine
offered at \[…\] euros.

The ability to formulate their written observations on the statement of objections was

offered to those inspected. The latter did not communicate observations to the chief

investigation.

        13. The president of the Restricted Training informed the controlled by mail
dated April 18, 2023 that their case would be listed at the Training session

Restricted from June 13, 2023 and that they were offered the opportunity to be heard there. By email

of June 6, 2023, those inspected confirmed their presence at the said session.

During this session the head of investigation \[…\], and those inspected, represented by \[…\],

questions asked by the Restricted Training. The Restricted Training gave the

controlled the possibility of sending additional information until June 28, 2023

requested during said session. Those controlled had the last word.

        14. By emails of June 21 and 29, 2023, those inspected provided the information

II. Place

II. 1. On the reasons for the decision

A. On the determination of the controller

1. On the principles

       16. Under the terms of article 4.7 of the GDPR, the data controller is “the

natural or legal person, public authority, service or other body which,
alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing”.

Under the terms of article 26.1 of the GDPR “\[w\]hen two or more data controllers

jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they are the

joint controllers”.

       17. The concept of joint controllers was explained by the Committee
European Data Protection Authority (hereinafter: the “EDPS”) in the “Guidelines

guidelines 07/2020 concerning the notions of data controller and subcontractor

in the GDPR”, version 2.0, adopted on July 7, 2021 (hereinafter: the “Guidelines

07/2020").

                                                                                                     6/38 Under these guidelines “\[t\]he joint responsibility for processing should

be assessed on the basis of a factual rather than formal analysis of the real influence

exercised on the purposes and means of processing. 7

“Joint participation in determining ends and means implies that

more than one entity has a determining influence on whether and how

treatment takes place.” In practice, joint participation can take several forms.

forms, such as a joint decision taken by two or more entities or decisions

convergent principles adopted by two or more entities regarding ends and means

essential to treatment. Joint participation resulting from a common decision

means that the parties decide together and assumes a common intention. Of the

decisions can be considered convergent as long as they complement each other

and are necessary for carrying out the processing so that they have a concrete effect on

the determination of the purposes and means of the processing (“\[…\] the processing by each
                                                                                         9
of the parts is inseparable from that of the other, that is to say inextricably linked. ").

2. In the present case

        18. The CNPD in “Deliberation No. \[…\] of \[…\] December 2020 of the

National Commission for Data Protection relating to the request for opinion

introduced on the basis of article L.261-1 paragraph (4) of the Labor Code by the delegation
                                                                       10
of the staff of Public Body A and Public Body B” (hereinafter: the “notice of

the CNPD) had held that “Public Body A and Public Body B must be
considered as joint controllers of the processing, within the meaning of Articles 4 point (7)

and 26 \[…\] \[of the GDPR\], insofar as they seem to jointly determine the purposes

and means of the treatment in question. 11

        19. In the statement of objections, the head of investigation considered that those inspected

were to be considered joint controllers within the meaning of the GDPR for

processing implemented by a geolocation system. 12

        20. In fact, those inspected had themselves declared that they considered themselves

joint controllers concerning the processing carried out within the framework of the system of

had specified in particular that \[…\].

       28. In view of these circumstances, the Restricted Panel considers that the controlled

had jointly determined for what purposes and how the geolocation data

were treated.

       29. She therefore agrees with the opinion of the head of investigation and concludes that those controlled were

to qualify as joint controllers for the processing covered by the

this decision.

B. On the failure linked to the obligation to inform the persons concerned

1. On the principles

       30. Under the terms of article 12.1 of the GDPR, the “data controller takes

appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as

that to carry out any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 in
regarding the processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent manner,

understandable, easily accessible, in clear and simple terms \[…\]. Information

are provided in writing or by other means including, where appropriate, by

electronic. When the data subject requests it, the information may
be provided orally, provided that the identity of the person concerned is demonstrated

by other means. »

       31. Article 13 of the GDPR provides as follows:

“1. When personal data relating to a data subject are
collected from this person, the data controller provides them, at the time

where the data in question is obtained, all of the following information:

a) the identity and contact details of the data controller and, where applicable, the

representative of the data controller;

e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data,

if they exist; And

f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to carry out a transfer

of personal data to a third country or to an international organization,

and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision issued by the Commission or, in

the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or in Article 49(1), second
paragraph, the reference to appropriate or adapted guarantees and the means of obtaining one

copy or the place where they were made available;

2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide

the data subject, at the time the personal data is obtained,
the following additional information which is necessary to ensure

fair and transparent treatment:

a) the duration of retention of personal data or, where this is not

possible, the criteria used to determine this duration;

b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to the data to be
personal nature, the rectification or erasure thereof, or a limitation of the

processing relating to the data subject, or the right to object to the processing and

right to data portability;

(c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or Article 9,
paragraph 2(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time,

without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent carried out before the

withdrawal thereof;

d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

(e) information on whether the requirement to provide data to

personal character has a regulatory or contractual character or if it conditions the

conclusion of a contract and whether the data subject is obliged to provide the data to

Article 22, paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, useful information

regarding the underlying logic, as well as the importance and intended consequences
of this processing for the data subject.

3. When he intends to carry out further processing of personal data

personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data

have been collected, the data controller first provides the person with

concerned information about this other purpose and any other information

relevant referred to in paragraph 2.

4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not apply when and to the extent that the person
concerned already has this information. »

       32. Communication to the persons concerned of information relating to the

processing of their data is an essential element in respecting the

general transparency obligations within the meaning of the GDPR. Said obligations were

explained by the Article 29 Working Group in its guidelines on the

transparency within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the revised version of which has been adopted

on April 11, 2018 (hereinafter: “WP 260 rev.01”).

       33. Note that the EDPS took up and reapproved the documents adopted by the said
Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25, 2018, as specifically the guidelines

mentioned above on transparency.

2. In the present case

       34. With regard to the information obligation, the CNPD, in its observations

formulated at the end of its opinion delivered at the request of the staff delegation of

Public Body A and Public Body B, had considered that one of the conditions of

lawfulness of the “processing envisaged by the employer” was that “the persons concerned

        35. During the on-site visit of May 26, 2021, those inspected declared to the

CNPD agents that

- the staff delegations of those inspected had been informed in advance of the

    implementation of the geolocation system; and 16

- the employees concerned had been informed of the processing implemented by the

    geolocation system using displays in service vehicles and

    construction machinery, by an information note (also included in the intranet), as well as

    as a memo and during a meeting. 17

Those controlled had given the CNPD agents a copy of the memo dated
                    18 19
of February 17, 2021, as well as an information notice relating to geolocation.

        36. Subsequently, those inspected sent several documents to the CNPD

of information :

        37. By email of June 2, 2021, those inspected had transmitted to the CNPD “\[…\]

        39. By email of March 24, 2022, those inspected sent the CNPD a

copy of the renewed memo dated January 11, 2022. They also had

confirmed that with regard to the four copies of the information notice, previously

transmitted to the CNPD, namely a copy given during the on-site visit on May 26, 2021,

two copies attached to their email of June 2, 2021 and one copy attached to their email

of October 15, 2021, it “is the same information note, just in German and French,

                                                                                                            13/38 43. The Restricted Training would first like to point out that article 13 of the GDPR

refers to the obligation imposed on the controller to “provide” all information

information mentioned there. The word “provide” is crucial here and it “means
that the controller must take concrete measures to provide the

information in question to the data subject or to actively direct the person

concerned to the location of said information (for example by means of a link
                             34
direct, a QR code, etc.) » .

       44. She further considers that a multi-level approach to communicating

transparency information to data subjects may be used in a
offline or non-digital context, i.e. in a real environment such as

example of personal data collected by means of a system of

geolocation. The first level of information (warning sign, note

information, etc.) should generally include the most

essential, namely the details of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the person responsible for the
processing and the existence of the rights of the data subjects, as well as the information

having the greatest impact on the treatment or any treatment likely to surprise

the people concerned. The second level of information, that is to say all of the

information required under Article 13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available

provision by other means, such as a copy of the policy
confidentiality sent by e-mail to employees.35

       45. Regarding the first level of information, Restricted Training

notes that on the sticker which was affixed to service vehicles and machinery

site of the inspected, a photo of which was annexed to the email of the inspected

June 2, 2021, the words “GPS überwacht mit \[…\]” and “Monitored by GPS with

\[…\]”, a reference to “\[…\].com”, as well as the “\[…\]” and “Made in
Luxembourg”. However, she noted that this sticker did not contain the information

required within the meaning of Article 13 of the GDPR and not even the elements required by the first

level of information. In particular, details of the purpose of the processing were missing,

the identity of the joint controllers and the existence of the rights of the individuals

concerned.

              investigation no. \[…\] carried out with Public Body A and Public Body B 14/38 46. The Restricted Panel also notes the copy of the “Memorandum

concerning the use of GPS installed in machines and vehicles \[…\] \[of those controlled\]”

dated February 17, 2021 which had been given to CNPD agents during the visit to

place of May 26, 2021 .36

The said note specified certain practical aspects of the use of the system of

geolocation such as the person responsible for the system, retention periods

geolocation data and access to the system.

The Restricted Panel notes, however, that this note did not contain the

elements required by the first level of information. In particular, details were missing.
of the purpose of the processing, the identity of the joint controllers of the processing and the existence

rights of the persons concerned.

Furthermore, the documentation submitted to the Restricted Training does not contain any evidence

that the information note had actually been transmitted individually to the

employees of those inspected before the on-site visit by CNPD agents.

       47. Regarding the second level of information, Restricted Training

take note

- of the three information notices which had been communicated to the CNPD within the framework

    of the request for an opinion submitted on the basis of article L.261-1.4 of the Labor Code.7

    Two of these documents were in French, dated June 9, 2020 and entitled

    “Information notice concerning the implementation of vehicle geolocation

    professionals”. Public Body A or Public Body B were identified

    as data controllers.

                            39
    The third document was in German, dated June 2, 2020 and titled

    dated and identified Public Body B as the controller;

- the two information notices that those inspected had attached to their email of

    June 2, 2021.

    A document was in French and entitled “Notice of information concerning the
                                                                          41

    certain other legal information to prepare an “information note \[…\] to

    The other two documents were in German and titled “Informationsblatt

    Public Body B or Public Body A were identified as responsible

    of treatment.

The Restricted Panel considers that, with the exception of divergent information on the
controller and the legal basis for the processing in the different versions

linguistic, the content of the aforementioned information notices was almost

identical.

                                                                     45
        48. She also observes that the email of June 9, 2020 that those inspected
inserted below their email of June 21, 2023 and the four information notices there

annexed, had been sent to their employees individually, namely to their addresses

professional emails.

        49. However, it notes that the aforementioned information notices do not

did not contain all of the information provided for in Article 13 of the GDPR.

Thus, they did not mention the joint controllers (article 13.1.a)

of the GDPR), the data protection officer of the controlled (article 13.1.b) of the GDPR),

information relating to the relevant legal basis under Article 6 of the GDPR

(article 13.1.c) of the GDPR), the legitimate interests pursued by the joint controllers
processing (article 13.1.d) of the GDPR), details of transfers to third countries and more

precisely relevant information on the existence or absence of a decision

of adequacy, the appropriate or adapted guarantees and the means of obtaining a copy

or the place where they were made available (article 13.1.f) of the GDPR) and the information

regarding the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority (article 13.2.d)
of the GDPR), in this case the CNPD.

        50. It also notes that the information notices combined with

display in service vehicles and construction machinery and/or service note

did not contain all the information required by Article 13 of the GDPR either.

employees during a meeting.

The Restricted Panel notes that it does not result from the reports relating to the meetings between

\[…\] \[the staff delegation and management\], copies of which were attached to the email

of the inspections of June 2, 2021, that the representatives of the staff delegations had
been informed of all the information required by Article 13 of the GDPR. She considers

moreover that information from the staff delegation could at most be

qualified as collective information, and not as individual information of

employees.

Therefore, the Restricted Panel notes that the documentation submitted by those inspected

does not contain any proof attesting that the employees of those inspected had been validly

informed, before the on-site visit of CNPD agents, orally in accordance with

Article 13 of the GDPR.

        52. In view of the above, the Restricted Panel agrees with the opinion of the chief
investigation and concludes that non-compliance with Article 13 of the GDPR was acquired on the day of

the on-site visit of CNPD agents.

D. On the breach linked to the principle of data minimization

1. On the principles

        62. In accordance with article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, personal data

must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary with regard to the
purposes for which they are processed (data minimization)”.

        63. Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR also provides that personal data

personal data must be “collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes,

                                                                                                     18/38and not be subsequently processed in a manner incompatible with these purposes; \[…\]

(limitation of purposes)”.

2. In the present case

        64. Regarding the principle of minimization, the CNPD, in its observations

formulated at the end of its opinion, had considered that one of the conditions of lawfulness of “processing
envisaged by the employer” was that “the geolocation of construction equipment cannot

be activated only outside working hours, except for employees working alone and

performing dangerous tasks in remote areas, in which case activation of

geolocation must be done by employees” .6

        65. During the on-site visit, those inspected declared to CNPD agents

that

- the geolocation system installed in service vehicles or equipment

    sites inspected were not provided with a deactivation button; 47

- service vehicles and construction equipment could not be used for purposes

    private ;8

- those inspected feared that in the case of installing a deactivation button,

    the geolocation system is not reactivated in the evening, due to forgetting, so that the

    machines are not protected against theft; 49

- the geolocation system was used for several purposes, namely security and

    health of employees, monitoring and verification of employees' working time, issuing

    invoices, optimization of the work process and the safety of service vehicles

    and construction machinery;50

        66. The head of investigation noted in the statement of objections that the system
geolocation system was “in particular installed on construction equipment” and that it was not

not equipped with a deactivation button. 53

        67. He also recalled that “concerning construction equipment, the Opinion of the

CNPD establishes that “with regard to the monitoring of construction machinery \[…\] \[of

controlled\], the National Commission is of the opinion that geolocating these during the hours

of work would amount to monitoring the employees of data controllers in a manner
quasi-permanent. Indeed, as indicated by \[…\] \[the controlled\] in \[…\] \[their\] mail

of October 2, 2020, the personnel \[…\] \[of those controlled\] often work alone or in very

small teams. It is therefore easy to link a particular machine to its user. \[...\] There

National Commission nevertheless understands the need for \[…\] \[those controlled\] to be able

protect your construction equipment against theft and also be able to track the time of

work of employees. In this regard, the National Commission is of the opinion that geolocation
construction machinery activated only outside working hours, and deactivated

by employees when they start using a particular machine, would make it possible to achieve

these two purposes, while being less detrimental to the private lives of employees \[…\] \[of

controlled\]. In addition, the National Commission recognizes that geolocation of machines

construction site during working hours could be useful, or even necessary, to ensure

the safety of employees who carry out dangerous tasks alone (for example, \[…\])
in remote places. \[...\] Consequently, with regard to the sometimes dangerous activities

carried out by employees \[…\] \[of the controlled\], in spaces \[…\] which can be very

\[was\] likely to influence the argument developed in the CNPD Opinion” and

that no element of the documentation submitted to the CNPD contained evidence

opposites. It therefore found that non-compliance with article 5.1.c) of the GDPR was
acquired on the day of the on-site visit.

        69. Those controlled by email of June 2, 2021 had specified that in the past

vehicles had been moved to a construction site, but had not been stolen and that this

incident had not been reported to the police.

        70. Subsequently, those inspected explained in their letter of February 2, 2023

that the geolocation system had been installed to comply with a request from the

staff who had justified the request “in the interests of personal security. »

They had explained in particular that “the workers \[…\] working partly alone

outside and potentially far from homes, \[…\] with equipment more or less

heavy. Faced with the ever-present risk of accident, employees wanted insurance
that their exact position is known in order to avoid unnecessary waste of time in case

a rescue intervention should prove necessary” and that “\[t\]herefore, a

system allowing the worker to turn it off or on according to his needs, such as

proposed by the CDG, would always carry the risk of forgetting to put it into service at

when he needed it. Such a module would clearly defeat the purpose

sought by employees and would reduce the interest of such a system. »

In addition, they explained that although an opinion had been requested from the CNPD by the

staff delegation, the employees concerned would at no time have felt
personally bothered by geolocation and any invasion of their privacy would be

remained “purely theoretical”.

In order to confirm the above, those inspected had annexed to their aforementioned letter
                                                                57
two testimonial certificates from employees of those inspected, as well as \[…\] \[that several

reports of the meetings of their governing bodies\]. The Restricted Panel notes that these
documents mentioned employee safety as one of the purposes of implementing

location of the geolocation system.

        71. During the Restricted Training session, the controls reiterated these

remarks and they also confirmed that contrary to what was indicated in the
                      58
information notices, service vehicles and construction equipment were reserved for

strictly professional use. They also explained that tracking time
work was currently carried out by clocking in the technical room \[…\] for the workers

and that the use of the geolocation system was an alternative means that could be

employed in order to allow workers to go directly (by their private means)

on construction sites and to those inspected to verify at the same time the declarations of working times

written work (via the geolocation system for construction equipment).

        72. Considering the explanations on the purposes of the processing provided by those inspected

in their letter of February 2, 2023 and during the Restricted Training session, as well as
that the confirmation that the construction machinery was reserved for use strictly

professional, Restricted Training considers that the geolocation system can

be used to ensure the safety of workers working alone in isolated locations

during working hours, without requiring that a separate activation button not be

is installed, and to verify the workers' written working time declarations

authorized to go directly to the construction sites.

        73. In view of these circumstances, the Restricted Panel considers that there is no need
to identify a breach of article 5.1.c) of the GDPR.

1. On the principles

        74. Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR provides that personal data

must be “collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and not

be subsequently processed in a manner incompatible with these purposes; \[…\] (limitation

purposes)”.

        75. Article 6.1 of the GDPR provides that processing is only lawful if, and in the context of

provided that at least one of the six legal bases listed in this article applies.

        76. Furthermore, article L. 261-1.1 of the Labor Code provides that “treatment

labor relations can only be implemented by the employer in the cases referred to

in Article 6, paragraph 1, letters a) to f) » of the GDPR, and in accordance with the provisions
of this article.

        77. Regarding the requirement that the purpose be “legitimate”, the Working Group
Work Article 29 in its opinion 03/2013 on limitation of purpose, adopted on April 2, 2013

(hereinafter: “WP 203”), clarified that in order for a purpose to be legitimate, the processing must,

at any stage and at any time, be based on at least one of the legal bases provided for by

Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC and Article 6.1(b) of that Directive further requires

that the purposes must comply with all the provisions of protection law

adopted by the committee, it can nevertheless retain its relevance, given that the

principle is worded in the same way in the GDPR. 62

2. In the present case

        79. The CNPD at the end of its opinion observed that it was its understanding that

those inspected wished to implement the envisaged processing, among other things, to

“ensure the tracking of goods due to their particular nature (materials

dangerous, foodstuffs) » . 63

        80. The head of investigation noted in the statement of objections that “it appears from the

Information notes (EXHIBITS 11, 12, 13 and 14) that one of the purposes of the Processing is the

“Guarantee of tracking of goods due to their particular nature (materials

dangerous, foodstuffs, etc.)", respectively in the German versions

“The terms of the Warehouse Verfolgung aufgrund der besonderen Art der

transportierten Waren (gefährliche Stoffe, Lebensmittel,…) » » 64 and that “the transport of

goods does not appear \[however\] in any of the corporate objects appearing in the statutes
                 65
controls " .

        81. He considered that “\[i\]f the transport of goods can constitute in itself and in

certain cases a legitimate purpose, this cannot be the case if this purpose does not cover
                             66
an operational reality. Thus, after having noted that “it in no way emerges from

the investigation that the Controlled would actually engage in a transport activity of

goods”, he held that the purpose relating to the transport of goods was
devoid of legitimacy 67 so that non-compliance with article 5.1.b) of the GDPR was

acquired on the day of the on-site visit.8

        82. During the Restricted Training session, the controls clarified in this respect

which they consider to be commodities.

        83. The Restricted Formation recalls that for a purpose to be legitimate, the

processing must in particular be based on a relevant legal basis under the
Article 6 of the GDPR.

        84. She notes that the tracking of goods due to their particular nature

was mentioned as one of the purposes of the processing in the information notices

that the inspected had sent to their employees and that during the on-site visit the

monitored invoked their legitimate interests as the legal basis for the processing
(article 6.1.f) of the GDPR).9

        85. The Restricted Panel has already noted that those controlled did not have

mentioned in the information notices the legitimate interests pursued by the

joint controllers (article 13.1.d) of the GDPR) (see point 49 of this
              70
decision) \[…\] .

        86. She nevertheless expresses her doubts concerning the qualification of the lands and

stones transported by controlled elements that merit monitoring due to
of their particular nature as the CNPD understands it, that is to say that they are

dangerous materials or perishable or particularly valuable goods.

Thus, the activities in which those controlled actually engaged did not correspond

not to the activities that the CNPD had considered in its opinion. In fact, it is only then

of the investigation that it turned out that the purpose of tracking the goods did not reflect a
operational reality.

        87. It considers that the tracking of goods due to their nature

particular purpose did not constitute a real and therefore legitimate purpose, and therefore could not

justify the use of geolocation on the basis of article 6.1.f) of the GDPR for this

purpose.

        88. In view of the above, the Restricted Formation agrees with the opinion of the chief

investigation and concludes that non-compliance with article 5.1.b) of the GDPR was acquired on the day
of the on-site visit by CNPD agents.

       89. In accordance with article 12 of the law of August 1, 2018, the National Commission

has the powers provided for in article 58.2 of the GDPR:

“a) notify a controller or a processor of the fact that the processing operations

envisaged processing are likely to violate the provisions of this regulation;

administrative fines as provided for in article 83 of the GDPR, except against
of the state or municipalities.

        91. Article 83.1 of the GDPR provides that each supervisory authority ensures that

the administrative fines imposed are, in each case, effective, proportionate

and dissuasive.

        92. Article 83.2 of the GDPR specifies the elements which must be taken into account
to decide whether to impose an administrative fine and to decide the amount

of this fine:

“a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the violation, taking into account the nature, scope

or the purpose of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects
affected and the level of damage they have suffered;

       93. The imposition of administrative fines was explained by the Group of
Labor Article 29 in its “Guidelines on the application and setting of fines

administrative measures for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2016/679” adopted on October 3, 2017. These

The guidelines have been taken up and re-approved by the EDPS. Restricted Training

underlines that these guidelines have been supplemented by the “Guidelines 04/2022 on the

calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR” of the EDPS, version 2.1 of which has been
adopted on May 24, 2023.72

       94. The Restricted Panel would like to point out that the facts taken into account in the

framework of this decision are those noted at the start of the investigation. The possible

modifications relating to the data processing subject to the investigation that have taken place

subsequently, even if they make it possible to fully or partially establish the

compliance, do not allow retroactive cancellation of a noted breach.

       95. Nevertheless, the steps taken by those inspected to put themselves in

compliance with the GDPR during the investigation procedure or to remedy the

shortcomings noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken

taken into account by the Restricted Training as part of any corrective measures

to be pronounced and/or the setting of the amount of a possible administrative fine to be

amount of \[…\] euros “for the payment of which the Controlled will be jointly and severally

position in relation to the initial statement of objections, had first raised

the incompetence of the CNPD to pronounce an “administrative sanction” \[…\].

In the alternative, those inspected had contested the amount of the administrative fine

proposed by the head of investigation in the initial statement of objections, in particular in

given previous decisions taken by the Restricted Formation. They also have

       102. In order to decide whether it is appropriate to impose an administrative fine, the

Restricted Training analyzes the criteria set by article 83.2 of the GDPR.

       103. As for the nature and seriousness of the violation (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), it

notes that with regard to the breach of article 5.1.b) of the GDPR, it is constitutive

of a breach of a fundamental principle of the GDPR (and of the law of protection of

data in general), namely the principle of limitation of purposes devoted to the
Chapter II “Principles” of the GDPR.

As for the failure to comply with the obligation to inform the persons concerned in accordance

in article 13 of the GDPR, it recalls that information and transparency relating to the
processing of personal data are essential obligations weighing on

data controllers, so that people are fully aware of

the use that will be made of their personal data, once these

collected. A breach of Article 13 of the GDPR therefore constitutes an infringement of
rights of the persons concerned. This right to information has also been strengthened in

terms of the GDPR, which demonstrates its particular importance.

       104. As for the duration criterion (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Training

Restricted notes that these failures have lasted over time, at least since
\[…\] March 2021 and until the day of the on-site visit. In fact, those inspected explained

during the Restricted Training session that the geolocation system had been

deactivated pending a return from the CNPD. However, the mail \[…\] that the controlled
attached to their email to the Restricted Training of June 21, 2023 specifies that the system

geolocation \[…\] \[was\] reactivated after those controlled had become aware of

the opinion of the CNPD and before the on-site visit of CNPD agents dated May 26

2021.

       105. As for the number of affected persons and the level of

damage they have suffered (article 83.2.a) of the GDPR), the Restricted Formation notes

that this concerns all employees of those inspected who have used service vehicles and machinery
of construction sites equipped with the geolocation system. In this regard, it takes into account the

explanations provided by those inspected during the Restricted Training session according to

which the people concerned by geolocation were the \[…\] employees-workers

who left daily with the service vehicles and used the equipment of
site, as well as their \[…\] other employees who occasionally used one of the vehicles

capable of being constantly monitored.

       106. As to the question of whether the breaches were committed

deliberately or negligently (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR), Restricted Training reminds

that “intent”, that is to say an offense committed deliberately, includes both the

knowledge and will in relation to the characteristics of an offense, while
“not deliberately” (negligently) means that there was no intention to commit

the violation, although the controller or processor has not complied

the duty of care incumbent upon it under the legislation.

The controlled in their aforementioned letter of February 2, 2023 had explained that they

were initially suspicious of the geolocation system, but that the said system had
nevertheless been installed at the request of employees for reasons mainly of

security. They also stressed that at no time was permanent surveillance

of employees would not have been the purpose sought by the geolocation system (cf.

point 70 of this decision).

The Restricted Panel also takes into account the assertions of the head of investigation according to

which “the Controlled have had a certain number of internal discussions regarding the

way of concretely adapting the CNPD Opinion to their needs (PIECES 28 and

29)” which “at no time \[…\] indicate any desire to ignore the
                                          74
recommendations of the CNPD Opinion”.

While the Restricted Panel is of the opinion that the facts and the shortcomings observed

do not reflect a deliberate intention to violate the GDPR on the part of those inspected,

it nevertheless considers that the breaches were committed through negligence.

       107. As for the measures taken by those inspected or their subcontractor to

mitigate the damage suffered by the persons concerned (article 83.2.c) of the GDPR), the
Restricted Training takes into account the measure taken by those controlled and refers to the

Chapter II.2, Section 2.2 of this decision for the related explanations.

Those inspected had also explained in their letter of February 2, 2023, as well as

during the Restricted Formation session that they had appointed a delegate to the
external data protection, namely Company D, already before the request for an opinion

              Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of
              survey no. \[…\] carried out with Public Body A and Public Body B 31/38 addressed to the CNPD and that the latter “had the particular mission of ensuring the implementation

in compliance of \[…\] \[of the inspected\] with the rules of the GDPR”. However, like this

appointment 75 had not resulted in a mitigation of the damage, the Formation

Restricted cannot take it into account as a mitigating factor.

This also applies to the aforementioned deactivation of the geolocation system,

given that those controlled had reactivated the system after receiving the notice from the

CNPD and before the on-site visit of CNPD agents (see point 104 of this

decision).

        108. As for the degree of cooperation established with the supervisory authority
(article 83.2.f) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training takes into account the assertion of the head

investigation according to which “the Controlled showed good cooperation”. 76

        109. As for the categories of personal data concerned by the

violation (article 83.2.g) of the GDPR), this is the date and time of the start and end of the

journey, the state of the vehicle (moving or stationary, including any possible

breaks), vehicle positioning data (within two meters) and route of the

vehicle, driving time and mileage traveled and start-up

abnormality of the vehicle due to the day (Saturday or Sunday) or the schedule (function

“Geo-fencing”). The controlled persons declared during the on-site visit of the agents of the

CNPD that the geolocation system was associated with service vehicles and machines
site and not to employees. However, the overlap between the geolocation of the vehicle and

the employee driving it was possible, by cross-referencing the work sheets

employees, to the extent that they documented which vehicle was used

which day by which employee.

        110. As for any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance applicable to

circumstances of the case (article 83.2.k) of the GDPR), the Restricted Training takes into account

assertions by the head of investigation according to which “the violations identified are not

furthermore, did not find any elements allowing us to conclude that losses were avoided.

       111. The Restricted Panel notes that the other criteria of article 83.2 of the

GDPR are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision regarding taxation

an administrative fine and its amount.

       112. Therefore, the Restricted Panel considers that the imposition of a fine

administrative is justified with regard to the criteria set by article 83.2 of the GDPR for
breach of articles 5.1.b) and 13 of the GDPR.

2.1.3 On the amount of the fine

       113. Those controlled transmitted to the Restricted Training by emails from 21 and
June 29, 2023 their respective accounts for the year 2022.

       114. Regarding the amount of the administrative fine, the Restricted Panel

recalls that article 83.3 of the GDPR provides that in the event of multiple violations, as is

in the present case, the total amount of the fine cannot exceed the maximum amount set
for the most serious violation. To the extent that a breach of Articles 5 and 13 of the

RGPD is blamed on those inspected, the maximum amount of the fine that can be withheld

amounts to 20 million euros or 4% of global annual turnover, the highest amount

high being retained, in accordance with article 83.5 of the GDPR.

       115. With regard to the responsibility of those controlled, their financial capacities
and the relevant criteria of article 83.2 of the GDPR mentioned above in chapter “2.1.2

On the advisability of imposing an administrative fine”, the Restricted Training

considers that the imposition of a fine of two thousand five hundred (2,500) euros appears

both effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the requirements of article 83.1 of the
GDPR.

2.2 Regarding taking corrective measures

       116. In the statement of objections the head of investigation proposed to the

Training Restricted to adopt the following corrective measures: “within 1

    German “Sicherstellung der Warennachverfolgung aufgrund der besonderen Art
    der transportierten Waren (gefährliche Stoffe, Lebensmittel,…)” and to communicate

    any supporting evidence capable of demonstrating compliance with this injunction. ".

       117. As for the corrective measures proposed by the head of investigation and by

reference to point 95 of this decision, the Restricted Training takes into account
the steps taken by those inspected in order to comply with the provisions of the

articles 5.1.b) and 13 of the GDPR, as detailed in their letter of February 2, 2023.

More particularly, it takes note of the following facts:

       118. In their letter of February 2, 2023, the controlled \[…\]. They had \[…\]

contested that they would have taken no measures to comply with their legal obligations
“after receipt of the CNPD’s opinion”.

Thus, they explained that they initially planned to wait for reception

in the opinion of the CNPD before initiating internal compliance measures and that they

did not expect to be “subject shortly after \[receipt of this notice\] to a
detailed control”. Otherwise, the necessary measures would have been taken more quickly.

\[…\]

Then, they emphasized that a memo had been put in place after the

receipt of the “first opinion” from the CNPD and remained in place pending guidance from

the CNPD in the form of its “final opinion”.

In support of their argument they had annexed \[…\] \[several reports from
meetings of their governing bodies\].

       119. During the Restricted Training session of June 13, 2023, the controlled

reiterated their words.

       120. As for the first corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation

repeated under point 116 of this decision to put the information measures
intended for employees of those controlled in accordance with the provisions of

articles 13.1.a), b), c), d), f) and 13.2.d) of the GDPR and more precisely to complete,

respectively rectify, said information measures, the Restricted Training holds

80Statement of Objections, paragraph 124.
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

              Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of
              investigation no. \[…\] carried out with Public Body A and Public Body B 35/38 includes the copy of the renewed version of the memo dated
                81
January 11, 2022 which was annexed to the controlled email of March 24, 2022, and

mentioned in their aforementioned letter of February 2, 2023.

The Restricted Panel notes, however, that the content of the said note was
substantially identical to that of the memo dated February 17, 2021. Being

given that it has already noted that the latter document did not contain the elements

required by the first level of information (see point 46 of this decision), it

therefore considers that the same observation is necessary for the memo dated

January 11, 2022.

Furthermore, the documentation submitted to the Restricted Training does not contain any evidence

that the renewed information note had indeed been transmitted in a manner

individual to the employees of the controlled.

In consideration of insufficient compliance measures taken by those inspected

in the present case and point 95 of this decision, the Restricted Panel therefore considers

that it is appropriate to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation in this regard.

       121. \[…\]

       122. As for the third corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation
repeated under point 116 of this decision to bring processing into compliance

with the provisions of article 5.1.c) of the GDPR and more precisely to provide the system

geolocation installed in construction equipment with a deactivation button, the

Restricted Training, given that it did not retain the breach linked to the principle of

minimization retained by the head of investigation (see point 73 of this decision), it considers
that there is also no reason to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the head

investigation in this regard.

       123. As for the fourth corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation

repeated under point 116 of this decision to bring processing into compliance

with the provisions of article 5.1.b) of the GDPR and more precisely to delete

information notes the purpose relating to the tracking of goods, Restricted Training
recalls that it noted that the tracking of goods due to their nature

              investigation no. \[…\] carried out with Public Body A and Public Body B 36/38 did not constitute a legitimate purpose of the processing (see point 87 of this
decision).

In consideration of insufficient compliance measures taken by those inspected

in the present case and point 95 of this decision, the Restricted Panel therefore considers

that it is appropriate to pronounce the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation in this regard.

Taking into account the foregoing developments, the National Commission sitting

in restricted training, after having deliberated, decides:

- to identify breaches of articles 5.1.b) and 13 of the GDPR;

- to pronounce against Public Body A and Public Body B a
    administrative fine in the amount of two thousand five hundred (2,500) euros in respect of

    breaches of articles 5.1.b) and 13 of the GDPR;

- to pronounce against Public Body A and Public Body B a
