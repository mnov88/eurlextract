## English Summary

### Facts

The Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP) received several complaints regarding a security breach of personal data, where an employee of the bank (the controller) had shared a statement about a customer (the data subject) on how they intended to use a certain amount of money that they wanted to withdraw from their account.

This statement was distributed among several other employees on their work e-mail addresses. One of the employees listed the email containing the data subject's statement as well as the email containing the internal conversation between the controller's employees. Another employee photographed the listed statement with his mobile phone and distributed it via WhatsApp. Subsequently, the listed text wasalso posted and distributed on Facebook and on a website.

Overall, the disclosed personal data belonged to four individuals (one customer and three employees) and included first and last names, email addresses, work phone number, job title and location, work address, behavioral data, personal preferences and financial transaction value.

### Holding

The Romanian DPA held that sharing the personal data violated [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") and proved the ineffectivness of the controller's employee compliance training, in violation of [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

The DPA also noted that the controller did not take sufficient measures to ensure that persons acting under its authority (namely their employees) and having access to personal data only processed them at the request of the controller. Finally, the DPA also took into account that the disclosure of personal data in the public space (on the internet) generated a series of moral damages, as well as other significant disadvantages of an economic or social nature for the data subject affected.

## Comment

This decision was appealed by Banca Transilvania SA. However, the Cluj Court of Appeal (Civil Decision no. 9 of 13.04.2022) confirmed the fine of €100,000 applied by the ANSPDCP (see [here](https://www-dataprotection-ro.translate.goog/?page=Comunicat_Presa_14_04_2022&lang=ro&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de)).

Although the DPA does not specifically refer to [Article 29 GDPR,](/index.php?title=Article_29_GDPR "Article 29 GDPR") it is clear the decision also relates to this provision.
