## English Summary

### Facts

The controller installed a GPS tracker on a company car.

The data subject, namely the employee using that company car, filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA, indicating that he was not aware of the existence of the GPS tracker and that the controller did not inform him about the processing purposes, applicable legal grounds, and retention periods. Also, the data subject stated that the personal data collected through the GPS tracker were not only processed for the purpose of monitoring the company car.

Following this complaint, the Romanian DPA started an investigation. It revealed that the data controller processed the personal data collected through the GPS tracker, without providing the data subject with complete information in relation to such processing activities. Also, it was found that the controller processed the data for various purposes and that it collected location data outside of working hours.

The investigation also showed that the controller stored the data after the expiration of 30-day storage period, provided by [Article 5 of Law No. 190/2018](https://www.dataprotection.ro/?page=legislatie_primara&lang=ro), without being able to prove that exceeding the 30-day period was based on justified reasons, as required under the law.

### Holding

The DPA found that the controller was processing data without providing complete and correct information and in an excessive way (outside the working hours), without being able to demonstrate that other less intrusive means were possible. The controller thus violated [Article 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), [5(1)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"), [5(1)(e)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1e "Article 5 GDPR"), [5(2)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). As such, the DPA imposed a fine in the amount of RON 14,697.9 (approximately €3,000).

Moreover, the DPA found that by exceeding the 30-day term for retaining the personal data collected through the GPS tracker, without any justified reasons in this respect, the data controller violated the provisions of [Article 5(1)(e)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1e "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR"). For such, the DPA imposed a fine in the amount of RON 9,798.6 (approximately €2000).

In accordance with [Article 58(2)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2d "Article 58 GDPR"), the DPA also imposed corrective measures. First, it ordered the data controller to reassess the use of location data from the GPS tracker to achieve the purposes of the processing and to avoid excessive collection of data. Second, the DPA ordered the controller to limit the data storage period.
