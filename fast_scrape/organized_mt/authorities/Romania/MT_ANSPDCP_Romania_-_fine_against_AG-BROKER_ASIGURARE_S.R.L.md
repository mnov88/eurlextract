Sanction for non-compliance with the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in April 2025, an investigation at the operator AG-BROKER ASIGURARE S.R.L., and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) letter. b) and para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

For the acts committed, the operator was fined 24,887 lei (equivalent to 5,000 euros).

The investigation was initiated following the transmission by the operator AG-BROKER ASIGURARE S.R.L. of a notification regarding the breach of personal data security, according to the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Thus, the operator notified that, following a cyber attack, the following categories of personal data were affected, namely CNP, name, first name, photos from identity cards of natural persons, birth certificates, driving licenses, vehicle registration certificates, email addresses and telephone numbers of a significant number of customers.

During the investigation, it was found that the operator had not implemented, at the time of the cyber attack, security measures with specific requirements regarding secure access to network storage equipment that would reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the aforementioned personal data.

Therefore, it was found that the operator did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented by the processing, generated in particular, accidentally or unlawfully, by the destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, including the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and continuous resilience of the processing systems and services, which led to the unauthorized disclosure of personal data processed by the operator.
