## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject, a member of the Association of Owners of Bld. Pipera 1-2E, filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA alleging that the President of the Association of Owners (the controller) had made block recordings from the association-managed video surveillance system, which contained pictures of the data subject, available on the WhatsApp group. Following the complaint, the DPA started an investigation into the controller.

### Holding

The DPA noted that the controller did not provide the information requested by the DPA by the legal deadline. Therefore, the DPA held that the controller violated [Article 58(1)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#1 "Article 58 GDPR") and [Article 83(5)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#5e "Article 83 GDPR").

The DPA thus fined the controller €300.
