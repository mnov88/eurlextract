## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is a bank that, inter alia, provides internet banking services. The processor is Valoris Center S.R.L., a company that provides call center services on behalf of the bank. In their communication with a customer of the bank, an employee of Valoris had, by mistake, attached an excel file containing personal data of the controller’s customers who used the internet banking service. Hence, pursuant to [Article 33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR"), the controller notified the Romanian DPA of a personal data breach.

In the course of the investigation, the DPA found that this breach led to the unauthorised disclosure and access to personal data. The excel file contained e-mail addresses, user names, user ID’s, telephone numbers, customer names, customer codes, customer PIN’s, of the bank’s customers. In total, 11,169 natural persons were affected by the incident.

### Holding

The DPA held that Valoris did not fulfill its obligations laid down in Article 29, Article 32(1)(b), and [Article 32(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#4 "Article 32 GDPR"). Even if the employee of Valoris was not allowed to share the personal data with the customer, this data breach could only occur because of Valoris negligence. In particular, the processor had not taken adequate measures to ensure that any natural person acting under its authority could have limited access to the personal data. Hence, the security of processing was not guaranteed, ultimately leading to a personal data breach.

The DPA considered the different aspects of the case, such as the amount of data subjects involved, the categories of personal data, and decided to impose a fine of 9898 Leu (the equivalent of €2,000) on Valoris.
