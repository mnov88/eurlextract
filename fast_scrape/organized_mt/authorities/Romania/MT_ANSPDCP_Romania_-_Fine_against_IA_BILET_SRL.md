## English Summary

### Facts

The controller operates a website where concert tickets are sold.

In order to use this platform, the data subject created an account and entered their phone number. After that, the data subject received several text messages on their phone, advertising the controller's services.

Therefore, the data subject objected to the processing of their phone number for direct marketing purposes pursuant to [Article 21(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#2 "Article 21 GDPR").

After that, the controller completely deleted their account and refused to reactivate it.

Thus, the data subject filed a complaint with the DPA.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller reacted in an unlawful way when receiving the data subject's objection, since it completely deactivated and deleted the data subject's profile.

Therefore, the DPA found a violation of [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR") in combination with Article 21(2) and 21(3) GDPR.

Moreover, the DPA noted that the controller had never acquired the data subject's consent before sending them direct marketing SMS. Therefore, it found a violation of Articles 6(1)(a) and 7(1) GDPR.

On these grounds, the DPA issued a fine of RON 9,951.40 (€2,000).

The National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data completed in September 2024 an investigation at the operator IA BILET SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) lit. a) and para. (2), in conjunction with art. 6 para. (1), art. 12 para. (1) first sentence, related to art. 21 para. (2) and (3), and art. 6 para. (1) lit. a) and art. 7 para. (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was penalized for contravention with two fines totaling 9,951.4 (the equivalent of 2,000 EURO) and a warning, as follows:

The investigation was started as a result of a complaint submitted by a natural person claiming a possible violation of the provisions of Regulation (EU) no. 2016/679. In this sense, a client of the operator complained that the operator unjustifiably deleted his account created on the iabilet.ro platform and refused to reactivate his account after exercising his right to deletion, as a result of the fact that he received messages on his phone number unsolicited commercial for marketing purposes.

(1) lit. a) and of art. 7 para. (1) from Regulation (EU) no. 2016/679.
