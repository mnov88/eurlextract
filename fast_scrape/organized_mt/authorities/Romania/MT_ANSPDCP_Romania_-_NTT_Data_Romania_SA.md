Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in February 2025, an investigation at the operator NTT DATA ROMÂNIA S.A. and found a violation of art. 32 para. (1) let. b) and d), para. (2) and art. 33 para. (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was sanctioned with:

- a fine in the amount of 124,432.50 lei, equivalent to the amount of 25,000 euros, for violating the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) let. b) and d), para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

- a warning for violating the provisions of art. 33 para. (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

The investigation was initiated following the transmission by the operator NTT DATA ROMÂNIA S.A. of a personal data breach notification, in accordance with the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

During the investigation, it was found that, following a cyber attack, the operator's IT infrastructure was accessed and thus personal data were extracted in an unauthorized manner.

As such, it was found that the operator did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures and did not periodically test, evaluate and assess the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of data processing, including the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and continued resilience of the processing systems and services.

In this context, we would like to point out that this situation led to unauthorized access to personal data of a significant number of individuals concerned, such as: name, surname, signature, address, telephone number, e-mail address, gender, nationality, copies of identity documents, marriage certificates, passports, birth certificates, employment information and financial information: invoices, contracts, budget plans, educational information (records of training courses, participation in training courses, CVs, diplomas), sensitive data regarding the health of employees.

Also, during the investigation, it was found that the operator did not notify the Supervisory Authority within 72 hours from the date on which it became aware of the personal data breach incident, thus violating the provisions of art. 33 para. (1) of the GDPR.

The operator paid the established fine.
