The National Supervisory Authority completed on 04.11.2020 an investigation at the operator Vodafone Romania SA and found the violation of the provisions of art. 12, art. 15 and art. 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

The operator of Vodafone Romania SA was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 19468.8 lei, the equivalent of the amount of 4000 EURO.

The sanction was applied following some complaints claiming that the operator did not respond to requests to exercise the rights of access and deletion provided by art. 15 and art. 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

During the investigation, Vodafone Romania SA could not prove the settlement of the requests for exercising the access and deletion rights within the term provided by art. 12 of the Regulation.

At the same time, the corrective measure was applied to the operator to communicate a response to the petitioner to his requests regarding the measures adopted on their basis.
