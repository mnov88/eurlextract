## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is a medical clinic, the Medical Civil Society Policlinica Tommed. The Romanian DPA started an investigation against the medical clinic after a complaint was filed by one of its patients. During the investigation, the DPA found that the clinic unlawfully disclosed the personal data belonging to a patient, including their health data, to another controller. Moreover, the patient was not informed of this.

### Holding

The DPA found that the controller violated [Article 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), [Article 5(1)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1b "Article 5 GDPR"), [Article 5(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR"), and [Article 5(2)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR"), in conjunction with [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR").

First, the DPA held that there was no legal basis to process the sensitive personal data. Moreover, the principle of purpose limitation was also violated. Lastly, the DPA noted that the controller failed to implement appropriate measures to ensure security and confidentiality. The DPA concluded this since there was no regular training of persons that process the data for the controller, nor was the data protection officer properly involved in accordance with [Article 37 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR "Article 37 GDPR"), [Article 38 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_38_GDPR "Article 38 GDPR"), and [Article 39 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_39_GDPR "Article 39 GDPR").

As result, the DPA imposed a fine of approximately €2.000 (RON9.898) on the controller. Moreover, the DPA applied a corrective measure, ordering the clinic to bring its processing operations into compliance to prevent further unlawful disclosure and to apply adequate security and confidentiality measures.
