Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in June 2025, an investigation at the operator Agricola International SA and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) let. b) and d) and para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 25,226.50 lei (equivalent to 5,000 EURO).

The investigation was initiated following the transmission by the operator Agricola International S.A of a notification regarding the violation of personal data security, according to the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Thus, the operator notified that, following a cyber attack, a series of categories of personal data of a significant number of employees, their family members and clients were affected, such as: photo of the identity document, name, surname, father's initial, date of birth, age, gender, personal identification number, trademark number, location, position, job, department, type of employment, employee status, spouse's date of birth, company, date of employment, mobile phone number, fax number, e-mail address, parents' surnames and surnames and telephone number, employee's address, marital status, spouse's surname and surname, spouse's personal identification number, personal documents such as: identity card, work card, aptitude sheet, study details, professional certificates, work card history, bank account, courses, salary payment records, leave records, health insurance records, payment parameters, disability records, bonus records, postal address).

At the same time, during the investigation, it emerged that the operator had not implemented, at the time of the cyber attack, security measures with specific requirements regarding secure access to network storage equipment that would mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to the aforementioned personal data.

As a result, it was found that Agricola International SA had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing, including the ability to ensure the confidentiality of processing systems and services and a process for periodically testing, evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures.

This situation led to the unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access by a third party to personal data held by the operator, thus violating the provisions of art. 32 par. (1) letters b) and d) and par. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Pursuant to art. 58 par. (2) letter d) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the corrective measure of implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures was also ordered, including by installing operating systems with active support from the manufacturer, complete and updated antivirus solutions on all IT equipment in the operator's network (servers, work devices), respectively securing external access, as appropriate, to the operator's infrastructure equipment (VPN, MFA, IP restriction).

We note that the operator paid the applied contravention fine.
