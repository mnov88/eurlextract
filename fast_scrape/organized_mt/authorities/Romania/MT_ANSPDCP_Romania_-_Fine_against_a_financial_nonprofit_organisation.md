## English Summary

### Facts

Association Casa de Recipproc Aid “FLEXICREDIT” (the controller) is a nonprofit organisation that provides financial services, including loans. The DPA began investigating the controller after receiving a complaint by the controller itself; the controller reported that an employee of a school had obtained unauthorised access to an official email address of their employer and had sent false documents to the controller. The controller entered into 17 remote loan contracts as a result, without the consent of several data subjects who were set as applicants.

### Holding

The DPA found a violation of [Article 32(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#2 "Article 32 GDPR"), as the controller had not implemented adequate technical and organisational measures to ensure security of processing. The controller processed a significant number of data subjects’ personal data (including their name and ID information) in the process of granting 17 loans based on falsified documents. In addition, the controller did not properly verify the identity of the applicants.

The DPA fined the controller RON 15,141.60 (€3,000).

Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data, completed, in June 2025, an investigation at the Association of Mutual Aid Houses "FLEXICREDIT" and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 paragraph (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

As such, the operator of the Association of Mutual Aid Houses "FLEXICREDIT" was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 15,141.6 lei, the equivalent of 3,000 EURO.

The investigation was initiated following a complaint sent by the Mutual Aid House Association "FLEXICREDIT", which reported that an employee of a secondary school had obtained unauthorized access to the official e-mail address of the educational institution and sent false documents to Flexicredit in order to contract 17 loans.

During the investigation, it was found that, during the period 2023-2024, the Mutual Aid House Association "FLEXICREDIT" granted 17 loans based on documents transmitted electronically by a third party, without the consent of the persons concerned on whose behalf the loan agreements were concluded.

It was also noted that the operator did not properly verify the identity of the applicants in the case of remote loan applications, in relation to the documents received from them.

At the same time, it was found that the Mutual Aid House Association "FLEXICREDIT" did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing, which led to the processing of personal data (e.g. name, surname, personal identification number, home address, ID card series/number, date of issue and issuer of ID card, ID card validity date) of a significant number of data subjects in the context of granting 17 loans based on falsified documents.

As such, in relation to the criteria for individualizing sanctions provided for in art. 83 of the GDPR, it was established that the operator of the Mutual Aid House Association "FLEXICREDIT" be sanctioned with a fine for violating the provisions of art. 32 paragraph (2) of the GDPR.
