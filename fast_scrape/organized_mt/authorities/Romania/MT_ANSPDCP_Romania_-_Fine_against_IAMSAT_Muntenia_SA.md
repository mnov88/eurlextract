For the former violations, the DPA issued a fine of approximately €1000 (RON 4.946,2) on the company, and for the latter, a fine of approximately €2000 (RON 9.892,4). Additionally, as corrective measures, the DPA ordered the company to inform its employees about its data processing activities conducted through video surveillance in its workplace, as well as to reply and resolve the data subject's objection request accordingly.
