## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject is a member of the controller's association. The data subject lodged a complaint at the Romanian DPA, stating that the controller breached the GDPR by publishing a payment list containing the first and last name of each member of the association. Moreover, the data subject also accused the controller of having published a defamatory document in which the data subject's name was mentioned.

The complaint prompted the DSA to launch an investigation into the controller's conduct. During the investigation, it was found that the Owners' Association disclosed the petitioner's personal data (name and surname) by displaying an information on the notice board, without his consent.

### Holding

During the investigation, the DPA found that the controller disclosed the data subject's personal name on a notice board without a legal basis in [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). Neither consent nor any other legal basis were applicable. Consequently, pursuant to the Articles 83(5)(a) and 83(5)(e), the DPA fined the controller 2,462.5 lei (the equivalent of €500). Additionally, the controller was ordered to implement corrective measures to ensure future compliance with the GDPR.
