Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in April 2025, an investigation at the operator BITDEFENDER SRL and found a violation of art. 32 para. (1) letter. b) and d), para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 49,772 lei (equivalent to 10,000 euros).

The investigation was initiated following the transmission by BITDEFENDER SRL of a notification of a personal data breach, according to the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

During the investigation, it was found that, due to a programming or implementation error in the update operation of the email security analysis service, a significant number of customers' personal data were disclosed to third parties.

As such, it was found that the operator did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures and did not periodically test, evaluate and assess the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of data processing, including the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and continuous resilience of the processing systems and services.

In this context, we specify that this situation led to the unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to the personal data of a significant number of data subjects, at least, name, surname and email address.
