## English Summary

### Facts

Data Diggers Market Research SRL (the controller) processed personal data of natural persons (the data subjects) across EU borders. On 21 May 2025, the Romanian National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing (ANSPDCP) published its decision after concluding an investigation initiated in April 2025.

The investigation arose from complaints referred by two other EU DPAs, each lodged by an individual against the controller. Because the controller has its main establishment in Romania, ANSPDCP acted as the lead supervisory authority under [Article 56 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_56_GDPR "Article 56 GDPR") and [Article 61 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_61_GDPR "Article 61 GDPR").

ANSPDCP found that, upon receiving access requests, the controller did not provide complete information as required by [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") read together with [Article 12 GDPR#1](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR"). It also failed, at first communication, to supply the information prescribed by [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR") read together with [Article 12 GDPR#1](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR"), despite processing data obtained indirectly from sources other than the data subjects. Finally, ANSPDCP determined that the controller did not demonstrate any valid legal basis for its processing activities, in breach of [Article 6 GDPR#1](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR").

### Holding

First, the DPA held that the controller had violated [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and [Article 12 GDPR#1](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR") by withholding complete access information from data subjects.

Second, the DPA found that the controller had infringed [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR") and [Article 12 GDPR#1](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR") by failing to provide required transparency information at the initial communication with those whose data it processed.

Third, the DPA concluded that the controller lacked any legal basis for its cross‑border processing, in breach of [Article 6 GDPR#1](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"), because it could not show which lawful ground applied.

Under [Article 58 GDPR#2d](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2d "Article 58 GDPR"), the DPA also ordered the controller to implement regular staff training on data‑subject request handling and legal‑basis compliance.

The Romanian DPA imposed three administrative fines on the controller: €5 000 (RON 24 886.00) for the Article 15/Article 12(1) breach, €2 000 (RON 9 954.40) for the Article 14/Article 12(1) breach, and €5 000 (RON 24 886.00) for the Article 6(1) breach; totaling €12 000 (RON 59 726.40).

```
The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in April 2025, an investigation at the operator Data Diggers Market Research SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 15 and art. 14 reported to art. 12 paragraph (1) and art. 6 paragraph (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (RGPD).
As such, the operator was sanctioned with:
a fine of 24,886 Lei, equivalent to 5,000 Euros, for violating the provisions of art. 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, reported to art. 12 paragraph (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;
a fine of 9,954.40 Lei, equivalent to 2,000 Euros, for violating the provisions of art. 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in relation to art. 12 paragraph (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;
fine in the amount of 24,886 Lei, equivalent to the amount of 5,000 Euros, for breach of the provisions of art. 6 paragraph (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
The investigation was initiated following notifications from two other EU data protection authorities, regarding complaints filed by two individuals from these countries against the operator Data Diggers Market Research SRL.
Given that the operator Data Diggers Market Research SRL. has its main office in Romania, the National Supervisory Authority acted as the lead supervisory authority for the cross-border processing carried out by the operator Data Diggers Market Research SRL, in accordance with the provisions of art. 56 and art. 61 of the GDPR.
During the investigation, it was found that the operator did not provide the petitioners with complete information as a result of exercising the right of access to personal data, which constitutes a violation of the provisions of art. 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in relation to art. 12 paragraph (1) of the same regulatory act.
At the same time, the operator did not provide at the time of the first communication with the petitioners the information that it was obliged to communicate to the data subjects, thus violating the provisions of art. 14 paragraphs (1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in relation to art. 12 paragraph (1) of the same regulatory act.
Also, the operator did not prove the fulfillment of one of the conditions regarding the lawfulness of the processing of the petitioners' personal data, which constitutes a violation of the provisions of art. 6 paragraph (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
At the same time, pursuant to art. 58 paragraph (2) letter d) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the National Supervisory Authority applied to the operator the corrective measure of ordering regular training measures for the company's staff on the procedure to be followed in order to correctly resolve the requests submitted by the data subjects and on compliance with the conditions of legality of data processing, in relation to art. 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
