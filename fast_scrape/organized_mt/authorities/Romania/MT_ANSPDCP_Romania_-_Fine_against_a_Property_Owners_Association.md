## English Machine Translation of the Decision

The decision below is a machine translation of the Romanian original. Please refer to the Romanian original for more details.

```
The National Supervisory Authority completed on 06.05.2021 an investigation at an Owners Association in Iasi to which it imposed a fine, due to the fact that the controller did not provide the information requested by our institution, thus violating the provisions of art. 83 para. (5) lit. e) correlated with the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) lit. (a) and (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

As such, the Owners Association was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 2463.3 lei, the equivalent of the amount of 500 EURO, pursuant to art. 58 para. (2) lit. i) of the General Regulation on Data Protection, corroborated with art. 8 of O.G. no. 2/2001.

The investigation was carried out as a result of a complaint alleging that the controller displayed the payment lists detailing the name and surname of each member of the Owners Association. The petitioner also complained about the posting of a defamatory document in which his personal data (name and surname) were mentioned.

As the operator did not respond to the requests of our institution, although it confirmed their receipt, it was fined.

Also, the Owners Association was ordered to transmit to the supervisory authority all the requested information, within 5 working days from the communication of the minutes.
