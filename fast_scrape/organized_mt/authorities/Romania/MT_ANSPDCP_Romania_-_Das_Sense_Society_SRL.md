## English Summary

### Facts

Data subjects submitted several complaints claiming that surveillance cameras were installed at the controller's workplace. Allegedly, the surveillance cameras captured images both from the public domain (the sidewalk and the street) and from the private domain (ramp and access stairs of a residential complex, access to a supermarket). As a result, the Romanian DPA initiated an investigation into the controller's processing activities. In the course of proceedings, the DPA requested information from the controller, to which the controller failed to respond. The investigation was completed in October 2022.

### Holding

The DPA held that the fact that the controller did not provide the information requested by the DPA violated [Article 58(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#1 "Article 58 GDPR") and [Article 83(5)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#5e "Article 83 GDPR").

In conclusion, the Romanian DPA fined the controller €1,000 for not providing the requested information.
