## English Summary

### Facts

The DPA initiated an investigation following several complaints received from a former customer (the data subject) claiming that the controller, Alior Bank SA Warsaw Bucharest Branch, sent unsolicited messages both by e-mail and SMS to the data subject, although the data subject had previously requested the deletion of their data.

The data subject also informed the DPA that, following previous requests, the controller had confirmed that the contractual relationship was terminated and, consequently, the related bank accounts of the data subjects were closed. Moreover, the data subject pointed out that the controller had continuously sent commercial correspondence by e-mail to them despite them contacting the controller several times specifying that the contractual relationship had been terminated.

### Holding

The investigation initiated by the DPA was made in consultation with the Polish DPA, considering that the controller had a series of applications and communication systems based in Poland. More precisely, the IT system of the controller’s branch in Romania was integrated into the centralized system of Alior Bank SA Warsaw, based in Poland. Consequently, the messages communicated to customers after the date of termination of the contractual relationship with the financial institution were sent by the technical department of Alior Bank SA Warsaw in Poland.

Following the internal enquiries at the level of the Romanian branch, it became clear that when a contractual relationship with customers ended, the controller continued to monitor their activity and send messages on certain operations. Therefore, the controller continued to process the personal data (such as e-mail addresses and telephone numbers) of the data subjects, even after the termination of their contractual relationship. This was considered incompatible with the initial purpose for which the data were initially collected, resulting in a breach of [Article 5(1)(a) and (b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1 "Article 5 GDPR"), as well as [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR").

Thus, the DPA sanctioned the Romanian branch with a fine of €17,000 and imposed the following corrective measures.

*   Firstly, it ordered the controller to regularly monitor compliance with the principles and rules set out in [Article 5 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") to avoid unlawful processing of personal data of data subjects and, in case necessary, to reconfigure systems or applications used in the processing of personal data.
*   Secondly, it requested the controller to inform its Polish branch about the above-mentioned to properly implement the data protection principles under GDPR.

## Comment

From the facts presented in the press release, it seems that the following proceedings, although not explicitly mentioned, fall within [Article 61(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_61_GDPR#1 "Article 61 GDPR") since the Romanian DPA consulted with the Polish DPA.
