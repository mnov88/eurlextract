Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in May 2025, an investigation at the operator Vodafone Romania S.A. and found a violation of the provisions of art. 25 para. (1) and para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 679/2016.

As such, the operator was sanctioned with a fine of 20,226 Lei, equivalent to 4,000 Euros.

The investigation was initiated following the transmission by the operator of a notification of a personal data breach, according to the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

During the investigation, it was found that the operator did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, both when establishing the means of processing and during the processing itself, intended to effectively implement the data protection principles and integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing, in order to meet the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and protect the rights of data subjects.

This led to the unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access to personal data belonging to several data subjects, customers of the operator (identification data: name and surname, unique identifier for the natural person, Vodafone customer code and foreign citizen personal numerical code, passport series or other equivalent, contact data: mailing address, financial data: payment amount related to the invoice).

Also, the operator was ordered to take the corrective measure of technical and procedural implementation of a mechanism applied at regular intervals, regarding the testing, evaluation and periodic assessment of the effectiveness of the measures adopted, taking into account the risk presented by the processing, in order to ensure an appropriate level of security and avoid similar security incidents in the future.
