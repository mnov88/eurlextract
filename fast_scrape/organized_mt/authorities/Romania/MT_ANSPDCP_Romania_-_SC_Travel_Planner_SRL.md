Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in April 2025, an investigation at the operator SC Travel Planner SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 and art. 33 and art. 15 in relation to art. 12 para. (3) and (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was sanctioned for a minor offence:

with a fine of 24,886 lei (equivalent to 5,000 EURO), for violating art. 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;

with a fine of 4,977.20 lei (equivalent to 1,000 EURO), for violating art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;

with a warning for the violation of Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in relation to the provisions of Article 12(3) and (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

The investigation was initiated following complaints that reported a possible unlawful processing of personal data.

The investigation revealed that the operator, in order to organize a raffle to reward its customers, published, on its Facebook page, a table containing personal data of tourists, such as: surname, first name, reservation identification numbers, hotel or location where they made the reservation and the period of stay. Thus, the operator did not adopt sufficient technical and organizational security measures. This situation led to the unauthorized disclosure of data of the data subjects, in violation of the provisions of Art. 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Consequently, the operator was fined 5,000 Euros.

It was also found that the operator did not notify this data security breach, which contravenes the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and thus the penalty of a fine of 1,000 Euros was applied.

At the same time, during the investigation, it emerged that no evidence was presented regarding the communication to the petitioners of a complete response to their request by which they exercised their right of access, thus violating the provisions of art. 15, in relation to the provisions of art. 12 para. (3) and (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The operator was sanctioned for this act with a warning.

At the same time, the following corrective measures were also ordered towards the operator:

to ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of personal data processing operations, by implementing technical and organizational security measures appropriate to the specific nature of the processing and the risks identified, throughout the data processing cycle, training of persons who process data under the authority of the operator, regular verification of compliance with the instructions sent to them;

to ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of personal data processing operations, by adopting internal measures necessary for the rapid detection, management and reporting of personal data security breaches, regardless of whether or not they require notification of the supervisory authority and/or the data subjects, as well as appropriate and regular training of persons who process data under the authority of the operator, in this context;

to communicate to the petitioners a response to the request to exercise the right of access.
