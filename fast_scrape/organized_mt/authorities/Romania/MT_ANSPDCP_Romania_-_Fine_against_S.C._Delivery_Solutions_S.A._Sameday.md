## English Summary

### Facts

S.C. Delivery Solutions S.A. (processor), commonly known as "Sameday", is a courier company. Sameday is authorized by two companies (controllers) for the processing of personal data.

The DPA received complaints about the processor's database, as it was found for sale on a website (RaidForums). Following the complaint, the DPA started an investigation.

The database contained the personal data of 26,566 customers (name of the recipient, contact details, address of the recipient, parcel details, delivery status etc.). The website was later seized by FBI, Europol and other European national police agencies.

### Holding

The DPA noted that a processor is obliged to take all necessary measures to protect systematically the processing of personal data of natural persons, as required by [Article 28(3)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR "Article 28 GDPR"), including against disclosure and/or unauthorised access to data.

During its investigation, the DPA found that the database for sale on website contained data relating to 26.566 individuals. The data included: AWB number and date (the transport document which must accompany the dispatch of any parcel), courier details, sender's name, consignee's name and surname, telephone number, address, delivery status, type of service, parcel weight, amount to be collected and delivery interval.

The DPA held that the processor did not implement adequate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, which led to the disclosure and/or unauthorised access to personal data of 26,566 natural persons. As result, the DPA held that the controller violated [Article 29](/index.php?title=Article_29_GDPR "Article 29 GDPR"), [Article 32(1)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"), and [Article 32(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

The DPA fined the processor €3,000 (RON 14,825.70).
