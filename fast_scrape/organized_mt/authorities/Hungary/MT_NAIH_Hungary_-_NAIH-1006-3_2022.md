## English Summary

### Facts

In April 2021, the Hungarian DPA received a complaint from a company, which was a co-owner of a property, where two separate car repair shops were operating. It said that the co-owner – the controller – installed six cameras in the shop and was not willing to remove them or give information about their operation.

In May 2021, the controller replied to the DPA stating that the reason for the installation of the cameras was to protect the safety of the tools and other valuable objects in the shop. He added that the cameras were not used for surveillance of public areas. Furthermore, all of his employees gave their written consent to the surveillance and there was a sign installed about the video surveillance as well since 8 May 2021. He also sent pictures of each camera, as well as the privacy policies that were in effect since 8 May 2021. In them, the controller stated that the primary purpose of the CCTV system was to protect human life, to guard dangerous substances, to protect business, payment, banking and securities secrecy, and to protect assets.

One of the cameras was installed in "the kitchen". This was space not used for work, only for rest and dining activities. However, the company's safe deposit box was also located there. There was also a camera in the “office/customer waiting room”. The controller claimed that the administrative work was carried out in this room. Also, the cash register, the (bank) card reader, and the cash desk were located in this room.

### Holding

First, the DPA found that since the controller stated in his privacy policy that the legal basis for the data processing was not consent, he should have conducted a legitimate interest assessment. Since he did not do so, he violated [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"). However, provided that the controller can justify the proportionality of this during the balancing of interests, the DPA noted that the degree of danger of the work carried out on these premises (car mechanic activities) and the high value of the assets stored there (cars, tools, etc.) may justify the use of CCTV surveillance. Consequently, the DPA ordered the controller to amend his privacy policy so that it explicitly states that the legal basis for processing is the legitimate interest of the data controller. In addition, the DPA noted that the privacy policy contains literal quotes from completely irrelevant laws or laws no longer in effect.

Second, the DPA held that to comply with the principles of purpose limitation under [Article 5(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and data minimisation under [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"), the controller must change the angles of view of the cameras installed in the "office/customer waiting room" and "kitchen" rooms so that they do not cause unjustified surveillance of employees. In the DPA’s view, the angle of view of the cameras installed in the "office/customer waiting room" is such that employees and customers can be monitored. The DPA further observed that the camera's field of view in the “kitchen” is directed towards the dining table, which does not include the safe deposit box in question. Therefore, the purpose of the protection of persons and property does not apply here.

Third, the DPA ordered the controller to amend the privacy notice of the camera system to comply with [Article 13(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#1 "Article 13 GDPR") and [Article 13(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#2 "Article 13 GDPR"). The controller sent a photograph to the DPA showing that on 8 May 2021, it had placed a pictogram sign at the entrance of the premises to bring attention to the camera surveillance. As the data processing began on 5 March 2021, the requirement of adequate information in time was not met.

In issuing a fine of approximately €1,300, the DPA took various factors into account. Among the aggravating factors were that the DPA became aware of the infringement based on a complaint which could not be resolved between the parties, the infringement was still in progress during the DPA’s investigation, and the infringement concerned fundamental privacy rights, namely [Article 5(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1b "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"). On the other hand, some of the mitigating circumstances listed were that there were only two cameras facing such problematic areas, the infringement affected a limited number of persons (6 employees in total), the data subjects did not suffer any specific harm or damage as a result of the infringement, there was nothing to indicate that the controller violated the GDPR intentionally, and it was the controller's first offence.

1) According to the definition in Article 4 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, a person's face or image shall be considered as personal data, and the taking of an image and any action on data shall be considered as data processing within the meaning of Article 4 (2).

Given that the viewing angles of the cameras are designed to monitor workers in the building below \[…\] in addition to the premises and assets located on the basis of the documents sent to the Authority, the rules on camera surveillance at work should also be taken into account. assessment of the legality of the case. In assessing this, the following labor law rules apply.

Pursuant to Section 42 (2) (a) of the Labor Code, the employee is obliged to perform work under the direction of the employer on the basis of the employment contract. Accordingly, b. carried out in accordance with regulations, instructions and customs. In order to comply with these legal obligations, Mt. 11 / A. § (1) provides for the possibility for the employer to control the employee in the context of his employment-related conduct. This right necessarily goes hand in hand with the processing of personal data.

Data management related to employer control is data management arising from the provisions of the Mt., the nature of the employment relationship, independent of the employee's consent. In the context of consent, it should be noted that it must be voluntary as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation1. Regarding voluntary contributions

1 Article 4 (11) of the General Data Protection Regulation: "" consent of the data subject "shall mean a voluntary, specific and well-informed statement by the data subject indicating, by means of a statement or unambiguous statement of consent, that he or she consents to his or her consent. processing of personal data concerning them. "

10
 

however, the Data Protection Working Party3 (hereinafter referred to as the "Data Protection Working Party"), set up under Article 29 of the Repealed Data Protection Directive2, has stated in a number of resolutions that the possibility of voluntary consent in an employee-employer relationship is questionable. In the world of work, it is therefore appropriate to use a different legal basis, data processing based on the legitimate interest of the employer, instead of the data subject's consent.

Thus, under the legal basis for a legitimate interest under Article 6 (1) (f) 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation, personal data may be processed if the processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller (or a third party), unless those interests are preceded by personal data protection. data protection rights.

It is important that the employer, as data controller, has to exercise a balance of interests in order to invoke this legal basis.5 The balance of interests is a multi-step process of identifying based on the weighting, it must be determined whether personal data can be processed. If, as a result of the balance of interests, it can be established that the legitimate interest of the employer precedes the right of employees to the protection of personal data, a camera system may be operated.

However, due to the "principle of accountability" under Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the employer must demonstrate that the electronic monitoring system it uses is compatible with the purpose of data processing and that the interests of the controller are paramount. This requirement sets out the framework for the purpose for which an electronic monitoring system may be operated at the workplace.

The Authority also notes here that in assessing the interests involved, the Client must also take into account why the monitoring of the entire area of the undivided jointly owned property to be monitored is essential for the specific purpose.

2) The data protection regulations sent to the Authority ("Camera Surveillance System Data Protection and Data Management Regulations") do not specify the legal basis for camera surveillance, only that the data subject's consent cannot be the legal basis for such data processing. In comparison, the Client has obtained statements of consent from each of the employees concerned, which have also been signed by the parties concerned.

2 Directive 95/46 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data

3 Prior to the date of application of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Working Party was an independent European advisory body on data protection and privacy issues, replaced by the European Data Protection Board.

4 Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation: “The processing of personal data shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following conditions is met: the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, shall take precedence over those interests. "

5 The Data Protection Working Party 6/2014 provides assistance in carrying out the balance of interests. Opinion No 1/2008 on the concept of the legitimate interests of the controller under Article 7 of Directive 95/46 / EC, which may also be interpreted during the period of application of the General Data Protection Regulation. The opinion is available at the following link: https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp217\_en.pdf

11
 

In clarifying the facts, the Authority asked why consent had been given by employees when the data subject's consent could not be the legal basis for data processing under the system's own data protection rules.6 To this, the Client replied that he had consulted with contributed to their equipment for security purposes. These contributions were also recorded in writing to avoid possible future disagreements. Customer has also stated that it does not have a balancing test for the camera system.

Based on the above, notwithstanding the provisions of the data protection regulations, the Customer has in practice based the operation of the camera surveillance system on the consent of the parties concerned instead of on its own legitimate interests. This is confirmed by the statements of consent requested and the lack of a balancing test.

However, according to the previous subsection III./1./1 of the decision, the use of a workplace camera surveillance system cannot be based on the consent of the employees. Such systems may be operated in the workplace in the legitimate interest of the controller.

In addition, the Code contains verbatim quotations from the law on the lawfulness of the application of the system7, which are completely irrelevant for camera data management. These additional pieces of legislation are also listed in the section entitled “Legislation underlying data management”. The regulations also contain the Infotv. The general provisions on the obligation to register in the Data Protection Register have also been taken over from the repealed text.

Based on the above, it is clear from the regulations created in connection with the operation of the system that the Customer has been randomly compiled on the basis of a possibly invalid data management policy used as a template, as well as randomly selected legal references.

The Authority states here that in the data management regulations the data controller must be able to specify the legal basis of the data processing on the basis of the legal provisions in force, he cannot evade this obligation by listing various legal references at random.

The customer therefore infringed Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation by operating the camera system, as the consent of the employees was the legal basis for the operation of the system instead of the legitimate interest.

8 The obligation to register in the data protection register previously maintained by the Authority is regulated by Infotv. It has been deleted from its text in force since 27 July 2018. At present, such a register is not kept by the Authority, so data controllers do not need and do not have the opportunity to log in.

12
 

2. The purpose of the examined data management

1) In the replies sent to the Authority and in the attached documentation, the Client stated the purpose of data management as the protection of the security of the buildings and the property located there, as well as the protection of dangerous goods and payment transactions, and personal protection purposes. The purpose of operating the camera system is thus not to monitor and influence the work of employees, but to protect people and property.

In this context, it is important to mention that respect for human dignity is an absolute limit to camera surveillance in the workplace, so that cameras cannot be operated to monitor workers and their activities on a permanent basis without a specific purpose. It is also illegal to use an electronic surveillance system, the purpose of which is to influence the behavior of employees at work, and to monitor and control employees with cameras on a permanent basis. The reason for this is that monitoring for control purposes typically violates the principle of necessity proportionality, as the employer has several other ways to make use of Mt. 11 / A. § (1). Therefore, it is not possible to operate cameras that only monitor workers and their activities on a permanent basis. Exceptions are workplaces where the life and physical integrity of workers may be in imminent danger, so that cameras can be operated exceptionally, for example in assembly halls, smelters, industrial plants or other establishments containing a source of danger. It should be emphasized, however, that a camera may be operated to protect the life and physical integrity of workers only if the danger actually exists and is direct, ie the potential danger cannot be a constitutionally acceptable purpose for data processing. However, all this must be demonstrated by the employer in the balancing test.

In the case of surveillance for property protection purposes, the employer must also prove during the balance of interests that there are in fact circumstances which justify the location of each camera and that the objective to be achieved cannot be achieved in any other way. An additional important requirement in the case of surveillance for property protection purposes is that the employer must pay particular attention to the fact that the angle of view of the camera in question is essentially the object to be protected and does not become a suitable means of monitoring the work of employees.

In addition, an electronic monitoring system may not be used in a room designated for the purpose of taking a break from work. An exception to this may be the case if there is any valuable property to be protected in this premises in connection with which an interest of the employer can be proved (for example, the employees have repeatedly damaged the equipment and the damage had to be borne by the employer). In this case, a camera can be placed in the room for this specific purpose, but in this case the employer must also pay special attention to the fact that the camera can only focus on the property to be protected, also in accordance with the principle of data saving.

2) Based on the customer's responses and the sent images transmitted by the placed cameras, it can be stated that they:

- The workshop for car installation work in the building, the cars and tools stored there are monitored (3 cameras).

13
 

- Monitors a storage room and the goods, tools and parts stored there (1 camera).

- It monitors the customer waiting area and the office for receiving customers, where the cash register and the bank card reader terminal are also included in the field of view of the camera (1 camera).

- Surveys the kitchen, facing the dining table (1 camera).

In the opinion of the Authority and in accordance with the legal provisions referred to above, the image transmitted by 3 cameras in the workshop and the image transmitted by 1 camera monitoring the storage room may correspond to the personal and property protection purposes indicated by the Customer. The degree of danger of the work performed in these premises (car repair activity), as well as the high-value assets stored there (cars, tools, etc.) may justify its camera surveillance, if the proportionality of this can be justified by the Client during the balance of interests.

In connection with the camera surveillance of the customer waiting room and the cash register, the client also indicated the purposes of protection of property, as well as the protection of dangerous substances and the protection of business, payment, banking and securities secrets. This is because the cash register, cash register, card reader, computers, as well as the key for storing external hazardous materials are stored here. Based on the position of the Authority, the viewing angle of the camera installed in the customer waiting room is suitable for the employees to check the employees and the customers and customers arriving there through the employee entitled to view the image of the camera. This is because it monitors not only the cash register, card reader workstation and key cabinet, but almost the entire room, including the customer waiting area. Constant monitoring of the latter part of the room is not justified for the protection of property, the protection of hazardous materials and the protection of business and payment secrets. The Authority notes that the protection of banking and securities secrecy indicated by the Client may not arise in connection with the Client's activities, as it is not an undertaking engaged in the activity of a credit institution.

Finally, in connection with the monitoring of the kitchen, the Client stated that there was no work there, only a resting and dining activity, and that the company's cassette was also located here. In connection with the monitoring of this room, the Authority notes that the angle of view of the camera is on the dining table and does not include the referred to cassette. The image transmitted by the camera is therefore not suitable for surveillance for personal and property protection purposes, but the employees' work breaks (meals) take place here. The angle of view of the camera is therefore suitable for unjustified observation of employees while taking breaks between work, but it is not able to fulfill the indicated purpose of protection of property, because the armor cassette does not fall into it.

3) Based on the above, the Authority concludes that the angle of view of the camera installed in the “office-waiting” and “kitchen” premises of the Customer's headquarters is suitable for unreasonable surveillance of employees and is therefore incompatible with the original purpose of personal and property protection. The processing of data through the camera therefore infringes the principle of "purpose limitation" under Article 5 (1) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

In addition, as the visual text of these cameras is not aimed at the assets to be protected, but the image it transmits covers a wider spectrum, thus allowing full surveillance of the premises, the Authority considers that the principle of data protection - Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation ( 1) c) also violates this data processing of the Applicant.

14
 

In view of the above, the Authority requested the Applicant, in the operative part of this decision, to adjust the viewing angles of the cameras installed in the “office-waiting” and “kitchen” premises of its premises in such a way that they are not suitable for unjustified surveillance of employees and only for security purposes.

3. Informing the data subjects about the data management examined

1) In the case of data processing related to camera surveillance at work, it is an essential requirement that employees receive adequate, transparent and easy-to-understand information about data processing. In this connection, the following must be taken into account:

Pursuant to Section 9 (2) of the Mt. Mt. 11 / A. § (1), if the employer also uses technical means to control the employees, he must inform them in writing in advance.

Article 13 (1) to (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation sets out the information to be provided to employees in relation to data processing.

In the case of data processing related to camera surveillance, the system of requirements provided for in the General Data Protection Regulation requires employees to be informed in particular of the following essential circumstances:

- the identity (with the exact name of the legal or natural person) and contact details of the operator of the electronic monitoring system,

- the contact details of the Data Protection Officer, if such a person has been appointed by the controller,

- the location of each camera and its purpose, the area or object they are observing, and whether the employer is making direct or fixed surveillance with that camera,

- the legal basis for data processing,

- the determination of the legitimate interest of the controller,

- the storage period of the recording,

- the range of persons entitled to access the data and the persons and bodies to which the recordings may be forwarded by the employer,

- the rules for reviewing the recordings and the purposes for which the recordings may be used by the employer,

- the rights of employees in relation to the electronic monitoring system and the way in which they can exercise those rights,

- the means of redress available to them in the event of a breach of their right to information, including the possibility of recourse to the Authority.

15
 

With regard to the obligation to provide information, it is also necessary to emphasize that for each camera, the employer must indicate precisely for what purpose the camera was placed in the given area and to which area and equipment the angle of view of the camera is directed. This allows the employer to justify to employees why it is considered necessary to monitor the area. The practice whereby an employer only informs employees in general that they use an electronic monitoring system in the workplace is not acceptable.

Based on the documents provided and sent by the customer at the request of the Authority, the following information regarding the operation of the camera system can be established.

The main findings of the "Surveillance Information System for the Surveillance System" are as follows: The primary purpose of the system is to protect human life, physical integrity, personal liberty, the protection of dangerous goods, the protection of business, payment, banking and securities secrets and property. The application of the system is not intended to influence employee behavior.

Customer has been named as data controller. \[…\] 'S name and contact information are provided.

For a total of six cameras, the data management purposes (which are uniformly property protection) and the monitored area were also marked separately. According to the information, the storage period of the recordings is uniformly three working days, which can be extended to 30 days in extremely justified cases. After the storage time, the recordings are automatically deleted (overwritten). The way the data is stored is electronic.

The person entitled to view the recordings \[…\], which is available in the event of "theft, material damage", only "in the event of an incident". The legal basis for the data processing is only stated in the prospectus that "the lawfulness of the data processing of the system does not require the consent of the monitored persons".

The additional legal acts indicated by the Client in the prospectus (Act LXVI of 1995, Government Decree 335/2005 (XII. 29.), Act CVIII of 2001 and Act C of 2003) are completely irrelevant from the point of view of data management, as they do not contain applicable standards for camera data processing. In any case, the purpose of referring to them has not been indicated in the prospectus, so it is completely unnecessary to list them.

The customer has also forwarded to the Authority a document entitled “Data Management Information” dated 20 May 2019, which, however, does not apply to the camera system, so the Authority will not make any further findings in this regard.

2) In connection with the above, it can be stated that the data management information incorrectly contains the legal basis of the data processing, as it does not clearly indicate it, it only indicates that it is not necessary to obtain the consent of the data subject. Instead, the Client should have indicated Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation, ie the legitimate interest of the controller, as the legal basis for the processing, as set out in Article III / 1 of the Decision. also explained in part. In the case of data processing on the basis of a legitimate interest, it should have referred to the results of the interest balancing test performed, however, according to the Client's statement, it does not have one. In addition, the

16
 

The prospectus, like the data management rules of the system, also identifies completely irrelevant legislation and objectives (see Section III./1 of the Decision for the legal basis and Section III / 2 for the objectives).

In addition to the above, the data management prospectus does not contain information on the rights of employees in relation to the electronic monitoring system and how they can exercise their rights, as well as the possibility to apply to the Authority for the enforcement of their rights.

Article 13 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation stipulates that the controller must make all of the listed information available to the data subject at the time of obtaining the personal data.

In relation to the above, the Authority concludes that the prospectus does not comply with Article 13 (1) to (2) of the General Data Protection Directive due to the following considerations:
- the actual legal basis for the processing (legitimate interest of the controller) has not been indicated,

- the prospectus does not include a balancing test,
- the prospectus refers to legislation that is irrelevant to data management,

- the prospectus also indicates purposes not related to data processing (protection of business, payment, banking and securities secrecy),

- the prospectus does not contain information on the rights of the data subject and the means of redress.

The Client forwarded to the Authority a photograph showing that he had placed a pictorial warning sign at the entrance to the business premises for a call for camera surveillance on 8 May 2021. As an additional requirement in connection with the appropriate information is that the employer is obliged to place an alert about the fact that he uses an electronic monitoring system in the given area9, but the Client did not comply with this until more than two months after the data management started on 5 March 2021. the requirement for adequate information was not met either.

Based on the above, it can be concluded that there was no and at present no adequate information on camera data management for the employees working at the site (a total of 6 people during the period under review) based on the available information.

Based on the above, the Authority found that the Customer had violated Article 13 (1) to (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation and therefore requested that a data protection notice be prepared in accordance with the law.

5. Findings concerning the sanction applied.

The Authority has examined the type of sanction it intends to impose on the Applicant

for the breaches detected and whether a data protection fine is justified. In this context, the Authority complies with Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation and Infotv. 75 / A. §, subject to Infotv. § 61 (5), considered all the relevant circumstances of the case and established that in the event of an infringement discovered during the present proceedings, the Client

9 See European Data Protection Board 3/2019. Guidelines on the processing of personal data by video tools, 28-29. He.
Online: https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb\_guidelines\_201903\_video\_devices\_en.pdf

17
 

warning and summons is not in itself a sufficiently proportionate and dissuasive sanction, so it is appropriate to impose a fine.

In determining the need to impose a fine, the Authority considered the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the infringements as follows:

Aggravating circumstances:

- According to the available data, the infringing camera data processing and insufficient information have existed at the investigated headquarters from 5 March 2021 to the present day. \[Article 83 (2) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation\]

- The Authority became aware of the data processing on the basis of a public interest notification. The public interest notifier has previously indicated to the Client the infringing nature of the data processing, in connection with which the Client has not taken any action. \[Article 83 (2) (h) of the General Data Protection Regulation\]

In setting the amount of the fine, the Authority took into account that

Infringements of principle by the applicant are covered by Article 83 of the General Data Protection Regulation

(5), they constitute an infringement falling within the higher maximum fine category.

Mitigating circumstances:

- The lack of infringing camera surveillance and information only affected a smaller number of persons (a total of 6 employees) with regard to the data processing examined. \[Article 83 (2) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation\]

- At the site, only two cameras ("office waiting room" and "kitchen") can be used for unjustified surveillance of workers. \[Article 83 (2) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation\]

- In the course of the proceedings, the Authority did not receive any information indicating that the persons concerned had suffered any specific inconvenience or damage as a result of the infringement. \[Article 83 (2) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation\]

- There was no circumstance that the Customer was guided by intent in setting the conditions for the data processing in an unlawful manner, so that only negligence can be established on his part \[Article 83 (2) (b) and (d) of the General Data Protection Regulation\]

- The Authority has taken into account that it has not previously established a violation of the processing of personal data against the Client. \[Article 83 (2) (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation\]

Other circumstances considered:

- The Authority also took into account the fact that the Client cooperated in all respects with the Authority in the investigation of the case, although this conduct

18
 

did not go beyond compliance with the obligations - it did not explicitly assess it as an attenuating circumstance. \[Article 83 (2) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation\]

The Authority did not consider Article 83 (2) (c), (g), (i), (j) and (k) of the General Data Protection Regulation to be relevant in deciding on the legal consequences.

In determining the amount of the fine, the Authority took into account that, based on the statement given by the Client at the request of the Authority, in the business year from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021

It had net sales of HUF \[…\], ie HUF \[…\]. In setting the fine, the Authority took into account the business year 2021 in view of the duration of the infringement. Based on the above, the amount of the fine imposed is proportionate to the gravity of the infringement and cannot be considered excessive.

The Authority shall inform Infotv. Pursuant to Section 61 (2) (c), it ordered the disclosure of the decision by concealing the Customer's identification data, as it does not affect a wide range of persons.
