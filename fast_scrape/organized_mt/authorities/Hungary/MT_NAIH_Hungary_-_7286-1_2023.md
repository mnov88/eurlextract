## English Summary

### Facts

On 07 April 2022, the data subject received an e-mail from a recruiter, the controller, mentioning the data subject’s standout resume among job seekers’ profiles. It was unclear to the data subject how the controller obtained access to his contact information as he never disclosed it on the jobseeker’ website which is generally used by the recruiters to directly contact the candidates. Therefore, data subject asked the controller for an explanation based on [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"). Despite reminders, no response was received.

The data subject requested the DPA to investigate the controller’s conduct and compel them to respond. Additionally, the data subject requested to investigate the relationship between the website operator and the recruiter and whether a joint liability could be established.

The controller declared to the DPA that they were registered on the jobseekers’ website as an independent data controller to carry out recruitment activities. Additionally, the data subject provided his consent to be contacted for recruitment purposes on the website. The controller had access to the data subject's e-mail address as a subscriber to the website.

The controller attributed the lack of response to the data subject's request to an administrative error, specifically, the misspelling of their email address in the response sent on 17 May 2022. This oversight came to light subsequent to the order from the DPA to address the allegations.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller’s argument did not relieve them of their liability as a controller under [Article 4(7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#7 "Article 4 GDPR"). The DPA highlighted that the most important characteristic of a controller is that they have substantive decision-making power and responsibility for compliance with all the obligations of the processing laid down in the GDPR.

Despite the fact that controller intended to comply with the data subject’s access request under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"), the DPA observed that this provision was violated. The controller sent the reply on 12 May 2022, which exceeds the one-month deadline (on 7 May 2022) under [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR").

Concerning the website operator, the DPA rejected the argument that the latter qualified as a controller in this case, as the recruiter organised the process and created the conditions for the data processing. The website owner declared that each undertaking which they enter into a framework agreement carries out recruitment activities independently and is, therefore, an independent data controller. Based on that, the DPA rejected a claim against the website operator.

For the reasons set out above, the DPA found that the controller infringed [Article 15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1 "Article 15 GDPR") and ordered them to comply with the data subject’s access request.

ARC. Decision:

IV.1. Personal data of the Applicant, quality of data management

(27) According to Article 4, Point 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the contact details of the Applicant,
    surname, first name, e-mail address are the personal data of the Applicant,
    the storage of which data is in accordance with Article 4, Point 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation
    is considered data management.

(28) The Respondents declared to the Authority that Respondent 2 is the data controller

    determines its purpose and means independently, therefore it is an independent data controller, since it was taken over from \[…\]
    personal data of job seekers, including the management of the Applicant's personal data
    has independent decision-making authority.

(29) Due to the above, Respondent 2, as a data controller, was obliged to respond to the Applicant's data subject request
    fulfill and provide information to him in connection with the data subject's request.

(30) The subject of the present proceedings was only the examination of whether the Applicant is a personal person
    data subject's request to those written in the general data protection regulation
    has been properly fulfilled, i.e. the Authority's handling of the Applicant's personal data,
    did not examine the data management conditions of their receipt from \[…\].

IV.2. Completing an access request and the related obligation to provide information

(31) The data subject's right of access is regulated by Article 15 of the GDPR. Based on this, the data subject is entitled
      to receive feedback on the data management that it is personal
      whether your data is being processed, and if such data processing is underway, you are entitled
      to receive information about the purpose of data management, the personal data concerned
      categories, the recipients to whom your personal data was (will be) disclosed, a
      the duration of their storage, the source of the data, the exercise of the data subject's rights, and a
      On the right to appeal to the authorities.

(32) On April 7, 2022, the Applicant turned to Respondent 2 with its access request. THE
      Respondent 2 as detailed in paragraph (14) only of the order of the Authority
      after receiving it, he noticed that this did not happen due to an administrative error.

(33) Pursuant to Article 12 (3) of the GDPR, the Respondent 2 from the receipt of the request
      should have informed the Applicant about the access within one month

      regarding your request. Based on this, the access letter sent to Respondent 2 by the Applicant
      the one-month deadline for responding to your request was May 7, 2022
      down, so Respondent 2 should have informed the Applicant by this deadline. THE
      However, Respondent 2 failed to inform the Applicant within this deadline,
      According to his statement sent to the authorities, the reason for this was an administrative error. His statement
      according to the attached e-mail copy, the Applicant's e-mail address was typed,
      so that was the reason why he did not receive Respondent 2's reply letter. The buckled

      according to a copy, on May 12, 2022, i.e. the Applicant's reminder e-mail (in which again
      requested access, on the other hand, he claimed that he would turn to the Authority if they did not comply
      the request) would have sent the response of the Respondent 2, so Article 12 (3) of the GDPR
      exceeding the one-month deadline according to paragraph

(34) Respondent 2 claimed that due to an administrative error, he did not answer a
      At the request of the applicant's stakeholders. According to this, it was unintentional behavior that caused Respondent 2 not to fulfill the stakeholder request at all. According to the position of the Authority
      this argument does not exempt Respondent 2 from data controller responsibility, given

      to the fact that, pursuant to Article 4, point 7 of the GDPR, Respondent 2 is considered a data controller. THE
      Respondent 2 is the one who organizes and develops the data management process
      circumstances. The most important feature of the data controller is that it is a substantive decision-maker
      has authority and is responsible for all data management, the general
      for fulfilling the obligation stipulated in the data protection decree. Because of the above, the Authority
      found that Respondent 2 violated Article 15 (1) of the GDPR.

(35) The European Data Protection Board on the concept of data processor and data controller according to the GDPR
      07/2020 (hereinafter: Guideline)
      according to "Sometimes companies and public bodies appoint a separate person for data management
      to carry out an activity. Even though sometimes a specific natural
      a person is appointed to ensure compliance with data protection rules,
      this person will not be a data controller, but for that legal entity (or company
      public law body) acts on its behalf, which is the data controller in case of violation of the rules

      is ultimately responsible for its quality. In the same way, even if you are a specific class
      organizational unit is operative with regard to certain data management activities
      is also responsible for ensuring compliance, this does not mean that it is
      department or unit will be the data controller (rather than the organization as a whole).” The Guidelines
      In addition, his summary notes in this regard that "As a general rule, there is none
      restriction on the type of organization that can fulfill the role of data controller,
      however, in practice it is usually the organization itself, rather than those within the organization

      a person (such as a CEO, employee, or board member) that
      act as a data controller."

(36) Based on all of this, the violation related to the case is also the Respondent 2, as a data controller
      falls under his responsibility. Article 25 of the GDPR requires that the controller is the controller
      implement appropriate technical and organizational measures throughout its entire process
      to ensure that you respond to data subject requests in a timely manner

      be fulfilled.

ARC. 3. Request related to obliging the Respondent to fulfill 2 stakeholder requests

(37) Considering that the Respondent 2 established in paragraph (34) of this decision
      did not comply with the Applicant's access request, therefore the Authority approved the
      Petitioner's request and obliged Respondent 2 to comply with it.

IV.4. Request related to obliging Respondent 1 to fulfill the stakeholder request

(38) Since Respondent 1 was not qualified for the data management complained about in the application
      decision IV.1. because of what was written in point, namely with the examined data management
      in this context, the Applicant 2 is qualified as a data controller, therefore the Authority is the Applicant
      He rejected his request for Respondent 1.

IV.5. Legal consequences

(39) The Authority convicts Respondent 2 on the basis of GDPR Article 58 (2) point b),
      because it violated Article 15 (1) of the GDPR.

(40) In accordance with Article 58 (2) point d) of the GDPR, the Authority ordered that the

      Respondent 2 fulfill the Requester's access request.

(41) The Authority exceeded Infotv. administrative deadline according to § 60/A. (1), therefore
      HUF 10,000, i.e. ten thousand forints, is due to the Applicant - according to his choice - to a bank account
      by money order or postal order Based on point b) of paragraph (1) of § 51.V. Other questions:

(42) The competence of the Authority is defined by Infotv. Paragraphs (2) and (2a) of § 38 define it, and its competence is
    covers the entire territory of the country.

(43) The decision in Art. 80-81 § and Infotv. It is based on paragraph (1) of § 61. The decision is
    Acr. Based on § 82, paragraph (1), it becomes final upon its publication. The Akr. § 112 and § 116
    (1) and on the basis of § 114, paragraph (1) administrative against the decision
