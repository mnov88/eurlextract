## English Summary

### Facts

The controller (a construction company), was doing construction and installation works at the data subject’s house.

During the repair work at the data subject's home, an employee of the controller made a voice recording on his phone. without informing the data subject beforehand. The data subject contacted the controller about the recording and was informed that the worksheet – what is filled and signed detailing the work done at the location –contained information about the voice recording.

The data subject later requested the worksheet and the name and contact details of the controller’s DPO, but received no reply.

Therefore, the data subject filed a complaint with the Hungarian DPA, concerning the voice recording made at his residence without his knowledge. The data subject also indicated that there was no information on the controller’s website about audio recording.

During the investigation, the controller stated that the audio recording was made on a case-by-case basis, decided by the managing director. The purpose is to protect the interests of the customers, especially the elderly, also to hold employees accountable for the proper information provided. The controller indicated the legal basis for the processing under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent of the data subject) and Article 6(1)(d) GDPR (vital interests of the data subject or other natural person). According to the controller, no audio recording was made of the data subject. The controller stated that the purpose of making the occasional audio recording was to properly document what was said at the installation site during the installation work. In some cases, the clients –claimed afterwards that they had not been properly informed about, the details of the installation. despite that this information was recorded in the worksheet. In view of this, the controller decided that in individual cases the installing employee should make an audio recording of what was said during the installation.

### Holding

In the DPA's view, Article 5 GDPR sets out the main principles that must be considered when processing personal data and that must be consistently applied in the processing. It follows from the accountability requirement of Article 5(2) GDPR that the controller is responsible for compliance with the data protection principles and must be able to demonstrate such compliance. On this basis, the controller must document and record the processing in such a way that its lawfulness can be demonstrated. The principle of purpose limitation under Article 5(1)(b) GDPR implies that personal data may only be processed for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes.

The DPA also stated that the audio recordings may be suitable to achieve the objectives stated by the controller, but they are also achievable by a worksheet mutually signed by the controller and the client. On this basis, it is not necessary to make an audio recording as there are other ways to achieve the objectives. Moreover, it is not proportionate to record what is said during the installation work, given the unpredictable length of the installation and the content of the conversation. Some unrelated piece of personal information may be recorded as well. The recording is also a tool to monitor employees without proper legal basis.

The DPA also found the breach of the purpose limitation and data minimization principles, as the controller did not carry out an interest test and therefore breached Article 6(1) GDPR.

Article 13(1) GDPR and Article 13(2) GDPR set out the processing circumstances and information that the controller must provide to data subjects. The GDPR does not specify the form of the provided information, but the DPA recommends the written form in line with the principle of accountability. According to the controller’s statement, on the occasion of the two audio recordings, the information was provided orally and the worksheet also contained a short piece of written information. The DPA however concluded that the worksheet did not contain any information on the processing of the data, which constituted a breach of Article 13(1) GDPR and Article 13(2) GDPR.

In overall, the DPA held that the information provided to the data subject by the controller was not sufficient and suggested that the audio recording was not necessary for the purposes. By taking the principle of data minimization into account, a signed worksheet is sufficient in the matter.

laptop in mode that is password protected and known only to the executive.

On the basis of the Customer's statement, before the audio recording is made, orally and in writing
they inform the affected parties, as well as inform them that they have the right to do so at any time

When asked why they did not respond to the whistleblower's electronic inquiry, that is
The customer stated that he did not receive a letter from the whistleblower at his e-mail address.

At the same time, the Authority will consider the whistleblower's individual complaint - including the one sent by him

non-response to electronic inquiries and requests for worksheets - the NAIH-
3853/2021. investigated in the investigation procedure started under no. Therefore, the present procedure is individual
not the subject of a complaint.

The Authority is Infotv. In view of Section 71 (2) in this official data protection procedure
was used as evidence by the preceding NAIH-3853/2021. investigation procedure was initiated

called, and also CL of 2016 on general public administrative order. law (a
hereinafter: Ákr.) based on § 108, paragraph (1), ordered by the Customer in NAIH-3853/2021.
stored on a laptop in offline mode referred to in the investigation procedure started at no
reservation of audio recordings.

The reason for the seizure was that if the audio recordings stored by the Customer were to be deleted

would avoid receiving an order ordering the initiation of data protection official proceedings
after, this would endanger the success of clarifying the facts.

2. The Customer appointed a legal representative in the data protection official procedure.

In its letter dated December 16, 2021, the Customer stated that the Authority
after your inquiry sent in the investigation procedure, the investigation and the present

its data management practices affected by official data protection proceedings, and thereafter
stopped the recording of audio recordings during installation work. According to his statement
at the same time, before the termination, audio recordings were made twice
which recordings were also deleted during the review. 4

According to his statement, 31 people worked for the Customer at that time, of which 15 were mechanics. Every month

on average, 140-150 installation jobs take place. The Customer's goal in making the audio recording is
was to properly document it during the installation work at the installation site
what was said. In many cases, his clients – in most cases elderly people –
afterwards they claimed that they did not receive adequate information, for example, about the installation or that
about the cost of materials, the duration of the work, or not how they remembered it
actually said. Even though this information is also recorded on the worksheet
cost, some of the customers questioned the on-site mechanic

the veracity of your information. In view of this, the Customer decided that in individual cases a
have the installer make an audio recording of what was said during the installation, in an appropriate way
can prove that the information has been provided or, where applicable, can hold the
employee, should the customer's complaint prove to be true. In both cases, when
recording was made, based on all the circumstances of the situation (such as the inquiry and the on-site
method of consultation prior to work, the nature of the work, the person using the service
estimated age, the mechanic's proposal and request for recording after the start of the work

about its necessity) the manager considered the necessity of making the audio recording.

At the request of the Authority, the Customer sends on electronic media all the, a
recorded audio recording to the Authority upon receipt of the order, the Customer stated that
due to the previous deletion of the two audio recordings, he cannot fulfill this request.

According to the Customer's statement, it was also presented in the previous investigation procedure

in the statement, he incorrectly indicated the legal basis for data management, and not general data protection
wanted to refer to point d) of Article 6 (1) of the Decree, but to point f) because
in his opinion, according to what was previously presented, they were said during the installation work
had a legitimate interest in its recording.

for its clarification order, the Customer stated in its letter dated February 28, 2022 that

in the two cases where he made audio recordings, he considered them before recording them
the possibilities that may be suitable for the realization of the goal he wants to achieve, and
deemed that the data processing related to the recording of the audio was lawful
legal and official requirements for interest-based data management.
However, he did not prepare a balance of interests test before starting data management.

According to the Customer's statement, he had previously marked it incorrectly on the worksheet

the legal basis for data processing, and not the consent of the data subject, is considered appropriate for data processing
its legal basis, but its legitimate interest.

According to the Customer's statement, the recording was regulated in the following way
its procedure, it did not have any other internal regulations in this connection:

"Regulation:

    - audio recording is made based on executive decision
    - the manager instructs the employee

    - recording can only be made by the employee entrusted with it, by the manager
        at a specified time and in a specified quantity

    - the manager transfers the recording to a laptop and deletes it from the audio recording device
    - at the end of the warranty period, which is six months, the manager deletes the recording from the laptop."

Furthermore, according to the Customer's statement, "during the making of the two audio recordings a
information was given verbally at the site of the installation work, or in writing on the worksheet 5

short information was also included - although unfortunately not in an adequate way - about recording
about the possibility."

The brief information on the worksheet is as follows: "I also agree that on site
the mechanics should make sound, picture and video recordings in connection with the works."

During the review of the data management, the Customer came to the conclusion that the information was not adequate
its form and content, and, among other things, terminated the examined practice with regard to this.

Regarding the seizure, the Customer stated that it had already been ordered by the Authority
at the time of the seizure, it did not store any audio recording that was the subject of the investigation
would have been recorded in connection with data management. There have been two such recordings before
was prepared, however, they were already during the previous investigation procedure of the Authority, on June 15, 2021
deleted it after my request, as no legitimate purpose justified the
further preservation of recordings. Dated 26 November 2021 by the Authority, NAIH-8701-
1/2021. at the time of receipt of his order with file number, none was available

nor audio recording, therefore the Customer could not fulfill his obligation to reserve.

the recordings were not stored on the device, and the exact time of deletion was not recorded.

4. The documents of the investigation procedure available to the Authority also contain the following

ARC. Decision

Based on the definitions of the General Data Protection Regulation, the natural person
voice, as well as the audio recording of the data subject's personal data, on the personal data
and any operation performed is considered data management.

IV.1. Purpose and necessity of data management

Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation contains the main principles that a
must be taken into account when handling personal data, and which are constantly
must apply during data management. Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation

pursuant to the requirement of accountability according to para
for compliance with data protection principles and must be able to comply
for verification. Based on this, the data controller is obliged to document and record the
data management, so that its legality can be proven afterwards.

Purpose-bound according to Article 5(1)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation
following the principle of data management, the management of personal data is only defined and clear

and may be done for a legitimate purpose.

According to the Customer's statements, by making the audio recording, on the one hand, the interests of the customers are protected,
furthermore, the aim was to properly document the installation work during the installation
said on the spot, as in many cases the typically elderly customers do so afterwards
they claimed that they did not receive adequate information about, for example, installation or materials
about the cost, the duration of the work, or they did not remember it as it really was

was said. Even though this information is also recorded on the worksheet, it is
some customers questioned the information provided by the on-site mechanic
its authenticity. According to the Customer's opinion, based on the audio recordings, the Customer knows in an appropriate way
prove that the information has been given, or, where appropriate, can hold the
employee, should the customer's complaint prove to be true.

According to the Authority's point of view, audio recordings may be suitable for the purposes referred to

to achieve, however, these goals can be replaced by the one completed by the mechanic and by the mechanic and the customer
jointly signed worksheet, a copy of which is also provided to the client,
thus confirming that both parties recognize what happened during the installation as real. Based on this
making a voice recording is not necessary, as there is another way to achieve the goals. Besides
it is not even proportionate to record what was said during the installation work,
taking into account the length of the installation work that cannot be determined in advance, and the fact that in advance
it is also not possible to determine the content of the conversation, that is given

in this case, information may be recorded that is completely unrelated to the purpose of data management
they are independent. In addition, in relation to the referred data management purpose, it can be established that
it actually also means checking the employees.

Section 52. (1) point c) of the Labor Code stipulates that the employee is obliged to perform his work in the
to perform according to the rules, regulations, instructions and customs applicable to his work, and Mt.
11/A. On the basis of § (1), the employer may also check the employee a

in connection with your employment relationship, even with a technical device, but this is not necessary,
the recording and storage of another person's voice and what is said is disproportionate, a
according to the Authority's point of view, it cannot be reconciled with the referred data management purpose. 11

According to the statements submitted by the Client, this only happened in two cases in practice
audio recording, and according to the Witness' testimony, he never once received instructions to do so

from his employer to make audio recordings of work, and he was unaware that
that there is such practice at the employer.

However, in addition to the two specific cases, the content of the worksheet, according to which the affected person is one
contributes to the fact that the installers on site provide audio, video and
to make a video recording, supports that this data management was a common practice.

The same follows from the text of the regulation cited by the Client, according to which "executives
a sound recording is made based on a decision
    - the manager instructs the employee

    - recording can only be made by the employee entrusted with it, by the manager
        at a specified time and in a specified quantity

    - the manager transfers the recording to a laptop and deletes it from the audio recording device

    - at the end of the warranty period, which is six months, the manager deletes the recording from the laptop."

In addition to all of this, the Customer himself acknowledged NAIH-3853/2021. investigation started
in the procedure that audio recordings are made on a random basis based on the executive's decision,
and then according to the statement submitted in the data protection official procedure - to the procedure of the Authority
- reviewed its data management practice and decided to terminate it,
since, in his opinion, it does not meet the goal it wants to achieve, and it also did not fully comply

in full compliance with the applicable data protection legislation and official requirements. That's why it is
According to the customer's statement, he is investigating the possibilities in any way he can
effectively, but in accordance with the applicable legal provisions and the affected parties
to fully respect your right to the protection of personal data
the goal he wants to achieve.

Compared to these statements of the Client, the Witness stated differently that

was not aware that the Customer was conducting data management practices in accordance with the present case, no
means that other employees besides him (a total of 31 people worked for the Client,
of which 15 were mechanics) would not have been instructed to make an audio recording. Itself
the Customer as a data controller has acknowledged the implementation of the data management practice. At the same time,
in the stage of the official procedure, he knew of only two specific cases, the making of audio recordings
away.

The Authority, because of all this, and also because according to the worksheet "works
the making of sound, image and video recordings in connection" is not clear from the wording
the exact purpose of the data management, through which the information about the data management
appropriate, establishes that the Customer is not clear, not for a specifically defined purpose
recorded the voices of customers during installation work, thereby violating the general
Article 5 (1) point b) of the Data Protection Regulation.

The Authority also establishes Article 5 (1) paragraph c) of the General Data Protection Regulation
also the principle of data saving according to point, considering that the voice of the employees a
its recording is not necessarily necessary due to the reasons explained above to verify that it is indeed
whether the necessary information about the work was given to the clients or not. 12

IV.2. The legal basis of data management and the principle of accountability

1. An additional requirement for the legality of data management is that the data management is general
it may be referred to a legal basis according to Article 6 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation
beer.

The Client uses NAIH-3853/2021 as the legal basis for data management. investigation started
referred to in the procedure according to Article 6 (1) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation
the legal basis of consent and his vital interest according to point d) of Article 6, paragraph 1,

however, in the official data protection procedure, he clarified what the Customer submitted and
according to his statement, the legal basis for data management is Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
legitimate interest according to point f) of paragraph The Authority therefore belongs to the legal basis of the legitimate interest
checked compliance.

The legal basis of legitimate interest can be legally invoked if the data controller is the data controller
- or a third party - is necessary to assert its legitimate interest, unless such is the case

the interests or fundamental rights of the data subject take precedence over interests and
freedoms.

The legitimate interest must really exist and actually exist (that is, it cannot be fictitious
or assumed). According to Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
in view of the principle of accountability, it is recommended that the data controller record them in writing
cases that establish your legitimate interest. The facts recorded in writing are convincing

they can serve as evidence of the existence of a legitimate interest. The legitimate interest
its existence and the need for data management must be re-evaluated at regular intervals.

It is essential that the data controller has an interest assessment to refer to the legal basis of the legitimate interest
must finish. Carrying out the interest assessment involves a multi-step process, which
During
interest of the data subject, affected fundamental right, and finally based on the weighting, it must be determined,

whether personal data can be processed. If as a result of the consideration of interests
it can be established that the legitimate interest of the data controller precedes the personal data of the data subjects
your right to protection, data processing can be continued on this legal basis.

It is due to the applicable legal provisions and the principle of accountability
the data controller must prove that the data management it carries out is compatible with
with the principle of purpose-bound data management and the outcome of the interest assessment, the data controller is justified

resulted in the primacy of his interest.

According to the Customer's statements, in the two cases when the Customer made a voice recording,
before recording, he considered the options that are the goal he wants to achieve
they may be suitable for implementation, and he considered that by making the audio recording
related data management corresponds to the data management based on legitimate interest
legal and official requirements. However, he did not prepare a balance of interests test

before the start of data management.

The Authority, taking into account the present decision IV.1. to the point in which he established the goal
the violation of the principle of bound data management and data saving, it also states that -
regardless of whether the Customer did not carry out an interest assessment - legitimate purpose and interest,
and, in the absence of unnecessary data processing, on the legal basis of legitimate interest - and other legal basis -
nor could the Client legally base its data management, and as a result, it violated it

Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

2. Regarding the lack of consideration of interests, the Authority draws attention to the fact that
based on the principle of accountability according to Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation 13

during the entire process of data management, the data controller must implement this
data management operations to enable compliance with data protection rules

to prove it. The principle of accountability, so not only in general, at the process level
can be interpreted, all specific data management activities, a specific stakeholder
also applies to the management of your personal data.

The data controller is responsible for the legality of the data management it carries out. General data protection
due to the nature of the legal basis according to Article 6 (1) point f) of the Decree
a data controller that refers to this legal basis must be able to accurately indicate that a

the processing of specific personal data is based on the legitimate interest of the data controller, and on this
in view of the interest, why data management is necessary, and at the same time be able to verify and prove it
it must take precedence over the legitimate interest of the data subject for the protection of personal data
against his right.

In this case, the legal basis indicated as the legal basis for data management and the data management based on it
before the start of practice, the need for data management is in the interests of the affected parties

in the absence of a verifiable, written comparison, the Customer has violated the general
accountability defined in Article 5 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation is a basic principle
requirement as well.

IV.3. Information on data management

An additional requirement of legal data management is that the data subjects are appropriate, transparent and
receive easily understandable information about data management. About that, it is
the following must be taken into account:

Paragraphs (1)-(2) of Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation define them
data management conditions, information about which the data controller must inform
those concerned. The form of information is not defined by the General Data Protection Regulation,

however, the Authority recommends the written form for the reason that - accountability
following from its principle - the data controller must prove and justify the - preliminary -
the occurrence of information.

According to the Customer's statement, "at the time of making the two audio recordings, the information a
it was spoken orally at the site of the installation work, and it was also written on the worksheet
brief information - although unfortunately not in an appropriate way - about the possibility of recording."

The brief information on the worksheet is as follows: "I also agree that on site
the mechanics should make sound, picture and video recordings in connection with the works."

In relation to this information, it can be stated that it does not contain data management
no information with which the Customer has violated Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
(1)-(2) of Article

Regarding the possible verbal information, the Authority notes that it is general
Article 5 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation expressly places the burden of proof on the data controller
also determines whether the data subject has been adequately informed. The
the general data protection regulation does not exclude the possibility of verbal information, however
in the event of a conflicting statement by the concerned party, in the absence of adequate provability, the doubtful situation
the Authority as a general rule based on Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation

evaluates it at the expense of the data controller. 14

IV.4. Cancellation of reservation

The Authority dated November 26, 2021, NAIH-8701-1/2021. in the order with file no
the Akr. Ordered on the basis of Section 108 (1) of the offline mode referred to by the Customer
seizure of audio recordings stored on a laptop.

The reason for the seizure was that if the audio recordings stored by the Customer were to be deleted
would avoid receiving an order ordering the initiation of data protection official proceedings
after, this would endanger the success of clarifying the facts.

In relation to the seizure, the Customer stated that the Customer has already been ordered by the Authority
at the time of the ordered seizure, he did not store any audio recordings that were the ones under investigation
would have been recorded in connection with data management. There have been two such recordings before
was prepared, however, they were already during the previous investigation procedure of the Authority, on June 15, 2021
it was canceled by the Customer after his inquiry dated 1st, as it was not justified by any legitimate purpose
further preservation of recordings. Therefore, the Authority dated November 26, 2021, NAIH-870-

1/2021. at the time of receipt of his order with file number, none was available
nor audio recording, therefore the Customer could not fulfill his obligation to reserve.
The manager irretrievably deleted the audio recordings in question from his own laptop, etc
the Customer did not store the recordings on the device, and the Customer does not know the exact time of deletion
recorded it.

The reason for the seizure was thereby eliminated, and since the Authority made a decision on the merits of the case,

the Authority is the Akr. On the basis of point a) of § 109, paragraph (1), the seizure is terminated.

V. Legal Consequences

1. The Authority is the IV of this decision. based on what is written in point of the general data protection regulation
Article 58 (2) point b) states that the Customer has violated the general data protection

Article 5(1)(b) and (c), Article 6, Article 5(2) and the
Paragraphs (1)-(2) of Article 13.

Given that the Customer has terminated the objectionable data management practice, the Authority
does not oblige the Customer to take action.

2. The Authority also examined whether a data protection fine against the Customer was justified

imposition. In this context, the Authority is in accordance with Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation and
the Infotv. 75/A. based on §, considered all the circumstances of the case and established that a
in the case of violations discovered during this procedure, the warning is neither proportionate nor not
is a deterrent sanction, therefore a fine must be imposed.

When determining the amount of the fine, the Authority first of all took into account that
the violation committed by the Customer is Article 83 (5) b) of the General Data Protection Regulation

according to point 1, it is classified as a violation belonging to the category of higher fines.

The Authority also took into account that data management with the Customer is hierarchical
also affected employees in a relationship \[General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2)
paragraph point k)\], and that the personal data affected by the violation are the voice of the persons concerned
does not belong to the special category of personal data \[general data protection decree 83.
Article (2) point (g)\].

The Authority as an aggravating circumstance when determining the amount of the data protection fine
took into account that 15

    - the Customer violated several provisions of the general data protection regulation
       \[general data protection regulation Article 83 (2) point a)\];

    - the violations committed by the Customer result from gross negligence, since it
       It did not even occur to the customer what the data management practices used by him were
       has implications for the privacy of its employees and customers \[general

       Article 83 (2) point b) of the Data Protection Regulation\].

The Authority as a mitigating circumstance when determining the amount of the data protection fine
took into account that

    - the Client following the inquiry sent by the Authority in the investigation procedure of the Authority
        reviewed by the investigation or the person concerned by this data protection authority procedure
        data management, and subsequently stopped the recording of audio recordings in the installation
        in the course of works, as a result of the Authority's procedures, the Client decided that
        terminates the practice it also classifies as illegal \[general data protection
        Regulation Article 83 (2) points d) and f)\];

    - to condemn the Customer for violating the general data protection regulation
        did not take place \[General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point e)\];

    - the Authority exceeded the administrative deadline \[General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2)
       paragraph (k)\].

When determining the data protection fine imposed on the Customer, the Authority does not
considered relevant Article 83 (2) c), h), i) and j) of the General Data Protection Regulation

circumstances according to point, as they cannot be interpreted in relation to the specific case.

The net sales revenue of the Customer in 2021 was HUF 130 million, so the
the imposed data protection fine is far from the maximum fine that can be imposed.
