## English Summary

### Facts

The Applicant sent the 7th January 2022 a letter to the Controller, attaching the copy of an e-mail sent the 5th January, asking for information about the handling of his personal data. Although the Controller received the letter the 10th January according to the postal receipt, it did not respond to it. The Applicant complained and asked the Authority to start official proceedings against the Controller and also asked the Authority to levy a fine. Applicant asked information about the handling of his personal data, the documents related to his name, their registration data, the erasure of data, the date and reason of erasure as well as about transmission of his personal data to third persons. Additionally, he enquired about e-mails received to the official e-mail address of the priest serving at the Controller their attachments and about the e-mails forwarded to third persons. He also asked for a date for consultation and confession. According to the Controller, it did never collect or process any personal data of the Applicant. The Applicant went to the Church of the Controller and harassed one of the curates there. A private discussion was held between the Applicant and the vicar of the Controller about this. According to the Controller, the personal data related to this discussion are not subject to the GDPR. Controller declared that it processes in its e-mail box the name, assumed address, assumed phone number and assumed e-mail address of the Applicant, which are part of this complaint by the Applicant. The legal basis is the legitimate interest to respond to the complaint. According to the Controller, the purpose of the Applicant with his letter (incorrectly indicated as being dated the 7th January but dated the 5th January) only wanted to enter into contact with the Controller. The e-mail dated the 31st July 2022 submitted by the Controller to prove that was not written by the Applicant according to him, as it was not sent from his e-mail address and thus he submitted a claim to the police alleging an unknown offender. The Controller stated that it did receive only one letter, the one dated the 5th January it did not, and the letter received did not aim access to personal data but only information about the registration number of the e-mail, the response deadline and a data protection notice. Given that the Controller considered itself being continuously harassed, it did not respond based on Article 13 (4) GDPR. The data protection notice could only refer to data provided by the Applicant himself and thus the request did not contain an access request. Controller has a procedure to handle data subject requests and registers them in an Excel file. This file did not contain the request of the Applicant due to the above considerations. Additionally, the Applicant remonstrated that during correspondence about a parish camp the Controller put the recipients into copy instead of blind copy and thus his e-mail address became known to other recipients without his consent. This complaint is subject of another procedure (not yet closed). The Controller did not respond to the questions of the Authority delivered the 3rd June and responded with a delay of 7 days compared to the deadline of the repeated call to clarify the facts. A further enquiry of the Authority was responded to in time. After several insights into the file, the Authority finished the establishment of the facts the 18th November. According to these, the Applicant registered to a camp through a Google form and to the closing mess of the Eucharist Congress and the Applicant and the Controller exchanged e-mails concerning the camp.

### Holding

The Authority considers that the Controller processed personal data in the correspondence and the Google form of the Applicant. The Authority assumes based on the duty of good and faithful co-operation (which has to be assumed of the parties according to the procedural rules of sate administration), that the two letters were sent by the Applicant if the Applicant states so. Therefore Controller was obliged to respond to the request of the Applicant as data subject. If the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, the burden of proof is on the Controller. Thus, Controller infringed Article 12 (3) by not responding to the Applicant. The Controller is obliged to provide to the data subjects the information included in Article 15 (1) GDPR. The request of the Applicant to apply a fine is rejected as the fine does not directly concern a right or legitimate interest of the Applicant and has no legal consequences related to him. Therefore this cannot be requested by the data subject and this part of the complaint cannot be considered an official demand. As the deadline for completing the procedure was exceeded, the Authority pays HUF 10000 (about EUR 25) to the Applicant.

## Comment

The Authority sided with the complaining data subject (the Applicant) in that the Controller received the access request and was not entitled to ignore it. The Controller tried to deny its responsibility and also answered only on the second request of the Authio. A fine was, however, not levied.

      An online Google document created by the applicant, on which he could submit his application for the camp

      you must have provided the information requested on the application form.

(25) According to the Applicant's statement, the International Eucharistic was also registered
      For the closing mass of the Congress, with the participation of the Applicant in his group.

(26) The Applicant also attached the "application for adult catechesis" dated January 7, 2022
      a photo taken of his postal letter with the subject "data management information request", in which the
      You requested information from the applicant about the personal data it manages, which can be linked to your name
      documents, the date of recording of the data and documents, the deletion in case of deletion
      date and reason, as well as which personal data was transferred to a third party
      for publication and transmission. The Applicant also requested information in the case of e-mails a

      It was sent to the official e-mail address of the priests serving with the Respondent and from there to the Applicant
      sent letters, their attachments, and which e-mails were sent to a third party
      for transmission to. Personal data released to a third party, e-mail,
      in the case of a document, he requested the name of the third party and the indication of the legal title of the edition
      too. He also asked in his letter dated January 5, 2022 with the subject "date agreement"
      answer as well.

(27) A photo of the Applicant's letter dated January 5, 2022 with the subject "date agreement"
      also sent it to the Authority. In this letter, the Applicant requested an appointment from the Application
      for confession and personal consultation. Furthermore, in this letter, he also indicated that
      had already addressed this kind of request to the Respondent via e-mail, however
      based on that, the appointment was not successful. The Applicant also requested this in this letter
      information about the e-mail you sent earlier, for the purpose of arranging an appointment
      registered with the file number and date, requested information about the response deadline and

      about data protection information.

(28) The Applicant's letter dated both January 5, 2022 and January 7, 2022 in one envelope,
      sent to the Applicant by post, the receipt confirming the delivery of the letters
      according to his testimony, the envelope was delivered to the Applicant on January 10, 2022.

(29) According to his statement, the Respondent never provided any personal data from the Applicant

      requested or required. The Applicant is not a member of the Applicant's parish community, he is a church member
      does not pay tax. The Applicant attended the Respondent's church at the same time, his relationship with
      It originates from here with a request, however, the Respondent did not record anything during this process either
      personal data about the Applicant.

(30) According to the Applicant's statement, during his visits to the church, the Applicant
      he met one of his former priests (chaplains), with whom he came into "conflict", as a

      The applicant continuously harassed the chaplain. The Applicant from conflict and contact
      following his conscious seclusion, he turned to the Parish Priest of the Applicant. The Applicant
      his discussion with the parish priest took place as a personal conversation, the subject of the conversation was
      It was a conversation independent of the activity of the respondent as a data controller, during which 5

      and personal data that may have been disclosed within the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation
      are excluded, based on Article 2 (2) point c) thereof. Based on the foregoing, the Respondent's position

      according to the parish priest, since data processing is for "household purposes" there is no legal basis for data processing,
      nor did it have to have a purpose, considering that the vicar acted as a private person
      during conversations.

(31) According to the Respondent's statement, the Applicant's name, assumed
      address, assumed phone number and e-mail address, which are provided by the Applicant
      are part of the inquiry. The request that the Requested made available to the Authority

      issued, was subsequently sent by the Applicant to the Respondent,
      that the parish priest had already personally indicated to the Applicant to please the chaplain
      stop bullying. In other respects, the Respondent sought to be with the Applicant
      to break contact in order to avoid continuous harassment. On this - a
      According to the respondent's point of view, the purpose of processing personal data is assumed
      substantiation of the provability of allegations in the procedure, and its legal basis is the general one
      point f) of Article 6 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, i.e. the Respondent as a data controller

      legitimate interest in connection with the fact that his claims in this official procedure are true
      be accepted.

(32) For the same purpose and legal basis, the Respondent handles the Applicant on July 31, 2022
      personal data included in the e-mail message you sent - and attached to the Authority. THE
      According to the Respondent's statement, the Applicant's email sent on July 31, 2022
      it is clear from his message that both the Applicant and the chaplain tried several times

      to sever contact with the Applicant. According to the Respondent's statement, it is also
      it is clear from the message that the Applicant is in violation of the 2012
      has committed harassment capable of establishing a criminal law situation according to § 222 of Act C.
      at the expense of the chaplain. It is quite obvious, according to the Respondent's point of view, that the 2022
      letter dated January 5 (according to the Applicant's point of view, 2022 is probably wrongly stated in the application
      the date of January 7 is stated, however, according to the Applicant's records, the letter is dated January 2022
      dated 5) was aimed at exercising the rights of non-stakeholders, the letter to the Applicant is completely different

      had intentions. He wanted to get the Respondent to establish a relationship with him. The Authority
      reviewed the letter attached by the Applicant, sent by the Applicant on July 31, 2022,
      which, according to the Respondent, requires contact with the referred chaplain
      to establish, to request an appointment from him for confession. However, the Applicant practiced during the procedure
      after inspecting the documents, indicated that this electronic letter sent on July 31, 2022
      it was not written by him, as the e-mail address indicated as the sender, \[…\], is not his e-mail address. The Applicant
      according to his statement, his real e-mail address is \[…\]. The Applicant is therefore an unknown perpetrator

      filed a complaint against.

(33) According to the Applicant's statement dated August 4, 2022, the Applicant mistakenly
      could indicate in his application that he addressed the Applicant with his letter dated January 7, 2022,
      because according to his records, the only letter sent by the Applicant was on January 5, 2022
      dated

(34) According to the Respondent's statement, the Applicant, in its letter dated January 5, 2022, made three
      asks for an answer to the following questions: (i) what file number was the e-mail registered under, (ii) what is the response time
      deadline, (iii) or requires a data management ("data protection") information sheet, not specified
      what personal data you are requesting information about. The Respondent's position
      according to you, you cannot expect a data controller who suffers continuous harassment to clarify
      calls the Applicant for information regarding the personal data he/she is requesting,
      on the other hand, according to his point of view, points (i)-(iii) do not qualify as points (i) and (ii)

      personal data, including the Applicant's right to access them
      can practice. The data management information indicated in point (iii) is at most the Applicant
      to the content of the e-mail message or letter included in the attachment sent by you
      may apply. The content of these documents was released by the Applicant himself to the Respondent 6

      at your disposal precisely for the purpose of contacting him. That is, the
      On the one hand, it is requested to avoid constant harassment, and on the other hand, general data protection

      on the basis of Article 13 (4) of the Decree, he repeatedly refrained from answering the letter
      emphasizing that the request does not require access to personal data
      contained. According to the Respondent's point of view, the Applicant with his letter has the rights of the affected parties
      obviously abused his right to access personal data
      to practice

(35) In connection with the two letters, the Authority established during the clarification of the facts that the Applicant

      In a letter dated January 7, 2022, he addressed the Respondent with the exercise of stakeholder rights, which
      attached to a letter dated January 5, 2022, previously sent to the e-mail address of the Applicant
      sent letter, about which the Authority informed the Applicant on August 30, 2022
      dated NAIH-5584-10/2022. in the order with file no. The Applicant on September 26, 2022.
      in his reply letter dated 2022, he stated that he would maintain it on 4 August 2022
      dated, the statement made in connection with the Applicant's letter dated January 5, 2022,
      however, he did not say anything about his letter dated January 7.

(36) According to its further statement, the Respondent sent it to the Authority as a data controller
      according to the relevant provisions of its data protection regulations for the exercise of the data subject's rights
      inquiries. Considering that the Applicant is a small organization, so any
      a person who experiences an inquiry referring to the exercise of data subject rights, the inquiry is a
      it will be forwarded to the parish priest as the internal data protection officer, who will comply with the provisions of the regulations
      appropriately decides to take the necessary measures, where appropriate, a legal advisor

      enlisting his help. In other respects, the applicant keeps records in a separate excel file
      requests for the exercise of rights in accordance with the principle of accountability. The Applicant
      according to his statement, the request of the Applicant dated January 5, 2022 was not sent to the
      to be entered in the register, as it is considered harassment and the exercise of non-stakeholder rights,
      considering in particular that the request does not affect personal data, as well as the person concerned a
      during the submission of the letter, he could have received information on data with which

      which personal data is handled by the Applicant, for what purposes. That to the Applicant a
      You must do so in your response to the requester's access request.

(54) It is not the subject of this procedure that the Respondent, on behalf of the Applicant,
      but according to his statement, he did not write from the email address he used, dated July 31, 2022
      whether the electronic letter was written by the Applicant or by someone else with defamatory intent.

(55) However, based on the definition of the general data protection regulation
      it can be established that the Respondent manages the Applicant's referenced personal data.

(56) Therefore, the justification that, in the absence of personal data processing, is incorrect
      it is necessary to fulfill the Applicant's access request.

(57) The Authority does not accept the Applicant's statement that the Applicant will

      sent a letter dated January 5 with the subject of "date agreement" to the Respondent, which
      it did not contain personal data according to Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation
      request for access. The Authority agrees with the Application in that a
      In a letter dated January 5, 2022 with the subject "date agreement", the Applicant requests

      Your request for access to your personal data, dated January 7, 2022, is also for delivery

      pursuant to which all participants in the procedure are obliged to act in good faith and the others
      cooperate with a participant, and the client - and other participants in the procedure -

      addressed to the Respondent with a request for access to his personal data
      - to which the letter dated January 5, 2022 was attached - was not denied by the Respondent,

      nor is there any other evidence to the contrary available to the Authority, a

      for catechesis, request for data management information" as well. From this Application

(68) Article 23 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation also defines it
      special cases, the existence of which may limit the rights of the stakeholders, such as a
      right of access.

(69) Based on the above, it can be established in this case that the Respondent did not answer the Applicant
      "application for adult catechesis, request for data management information" dated January 7, 2022

      to his letter with reference to the fact that he did not receive such a letter. At the disposal of the Authority

      recipients and international organizations.

(72) The Authority also rejects the Applicant's request for a data protection fine

      application, since the application of this legal consequence affects the right or legitimate interest of the Applicant
      does not directly affect him, such a decision of the Authority does not create a right or obligation for him
