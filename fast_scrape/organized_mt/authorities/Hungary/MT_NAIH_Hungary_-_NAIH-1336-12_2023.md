## English Summary

### Facts

The Complainant alleged that the Respondent, a real estate franchise office, unlawfully stored personal information collected during a property viewing process, including name, ID number, and contact details. This was based on the fact that the Complainant did not receive any information from the Respondent when their data was collected and they assumed it was based on their consent.

The Complainant requested the Hungarian DPA to examine whether the Respondent's data processing activities complied with GDPR.

Despite requesting the deletion of their data, the Complainant’s information was retained for alleged legal enforcement purposes, due to a breach of contract by the Complainant. During the procedure, it turned out that there was an ongoing civil procedure between the Complainant and the Respondent, which already become legally binding.

The Hungarian DPA also involved the Franchise Owner in the process, because the data processing practices of the Respondent (the real estate franchise office) were tied to procedures and policies mandated by the Franchise Owner.

The Hungarian DPA investigated claims that the Respondent’s data processing practices failed to adhere to GDPR’s transparency and data minimization requirements, specifically regarding proper notification of data processing and storing excessive data.

### Holding

First, the DPA held that the Respondent and the Franchise Owner were not deemed joint controllers because, although the Franchise Owner provided data processing guidelines and a standardized system, each party independently determined specific aspects of the data processing activities, e.g. they separately determined the purposes and means, and the activities were not closely linked.

Second, the DPA determined, that it was in the legitimate interest of the Respondent to process the personal data of the Complainant for the enforcement of its claims until a legally binding judgment established that the claim did not exist.

The Respondent submitted the court's final judgment and the decision confirming its legal finality, regarding the lawsuit initiated based on the Respondent's outstanding claim. According to this judgment, the court dismissed the Respondent's claim. Therefore, since the judgment became final on February 16, 2023, the Respondent could no longer process the Complainant's personal data for claim management purposes on the grounds of legitimate interest.

In light of this, the Authority upheld the Complainant's request and ordered the Respondent to delete the Complainant's personal data from its claim management records.

Third, the Hungarian DPA held that the Respondent failed to carry out a legitimate interest assessment and therefore was unable to demonstrate compliance with the data processing principles and infringed [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR").

Fourth, the DPA found that processing certain personal data of the Complainant - specifically nationality, email address, ID document number, and phone number - were unnecessary for enforcing legal claims. The Authority determined that the processing was excessive and processing these data elements violated [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR").

Fifth, the Hungarian DPA found that the Respondent did not inform the Complainant in a transparent and intelligible way about the processing of their personal data, including details such as the identity of the data controller and the purposes of data processing. This lack of prior information meant the Complainant did not have a full understanding of how their data would be processed, which is a core requirement of [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR").

    on his responsibility.

(26) With reference to the above, in the Customer's opinion, the Respondent and the Customer are common
    data controllers, and the Respondent is an independent data controller with respect to its own customers.

(27) The Customer declared that the franchise contract concluded with the Application is complete

    The data management activities may be performed by several persons, which are as follows:

    - the Customer, who is the owner of the franchise system and the operator of the network,
    - the so-called "franchise partner": the member of the franchise network that is with the Customer

    "\[…\] Based on the above, the purpose, tools and rules of Data Management are determined by \[...\] THE
    Partners provide the data based on the contract concluded with the Data Subject or the Data Subject's consent
    are handled on the basis of, taking into account that the Partners are directly involved
    in connection. Noting that the purpose and means of data management are the Data Managers
    they are not defined jointly, they are not considered joint data controllers. The individual data controllers

    its data management is thus independent, but at the same time most of the data management activities are carried out by the Data Controllers

      lists according to data management purposes, of which purposes in the present case are the following two purposes
      relevant:

      - "Data required for identification: surname and first name; birth name; place and time of birth;
      his mother's name; permanent address, if not, place of residence, type of identification document
      and number. In relation to the above, the Data Management Information specifically highlights that "That
      provision of data, conclusion of a contract, other relationship creating a legal relationship (e.g.

      signing a viewing certificate) is mandatory, in the absence of these, the contract is not

      performance, enforcement of claims arising from the contract."

      - "Request-related data: If there is a legal dispute between the data subject and the Data Managers
      is formed (in particular, the person concerned does not pay the fee, or the property is owned by the Partners
      sold to an intermediary buyer by bypassing the Partners), the Data Controllers handle the request

      data regarding its legal basis and nature, as well as the validation of the claim
      supporting evidence.”

(33) Section 4.4 of the Data Management Information is entitled "Enforcement of demands and claims".
    According to what is written in this section, the most common legal dispute is related to "circumvention",
    when the parties involved bypass the Applicant and the Client and establish a legal relationship with it
    with the aim of exempting them from the obligation to pay fees. According to the Data Management Information

    the franchise partners can entrust the Customer with validating the claim, in this case
    the Customer acts as an agent and joint data management is carried out.

    however, it only mentions "Data Controllers" throughout, so it does not name the previously mentioned

    which of the three is the data controller, namely the Customer or the franchise partner
    or whether it is the sub-partner.

ARC. Decision:

IV.1. The personal data of the Applicant stored by the Respondent, data processing carried out on them,

data manager and data processor quality recorded on the viewing certificate
in relation to data management

IV.1.1. Personal data and its source

(55) According to Article 4, Point 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Applicant's name, mother's name,
    your nationality, address, ID document number, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth

    place and time are considered personal data of the Applicant, the storage of which data,
    use of data management according to Article 4, Point 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation
    qualifies.

(56) The source of the above personal data is the Applicant, as these data are so-called
    made available to the Applicant on a viewing statement. The viewing
    declaration as a form was made by the Customer as a franchise owner

    binding for the Applicant.

IV.1.2. Data processing carried out on the Applicant's personal data - investigated in this procedure
    operations

(57) Recording, storage and transmission of the data indicated on the inspection certificate
    it can be considered data processing based on Article 4, point 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation. The present

    In the official data protection procedure, the Authority separately examined these personal data
    recording, and separately, this personal data by the Respondent for claim management purposes
    data management related to its transmission.  The latter is a data management operation
    regarding IV.2. the Authority made findings in point

IV.1.3. The Applicant IV.1.1. related to the recording of personal data according to point
    data manager and data processor established in terms of data management

(58) The concept of data controller is defined in Article 4, point 7 of the GDPR, and the concept of data processor is defined in Article 4 of the GDPR.
    Article 8. According to Article 4, point 7 of the GDPR, the natural person is a data controller
    or legal entity \[...\] which independently manages the purposes and means of processing personal data
    or defines together with others \[…\]. Based on point 8 of the same article
    data processor is the natural or legal person \[...\] that, on behalf of the data controller
    manages personal data.

(59) The Data Management Regulations, compiled by the Customer, relating to the data management of the Respondent
    is also recorded in the information sheet - in accordance with the statements made by the Requested Party and the Customer -,
    that the Customer determines the forms used during data management,
    contracts, sales processes, the procedure to be followed in case of breach of contract.
    The Data Management Information - as explained in paragraph (30) of this decision, 1.3.
    - expressly states that the purpose, means and rules of data management are

    The customer defines, and at the same time records that the purpose and means of data management are determined by the customer
    data controllers (i.e. the Requested Party and the Customer) do not jointly determine it, no
    are considered joint data controllers. The Data Management Notice refers to the fact that
    the data management of the individual data controllers (in this case, the Requested Party and the Customer) is thus independent,
    at the same time, most data management activities are based on the joint activities of the data controllers
    is realized.

                                                                                             11(60) In the opinion of the Authority, the above information is rather contradictory, and it is
    it is also contradictory that the Customer determines all forms, so a

    The respondent has no say in it, but at the same time, everything is an independent data controller
    regarding.

(61) The European Data Protection Board 07/2020. no. guidelines (hereinafter: Guidelines),
    which is the data controller and that
    about the concept of data processor according to the GDPR, and also details in which case
    we can talk about joint data management. Joint data management is on page 3 of the Guidelines

    regarding the summary of its essence, the following can be read: "\[…\] An important aspect,
    that data management is not possible without the participation of two parties in the sense that it is
    data processing carried out by some parties is inseparable, i.e. untangleable
    are connected. Joint participation must include goals on the one hand and goals on the other
    the definition of the means. \[...\]"

(62) The Respondent cannot be considered an independent data controller, but at the same time the Respondent and the Customer are

    the data management related to the viewing certificate cannot be considered a joint data manager either
    regarding, as the Customer determined its data content, and also by the Customer
    it is done in relation to it as written in the prepared Data Management information sheet
    data management. This also follows from the operating principles of the franchise system
    within the framework of all aspects of the Respondent's activity - and related to it
    data management - are regulated in detail. Used under the franchise system
    documents, such as the viewing certificate, also contain a reference to the franchise system,

    therefore, to continue their activities as specified by the Customer a
    partners. The viewing certificate form has the Customer's name and logo
    is included, the franchise partners' names are included only to the extent that the customer is aware of it
    declares that he learned about the property through XY Real Estate Agency. THE
    inspection certificate is not a document required by law, its design,
    its content is solely the decision of the data manager, in this case the Customer.

(63) 11.6 of the attached franchise agreement (as an attachment to document NAIH-3772-7/2022). point
    the Customer may delete data from its system to which the Requested Party has access
    provides and in which the Requested data can be entered.

(64) The following can also be read on page 4 of the Guidelines: "\[…\] For the data processor
    qualification has two basic conditions: an organization separate from the data controller, and
    manages personal data on behalf of the data controller. The data processor is the data controller

    you may not process the data in a way other than your instructions. Instructions of the data controller
    they still give some degree of discretion as to how
    the interests of the data controller can be best represented, which enables the data processor
    to select the most appropriate technical and organizational measures. \[...\]"
    The Respondent actually handles the data on behalf of the Client, since with them
    you cannot make any data management decisions, except for the commission fee
    decision on collection. This was decided by the Respondent and forwarded by him

    the Applicant's personal data to his lawyer in order to enforce his claim. THE
    The Respondent therefore asserts the fee in its own name, this is the Respondent's claim. The present
    in this case, the separate organization also exists as a criterion, since the Client and the Respondent
    two separate legal entities. In this respect, therefore, the Respondent is independent in this case
    data controller. However, this is not the case in all cases, according to Data Management Information 4.4.
    point, based on what was written in paragraph (33) of this decision.

(65) Due to the above, the Authority to the Client data controller, the Requested data processor
    considers the management of the Applicant's data provided on the viewing certificate,
    regarding the recording, in relation to the period until the Data is requested
    it does not independently decide on its further use for other purposes, i.e. not for claims management purposes
    handles them. Additional data management operations performed on this personal data, i.e. on
    handling (storage) of personal data for the purpose of claims management, and \[…\] to the District Court

                                                                                           12 - in connection with legal proceedings -) is subject to a different judgment in IV.2.
    as explained in point.

IV.2.  Claims management by the Respondent on the Applicant's personal data,
    data processing for the purpose of claim validation

IV.2.1. Legitimate interest as a legal basis

(66) The Respondent is a separate legal entity from the Client. It follows from its independent legal personality
    is that the Respondent may have a claim against other persons, i.e. the Respondent
    in this capacity, it can be considered a data controller, since it can make decisions as an independent legal entity
    about whether it takes steps to enforce the given debt. For viewing
    certificate also refers, because it refers to the fact that the real estate agency is entitled to
    entrusts the Customer with the claim validation. Economic decisions of independent legal entities,
    thus, the claims are also independent. So while the franchise system may stipulate that a

    using the name of the franchise system, how should the Applicant perform his real estate brokerage
    activities, the management of its finances is independent of this. So until the viewing
    personal data recorded on the certificate will not be used for claim validation purposes
    for use, until then the Requested is considered a data processor, but as soon as it is
    data processing for the purpose of claim enforcement begins, from that date the Requested
    becomes a data controller.

(67) Based on the above, therefore, the Respondent registered a claim as long as
    Against the Applicant, in relation to whom the Applicant has not filed any court proceedings
    decision, which would establish that it does not exist, regarding the requested data management
    had a legitimate interest, especially considering that court proceedings were ongoing. THE
    For the applicant's personal data - natural personal identification data, as well as a
    claim data - and to validate your claim, as well as for this
    legitimate interest in the processing of necessary data, i.e. Article 6 (1) Paragraph f) of the GDPR

    point existed against the Applicant, as long as it was not established by a final judgment
    and that the claim does not exist. With reference to this, the Respondent is the Applicant
    his personal data was legally handled (stored and forwarded to the court) by his request
    for the purpose of validation.

 (68) According to the Respondent's statement, the judgment on the rejection of his claim has become final
    deletes the Applicant's personal data, if it is not relevant to this official procedure

    necessary. After the judgment becomes final, no longer with reference to claim enforcement,
    only in the legitimate interest of the Requested Party and the Customer with reference to this official procedure
    the personal data of the Applicant can be managed by reference.

(69) At the request of the Authority, the Respondent attached the final judgment of the court and the final
    order in the lawsuit initiated with reference to the Respondent's outstanding claim. According to the court
    rejected the Respondent's claim, therefore the Respondent's judgment becomes final

    after (since 16.02.2023) no longer for claim management purposes with reference to your legitimate interest
    can manage the Applicant's personal data.

(70) In view of the above, the Authority granted the Applicant's request and obliged the
    The request is from the record of the Applicant's personal data for claim purposes
    to delete.

IV.2.2. Consideration of interests

(71) Based on recital (47) of the GDPR, to establish the existence of a legitimate interest
    in any case, it must be carefully examined, among other things, that the interests of the person concerned
    and your fundamental rights may take precedence over the interest of the data controller if a
    personal data are processed in circumstances where the data subjects are not

                                                                                             13 expect further data processing. However, this decision (70)
    as established in paragraph 16.02.2023. is no longer relevant after

    so it is only 16.02.2023. governing data management up to date.

(72) According to the Authority's finding, it concerns the primacy of the Respondent's legitimate interests
    on the one hand, their statement does not specifically refer to the Applicant's personal data, but
    made some very brief statements regarding his legitimate interests in general,
    on the other hand, it does not cover the circumstances mentioned in recital (47) of the GDPR either. THE
    The respondent did not identify the interests of the data subject and did not compare them

    interest of the data controller, as well as the necessity and proportionality of the data management
    nor was it examined or substantiated. As part of the attached Data Management Information
    the “Brief Introduction to the Weighing of Interests Test” emphasizes that if the data subject voluntarily
    does not meet the requirements of the data controllers, then there is no other way to achieve the goal, and that
    manages the personal data required to validate claims.

(73) According to the Authority's finding, it concerns the primacy of the Respondent's legitimate interest

    on the one hand, his statement does not specifically refer to the Applicant's personal data, but
    made some very brief statements regarding his legitimate interest in general,
    on the other hand, it does not cover the circumstances mentioned in recital (47) of the GDPR either. THE
    The respondent did not identify the interests of the data subject and did not compare them
    interest of the data controller, as well as the necessity and proportionality of the data management
    nor was it examined or substantiated. Given that the Respondent only
    made general findings regarding his legitimate interest, therefore the Applicant

    in relation to it, he completely failed to carry out the consideration of interests, in general
    and its findings cannot be considered sufficient, since the GDPR (47)
    it does not meet the requirements of the preamble.

(74) Due to the above, it can be established that the Respondent did not comply with Article 5 (2) of the GDPR
    of his obligation according to paragraph

(75) According to the Authority's point of view, in relation to the following personal data - 16.02.2023.
    to date - the legitimate interest of the data controller existed, or its priority, as legal claims
    scope of personal data required for the purpose of enforcement based on legal provisions
    can be determined as follows:
