## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject submitted a complaint with the Hungarian DPA for the unlawful processing of their personal data and the personal data of their child, including special categories of data. The complaint was made regarding the recording and subsequent sharing of a private conversation between the defendant and the complainant, as well as an employee of a daycare attended by both of their respective children. The recording contained personal data, including sensitive information about the health of a minor. It was then shared by the controller within a Facebook group containing of all the parents whose children attend the daycare, as well as via e-mail with other parties. Upon questioning, the defendant admitted that they had no legal grounds for the collection or sharing of this data.

### Holding

The Hungarian DPA noted that both recording the conversation for purely personal use or sharing information about the meeting with other interested parents could have fallen under the household exemption of the GDPR under [Article 2(2)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_2_GDPR#2c "Article 2 GDPR"). However, NAIH held that the sharing of such recording excluded the exemption and was also contrary to the principles of purpose limitation and data minimisation under [Articles 5(1)(b) and 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1 "Article 5 GDPR"). Moreover, the DPA held that the defendant had no legal ground for the processing of the data, including special categories of data, under [Article 6(1)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") and [Article 9 GDPR.](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR")Subsequently, NAIH decided to reprimand the controller under [Article 58(2)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2b "Article 58 GDPR") and impose a ban on any further processing under [Article 58(2)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2f "Article 58 GDPR"). The DPA also ordered the controller to inform those with whom the data was shared to erase it without undue delay under [Article 58(2)(g)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2g "Article 58 GDPR"). However, NAIH did not find it necessary to impose an administrative fine under [Article 83(2)](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2 "Article 83 GDPR"), taking into account that the controller is a natural person who had accepted that their conduct had been unlawful.

## Comment

In the DPA's Opinion, the recording of the conversation between two parents and the daycare employee in secret is 'concerning and unacceptable from an ethical point of view'. However, they state that it would have still fallen under the household exemption, as long as the data is not shared with others (but only serves as an aid to help remembering what was said during the meeting). One could argue that this interpretation of Article 2(2)(c) allows natural persons to record all of their phone conversations for example, as long as they don't share them with anyone. One risk could be that given that the this processing would fall outside the scope of the GDPR, even the general principles (especially 'integrity and confidentiality') wouldn't apply.

by alerting the controller or processor.

ARC. Decision

 (23) The processing of data by recording consisted of two different data processing operations. The first
       operation was to record the recording, while the second operation was to communicate the recording, and the latter
       it took two different forms when the Applicant first appeared in the group

       shared the recording and then e-mailed his statement - and the attached evidence -
       according to three people. Both operations, including the recording and communication of the recording
       considered as data processing within the meaning of Article 4 (2) of the GDPR.

IV.1 Data management related to the communication of the recording

(24) The Authority found that personal data within the meaning of Article 4 (1) of the GDPR
       the following information about the Applicant on the audio recording shall be considered: a

       name (\[…\]), place of residence, that it does not belong to the given kindergarten district; in his family a
       there have been three recent deaths; the Applicant's conduct, behavioral
       information about your problem.

(25) It was also found that the GDPR was a health claim within the meaning of Article 4 (15)

       and therefore special personal data under Article 9 (1) of the GDPR
       statements made by the Applicant that \[…\]
       are taking “\[…\]” medication, \[…\] will have a test \[…\] problem, two weeks a week

       times of development, as well as to provide indications that he is ill.

(26) The Applicant indicated different data processing purposes for the two data processing operations
       me. According to the Applicant 's statement, the recording was made for the purpose of:

       later recall the conversation and the communication to the other parents -
       ie to inform the addressees of the communication.

(27) As regards the recording of the recording, the Authority noted that as long as
       is for purely private purposes, that is to say, as the Applicant has pointed out,
       the recording will help the Recaller to recall what was said during the interview

       the so-called "household data management" category, and the GDPR - a
       Article 2 (2) (c) shall not apply to it. However, not
       it may be disregarded that the recording was made in secret - subject to the

                                               10 the sensitivity of the topic of discussion - ethically concerned and not
       acceptable.

(28) However, at the moment, as between the Applicant and the Representative and the
       a recording of a conversation between the kindergarten teacher for other people
       made it available - thus making the Applicant’s personal and special

       personal data - the private nature of the recording, ie also by the Applicant
       emphasized, his own self-interest ceased to exist. Consequently, the position of the Authority
       according to the division of the recording goes beyond the household exception to the GDPR

       the concept of data management.

(29) With regard to the sharing of recordings as a data processing operation, the Authority should
       the purpose indicated by the applicant - ie to inform the other parents about the Applicant

       stated the following. THE
       conversation with two people involved in the main topic, the kindergarten teacher
       with the help, so between three people, it took place in a closed circle, and although it was uttered differently

       also conflicts and general problems related to children, starting from the
       There was a conflict between the Applicant's child and the Applicant. The Applicant himself is a
       in the attached messenger conversation: “Monday afternoon, a

       after another incident with my son, I had another parental complaint with the head of the kindergarten. ”
       \[…\] “At the initiative of yesterday \[…\], we sat down with his kindergarten teacher
       to discuss things. ” The Representative also intends to have a child and the Applicant
       in a conversation between the two of them to resolve a conflict between their children

       informing all parents about what has been said is not considered lawful under the GDPR
       purpose.

(30) In addition to the illegality of the stated objective, the Authority found that if the others
       an oral conversation about general, relevant information that concerns them exclusively
       also due to its household nature does not qualify as GDPR

       therefore cannot be objected to from a data protection point of view.

(31) However, sharing the recording in this way was an unnecessary intervention
       to the privacy of the data subject, ie the Applicant, by being personal and special

       your personal data has thus become accessible to more than one person.

(32) In addition to the above, the Authority did not consider that the online communication was made

       appropriate way to pass on the information in this case, as it carries
       the possibility and risk of the link - or, in the case of an e-mail, the file -
       the recipient may transfer the recording to other persons.

                                               11 (33) In view of the above, the Applicant violated Article 5 of the GDPR by sharing the recording.
          the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5 (1) (b) and Article 5 (1) of the GDPR.

          the principle of data protection set out in paragraph 1 (c).

 IV.2 Legal basis for data processing

(34) Based on the above, the Applicant's personal data of the Applicant is third

          activities under the GDPR
          in which case the lawfulness of the processing is subject to one of the conditions laid down in Article 6 of the GDPR
          Existence of a legal basis governed by paragraph 1.

(35) In addition, the processing of special personal data is in principle prohibited. The special
          personal data may be lawfully processed only if Article 6 (1) of the GDPR
          in addition to a specific legal basis, a circumstance within the meaning of Article 9 (2) of the GDPR
          which allows an exception to the prohibition on the processing of special data.

(36) The Applicant did not have the consent of the Applicant for the data processing. THE

          Authority invited the Applicant to indicate his data processing
          however, the Applicant did not comply with this during the proceedings. To the Authority
          he stated, “I did not have the right to send the recording to anyone who asked for it now

          I know.". With the consent of the Applicant or the legal representative
          did not in fact have any provisions or prove the existence of any other plea in law.

(37) In view of the specific circumstances of the case, the Authority concluded that both
          The processing of both the applicant's personal data and his special personal data is a legal basis
          therefore, the Applicant violated Articles 6 (1) and 9 of the GDPR.

(38) In view of the above, the Authority granted the applicant's request pursuant to Article 58 (2) of the GDPR.
          Pursuant to paragraph 1 (f), the Applicant is prohibited from recording the sound by third parties
          to the Commission.

   IV.3. Principle of fair data management

   (39) The fairness of data processing is the principle governing data processing, the data subject
          respect for his or her privacy and human dignity. THE
          in accordance with the principle of fair data processing, the data subject may not become vulnerable to

          against the data controller or another person.

   (40) About the conversation about the Applicant with his legal representative without the Representative's knowledge
          was taken when the Applicant secretly, without informing those present, into his pocket

          used the recording device in secret. He did this to record a conversation
                                                   12 during which the Representative, i.e. the mother of the minor Applicant, did nothing about the recording
       suspecting her child has a number of sensitive privacy and health issues

       shared status information with the other two participants in the conversation.
       Given that the Representative did not know how to make the recording, and given
       he could not even count on him in the circumstances, so he could not protest against him.

(41) The purpose of the meeting was to be the child of the Applicant and the Applicant
       to talk about the situation caused by conflicts and other problems between the two countries, and
       try to find a solution together. The Applicant was therefore aware of this

       put the conversation from the very beginning to be the focus of the Applicant
       will have problems with their behavior and their background.

(42) In addition, the Applicant emphasized on several occasions during the discussion that
       with his questions or comments he tried to confirm that the Applicant was ill.

       An example of this phenomenon is the dialogue on the recording when the Requested
       To his representative that "I do not see you admitting that
       \[…\]. ” the Representative begins his response with “I acknowledge,”. Also during the conversation

       the Applicant is repeatedly compared to other preschoolers as healthy
       with children. The Applicant also mentions his own child in such a context, indirectly
       referring to the Applicant's patient status: "I have the right to protect my healthy child."

(43) The Applicant was therefore aware not only of the conversation but also of the
       knowing the sensitivity of what was said in the conversation - as an active participant in it
       and Shaper - shared the recording with third parties.

(44) Sensitive, special data about the Applicant and the

       allusions to his behavior were made. The data transmission was suitable for a
       Applicant's judgment in the microenvironment, the parents of the kindergarten peers
       adversely affected.

(45) In view of the above, the Authority finds that the Applicant has infringed Article 5 of the GDPR
       The principle of fair treatment under paragraph 1 (a) because in a situation
       decided to be uncomfortable for the Applicant, to the detriment of his fellow preschoolers
       indicating, emphasizing his illness, and distinguishing him from others

       transmission of a recording of a conversation when it would not have existed at all
       need to process personal and special personal data.
