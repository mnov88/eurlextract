## English Summary

### Facts

On 16 May 2023, the the Hungarian DPA (NAIH) received a complaint from a minor's legal guardian, which alleged that a bank (the controller) had processed the minor's (data subject) personal data unlawfully. The minor's legal guardian had applied for a 'baby loan' ('Babaváró' loan) with the bank. These loans are for the purpose of financing child-related costs.

In order to process the loan application, the bank had requested a copy of the minor's identification documents, which included details such as the minor's residential address, gender, birth date and national identification number. To do so, the bank relied on [Article 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") (contract) as a legal ground for processing. In the complaint, the applicant argued that the processing was disproportionate and unnecessary for the purposes of their contract with the bank, which the minor was not party to.

In response to the complaint, the NAIH contacted the bank for more information. The bank responded that Article 14(4) and Article 9(2)(c) of Decree 44/2019. (III. 12.), which regulates the conditions of a “Babaváró” loan, requires banks to process minor's identification documents. Moreover, in order to be able to demonstrate compliance under domestic banking regulations, banks are obliged to document the basis on which they have granted loans and store any relevant information in relation to this.

### Holding

The NAIH rejected the complaint. The NAIH held that Article 14(4) and Article 9(2)(c) of Decree 44/2019. (III. 12.), required banks to process the data referred to. Therefore the processing was legitimate as it was necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller was subject ([Article 6(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR")). The NAIH acknowledged that the bank had wrongly indicated [Article 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") as a legal basis for processing. However, the NAIH held that the indication of an incorrect legal basis for processing under Article 6 GDPR, did not make the processing illegitimate.

Falk Miksa utca 9-11 Fax: +36 1 391-1410 www.naih.hu(2) The Representative found the preparation of document copies harmful and therefore
        contact with the data protection officer of the Respondent. On April 4, 2023, to the \[...\] e-mail address
        in his e-mail sent, he asked for information about what legislation he was referring to
        the Applicant manages "all" of his child's personal data. The Requested data protection
        in his reply letter dated April 12, 2023, his official informed the Representative that the mentioned
        data, such as the Data Subject's birth certificate, identity card, a
        processing a copy of your residential address card and tax certificate about the babysitting allowance
        44/2019. (III. 12.) Government decree (hereinafter: Babaváró r.) based on paragraph 14. (4) of §

        It is done in accordance with point c) of § 9, paragraph (2), since these legal provisions
        based on this, they must be attached to the application for suspension of repayment. Furthermore
        informed the Representative that he has a ministerial resolution which
        states in general that it applies to the use of state aid for banks
        they must be able to prove conditions, i.e. to make the "credit institution decision, that
        for review by the housing support authority, and the Hungarian State Treasury
        for its subsequent verification, it is necessary to evaluate the support, i.e. the person entitled to the support

        preservation of documents establishing the verification of conditions."

(3) The Representative did not consider the above information to be satisfactory. According to his opinion, why did they apply?
        family support benefits directly from the Hungarian Treasury, therefore in relation to
        Babaváró r. The provisions of § 9, paragraph (2) c) do not apply. Therefore
        in his opinion, the Data processing of the Respondent was unnecessary and disproportionate.

(4) In the request for the official data protection procedure, the Representative requested that the Authority establish

        and that the Respondent's data processing was largely disproportionate and unnecessary when
        the Respondent made a photocopy of the Data Subject's "authority card confirming personal identification",
        since personal identification is not necessary at all for credit administration.

(5) The Representative also requested that the Authority oblige the Applicant to
        to delete personal data and oblige the Requester to be prepared from the Data Subject's documents
        for returning copies to

II. Fact

(6) In the case of the Respondent, in general, with the obligation of banks to copy documents
        explained that the supervisory bodies that control banks, such as Magyar
        National Bank (hereinafter: MNB) or the Hungarian State Treasury (hereinafter: Treasury)

        they set expectations for the banks, based on which it is inevitable that
        so that banks are able to provide documents and deeds in all cases
        to substantiate that their financial service activities, such as lending
        or aid related to state subsidies in the course of their assessment activities, the relevant
        legal provisions are complied with.

(7) The Respondent also submitted that the relevant legislation and the MNB apply
        in accordance with his recommendations, bank branch staff performing sales cannot be
        in a position to make a decision related to credit or a credit assessment. The banks
        prudent and transparent operation, protection of depositors' money, and the banking sector
        in order to preserve its stability, banks may not develop internal processes that
        as a result of which bank branch clerks with a commission interest bring the
        bank branch clerks who receive credit assessment decisions, i.e. certificates, are not entitled to a
        related to the suspension of repayment and the awarding of child support

        to make decisions. In order to ensure prudent and proper banking operations, it is also necessary
        to avoid situations where the bank branch employee may data

                                                  2 in connection with the misinterpretation or concealment of the credit assessment, or the loan or state
        can influence the placement of support or provide it illegally. Based on all this, the
        in the banking sector, the high level of documentation required by the supervisory bodies
        are expected from banks, it also stems from the basic principle that the prudent operation of banks and the
        the possibility of internal abuses must be avoided in order to ensure the stability of the banking sector
        may survive.

(8) The Respondent also considered it necessary to record that the banks are state-owned
        they are not entitled to the legal provisions with regard to loans related to support
        overwrite or supplement. Banks can decide whether to provide state support
        whether they provide it or not, but if they decide to provide the given state aid, then so be it
        nor may they deviate from the legislation of the legislator, if it applies to the given place of legislation
        provision is incomprehensible, inapplicable or inappropriate. Based on all of this, the
        Bank, even if it is difficult or impossible to interpret each one from a data protection point of view

        legal provision, it is still maintained by the relevant legislation, such as, for example, Babaváró
        the application of concepts or solutions defined in r.

        after the 12th week of pregnancy, including the period after childbirth, or
        can be requested in case of adoption.

(34) In the specific case, the Representative and his wife asked the Applicant to suspend the repayment
        On \[...\] 2022, given that the 12th week of pregnancy has been completed, then on \[...\] 2023

        certified to the Respondent that their child, the Subject, was born, which is their obligation
        Babaváró r. prescribed by § 22, paragraph (2). In connection with the suspension of repayment, Babaváró r.
        Paragraph (4) of § 14 stipulates that the request for the suspension of repayment must be submitted to the
        must be submitted to a credit institution. Section 9 (2) b) and c) must be attached to the application
        documents specified in point Eligibility conditions for pausing
        compliance is determined by the credit institution based on the submitted certificates.

(35) Babaváró r. Paragraph (4) of § 14 thus refers back to points b) and (c) of § 9 (2)
        to specific documents, which is a general legal drafting technique,
        which aims to avoid unnecessary repetitions. That is, for the suspension of repayment
        from the point of view of the application, only the part of § 9, paragraph (2) b) and c) applies
        significance in which the documents to be submitted are named, not that § 9 (2)
        points b) and c) of paragraph otherwise aim to trigger what legal effect.

(36) As a result, the fact that the Representative and his wife applied for

        whether, and if so, where, family support benefits, it is not affected by the suspension of repayment
        the range of documents to be submitted in order to support the application for
        paragraph 9. (2) points b) and c) defines which are blood
        in the case of a child according to the following: pregnancy care book or by the attending physician
        exhibited, Babaváró r. document with the content specified in Annex 2; by blood
        child's birth certificate, official ID card confirming his address and
        tax certificate.

(37) In addition, Babaváró r. Paragraph (2) of Section 5 expressly authorizes credit institutions to
        the name of the children born after submitting a loan application for subsidized married couples,
        their birth name, their mother's name, their place and time of birth, their nationality
        or for the treatment of their stateless status, address and tax identification number a
        assessment of the loan application, conclusion of the loan agreement, disbursement of the loan and the legal
        for the purpose of checking usage. The documents copied by the Applicant are exclusively on this
        contain data, copies of the authenticity and correctness of this data

        are used for verifiability. In his submission, the Representative only claimed that the Data Subject
        also the page containing your personal identification number of your official ID card confirming your address
        was copied by the Respondent, he could not support it with anything, so the Authority a
        Based on the copies of documents provided to him by the respondent, he states that
        The Personal ID of the Data Subject was not processed by the Respondent, about which a
        You did not make the requested copy.

(38) Babaváró r. Paragraph (4) of § 14 specifically emphasizes that for the suspension of repayment

        the fulfillment of relevant eligibility conditions on the basis of the submitted certificates by the credit institution
        establishes, i.e. in the absence of these documents, the credit institutions to suspend repayment
        applications must be rejected.

(39) It should also be noted here that the Applicant and all other baby loans
        disbursing credit institution has a settlement relationship with Kincstár, as well as Babaváró r. Section 23 (8)

                                                  According to paragraph 7, the Treasury is responsible for activities related to baby loans
        can check and is entitled to request the necessary information and documents, or to access them
        to inspect on site. Babaváró r. According to § 24, paragraph (1), the credit institution is also responsible
        against the state for any damage that is an obligation imposed on him based on this decree
        caused by its violation. That is, the Respondent's compliance with the law, as well as
        in order to verify compliance, it must be handled as specified in Babaváró r
        documents. Thus, on the basis of the above, to prove eligibility for support
        Babaváró r. is not enough. Defined in points b) and c) of paragraph (2) of § 9

        the mere presentation of documents at the credit institution.

(40) Based on all of this, the Authority concludes that the Applicant in Babaváró r. Section 14 (4)
        paragraph and Section 9 (2) points b) and c) legally prepared
        a copy to the Affected Babaváró r. on the documents containing your data according to paragraph (2) of § 5,
        i.e. from the part of the Data Subject's official ID document confirming the residential address containing the residential address,
        of your tax certificate and birth certificate, and the personal information on it
        handles data legally. The personal data on the copies of documents Applicant

        is necessary to be handled by and is proportionate to the goal to be achieved, as it concerns the suspension
        eligibility conditions are met by the Applicant based on the submitted certificates,
        in the absence of these, the grant applications would not be considered. Consequently, the Authority
        states that the Respondent is in accordance with Article 5 (1) point c) of the GDPR
        in accordance with the principle of data saving, legally manage the Data Subject's personal data, and
        as a result, the Representative rejects the requests submitted on behalf of the Data Subject.

(41) The Authority further notes that the Respondent is responsible for handling the Data Subject's personal data

        as its legal basis, it indicated point b) of Article 6 (1) of the GDPR, according to which the personal
        data processing is legal if and to the extent that the data processing is a contract
        necessary for the fulfillment of which the person concerned is one of the parties, or the conclusion of the contract
        it is necessary to take steps at the request of the data subject beforehand

(42) However, the Data Subject has no rights or rights in the contract
        obligations do not arise, the contracting parties do in relation to the baby loan
        Affected parents and the Applicant, therefore only the beneficiaries of Article 6 (1) point b) of the GDPR

        can be considered as a suitable legal basis for contracting parties.

(43) The children – whether they are biological or adopted children of the beneficiaries –
        personal data is processed so that parents and beneficiaries can verify
        that the conditions of the support received from the state have been fulfilled in parallel with the baby loan,
        and that this performance can later be certified by the credit institution to the Treasury. THE
        proof of compliance with the eligibility conditions for support by the parents to the credit institution

        an obligation that is created by concluding a babysitting contract. For those supported
        although they have to prove compliance to the credit institution, it is the support provided by the state
        is significant from the point of view of the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of the conditions of the support a
        does not affect the existence of a loan agreement. On the other hand, the conditions of support
        verification of its existence is the legal obligation of credit institutions prescribed by law, which
        in connection with its execution, they are liable for compensation to the Treasury. All of these
        based on which it can be stated that the processing of children's personal data by credit institutions is legal
        based on their obligation, the data management is carried out in relation to their personal data

        its corresponding legal basis is Article 6 (1) point c) of the GDPR.

(44) Nevertheless, in the specific case, the Respondent does not comply with Article 6 (1) of the GDPR
        referred to its appropriate legal basis when handling the Data Subject's data, data management
        it has no significance in terms of its legality and necessity. On the one hand, it is the Representative
        He did not dispute the legal basis for processing the personal data concerned, but only the necessity of it,

                                                  8, on the other hand, the Respondent has, regardless of this, appropriate means to manage personal data
        with the legal basis that it marked an inappropriate point in Article 6 (1) of the GDPR
        as the legal basis for data processing in the statement addressed to the Authority, since Article 6 (1) of the GDPR
        on the basis of paragraph 1, the processing of personal data is lawful if and to the extent that it is
        one of the conditions in points a)-f) exists.
