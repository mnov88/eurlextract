## English Summary

### Facts

The claimant contacted Google AdWords and asked for the information stored by them in relation to the processing of the personal data related to the claimant's name. Google replied to the claimant stating that they did not know which organizational unit would be able to answer the Claimant's query, and therefore did not provide the Claimant with an answer to his request. The Claimant then filed a complaint against Google with the Hungarian DPA for not complying with his request under Article 15 and with the one month deadline under Article 12(3).

### Dispute

Was Google Ireland Ltd in breach of its obligations under GDPR Article 15(1) and Article 12(3) by failing to provide the data subject with their personal data?

### Holding

The DPA held that Google had not provided the Claimant with a substantive response to their data subject request under Article 15 within the one month time frame as specified in Article 12(3). After making this finding, it closed the investigation and did not issue a fine against Google Ireland.

The Hungarian DPA also held that it was the main authority in this case, as they only examined the practice of Google Ireland in so far as it had an impact on the rights of data subjects residing in Hungary.

## Comment

There was conflicting information on the actual amount of the fine. The exact number will be updated.

**Update:** a fine of 10,000 HUF was imposed in the course of these proceedings, but it was imposed on the Hungarian DPA itself, and not the controller (ie Google Ireland). The fine was imposed on the Hungarian DPA under special procedural rules in section 51 of the Hungarian Code of General Administrative Procedure (Act CL of 2016) and the Hungarian Privacy Act (Act CXII of 2011).

According to section 51, if an authority exceeds the administrative deadline in the course of a procedure that is provided free of charge to the applicant, then the _data protection authority_ must pay HUF 10,000 to the _applicant_ (i.e. the data subject lodging the complaint). The imposition of this fine does not affect the data controller and is separate to any findings of liability or GDPR violation pertaining to the controller in the course of the same proceedings.
