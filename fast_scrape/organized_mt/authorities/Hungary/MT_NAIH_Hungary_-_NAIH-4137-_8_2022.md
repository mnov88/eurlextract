## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject was the patient of a gynecologist (the controller), who owned a private practice, and requested access to their medical records. The requested documentation related to the data subject's maternity care and pregnancy, which ended in the death of the fetus. Within a span of two months, the data subject sent two letters requesting a copy of the records, both with no response. Consequently, they lodged a complaint with the Hungarian DPA in order to obtain access to the data.

The DPA initiated a procedure and asked the controller to clarify the facts of the case. The controller responded that it managed the practice without any administrative help and due to the Covid-19 pandemic, struggled with minor administrative shortcomings. Consequently, it did not become aware of the data subject's request on time. The controller largely relied on paper records rather than an electronic patient database and only maintained the statutory mandatory electronic records. At the request of the DPA, the controller provided a copy of the documents, signed and sealed, to the data subject. However, the file was not complete as several medical test results were missing. The data subject requested the DPA to order the controller to send a copy of the missing records.

The DPA examined whether the controller acted lawfully in considering the request for access to medical records. The DPA also examined ex officio the general data management practices of the controller.

### Holding

First, the DPA recalled that the GDPR defines data relating to the health and healthcare of a data subject as personal data, including special categories of personal data under [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR").

Second, the DPA noted that maintaining paper records is still considered processing of personal data under the GDPR if the data are part of a filing system, in line with [Article 2(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_2_GDPR#1 "Article 2 GDPR"). [Article 4(6) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#6 "Article 4 GDPR") defines a filing system as "any structured set of personal data, which are accessible according to specific cirteria". Accordingly, the DPA held that, in the present case, the patient files maintained by the controller in the context of providing private healthcare fell within the scope of the GDPR.

Third, the DPA noted the obligations of the controller under [Articles 12(2)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") and [15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") to provide the details of the right to access as well as a copy of the requested data. Respectively, the copies of medical records sent to the data subject were not complete and the controller did not respond at all to two consequtive requests. The DPA pointed out that, according to the principle of accountability in [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR"), the controller is responsible for compliance with the GDPR and must be able to demonstrate it.

Fourth, the DPA noted that, contrary to the requirements of [Article 13(1)(a)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"), it was difficult to find the correct address for submissions of access requests because the controller's Privacy Notice with contact information was not provided to the data subject.

Fifth, the DPA took a closer look at the controller's documentation practices. In this context, the DPA indicated that the controller was unclear about how it stored patients' data. First, it had stated that it did not keep electornic records. Later, the controller stated that it created electronic records when required by national law. Therefore, the controller was not transparent with regards to the means of processing personal data, in breach of [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR").

The Hungarian DPA had to reject the data subject's request to order the controller to submit the missing documents as they turned out to be missing from the medical documentation overall. However, on its own initiative, the DPA concluded that the controller did not ensure an effective exercise of data subject rights in violation of [Articles 12(2)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") and [13(1)(a)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). The controller also did not process personal data in a transparent manner in violation of [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"). The DPA imposed a €1,400 fine for these violations.

as a health care provider who is the personal and health data of the patients concerned
during the care provided by him on a paper basis, and with regard to the mandatory data upload

According to the introduction of the Data Management information of the Respondent dated 2020, “\[…\]

According to point 10 of both information sheets, data protection officer \[...\], address: \[...\]; e-mail: \[…\]; and
can be found as an explanation that “with data protection issues or questions the above
you can contact a data protection officer". However, according to the Authority's point of view, it is not

according to Article 39 of the General Data Protection Regulation, it is not responsible for data protection either

he did not receive shipments.

According to Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data controller is responsible for (1)

in possession of the information on the address of the business headquarters of the service provider providing it,

where you could have otherwise sought the data protection officer. On the Applicant's website a

the address and method of submission, the Applicant could not verify, to the place of the order
and he did not ensure the reception of the submitted request.

According to the Authority's point of view, the data subject does not have to be aware that it is

the legal form in which the healthcare provider operates, its corporate headquarters
does it match the place of the order. If the person concerned, about the address for submission of applications
does not receive explicit and verifiable information, it is reasonable and unobjectionable if the request

The data controller's duty to facilitate the exercise of rights includes that
the data controller must cooperate with the data subject, in addition to the general data protection regulation

according to the data controller does not have the possibility to limit the rights of the data subject

IV.4. Management of health documentation, management of the Applicant's data 15

The General Data Protection Regulation defines the concept of data controller and data management
when defining it, it clearly states that the person who is personal is considered a data controller

manages data. The fulfillment of stakeholder requests regarding the subject of data management is general

Consistent with this, the Respondent's statement states that the Applicant is a
no data or documents can be found in its records.

The data subject's rights and their exercise can only be interpreted if there is data management which
however, it was not in the specific case. As a result, the Respondent did not violate the

For this reason, the Eütv cannot be established. Violation of the provisions of § 24 - which section is it
the rules of the general data protection regulation are ordered to be applied by the health department
regarding access to documentation and providing copies.

As a result, the Authority rejected the Applicant's request that the Authority oblige a

IV.5. Findings regarding the documentation practices of the Applicant

Due to the present case, the data management information provided by the Respondent does not cover the reality
practice, because it states in its information that it keeps paper-based records,

creates an electronic record based on its own decision, it is its legal obligation
complies with the electronic data transmission circuit, in addition to all this, the
entry in the maternity care book as well.

In the data management information, the Respondent states that the data is a
registers it in the pregnancy care book, which also means that you are aware of
that you have to record the data in another form, and also your patients about this practice

informs.

On the contrary, it refers to the processing of data concerning the Applicant during the discovery of the facts
information did not arise, the existence of data management concerning the Applicant could not be verified.

Furthermore, the Respondent made a contradictory statement in the present proceedings when earlier
stated that he does not keep electronic records, later the mandatory data upload

acknowledged the fact of electronic data management in demanding cases. However, he did not comment
in detail about the cases in which electronic data transmission is sufficient
obligation, what is considered a necessary case. The Respondent therefore approached the Authority
also amended its declaration, which basically affects its data management
it referred to circumstances, thereby making its real practice difficult for the Authority
exploration.

As for the Authority, the Respondent is not transparent for the affected parties either
practice. Based on all these circumstances, the Authority concludes that a
Requested 17 prescribed in Article 5 (1) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation

did not ensure the enforcement of the basic requirement of transparency, and the Respondent is
could not fully prove the legality of its data processing.

The Applicant stated that it was professional due to the emergency situation caused by the coronavirus
because of his additional tasks, he considered administration a task of secondary importance, for this reason
administrative failures may have occurred in its operation. So does the Respondent himself
states that "in certain cases" there were omissions, which the Authority
in its interpretation, it does not only mean the involvement of one person.

The Authority's position regarding administrative tasks is that the coronavirus
certain additional tasks due to an emergency may result in certain data management
postponement of the documentation obligation, however, this cannot mean the professional

complete neglect of the obligation, therefore, the complete management of health documentation

The Respondent's practice in fulfilling its documentation obligation a
It had an impact on the processing of the applicant's data and his rights, as the data subject is exercising his rights
is closely related and made it impossible, so the Authority for this reason the facts
examined the issue during clarification.

To the bodies and persons involved in pregnancy care, in the pregnancy care book
26/2014. (IV. 8.) EMMI decree prescribes for the purpose of

that for the bodies providing care for pregnant women (specialists, family doctors, nurses, midwives) the
care process information is summarized in a document.

However, according to the Authority's point of view, the fulfillment of this requirement does not mean that the Eütv. § 137 b)

according to, after the mandatory connection of the private service provider after January 1, 2020, the

omission.

According to the Authority's point of view, the management of health documentation required by law a
during a coronavirus emergency, it cannot be considered an obligation that can be pushed into the background. Any
the patient's treatment history is essential for the doctor treating the affected person,
medical history study in the Eütv. Expected care according to § 77, paragraph (3) and a
for the sake of a professionally founded procedure, which cannot be ensured in the event that

the person concerned does not receive the required documentation about his treatment, so it may be a
it cannot be forwarded to another doctor later on.

The Eütv. Paragraph (2) of § 26 also mentions the patient's medical history as an obligation and
information about medical history, which the patient cannot fully comply with,
if he does not have the appropriate documentation for his care.

In the case of maternity care, data on the life and health of the mother and fetus
are the subject of medical documentation. In this case, during the private order
the processes leading to the tragedy by failing to fully record the generated data
documentation was lacking, for which the Applicant was not aware of the data subject's rights
practice and did not get hold of your important health data.

The fact that the Respondent, as a health care provider, is required to apply to him professionally

led, did not give a finding to the provided Applicant at the end of the supply events, or a
findings were not forwarded to the EESZT system, it is not the authority of the Authority to judge. 18

The examination of this question - the management of the Requested health documentation

monitoring the fulfillment of its obligations and related legal requirements - a
It is initiated ex officio by the authority at NEAK.

IV.6. The Authority rejected the Applicant's request for a data protection fine
application, since the application of this legal consequence affects the right or legitimate interest of the Applicant
does not directly affect him, such a decision of the Authority does not create a right or obligation for him

arises, as a result of which this legal consequence falls within the scope of enforcing the public interest
the Applicant is not qualified for the imposition of a fine
for the client, the Akr. Based on § 10, paragraph (1). Since the Ákr. § 35, paragraph (1) no
