## English Summary

### Facts

The controller (a debt management company ) sought to collect a debt from an heir of a person deceased in 2013.

Following a notice received on 23 June 2021, the data subject (the heir) called to inform the controller that in his view, the claim was not justifiable. Based on the Hungarian Act V of 2013 on the Civil Code, a claim expires after 5 years, and also, heirs are liable only up to the amount of the inherited estate. The data subject also asked the controller to erase all personal data relating to this case. As no measures were taken by the controller, the data subject called a second time on 15 July 2021, when he requested the controller to send him the audio recording of his previous call. The phone operator of the controller could not find any reference to the first phone conversation and informed the data subject that the request for erasure had to be submitted in writing.

After the controller received an inquiry by the DPA, it claimed that it had initiated the proceedings against the data subject based on an administrative error. It was determined in an internal review that the data subject's verbal request for erasure was fully justified and the controller's phone operator failed to register it as a complaint.

As a result, the controller notified the data subject that it irretrievably deleted the relevant personal data from its records, while retaining a copy of the order of the public notary about the estate (including name, date and place of birth of the data subject, as well as his mother's name) based on its legal obligation to keep records under Act CCXXXVII of 2013 on Credit Institutions and Financial Enterprises and also on the basis of [Article 6(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1c "Article 6 GDPR").

### Holding

First, the DPA considered the processing of personal data for the purpose of debt collection. It was clear from the probate order obtained in 2016 that the amount of debts exceeded the amount of the active assets and hence the controller's claim was unjustified. Nevertheless, after receipt of the order, the data subject was still sent payment notices by the controller to settle the debt. The DPA consequently held that the controller unlawfully processed the personal data of the data subject for the purposes of debt collection, in violation of [Article 5(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). Regarding the copy of the order of the public notary that the controller retained, however, the DPA held that, pursuant to [Article 17(3)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#3b "Article 17 GDPR"), a data subject's request for erasure cannot be complied with if the processing of personal data is required by law. The controller was lawfully processing the personal data included in the order of the public notary about the estate based on [Article 6(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1c "Article 6 GDPR").

Second, the data subject was informed by the phone operator of the controller that the request for erasure had to be made in writing. Since the GDPR does not impose any formal requirements for the submission of a data subject request, the controller was not entitled to do so and, by refusing to accept the data subject request, it breached [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR").

Third, the DPA considered the inability of the controller to provide the data subject and the DPA with a copy of the initial erasure request. The DPA concluded that the controller, after becoming aware of the DPA’s proceedings, deleted the audio material, the retention of which would have been justified for the purposes of the proceedings, in particular based on the principle of accountability, and would therefore have had a legal basis under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"). The DPA further found that because the controller deleted the audio of the telephone conversation with the data subject and did so at a time that the proceedings were already pending, it violated [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"). In addition, because the requested audio file was not sent to the data subject when he requested it, despite the fact that data matching and identification took place and the telephone operator recorded the request, and because the controller did not give any reason for not providing access, the controller also violated [Article 15(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and [Article 12(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR").

Lastly, because the controller's policy on backups and their management was not public to the data subjects, the DPA held that the controller breached the principle of transparency under [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR").

ARC. Decision:

IV.1. Data management prior to May 25, 2018

On 07 December 7, 2015, \[…\] assigned the claim to the Applicant. The Applicant a
\[…\] On the basis of a final transfer order (hereinafter: transfer order) \[…\]
was registered as the legal heir of the Applicant on 20 September 2016.
on the day.

However, in spite of the above, the Authority will only process data after 25 May 2018

examined the Applicant for the following reasons:

In the present proceedings, the Authority will only deal with the data processing of the Requested until May 2018
Made in connection with the data management after the 25th day of the day, so the Ákr. Section 47 (1)
The Authority shall submit a request in accordance with paragraph 1 (a) before 25 May 2018
terminated the procedure in the part concerning the examination of his data processing, as the request did not

                                                                                             11, complied with Infotv. Section 60 (2), as the applicant
the general data protection regulation was not yet applicable in this part of the data processing period,

Thus, the Authority may not initiate official data protection proceedings upon request.

IV.2. The issue of limitation of a claim

According to the Applicant, the claim that the Applicant intends to collect against him has already taken place
expired, however, the Applicant disputed this and argued that the Civil Code. 6:23. § (4)
limitation may not be taken into account ex officio in judicial or administrative proceedings.

In the present proceedings, the Authority shall limit the limitation period of the claim in respect of the data processing of the Requested
did not examine it, because the judgment of Infotv. Pursuant to Section 38, Paragraphs (2) - (2a), a
Authority. It is for the courts to decide this question.

The Applicant has registered a claim against the Applicant in connection with which the
The applicant did not attach a court decision finding that it did not exist,

therefore, with regard to the claim registered by the Applicant, the data processing a
a legitimate interest may in principle exist.

IV.3. Person of the data controller

According to the data of the company register, the main activity of the Applicant is a receivables management activity.

The Authority has established, on the basis of the Applicant's statements, that the data processing under consideration
the purpose of the processing in connection with the above - mentioned activity in the case in question, and
assets are determined independently by the Applicant and therefore pursuant to Article 4 (7) of the GDPR
data controller in connection with the processing of the Applicant's personal data.

In the Authority 's view, the reference to an administrative error does not exempt
Claimant from the responsibility of the controller, given that Article 4 (7) of the GDPR

the Applicant qualifies as a data controller. The Applicant is the one who organizes the
the process of data management and establishes its conditions. The most important feature of a data controller
is that it has substantive decision-making power and responsibility for data management
for fulfilling all the obligations set out in the General Data Protection Regulation.

The Working Party on Data Protection set up under Article 29 of the Data Protection Directive (hereinafter
Working Party on Data Protection) 1/2010 on the concept of "controller" and "processor".
He also stated in his opinion that “Ultimately, the company or body needs to
be held responsible for the processing of data and arising from data protection legislation
unless there are clear indications that a natural person is a
responsible. \[…\] However, even in such cases where a specific natural person is appointed,

to ensure compliance with data protection principles or to process personal data, that is
the person will not be a data controller but a legal entity (company or
acting on behalf of the public body, which remains responsible for the principles in its capacity as data controller
in the event of a breach. "

The Applicant carried out two independent proceedings in connection with the case complained of
also referred to an administrative error. One of the administrative errors is against the Applicant
the other administrative error related to the initiation of the recovery procedure is the telephone
omission by the operator, as a result of which the Applicant did not make a telephone call
treated as a complaint or a claim by a data subject. The two were realized independently
"Administrative error" means a high degree of negligence, as if it occurred in the first case

administrative error, in which case it would be viable that the Applicant’s first indication
so, following his phone call on June 23, 2021, action will be taken to correct this, however
this was not done, not even at the time of the Applicant's second telephone call (15 July 2021)
the Applicant was instructed to investigate this case because of an administrative error in the
conditions.

                                                                                              12, the initiation of the recovery process is an internal decision, the initiation of a process involving several persons
presupposes the performance of duties and the preparation and sending of a letter issued, which is why this

can be assessed as a high degree of negligence and negligence.

IV.4. Management of the Applicant's personal data

ARC. 4.1. Data management for receivables management purposes

The Applicant acknowledged that it was in error and in its claims management business processes
Controlled by the descriptive regulations, the Applicant handled the claim for personal purposes
as the Applicant was registered as the heir as a trader, as a debtor a
in his register, even though his estate did not cover the debts of the testator, and

based on this, the Civil Code. nor, accordingly, on the basis of the Applicant's internal regulations
may be required to pay the debt to the heir.

The Applicant with the debtor and his successors in title on the basis of the assignment agreement
became the holder of a claim against (his heirs) in order to enforce the claim,
and had a legitimate interest in the processing of personal data necessary for that purpose
in principle, the purpose of the data processing can be established on the basis of legal regulations and the purpose of data processing is lawful

it counts as.

Article 5 (1) (b) of the GDPR states, among the principles of data processing, that personal data
data may be collected for lawful purposes and may not be processed for that purpose
in a compatible manner.

From the local government competent by the Applicant according to the debtor's place of residence 20.09.2016. on the day

from an acquired disposition order, in which the Applicant is named as heir,
it is clear that the amount of debts exceeds the amount of active assets. Of this
notwithstanding the order, it sent payment orders to the Applicant after receipt of the order
He applied to settle the debt.

The Civil Code. Pursuant to Section 7: 96 (1), the heir for the debt of the estate with the objects of the estate
and is liable to the creditors for their benefits, therefore the Authority considers that the Applicant a

The applicant's personal data was unlawfully processed for the purpose of claim management
infringed Article 5 (1) (b) of the GDPR from the entry into force of the GDPR, ie May 2018
From the 25th day to the date of deletion of the Applicant's personal data, ie 21 August 2021.
until the day.

According to the Applicant's statement, the Applicant was deleted on 21 August 2021
personal data processed for the purpose of claims management after detecting an administrative error

the case was not closed due to. However, the Authority concluded from the facts that it did not
the Applicant detected the administrative error, but the Applicant reported it to the Applicant
also made two telephone calls and initiated data protection official proceedings
Authority, therefore the Applicant's attention was drawn to the fact that the Civil Code
recovery proceedings may not be instituted in respect of that claim. Of this
however, the Applicant did not take action until after receiving the Authority's order
to examine the data management, as the Applicant stated in a letter dated 11 August 2021

stated that “Our company, at the request of the T. Authority, has referred the matter for assignment
reviewed and found the following with effect from. \[…\] Review of the case
On the basis of this, it was found that the Applicant's oral complaint was in full
was well-founded and an employee of our telephone operator failed to take it
instead of submitting the submissions made by the Applicant as an oral complaint, in writing
objection. \[…\]
As a result of the above investigation, our Company has closed the case and the

Applicant as a transaction operator and related personal data in a non-retrievable manner
deleted from its register. "

                                                                                             13, IV.4.2. The legal basis for the processing of the Applicant's personal data for claims management purposes

According to the Data Protection Information of the Applicant, the data processing for the purposes of receivables management is regulated by Article 6 of the GDPR.
Article 1 (1) (f), ie with reference to a legitimate interest.

A IV.4.1. Due to the provisions of point 1
the priority of the legitimate interest in the processing of the data with the rights and interests of the Applicant
therefore could not rely on Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR in this case.
With regard to this purpose of data processing, the Applicant is referred to in Article 6 (1) of the GDPR

nor did it have a specific contractual legal basis (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR),
in view of the fact that the Applicant, as a concessionary claim for management purposes
only a legal basis under Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR can be accepted for the processing of personal data. THE
Mansion Kf.V.39.291 / 2020/5. upheld by judgment of 14 September 2020,
In its final judgment, the Authority shared this view on the applicability of the contractual legal basis
position. The Metropolitan Court of the European Data Protection Board, 2/2019. in its recommendation no
considered the performance of the contract as a legal basis

should be interpreted narrowly and does not automatically cover non-compliance data processing,
or that only by sending a reminder of payment or the normal course of the contract
the processing of data relating to the diversion may fall under the legal basis of the performance of the contract, the original
however, this is not the case for data processing for the purpose of receivables management after the termination of the contract
applicable.

The additional legal bases set out in Article 6 (1) of the GDPR, ie point (a) a

consent, point (c) is not applicable due to a lack of legal obligation, Article 6 (1) GDPR
Paragraph 1 (e) may not be invoked by the Applicant at all, given that it does not
it carries out an activity in the public interest and does not have a public authority license.

On the basis of the above, it can be concluded that the Applicant has been in force since the entry into force of the GDPR, ie 2018.
from 25 May to the date of deletion of the Applicant's personal data, ie 21 August 2021.
has been in breach of Article 6 of the GDPR for the purposes of debt management for the purposes of

Article 1 (1).

ARC. 4.3.Reservation obligation required by law

ARC. 4.3.1. Legacy transfer order

The transfer order and the personal data contained therein (Applicant

name, place and date of birth, name of mother) of the Applicant on credit institutions and financial
CCXXXVII of 2013 on enterprises with regard to Section 258 of the Act (hereinafter: Hpt.)
with reference to Article 6 (1) (c) of the GDPR.

A Hpt. Pursuant to Section 258 (1), a financial institution is subject to business-like activities
records in Hungarian - in accordance with the provisions of Hungarian accounting legislation
in a manner suitable for both supervisory and central bank control.

Section 166 (1) and Section 169 of Act C of 2000 on Accounting (hereinafter: the Act)
Pursuant to paragraphs 1 to 2, personal data shall be removed from the termination of the business relationship, respectively
shall be recorded and kept by the data controller for 8 years from the execution of the transaction order.

An application for cancellation pursuant to Article 17 (3) (b) GDPR is not
can be fulfilled if the processing of personal data is required by law.

In view of the above, it can be concluded that the Applicant has failed to comply with Article 6 (1) (c)
therefore lawfully treats a transfer order (and
personal data of that Applicant).

                                                                                             14, However, the law only imposes an obligation to store, not the stored personal data
can be used.

IV.4.3.2. Sound recording

According to the data management information of the Applicant, it was conducted with the data subjects
telephone conversations are recorded and preserved by the Civil Code. during the limitation period specified in THE
The Applicant argued that there was no such audio material in connection with the Applicant
available to you.

It can be accepted as a fact that the Applicant had a telephone conversation with the Applicant, as
the Applicant is NAIH-5732-4 / 2021. In his statement of order No
that, at the request of the Authority, the case was reviewed and it was established that
The Applicant's administrator made a mistake because he did not receive the Applicant's oral complaint
registered as a complaint. It can be concluded from this that the Applicant a
during the review carried out by the Authority, he heard the data subject

sound recording and drew conclusions from it, so there was a sound recording that a
Recorded conversation between Applicant and Applicant. This is also supported by the fact that the Applicant
During a call on 15 July 2021, his administrator remarked:
with us earlier, with your colleague, you will want to request this recording. ”

In view of the above, it can be concluded that the Applicant is aware of the present data protection authority proceedings
deleted the audio material, the preservation of which is the procedure

would have been justified, in particular with regard to the principle of accountability, and therefore
It would also have had a legal basis under Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Besides other
would have been justified for the purpose of maintaining it, since if the review had established that
complaint was also made during the conversation, the Hpt. Section 288 also provides for such preservation
obligation.

Not about the preservation of the audio material of the telephone conversation with the Applicant

care is also controversial because the Applicant himself acknowledged that the Applicant
he also made a complaint during the first telephone conversation, which - the Applicant
due to the omission of his employee, he did not adjudicate. He was affected by such “complaints”
may be classified as an application taking into account different criteria. THE
The Applicant stated that he had submitted an application to the Applicant, establishing this
it would also have been necessary to preserve the sound material in question at a later date
in order to prove whether the Applicant has lawfully classified the complaint in question as

the non-affected application. Not about preserving the audio of a phone conversation
care actually covers cancellation as it is known for Requested telephone conversations
related to its data management information and considering that based on it
all initiated by the parties concerned to the Customer Service of the Applicant
automatically records a telephone conversation (this is also indicated by the machine voice during the call),
therefore, he also had to record telephone conversations with the Applicant.

The Applicant does not record the preservation of the audio material of the telephone conversation with the Applicant
did not examine whether it was obliged under Article 5 (2) of the GDPR
retained and did so by the time it was deleted by the present data protection authority
proceedings were pending, so in any case the Applicant had to expect that
the applicant must be able to deal with the Authority's claims against the Authority.

In view of the above, the Authority found that by continuing with the Applicant

canceled telephone conversations and was thus unable to call the Authority
infringed Article 5 (2) of the GDPR.

The Authority also mentions here that the Applicant is also involved in the purchase of receivables
financial institution Hpt. Pursuant to § 288, he is also obliged to keep it with the recovery of claims
complaints received in this context, so the Data Protection Information of the Requested

                                                                                             15, is incorrect, as it refers only to Hpt.
To the obligation to keep a complaint under § 288. Obligations prescribed in the Credit Institutions Act

non-compliance with the conservation obligation
the Authority cannot make any findings because it also performs financial consumer protection tasks
It is within the competence of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank. However, the Authority erred in the Request
with regard to its information management information note, the
The applicant also infringed Article 12 (1) of the GDPR and Article 13 of the GDPR.

IV.7. Applicant's comments on the request for an extension of the deadline

The Authority emphasizes that Ákr. does not expressly provide for an application for an extension of time
in the context of its assessment and thus does not provide for it in certain cases
required. Given that the Applicant did not even explain why he was requesting a

extension and could not, in principle, expect the Authority to grant his request,

IV.9.1. The Authority granted the Applicant's request in part and Article 58 (2) GDPR
(b) condemns the Applicant for violating:

- Article 5 (1) (a) and (b) of the GDPR,

- Article 5 (2) of the GDPR,
- Article 6 (1) of the GDPR,
- Article 12 (1) and (4) of the GDPR,

imposition. In this context, the Authority will comply with Article 83 (2) of the GDPR and Infotv.75 / A. §
ex officio considered all the circumstances of the case and found that in the present proceedings
in the case of an infringement detected, the warning is neither a disproportionate nor a dissuasive sanction,
it is therefore necessary to impose a fine.

In imposing the fine, the Authority took the following factors as aggravating factors
take into account:

    1. The violation is serious because the Applicant has committed several violations of principles. (GDPR
       Article 83 (2) (a)

    2. The infringement is serious as the Applicant's sphere of interest was significantly affected by the fact that
       the Applicant tried to collect a claim against him, for the fulfillment of which the Civil Code. 7:96. §
       Under paragraph 1. The gravity of the infringement is aggravated in particular by the fact that

       considered closed by law, considering the Civil Code. related provisions. The Applicant a
       In his telephone call to the Applicant, he specifically referred to the Applicant

       the unlawful data processing affected the Applicant's mourning process in the wrong direction,
       for he was disturbed by the letter of summons of the Requested just when he was in mourning

       to the Applicant that for the purpose referred to it (claim management) the Applicant
       you may not lawfully process your personal information. (GDPR Article 83 (2) (a))

    3. Illegal data processing for a long time (25 May 2018 and 11 August 2021)

       until the deletion of the unlawfully processed personal data). (Article 83 (2) GDPR
       paragraph (a)

    4. The violation caused by unlawful data processing by the Requested is partly intentional
       because of its obligation under Article 5 (2) of the GDPR

                                                                                               18, its fulfillment can not be traced back to the telephone operator's failure to act.
       (GDPR Article 83 (2) (b))

    5. The Applicant canceled the telephone conversations with the Applicant, his employees
       relied on an error instead of accepting liability, for which reason it can be concluded that it did not
       cooperated with the Authority. (Article 83 (2) (f) GDPR)

    6. The Authority has previously condemned the Applicant several times in the GDPR
       as follows:

              - Article 12 (2) of the GDPR and Article 5 (1) of the GDPR
                NAIH / 2019/1841. Resolution No

                and

              - a violation of Article 6 (1) of the GDPR has already taken place in the Applicant
                NAIH / 2019/2566/8, NAIH / 2020/5552, NAIH / 2020/152/2.

       the Authority has already done so

In view of the fact that the Applicant has repeatedly applied the same provisions of the GDPR, Article 5 of the GDPR
In the case of Article 1 (1) (a), it infringed more than one, quantified three cases
as set out above, the Authority will therefore
