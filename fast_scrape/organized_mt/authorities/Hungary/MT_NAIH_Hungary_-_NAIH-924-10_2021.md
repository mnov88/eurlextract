## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant received unsolicited emails from the controller Magyar Telekom Plc., a hungarian telecommunications company. After the receipt of such emails, the complainant requested the controller to delete his email address several times.

The controller continued to send unsolicited messages and required the complainant to register on its webpage to unsubscribe from its newsletter. However, the complainant was unable to unsubscribe from the newsletter since the website asked for customer data, that the complainant (not a customer of the company) could not provide.

The controller argued that the availability of the contact data of the complainant was an individual mistake due to an unknown third party providing their email address. It was therefore not caused by any inadequate internal policies or processes.

### Holding

The Hungarian DPA found that the controller had not confirmed the entitlement of the third party data provider to use the complainant's data. Moreover, it was the controllers decision to introduce unnecessary obstacles to unsubscribe from their newsletter. In this regard, the controller only deleted the email address after being informed about the DPA's investigation. The DPA hold, that the controller failed to implement measures to facilitate the exercise of data subject rights and fined them approximately €28,000 (10,000,000 HUF) for violating Articles 12(2), and 25(2) GDPR.

ARC. Decision of the Authority

IV.1. Assessment of an individual infringement

The Applicant was canceled by the Applicant upon receipt of the Authority's fact-finding order
email address data from its database, therefore fulfilling the request for a cancellation order
it became impossible.

The Applicant did not have a provision under Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
none of the legal bases in connection with the Applicant’s email address and becoming aware of it
- despite the Applicant's repeated express indication - did not comply with the general data protection
obligation under Article 5 (1) (d) of the Regulation is undoubtedly incorrect
expected the cancellation from the Applicant, who, moreover, for reasons falling within the
for some reason he was not even able to. The email address holder is easily identifiable as

it appears in the correspondence as the sender, so there was no circumstance which is the request of the person concerned
would have justified not correcting the error.

The Applicant did not respond to the request of the Applicant concerned, the non-client is concerned
reference to an unsubscribe reference which cannot be used by the Commission - repeated several times without change
Article 12 (3) and (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation
or a duly substantiated rejection.

Pursuant to Article 17 (1) (d) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Applicant became obliged
would have deleted the contact details immediately at the request of the Applicant, but this has been repeatedly requested
nevertheless did not do so and only complied with the Applicant’s request for cancellation when the Authority
became aware of the present proceedings, without which the cancellation would not have taken place. 11

In view of the above, the Authority decided on the individual application for cancellation in accordance with the operative part
of its own motion
Article 5 (1) (d), Article 6 (1), Article 12 (2), (3) and (4) of that Regulation,
and a violation of Article 17 (1) (d) in respect of the Applicant.

IV.2. The role of general practice in relation to an individual infringement

(i) The Applicant's policy regarding the exercise of data subject's rights is contact information
respect

Article 57 (1) (a) and Article 58 (2) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation
and d), Article 83 (1), (2) and (5), and Infotv. 75 / A of the Authority

examined of its own motion in the course of the proceedings the Applicant's general practice affecting the present case
part. The Authority has issued the Infotv. Pursuant to Section 71 (2) in any other proceedings
may use the resulting document in other proceedings.

According to the revealed facts, the Applicant is recording the contact details (telephone number, email address)
does not in any way control the right to control the given contact details,
or if the contact data, which is considered personal data, is not provided by the person entitled to it, no

asks for any proof that you are the owner of the contact details (phone number, email)
contributed. The existence of a legal basis under Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation is the responsibility of the controller
at all stages of data management. For example, entering a one-time code
request, which is sent by SMS or email to the given phone number or email address, is
can prevent a case similar to all Applicants, and this is the case for a large communications provider
in no way a disproportionate obligation.

The Applicant is considered a data controller and is obliged to comply with the general data protection regulation
this obligation may not be partially transferred by certain
administrators and their individual faults or other third parties who have personal data
sources. The controller may only process personal data whose source is lawful, if so
he is not convinced in any reasonable way, he cannot be released from liability.

The Applicant's procedure did not facilitate the exercise of the rights of the Applicant concerned, it is unnecessary for him -
and, if applicable, impossible - condition, login to a third party Telekom account

in the present case several times from the Applicant. General practice of the Applicant,
that in messages sent to the email address assigned to the Telekom account, the unsubscribe link is a
takes you to a login page, direct unsubscription is not possible.

(ii) Similarities of the present case with prior cases

Some parts of the present case and the background cases highlighted by the Applicant are different,

however, the identity exists in the relevant details below which are relevant to the present case.

The common practice of the Applicant in the present case and in individual antecedent cases is to have a newsletter
you do not ask for any proof of the correctness of the given telephone number or e-mail address when signing up,
thus, either due to the fault of the third party customer or the Applicant, there may be a wrong contact
record data.

Following the erroneous recording, there was no correction or deletion of the erroneous data in the individual antecedent cases
possible by the data subject who is the owner of the telephone number or email address. In the present case, too, 12

data protection authority proceedings were initiated because the Applicant was unable to delete the email address himself
because a condition - login to the Telekom branch - was required by the Applicant,
which was impossible to comply with and, despite repeated requests, prior to the Authority 's proceedings, the
Applicant did not remedy it.

The combination of circumstances detailed above has led to the applicant - and the
NAIH / 2018/4939 / V, NAIH / 2019/192, and NAIH / 2019/5205, NAIH / 2020/1773,

your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation have been violated.

(iii) Consideration of relevant statements made by the Applicant on the above issue

Contrary to the statements made during the Requested Procedure, it is detailed in the above paragraphs
circumstances do not constitute an unavoidable cause beyond the control of the Applicant, they are a
Applicant could have effectively and effectively affected both the data collection and the erasure

procedure.

In the Authority's view, contrary to the Applicant's allegations, the Applicant's infringement
the direct reason was not that a third party misrepresented the Applicant’s contact details
to the Applicant, and not a feature of the Gmail system - of which
knowledge of the applicant was expressly acknowledged by the Applicant in the present case by letter received on 19 February 2021.
Nevertheless, the Applicant 's good practice could have ensured that the Applicant - and the

the rights of those involved in background cases.

Confirmation and, if not, automatic deletion of the contact details at the time of data collection
internationally accepted practice and of a similar type and size to the Applicant
telecommunications provider.

Applicant's argument that deleting contact information without logging in is specific

using contact information does not allow because some contact information for multiple accounts
are also incorrect. On the one hand, if several subscribers have data (for example,
email address, contact phone number) and is not entitled to dispose of that contact information
subscriber requests cancellation, he shall, as a general rule, in the absence of a specifically named subscriber,
it is necessary to delete from all accounts, especially if the reason is explicitly that the data is above
the data subject did not consent to the use of the data. In addition, for example, if
places a unsubscribe link in a newsletter and multiple accounts
sent on behalf of an email address, you can place multiple unsubscribe links, which are only

the email address will be deleted for each account (although if, as in the present case, it is unauthorized
person provided the contact address, this is not relevant either). From the above, it is clear that
there is technically no obstacle to resolving them incorrectly without logging in
provided contact data cancellations at the request of the data subjects, and therefore at the sole discretion of the Applicant
was a restriction based on that in both the present case and the individual antecedent cases
led to unnecessary and unlawful processing of personal data.

The official decision in case NAIH / 2020/4999 referred to by the Applicant III. point
the last paragraph expressly stated that “This official inspection shall be limited to the Client’s
its practice in managing direct acquisition contributions
legal compliance, a bottleneck in data management and is not considered
approval and audit of the Client's general data management practices beyond the above,
or certification of conformity. ". The general enforcement of the rights of data subjects shall be carried out by the Authority a
In case NAIH / 2020/4999, it was not examined, it was not established, it is the subject of the proceedings

specifically the data management compliance of the database managing the contributions was in that
whether an unauthorized person could have altered the consent without notice. Accordingly, the applicant 's 13

the data processing detailed in this decision, which is the subject of an ex officio part of the present proceedings
in Case NAIH / 2020/4999
they do not affect the findings of the present case.

The Authority also does not share the Applicant 's view that the Applicant - and similar cases
the persons concerned - do not suffer any pecuniary or legal damage. The general
The Data Protection Regulation protects the right to the protection of personal data, which is

Basic Law VI. Article 8 (3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union
constitutes a fundamental constitutional right. In the relevant legislation - such as
General Data Protection Regulation III. for the protection of fundamental rights
unnecessarily restricting the rights of those affected, making it impossible with administrative barriers
causes damage to fundamental rights even without direct financial loss.

Other than the data recording of the Requested and the practical feasibility of the exercise of the rights concerned

statements as well as the Applicant’s internal tutorials not addressing the above issues
several amendments have not substantially affected the practice examined by the Authority above,
thus, the Authority could not take them into account in the interest of the Applicant.

(iv) Illegality of the Applicant's investigated practice

Pursuant to Article 12 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Applicant has the rights of the data subject

on the other hand, both the recording of contact details and the
the procedure for requesting a repair or cancellation by a person outside the customer in the Applicant's practice
carries with it, in principle and in practice, the possibility of infringing the rights of the data subject,
which has been proven in a number of antecedents.

The Authority shall as detailed in section 1 has repeatedly established the general data protection
Infringement of Article 12 of the Regulation by the Applicant in relation to contact details

due to non-compliance with the exercise of rights.

The problem with the Application has been raised several times, as explained above
occurred at the Applicant and did not cease despite the Applicant's repeated previous statements
as evidenced by antecedent cases and the present case. In addition, the Applicant is not the antecedent either
nor in the present proceedings has it been justified to change its practice in accordance with Article IV: 2.
would be an effective solution to the problems identified in For this reason, the general can be established
also infringe Article 25 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation, as the Applicant is solely his own

defined its organizational procedures as organizational solutions
employed that they involve a real risk of infringement for the data subject, either by the Applicant or by the
in the event of a loss of data by a third party, and in several cases there has been a real infringement.

In view of the above, the Authority considers, in accordance with the operative part, that Article 58 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this paragraph, found that by enforcing the rights of the Applicant concerned
infringes Article 12 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation and

Article 25 (2) and Article 58 (2) (d) of the General Data Protection Regulation
instructed to bring the infringing practice into line with the General Data Protection Regulation.

IV.3. The data protection fine

The Authority is the other measure under Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation

may impose a data protection fine instead or in addition. The Authority is governed by the case law
accordingly, Article 83 (2) 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the imposition of fines in such a case

The decision shall set out the merits of the aspects listed in paragraph
justification.

The Applicant handles a huge amount of personal data, millions of affected customers and
- as in the present case and in Annex II. The cases detailed in point 1 also show an indeterminate number
non-customer handles relevant personal data, aggregate annual revenue for 2020 accounts
according to which it was HUF 524,131,000,000, ie five hundred and twenty-four billion to one hundred and thirty-one million forints

In 2020. In addition, the Applicant's breach of the General Data Protection Regulation is not the first
established by the Authority on several occasions, not once on a substantially related issue. THE
Applicant has repeatedly indicated that he will take steps to avoid similar cases in the future,
however, non-customer stakeholders are still not provided easily and unnecessarily
without administration, under the minimum conditions necessary for data security
right of cancellation. It has long been used, repeatedly causing problems and unreasonable solutions to it
in some cases, only the customer knows the contact information provided incorrectly by the customers

rectified if the data subject requests the deletion just through the contact details complained of, and
the decision rests with clerks who misjudge such obvious cases. Neither the contact information
immediately after the grant of the application does not provide an effective means for the Applicant to
stakeholders to deal with the deletion (e.g. with a link that can be used by anyone, etc.). All this
confirms that the protection of personal data, which is the responsibility of the Authority, cannot be achieved
without imposing a data protection fine. Infotv. None of the mitigating circumstances under § 75 / A exists,
whereas the Applicant is not an SME and is not the first to infringe the General Data Protection Regulation. THE

the imposition of fines serves both special and general prevention, for which the
decision will also be published on the website of the Authority, the identification data of the Applicant
anonymization.

In determining the amount of the data protection fine, the Authority took it as an attenuating circumstance
taking into account that

(a) the applicant has, at the request of the Authority, deleted the
Applicant has unlawfully processed personal data,

(b) the root of the problem was the misrepresentation of a third party (however, the acquisition of knowledge
following an effective solution to the problem would have been the Applicant's obligation in general
under Article 25 of the Data Protection Regulation, failure to do so requires a fine
due to incorrect data alone),

(c) the nature and gravity of the breach are moderately significant in the individual case (the General Data Protection Directive)
infringements other than Article 25 of that Regulation),

(d) the duration of the infringement was not significant in the individual case,
(e) the personal data affected by the breach were contact details only, not sensitive data,

(f) the internal rules were designed to commit an unintentional data breach.

In setting the level of the data protection fine, the Authority took it as an aggravating circumstance
taking into account that

(a) the internal procedural problem giving rise to the infringement has persisted for a long time and the
breach of the obligation under Article 25 of that Regulation,

(b) the applicant's commitments in previous similar cases and the Authority's previous findings
despite eliminating the actual solution to date, no solution has been developed
attempts at the merits of the problem, the right of cancellation is easy and without unnecessary administration
the issue of the exercise of the right has not been addressed, in particular in view of the legitimate need of those concerned to:

to make account registration and other unnecessary administration without the actual data disposition
be able to act by presenting the right,
(c) based on the extent and market position of the Requested 's data processing,
It is up to the applicant not to depend on the individual and unsupervised decision of each clerk

the exercise of rights, especially if the technical subject is much simpler for the data subject
a solution can also ensure the erasure of incorrectly entered data,
(d) the online financial statements are also available according to the 2020 Requested Entity

It had an annual income of HUF 524,131,000,000, ie five hundred and twenty-four billion to one hundred and thirty-one million forints,
thus, a very small fine would have no punitive or deterrent effect.

Based on the above, according to the operative part, the maximum amount that can be imposed by the Authority is approx. four
ten thousand (0.04%) of the case considered the imposition of a data protection fine
proportionate and dissuasive in relation to the Applicant.
