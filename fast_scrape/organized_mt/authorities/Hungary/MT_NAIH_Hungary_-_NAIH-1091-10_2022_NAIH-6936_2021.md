## English Summary

### Facts

Two data subjects received unsolicited commercial emails from a hotel booking website (the controller). They objected to the processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes and requested their email address to be deleted form the controller's register. However, the controller did not comply with the request and continued sending unsolicited emails. The same happened to the second data subject. Additionally, one of the data subjects submitted an access request to the controller but did not receive a response.

Both data subjects filed a complaint with the Hungarian DPA. The DPA initiated an investigation, trying to contact the controller several times. After not receiving any reply, the DPA started sanctioning proceedings.

During the proceedings, the controller argued that it was not aware of the data protection aspect of its activity and only considered it "simple advertising". Moreover, the controller stated that it had given instructions to delete the data from the mailing list, but an error occurred, as a result of which the personal data was still in the register. Furthermore, according to the controller, once the error was remedied, the data subjects were orally informed by a phonecall about the deletion of their data.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller provided misleading information in its privacy policy. Although the controller claimed that the legal basis for processing personal data in relation to newsletters and marketing was consent under [Article 6(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"), the privacy policy mentioned the legitimate interest of the controller. Hence, it confused the data subjects, as to which legal basis was actually used. Moreover, the privacy policy did not expressly mention the purposes of processing personal data. Therefore, the DPA found a violation of [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") as the data subjects were not clearly informed of the purposes and the legal basis for processing.

Additionally, the DPA established a violation of [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") because the consent given by the data subjects was not informed since the controller provided conflicting information about the legal basis. Furthermore, the consent was not obtained separately for every specific purpose as there were no separate checkboxes for data marketing purposes.

The DPA also held that the controller did not have proof of consent, violating [Article 7(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR#1 "Article 7 GDPR"). The controller also violated [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR") as it never sent to the DPA the requested proves of consent or an assessment of balancing the legitimate interests at stake.

The DPA emphasised that data processing for marketing purposes is of a special nature. The DPA referred to [Article 21(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR"), according to which the data subject can at any time object to personal data processing for direct marketing purposes. In such cases, the controller has no discretion, but must delete the personal data ([Article 17(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR")).

Regarding the access request made by one of the data subjects, the DPA found a violation of [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") as the controller never responded to the request.

For the above-discussed violations, the Hungarian DPA fined the controller HUF 500,000.

used as evidence.
IV.1. The Customer's activity and quality of data management
According to the company registry, the Customer's main activity is hotel services, other
its activities include holiday, other temporary services, restaurants and mobile catering.
The Authority established that in the case concerned with the investigated data management, the above mentioned
in connection with its activities, the Customer independently determines the purpose and means of data management
determines, therefore, based on Article 4, point 7 of the GDPR, it is an independent data controller.
IV.2. Electronic mail address as personal data and its storage as data management
Pursuant to Article 4, point 1 of the GDPR, the electronic mail address in relation to a private individual
is considered personal data. Based on Article 4, point 2 of the GDPR, personal data is considered data processing
any operation or set of operations performed on data, i.e. by the Customer storing,
uses it, sends circular emails to the given address, performs data management.
IV.3. Data processing for the purpose of direct business acquisition and its legal basis
IV.3.1. Informing stakeholders
If the personal data concerning the data subject is collected from the data subject, the data controller has a
fair and transparent data management at the time of obtaining personal data
in order to provide data subjects with detailed information pursuant to Article 13 (1) of the GDPR
of what is written in paragraph
Recital (39) of the GDPR and Article 5 (1) point a) of the GDPR stipulate that the
information on data management must be transparent, in an appropriate manner
must be made available to those concerned (e.g. on the website of the data controller), taking into account the chosen
to possible additional conditions of legal bases.
Article 12 of the GDPR defines the formal requirements that must be observed
be the data controllers when they enable and ensure the exercise of data subject rights, including
prior information of those concerned. Based on this, the data controllers can manage personal data
all relevant information in a concise, transparent, understandable and easily accessible form,
they must provide clearly and comprehensibly. This must be made available to those concerned in an appropriate manner
for (e.g. on the data controller's website), taking into account the possible legal grounds chosen
additional conditions. The Customer referred to the General Terms and Conditions being read by the Data Subjects and accepted
away, so they also consented to the processing of their personal data.
Adopted by the Data Protection Working Group established on the basis of Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC, a
Guidelines on transparency facilitating the application and interpretation of GDPR (a
hereinafter: Guidelines) to the data controllers as required by the GDPR
they must provide it in a "concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible" manner. "This information
must be clearly separated from other information not related to data protection,
for example, from contractual provisions or general terms and conditions.” (Guidelines 8.
point)
The "easily accessible" criterion is met if the data controller is
According to the guidelines, if you place the information on the website in such a way that the person concerned has it
you don't have to search and, for example, "Privacy", "Privacy notice" or "Privacy
can be accessed with one click under the heading "declaration". (Point 11 of the Guidelines)
It must also meet the requirement of transparent information in that regard
to the data controller that the purpose and legal basis of the processing of personal data is in the information sheet11
be clearly defined, so avoid 'abstract' or 'ambiguous'
use of expressions.
According to the Authority's findings, the General Terms and Conditions referred to by the Customer in relation to data management
it did not and does not contain provisions, as - as the name suggests - it is
it is about general terms and conditions.
The Customer's website contained its data management information sheet, which was examined by the Authority,
and found that in relation to newsletters, in connection with data management, there are two
also mentions a separate legal basis, points a) and f) of Article 6 (1) of the GDPR. Article 6 (1) of the GDPR
point a) of the paragraph was expressly referred to by the Customer, and the legitimate interest was also indicated,
not specifically as a legal basis, but his legitimate interest ("with partners, hotel guests
established business-related maintenance and development") he named. However, this is not the case
is acceptable, because if you perform data processing with reference to GDPR Article 6 (1) point a),
then it is unnecessary and at the same time misleading to refer to a legitimate interest. The Customer must choose a
of two legal bases, given that each legal basis requires different conditions
as explained above. If the Customer is the start of data management
designates a legal basis before, then the entire data management process must be consistent with it
adjust, which in this case means that it is legitimate for data processing based on consent
reference to interest is not acceptable.
The purpose indicated by the Customer was not properly established either, as it was not for sending a newsletter
the goal is to "keep in touch with potential hotel guests", but information is current
about offers, so direct business acquisition is the actual goal.
By the fact that the Client did not provide clear information regarding the purpose and legal basis, the Authority
in his opinion, the Customer violated Article 12 (1) of the GDPR, as he did not give
clear information neither in the GTC he refers to, nor in the data management policy on his website
by way of information.
IV.3.2. Data subject consent and legitimate interest as the legal basis for data management
Article 6 (1) of the GDPR regulates the legal grounds, including the data subject
consent and legitimate interest.
IV.3.2.1. Data processing for the purpose of direct business acquisition is with the consent of those concerned, so a
It can also be carried out on the basis of point a) of Article 6, paragraph (1) of the GDPR.
In the case of data processing for marketing purposes based on Article 6 (1) point a) of the GDPR, it is essential
condition based on Article 4, point 11 of the GDPR, that the data subjects have adequate information
provide for the granting of consent in connection with the data management conditions
before making their related decision, and also clearly declare the
their contribution. The fact that those concerned must have adequate information
means that the information given to them must be clear and unambiguous, and a
information must have content in accordance with Article 13 of the GDPR. The additional requirement,
that the persons concerned must clearly declare their consent means that
it must be specific, so it must be for data processing related to a specific purpose
apply. III.3.2. due to point 11 of Article 4 of the GDPR, the condition that a
consent must be based on adequate information could not be enforced, because the legal basis
the Client provided conflicting information to those concerned.
The Customer did not comment on whether the subscription to the newsletter had any consequences
with an advantage, as it denied data processing for marketing purposes at the beginning of the procedure, despite the fact that
the data management information on its website specifically provides for this as well. Later, the Customer
In the briefing given to the Authority by his legal representative, he admitted that "\[…\] He really sent a
Ltd. a letter describing special offers to old and satisfied hotel guests,...\[…\]". 12
The Authority notes that the Data Protection Act established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC
The guidelines issued under the number WP259 adopted by the working group are strict
imposes requirements for the exercise of free will, therefore if subscribing to the newsletter
provides some advantage, the extent of that advantage must be examined individually
influences volunteering. The granting of the benefit cannot be limited in any way by those concerned
your rights under GDPR (opt-out, right to erasure). So this means that promotions are not
they can be addressed exclusively to subscribers to the newsletter.
The Authority further established that on the interface where the reservation could be submitted, it
despite the fact that the data management information indicated the legal basis of the consent for marketing purposes
in connection with data management, did not place a separate checkbox for direct marketing purposes
for data management, even though this is an independent purpose, and consent must be obtained separately for each purpose.
Based on the above, the Authority therefore established that Article 6 (1) point a) of the GDPR
legal basis does not exist, as there is no consent pursuant to Article 4, Clause 11 of the GDPR
For the customer's data management for the purpose of obtaining direct business.
IV.3.2.2. In addition to Article 6 (1) point a) of the GDPR, the Customer also has a legitimate interest on its website
referred to in point 4 as follows:
“\[…\]
Legal basis for data management: the consent of the data subject - Article 6 (1) point a) GDPR.
Designation of legitimate interest: business relationships established with partners and hotel guests
maintenance and development
\[...\]"
However, the Client did not refer to the above in his statement sent to the Authority, and a
Despite the authority's express request, it did not specify a legal basis for data processing for marketing purposes
context, since he initially disputed that he was conducting such data management, only the Authority repeatedly
the Client's legal representative acknowledged it in his statement sent to his request.
It can be evaluated as a contradiction in the Customer's statement when he referred to the fact that
those concerned provided their relevant e-mail address when checking in to the hotel
after a verbal question as to whether they can send them notifications about promotions, and then
cited that the email addresses are in "mandatory hotel records".
Based on this, one of the data processing companies indicated data management for the purpose of direct business acquisition
purpose, and then referred to the fact that e-mails are included in mandatory records
addresses, so fulfilling the preservation obligation would be the other goal, however
he did not even indicate the legislation regarding records. Another contradiction is that it is also about
stated that the Customer finally deleted the e-mail addresses and that all e-mail addresses were deleted
from its records, so this contradicts the possible retention obligation. If
the Customer would really have an obligation to keep e-mail addresses, then
you can manage those e-mail addresses only in order to fulfill your retention obligation,
for the purpose of obtaining direct business, i.e. for the purpose of sending newsletters, if the Customer
You do not know your consent according to GDPR, or your legitimate interest in this regard
verify, and in these cases, not even if the Customer requests that the
hereinafter newsletters.
If it performs data processing for the direct purpose of obtaining business with reference to a legitimate interest, it is
Customer, in that case based on the preamble paragraph (47) of the GDPR, with a consideration of interests
must be supported. The Customer's website also refers to the legitimate interest, which may be acceptable
in possession of a consideration of interests, but the Customer did not attach it, nor did it refer to it
to that. The data controller is responsible for the legality of the data management it carries out. Article 6 (1) of the GDPR
arising from the nature of the legal basis according to point f) of the paragraph, to the data controller who has a legitimate interest
refers to, you must be able to indicate precisely that it is the processing of specific personal data
which is the legitimate interest of the data controller and why is it necessary in view of this interest 13
data management, you must at the same time verify and prove that the person concerned has priority
against his legitimate interest and his right to the protection of personal data.
In this context, the Authority emphasizes that data management is for marketing purposes
of a special nature. This is referred to in Article 21 (2) of the GDPR, according to which the data subject can at any time
may object to the processing of personal data relating to him for the purpose of direct business acquisition
against, and if you have done so, then the personal data can no longer be processed for this purpose. In such cases
therefore, the data controller has no discretion as to whether to delete the personal data
data or not, against the processing of which the data subject objected.
IV.3.2.1. and IV.3.2.2. points, the Authority determined that it was handled illegally
the Client violated the GDPR with the personal data of the Data Subjects and other guests
Paragraph 1 of Article 6, because consent according to Article 4, point 11 of the GDPR was not verified by the
He did not substantiate his legitimate interest with the authorities, nor with a consideration of interests.
IV.3.3. Principle of accountability, lack of proof of consent and legitimate interest
An essential condition for the legality of data management is that it has an appropriate legal basis
be.
Article 6 of the GDPR provides for the possible legal bases for processing personal data, i.e
on the cases when a data management can be legal, as long as it is general data protection
complies with the other provisions of the Decree, such a legal basis may be - among others - the person concerned
contribution.
The GDPR does not contain any restrictions on the form of consent, only that
requirements for its validity - voluntary, specific, appropriate information
based on a clear declaration of intent with which the affected statement or confirmation
by means of an unmistakably expressive act, he indicates that he gives his consent to the personal information concerning him
to manage data - define.
Based on Article 7 (1) of the GDPR, if data processing is based on consent, it
data controller must be able to prove that the data subject's personal data
contributed to treatment.
Therefore, if the legal basis of the data management is according to Article 6 (1) point a) of the GDPR
consent, the data controller must be able to prove that he has obtained valid consent
from the data subject, the data subject has given his consent to the data management.
Despite the Authority's express invitation, the Client did not attach a document which
would support that the data subjects gave their consent to the data management, so with this
violated Article 7 (1) of the GDPR.
With reference to the application of Article 6 (1) point f) of the GDPR, i.e. the legitimate interest
the condition for data processing is that the Customer prioritizes its legitimate interests in accordance with the GDPR (47)
in accordance with the preamble paragraph, it is justified by a consideration of interests. However, the Customer is
did not forward his assessment of interests to the Authority, thereby violating Article 5 (2) of the GDPR
paragraph, i.e. the principle of "accountability".
IV.3.4. Fulfilling stakeholder requests
IV.3.4.1. Deletion of personal data and objection to the processing of personal data
In the case of data processing pursuant to Article 6 (1) point f) of the GDPR, the data subject is subject to Article 21 (2) of the GDPR
you can exercise your right according to paragraph 6 of the GDPR.
and in the case of data processing on the legal basis according to Article (1) point a), the data subject
you can withdraw your consent to data management. 14
In the investigation procedures prior to the official procedure, the Stakeholders stated that
objected to the processing of their personal data and wanted to unsubscribe from the newsletters. This
supported by attached documents. The Data Subjects' unsubscribe from the newsletter is
The client did not doubt it either, he admitted this in the official data protection procedure to the Authority
in the statement sent.
The data controller responds to data subject requests as a general rule based on paragraphs (1)-(3) of Article 12 of the GDPR
is obliged to provide transparent and comprehensible information within one month, or to fulfill them, or a
in case of non-performance, to provide information on the reason for the non-performance.
Based on Article 12 (4) of the GDPR, if the data controller does not take measures, the data subject
following your request, without delay, but no later than one from the date of receipt of the request
informs the person concerned about the reasons for not taking the measure within a month, as well as that
the person concerned can file a complaint with a supervisory authority and seek legal remedies
with his right.
According to the Customer's statement, the Customer is in a situation due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) epidemic
probably did not respond due to an administrative error.
Pursuant to Article 4, point 7 of the GDPR, a data controller is a natural or legal person \[…\] that a
determines the purposes and means of processing personal data independently or together with others
\[…\]2.
According to the Authority's point of view, the argument regarding an administrative error does not exempt it
Customer from data controller responsibility, given that pursuant to Article 4, Clause 7 of the GDPR
the Customer is considered a data controller. The Customer is the one who organizes the data management process and
creates its conditions. The most important characteristic of the data manager is that it is meaningful
has decision-making authority and is responsible for all data management, that
for the fulfillment of the obligation laid down in the general data protection regulation. In those cases,
when a specific natural person is appointed to ensure the data protection principles
compliance or to process personal data, this person will not be a data controller,
but acts on behalf of the legal entity (company or public body) which
in its capacity as a data controller, remains responsible in the event of a violation of the principles.
The Customer stated that, after his default, he complied with the Data Subjects' request and deleted
electronic mail addresses. However, the Client does not, despite the Authority's express request
attached the document that would support this statement, i.e. that it is
In accordance with Article 12 of the GDPR, data subjects were informed about the fulfillment of their data subject request. THE
In the statement sent to the authorities, the Customer only referred to the fact that the Data Subject 1
"spoken", however, this does not comply with GDPR Article 12 (1) and GDPR Article 5 (2)
of the provisions of paragraph 2, and he did not even mention the Data Subject 2.
Based on GDPR Article 17 (1) points b), c), d), the Customer is obliged to provide the e-mail
to delete their addresses based on the request of the data subjects, as they must be deleted even if they are revoked
their consent, or in the case of an e-mail address managed with reference to a legitimate interest, objects to it
and there is no overriding legal reason for data processing, and even then it is personal
data was handled illegally. In the present case, the Authority established that the Customer
handled the e-mail addresses of the data subjects illegally and without legal basis, therefore Article 17 point d) of the GDPR
there is an obligation to delete based on Given that the Data Subjects have indicated that they are not
they want to receive newsletters in the future, so based on this they automatically had to do it
would have the Customer cancel it.
2GDPR Article 4.7 "data controller": the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body that
determines the purposes and means of processing personal data independently or together with others; if the purposes of data management and
its means are determined by EU or member state law, the data controller or the special data controller designation
aspects can also be determined by EU or member state law; 15
Due to the above, the Authority determined that the Customer violated Article 12 (1) - (4) of the GDPR
paragraph, as it did not comply with the deletion request of the Data Subjects. The Customer is only the data protection
deleted the personal data processed for marketing purposes after the initiation of the official procedure, so a
in this case, following the submission of data subject requests requiring automatic deletion
also managed (stored and used) personal data for a long time. Furthermore, no
proved that after the deletion took place, he notified the Data Subjects of this in writing, only
sent a statement about it.
IV.3.4.2. Access request
According to the documents of the investigation process initiated by Data Subject 2, Data Subject 2 also submitted an access request
submitted to the Customer on 20.03.2019. on the day of Subject to the request submitted on the basis of the data subject's right
2 did not receive a response from the Customer.
Based on Article 15 (1) of the GDPR, the data subjects are entitled to request information about their personal data
about the circumstances of its treatment, thus their personal data based on Article 15 (1) point g).
also about its source.
Despite the Authority's express request, the Customer did not make a statement submitted by Data Subject 2
about the non-fulfillment of his access request, the reason for it, and he did not substantiate it either
the Customer acknowledges that he has fulfilled this request, despite the fact that Article 5 (2) of the GDPR
would be obliged to do so based on the principle of accountability.
For data subject requests, including access requests in accordance with the GDPR, the data controller shall comply with Article 12 of the GDPR.
based on paragraphs (1)-(3) of Article, as a general rule, it must be transparent and understandable within one month
to provide information and fulfill them, or in case of non-fulfilment, the fulfillment
to provide information on the reason for the absence.
Given that the Customer did not prove that the Data Subject 2's access request
fulfilled, therefore the Authority found that it also violated the GDPR in this context
the provisions of Article 12 (1) – (4).
IV.3.5. According to the Customer's observation, there would have been no reason to initiate this procedure,
or it should have been terminated after deleting the Data Subjects' personal data.
Considering that the Client is the Authority NAIH/2020/1247. and NAIH/2020/147. test no
he did not respond to his calls in his proceedings, and for this reason it could be assumed that he was

Regarding the above, the Authority refers the Client to NAIH-6936-1/2021. he also informed in his order no
there he also highlighted that in order to move the official data protection procedure, Infotv. § 55, paragraph (1).
point ab) and Infotv. It took place on the basis of § 60, paragraph (1).
The history of the official data protection procedure initiated ex officio was therefore started on the basis of the reports
was an investigation procedure, which ended unsuccessfully due to the Customer's lack of cooperation.
Neither Ákr. nor Infotv. does not contain a provision that the procedure by the Customer
must be terminated for the reason cited.
IV.4. Legal consequences
