## English Summary

### Facts

In September 2021, the Hungarian DPA initiated an _ex officio_ investigation against Budapest Bank Zrt. (hereinafter the Bank) related to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) software applied to the audio recordings of customer service telephone conversations between May 2018 and the start of the investigation.

According to the Bank, the software used speech signal processing based on AI to identify periods of silence, different voices talking at the same time, key words, and emotional elements (such as voice speed, volume and pitch) within the recorded sound files in order to identify customer dissatisfaction. Once the software had made an automated decision to identify calls according to these criteria, a Bank employee then listened to the recordings, and made call-backs to customers in order to handle and attempt to resolve any customer dissatisfaction issues.

The Bank stated that its legal basis for this processing was based on legitimate interest, and its purpose was to conduct call quality control, to prevent complaints and customer churn, as well as to increase efficiency.

The Bank stated that customers were informed at the beginning of the calls that they were being recorded, but admitted that they did not inform them that the AI software would be used to analyse the calls, since detailed information in this regard would make the introduction to the calls too long, outlasting many of the simple queries made by customers when calling the Bank. The Bank also claimed that the system did not store any identifiable personal data, or perform automated decision-making in order to create personal profiles.

Additionally, in a Data Protection Impact Assessment carried out by the Bank, the Data Protection Officer stated that: “_The purpose of the processing is lawful on the basis of the rights of the data subjects and the business interests of the Bank, there is no direct or indirect legal prohibition. The processing is high-risk for several reasons, in particular the novelty of the technology used, as the audio recordings are analysed and findings are made automatically by artificial intelligence. The aggregate data is suitable for profiling or scoring for both sets of data subjects_ \[customers and employees\]_, and although no automated decision making is involved, the data processing may have legal effects on the data subjects. The high risk is mitigated by the controller through measures identified in the impact assessment, such as human decision-making at the end of automated processing. The exercise of data subjects' rights is ensured in accordance with standard practice._”

### Holding

#### Personal data

The NAIH first established that the software processed personal data since the data subject was indeed identifiable within this processing, due to the fact that the customer service calls are assigned a unique internal identification number that can be linked to the both the caller and the customer service employee. According to the NAIH, this processing was analogous to case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union [C-582/14](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C%E2%80%91582/14_-_Patrick_Breyer "CJEU - C‑582/14 - Patrick Breyer"), which established that dynamic IP addresses are also personal data.

The NAIH also stated that the use of AI to identify emotional states should be considered processing of a sensitive nature, and could fall under the special category of personal data within the meaning of [Article 9(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#1 "Article 9 GDPR") in certain cases. However, the NAIH held that in this specific case [Article 9(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#1 "Article 9 GDPR") did not apply to the processing, since the voice analysis did not produce data that in itself could uniquely identify a data subject (and therefore could not be considered biometric data), and due to the fact that no meaningful inference as to the physical or mental state of health of the data subject could be drawn from the result of the processing.

#### Automated decision-making and profiling

The NAIH held that automated decision-making was carried out in this case, since it is not a prerequisite that the software makes the decision itself, and that it is sufficient if the processing is intended to produce an outcome that influences the decision-makers. The NAIH also established that profiling also took place according to the definition in [Article 4(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#4 "Article 4 GDPR"), since the prioritisation of dissatisfied customers based on keywords and emotions implies the evaluation of personal aspects cited in this provision.

Based on these assessments, and the fact that this is a novel technology, the NAIH noted that the processing created increased risks to fundamental rights, which also imply increased responsibilities on the controller. Therefore, the NAIH held that before rolling out the automated voice analysis using emotional AI, the Bank should have assessed whether the processing was feasible under the current technical and social circumstances, and taken into consideration appropriate safeguards to comply with data protection laws and the principle of data protection by design. Based on these considerations, the NAIH held that the Bank’s failure to carry out these obligations constituted a violation of [Articles 24(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR#1 "Article 24 GDPR"), [25(1)](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR#1 "Article 25 GDPR") and [25(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR#2 "Article 25 GDPR").

#### Lack of proper information and right to object

The NAIH noted that no information was given to the data subjects regarding the voice analysis, in particular about the specific types of data processed, as well as how their emotional reactions were processed and assessed. According to the NAIH, this constituted a breach of [Articles 12(1)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR"), [13](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"), [5(1)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1 "Article 5 GDPR") and [5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR").

Furthermore, according to its previous assessments regarding automated decision-making and profiling, the NAIH held that absence of information given to data subjects regarding their right to object lead to a breach of [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR"). Additionally, the NAIH also considered that processing for customer retention purposes constituted a marketing purpose similar to customer acquisition, and that therefore the Bank violated data subjects’ right to object under [Article 21(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#2 "Article 21 GDPR") as well.

#### Balancing of interests and lawfulness of processing

The NAIH held that the Bank had provided no concrete evidence that it had carried out an adequate balance of interests between its claimed legitimate interest to carry out the processing, and the rights of the data subjects involved.

The NAIH noted that according to the technical documentation provided by the Bank, the effectiveness of the emotion analysis software is actually relatively low, and that the Bank had failed to prove that, in its current form, its use was suitable to achieve its proposed objectives in a way that was proportionate to the effect on data subjects’ rights. The NAIH also noted that the Bank had not demonstrated that any alternatives to this processing were considered.

The NAIH also cited the [European Data Protection Board and European Data Protection Supervisor’s Joint Opinion 5/2021 on the Artificial Intelligence Act](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-06/edpb-edps_joint_opinion_ai_regulation_en.pdf), which states that _“the use of AI to infer emotions of a natural person is highly undesirable and should be prohibited, except for certain well-specified use-cases, namely for health or research purposes.”_ Based on these criteria, the NAIH concluded that the Bank’s stated efficiency purposes were not proportionate to justify the use of a form of data processing that EU data protection bodies have considered undesirable and constitute a high risk to data subjects' fundamental rights.

The NAIH also noted that not only the voices of the Bank's customers were analysed, but also the voices of its employees. The NAIH stated that although monitoring performance and quality assurance may give rise to legitimate interests in certain circumstances according to labour law, the question of suitability and proportionality was also relevant in this case, especially because employees are in a vulnerable position in the context of a labour relationship. The NAIH established that these factors were not taken into account due to the Bank's failure to conduct an adequate balance of interests, and that an adequate system of guarantees was not provided for employees.

Therefore, the NAIH held that the bank could not claim legitimate interest as a valid legal basis under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") (or any other legal basis listed in [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR")) for the processing in question. It therefore held that the Bank had violated [Articles 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), [6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") and [6(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#4 "Article 6 GDPR").

#### Fine and order to comply with GDPR

Based on these considerations, the NAIH imposed a fine of HUF 250,000,000 (approximately €700,000) on the Bank, and ordered the Bank to cease its use of AI to analyse emotions in the recordings of customer service calls unless it provided proof, within 60 days, that: an appropriate scope of data was defined; a proper data impact assessment was carried out; and a valid legal basis was provided which ensured that data subjects’ rights are protected to the maximum extent possible.

With regard to the Bank's employees, the NAIH held that processing should be limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is intended, and that they should be provided with appropriate information, indicating the assessment criteria and consequences, and including a specific balancing of interests that addresses their vulnerability due to the nature of their labour relationship, with appropriate internal safeguards.

I. Procedure

I.1. The History Case

1. In the preliminary examination procedure NAIH-5161/2021 (hereinafter referred to as

Customer) as a legal entity engaged in the activity of a financial institution
data management to record the recorded audio of customer service calls automatically
analyze and provide adequate information to stakeholders. The Customer is the analysis
using the result, determine which dissatisfied customer needs to be recalled,
in this regard, it automatically analyzes, among other things, both the caller concerned and the caller
the emotional state of the customer service employee and other characteristics of the conversation. The History
In the case, the complainant can find a sentence on the Client's website referring to the sound analysis

asked questions in this regard but was not satisfied
replies to the Authority.

(2) At the request of the Authority, the Client received the number NAIH-5161-5 / 2021 on 5 July 2021.
In its reply, filed under
In the present proceedings, the Authority also classified Annex III to the explanatory memorandum. at point:

   (i) The sound analysis application (hereinafter: Software) was introduced by the Customer on 26.05.2017. THE
   The aim of the development was to make the work of the nearly 180 telephone staff more productive,
   by improving the call selection process of about 20 call-backers. THE
   retrievals are made by random selection while using the system, but
   calls are ranked by the Software based on the characteristics established by the Software. These characteristics

   are not known to the Customer, it is handled privately by the software. Detailed call evaluation
   results, the evaluated aspects are not known.
   (ii) The purpose of the Software is to make quality control more professional for Customer's employees

   individual development (professional and communication), improving the efficiency of processes and
   increase customer experience. The system does not store any uniquely identifiable data,

or customer information. The data are analyzed together. Areas of application of the program
does not include increasing sales results.
(iii) One of the main areas of use is call quality control (interception): to be assessed
calls are sorted by the analysis team for listeners. Sorting criteria

includes data from the Software (eg, dissatisfaction, frustration, etc.)
these are parameters that can be changed on a monthly basis in order to be the most effective
quality assurance, ie they can reveal the shortcomings and possible directions of development.

(iv) The second main area of use is to prevent complaints and customer migration: monthly in advance
a specified number of customers are called proactively in order to file a complaint
prevent or deter potential customer migration. Enter keywords into the system
based search criteria have been set up to help you find the
affected customers. This report can be run on a daily basis and the eavesdropper will randomly,
choose freely from potential calls.

(v) The third main area of use is to increase efficiency: team leaders on a daily basis
examine for their team which calls were higher than average and why
idle (silence / music) ratio. This is done in exceptional cases for the individual development of staff, respectively
used to improve process efficiency.

(vi) The mandatory element of the concept of personal data is missing, the data is definitely natural
being personal. The Software analyzes the conversation and therefore without eavesdropping (which
and a new data management process) none of the characteristics of the conversation can be identified.

(vii) Aggregate data on the regulated business process conducted on the basis of the script
they only allow a conclusion to be drawn from the discussions. Breaks, idling
length, even for a given administrator, is not an indicator of individual aptitude, but indicates that

special support is required for your work. For example, if you have a cumbersome IT system
waiting time for access causes longer silence.
(viii) The Software is similar to, for example, traffic counters, traffic lights
which also determine the number of persons involved in the traffic (otherwise

identifiable) of natural persons crossing the crossing,
however, their operation is not considered as personal data processing in practice.

(ix) The purpose of data processing is to deal with complaints and faulty banking procedures not complained of in the complaint.
reduce the number of efficient, courteous customer service to ensure control procedures
by supporting its effectiveness, as detailed above. Legal basis for data management
the legitimate interest of the Customer detailed in the description of the data management purposes is effective and lawful

telephone administration. The duration of data management may be retrieved within the Software
45 days for audio recordings, statistics generated by the operation of the Software

can be minimized.

(xi) \[…\] voice recorder operation:

\[…\] Records all audio by default. An automatism runs down every night

on the voice recorder server, which destroys calls in less than 5 seconds. Default, 4

   all calls are deleted after 180 days, except for calls with a business label

   removes it from the hit list. Nevertheless, it remains in the internal system of the Software

   calls can be listened to until the 45th day after recording. There will be no calls after this
   can be listened to within the Software.

   (xii) Within the Software, the \[…\] (\[…\]) option allows \[…\] and
   to listen to and analyze calls from voice recording systems \[…\] - \[…\]. Also
   it is possible to monitor and categorize calls made and received \[…\] and \[…\] differently

   The conditions of Article 22 (2) shall not apply.

   (xix) The information of the data subject is provided to the Customer by Chapter 3 of the Business Rules and by Telephone

   customer service and complaint handling through detailed data management information provided by
   attached to his reply.

   (xx) The Software has been operating without complaint since its introduction.

In its reply, registered under number

which the Authority has also classified in the present proceedings in Annex III to the explanatory memorandum. at point:
   (i) “On this basis, it can be concluded that the main purpose of using the application is call time
   promotion of abbreviations. The Bank's telephone customer service capacity is limited. Therefore, the call time

   shortening to ensure that significant customer irritation is reduced,
   cease. This is the purpose of breaks in conversations, listening to waiting music
   the Bank achieves by examining. In these cases, the calls from my co-workers are statistical
   processed by other methods and only listened back if necessary. Their purpose is to have a conversation
   find bugs in control scripts that wait, play music, or talk to each other
   (clutter of the clerk and the interlocutor). In this case, the
   or those who are automatically scheduled to be retrieved from your conversations

   are listened to in full, but in part on the basis of the aspects examined. So the
   eavesdropping worker does not hear the customer identification part. The application supports the same
   aspects per employee. This is in a performance - based pay system, 8

helps the employee to improve the efficiency of an individual call, the time required for their calls
reduce it. "
(ii) “The result of the screening may be overridden at any time by the wiretapping officer. The software
it only gives the listener a “menu” to choose from, but the decision is always a

competence of the colleague in the process. "
(iii) Employee contributions not used in operational work are listed in Appendix
Customer has repealed and attached the enforced regulations (\[…\] - A

recording, retrieving and handling telephone conversations at banking group level), and
also updated organizational changes while streamlining the annexes.
(iv) The Software is not a call recording system. This task is performed by the \[…\] and \[…\] systems.

These are used to transfer calls to the Software system. The data content of the Software is the call
caller ID in the recording system, the calling / called telephone number, the direction and time of the call,
length, name of the clerk, organizational unit, date of the analysis, quantified (%)
results, alphanumeric description of the recognized language elements.

(v) Customer retention or pre-complaint calls:
   • The listener launches a filter based on the rules and keywords set in the system

   for the period of his choice.
   • The Software lists the results, that is, the calls that match the filtering
   conditions.

   • The staff member randomly selects from the suggested calls and listens (typically
   the call segment indicated by the Software). If this is confirmed by the Software, it is complete
   it is advisable to listen to the call.

   • After listening back, you decide if it is possible in the given case
   customer retention or complaint prevention.

   • If so, it retrieves the customer's data from the banking systems.
(vi) Detected emotions can also be displayed at the call level. These can be aggregated into groups and

area level and sort by emotion strength.

(vii) No information will be given at the beginning of the calls as to whether to use the Software or whether
data processing for voice analytical purposes. In the case of an incoming call (\[…\]), \[…\]
tell the voice recording. In the event of an outgoing call (\[…\] and \[…\]), the staff member will inform you of the
recording. If the customer complains about the use of the software, the clerks
shall be informed of the possibility of recording the notification. If necessary, the complaint will be picked up,

which will be investigated by the Complaints Office - if necessary by the Data Protection Officer
involving. We would like to note that verbal information at the beginning of telephone calls
its practical possibilities are severely limited. A few words of information necessarily
misleadingly, forcing the data subject to an unjustifiably disadvantaged communication situation. Detailed,
and thorough information does not allow for live audio as required by law
compliance with contact requirements. A significant portion of phone calls are customer
interest. A customer for the opening hours of an account or the current balance of an account

Detailed information provided prior to responding to a request would necessarily violate Article 12 of the GDPR.
the requirement of conciseness of information under Article 1 (1) because it is temporal
its scope would far exceed the substantive administration, the actual data management.

(viii) The possibility of protesting without breaking the line is precluded by technical circumstances. If
human intervention could influence the analysis of a failed call,

   subtraction, would significantly skew the efficiency of the analysis, as it is the anomalies
   protest and agent intervention are expected in the case of a call containing

   (ix) The information is provided by the Client on the website https://www.budapestbank.hu/panaszkezeles.

   (x) Upon termination of the primary purpose of data management, the Customer shall delete from the production systems
   data, but the referenced 42/2015. (III. 12.) Government Decree § 3 (3) e) and (4) the Customer

   makes it an obligation to create and manage archives, data backups and backups.
   The order of their access corresponds to the concept of blocking according to the GDPR, therefore they are described in this way
   provided information to the Customer. The management rules of archive media are in the records management regulations
   is located.

   (xi) In addition to the questions, it is worth highlighting from the experience of personal control that a
   emotional indications of sound analysis for sound property and terms used

   are set up and therefore give false results about calls without human control. On the other hand
   there are people with a voice - our employee had one too - whose voice
   it always reflected dissatisfaction. These are also given, while the pause-to-speech ratio is intertwined
   speech and the speech / music ratio are relatively objective characteristics of conversation, until then
   emotional tone, so the dissatisfaction and frustration experienced are less reliable characteristics.
   This is taken into account by my colleagues when using the system.

   (xii) The caller will only be identified if it is necessary to compensate him due to a bank failure,
   or the Customer seeks to resolve your latent complaint in a reassuring manner.

    individual functional management members for their entire area, by area (\[…\]), by group,
    they may receive unmeasured quality data per clerk.
    \[…\], Using speech intelligence processing based on artificial intelligence, recognizes:

    • waiting / silence / talking to each other in the sound files,

    • recognizing and finding keywords in audio files
    • detects emotional / mood elements in sound files.

    Measuring the wait / silence allows the area manager to identify the
    launch a reduction factor and action at both the individual and regional level
    (eg individual development, field training, process development, etc.)., 10

 Keyword recognition (based on a dictionary we developed) allows complaining customers
 filtering and churn prevention, detection of prohibited / stuffed words.
 Detection of emotional / mood elements in calls shows the true customer experience
 or customer irritation.

 The Software will store the audio in encrypted form on its own storage for 45 days, thereafter
 destroys them. Previous audio analyzes have continued
 they can be retrieved, but the call cannot be deduced from them. "

III. Findings and decision of the Authority

III.1. Recorded conversations conducted by Customer's telephone customer service
description of data management related to the analysis of sound recordings

(39) The Client, as a financial institution, operates a telephone customer service. In this context, certain
In some cases, it is a legal obligation to record a conversation with telephone customer service
and preservation. The present procedure of the Authority is the further processing of data on recorded audio files

focused on operations, not voice recording.

(40) The data controller is the data processing carried out in connection with the sound analysis with the Software
in the case of both the decision-making authority and the Client's own statements. It is up to the Customer to decide
the use of the Software and its terms of use in internal regulations.

(41) All telephone customer service calls are non-substantive calls of a few seconds

except for the audio of the call is recorded and stored in the Customer's systems.

(42) The recorded audio material is included in the Customer's telephone customer service employee
as a concerned person and a third party called by him or by calling the Customer’s telephone customer service
the affected voice of a party, in addition to which a single unique is associated with it in all systems of a Client
caller ID, caller / called phone number, call direction, time, agent name,
organizational unit.

(43) Every night an automation runs on the Customer 's voice recording server, which destroys the 5
seconds. Speech signal processing based on artificial intelligence
in addition, the wait / silence / talk to each other is automatically analyzed,
the keywords from the list provided and the emotional / mood status of the speaker. This
may be associated with a specific person as it may be filtered out if the Software affects an employee’s emotion
recognized and not the caller, which is the default assignment provided by Customer in the above (4)
paragraph (xi). Declaration under the same subparagraph -

and the technical “voice
A system based on the recognition of emotions under the annex entitled "screens.docx.doc", 19

its efficacy is highly questionable, as there was no recognizable emotion in 91.96% of cases
in. In this respect, the Authority emphasizes that personal data are not
but will be personal data when assigned to a specific person. For example, an inaccurately recorded and
unrealistic storage of data stored in connection with a given identifiable data subject
there will be treatment on the part of that data controller as if the data were accurate.

data, however, their processing affects the privacy of the data subjects.

(45) The Authority considers that the data generated by the data processing under investigation are general
special categories of personal data under Article 9 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation
in the light of all the circumstances of the present case, it held as follows. Sound analysis

of the data that make up the result, only emotion, mental state is what is given
biometric data or health data. In the present case, the
according to the revealed facts, the data analysis does not create data that uniquely identify the data subject,
thus, this condition of biometric data is missing. And that condition does not apply to health data
that a meaningful conclusion can be drawn as to the physical or mental state of the person concerned
deducted from the outcome of the data processing at issue in the present case. Regardless, not the employee
method or the quality of the data itself, the conditions are not met, so it may be different

In similar cases, similar data may be classified as a special category of personal data
other circumstances, in conjunction with additional data - which is present
the above conditions are met.

(46) Based on the above, the Software evaluates by waiting / talking / talking to each other.

however, they remain beyond the sound recording system. In this context, paragraph 3 (iii) above

The data management information containing the content indicated in subsection 3.1.8 only refers back to the provisions of section 3.1.8
which lists different retention periods for several data processing purposes for different purposes is not clear and
transparent to the average stakeholder.

(48) The Software will rank the calls based on the above, which is a suggestion of which
the data subject should be recalled in the first instance, which complainant is more dissatisfied. In this, the data subject a
to describe a typical emotional, mental state based on an analysis of the Software at the time of the call
data is also stored in the Software when connected to the call. Based on this, the Client is in a senior position

employees decide which customer service to call back to deal with dissatisfaction
for the purpose. The purpose of the Software is not to handle individual complaints, the complaint indicated on the telephone
regardless of the operation of the Software, any complaint will be handled in any way
by customer service staff. The purpose of the recall is not to deal with the specific complaint, but to
regardless of the resolution of the specific complaint of the customer in principle
filtering and management.

(49) The Client’s decision in the History Case referred to in sub-paragraphs (iii), (iv) and (v) of paragraph 2 above
the purpose of data management is to control the quality of calls with variable parameters, 20

based on, complaint and customer migration prevention, and call handling staff
increase its efficiency. The information provided to the persons concerned on the Customer's website in accordance with paragraph 3 (iii) above
The data management prospectus containing the content indicated in subsection 1 is very general in the first place
in relation to data management, "performs profiling based on a legitimate interest and automatic decision - making
selects calls in which a higher-skilled bank employee recalls
eliminates the problem of the telephone conversation, complaint "does not inform the sound analysis is substantive
method and essence, does not articulate clearly. The prospectus also covers quality assurance and

complaint prevention is for purposes only, but also the above description, which does not provide meaningful information
concerns the prevention of a complaint. For this reason, with the existence of data management, its essential content
and all its purposes are clearly unaware of those concerned, and this
information is not received during a phone call or callback.

(50) The Client has based the above data processing on its legitimate interests in order to retain its clients and
increase the efficiency of its internal operation. These interests, which are very different,

however, no data processing is required in either the minimum prospectus or the balance of interests
separated, they were handled together by the Customer.

(51) Although not the subject of the present proceedings, the Authority notes that it is general
Prior to the entry into force of the data protection decree, the Infotv.
Pursuant to Section 68 (4), due to the application of the new data processing technology, the examined
data protection registration would not have been automatic. The Authority is the Customer

upon request, the conditions and guarantees of data processing in such cases shall be individually assessed by the Authority
without its prior approval, the Customer would not have been able to start processing the data. Because this is
the approval procedure was not blamed on the Client, therefore the Authority obtained it with a significant delay
be aware of this data management. In addition, the information sent by the Client to the Authority
pursuant to Article 30 of the General Data Protection Regulation
nor does it mention the data management records related to sound recordings by processing the sound recording
data management, storage only.

III.2. Application of the General Privacy Policy to Data Management with the Software

(52) Under Article 4 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the quality of 'personal data' can be
indirect identification is also sufficient.

(53) Article 57 (1) (a) and Article 58 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
Article 83 (1) (b) and (d), Article 83 (1), (2) and (5) and Infotv. Pursuant to § 75 / A a
Authority examined ex officio in the course of its proceedings the general practice of the Customer affecting the present case
part. The Authority shall inform Infotv. Section 71 (2) in any other proceedings
may use evidence in other proceedings.

(54) The Client stated that it had received a letter dated 5 July 2021, registered under number NAIH-5161-5 / 2021.
in its response to the History Case that, in its opinion, the Software does not store an identifier

data and analysis results generated by the Software by the caller and customer service representative
is not personal information about his emotional state because it cannot be linked to anyone, and the system a
compared to the operation of traffic counters and traffic lights. That's obvious
denies the NAIH-5161-10 / 2021 received by the Client in the History Case on 16 August 2021
information in its reply, registered under number, that the customer service telephone calls are one
they have a unique internal identification number that is on the Customer's systems in addition to the Software
they can also be contacted within the caller and the customer service representative and this unique ID

is also used as a pseudonym by the Software. When applying the consequence (eg recall,
sending to training) this connection is realized. A traffic counter or traffic light, 21

for example, the fourth car that passed in front of it and the driver cannot be re-identified
to draw. The Software does not operate on this principle at all, but is expressly intended to be specific
to take action.

(55) Based on the above, both parties to the call can be clearly identified by the Customer, which

during the normal operation of the system, the Customer shall continuously
whose recorded calls are intercepted and subsequently recalled accordingly, or
an employee working by telephone customer service is evaluated based on this. If you didn't
the Customer, but you would have the opportunity to do so, it would still be personal data for analysis by the Software
result until the irreversible termination of the relationship with that identifiable

stakeholders.

(56) The above interpretation is confirmed, inter alia, by the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-582/14
judgment on dynamic IP addresses analogous to the present case, which are also personal data
for all controllers who, by lawful means, even indirectly,
access to the information from the ISP

which subscriber belonged to an IP address at a given time. In this case, the required identifier
information-alias ID link with phone number and other call details
- is available to the Client within its own systems, so there can be no question that it is legal
a tool was available for this. It is important to emphasize that it is a legal instrument designated by the court
the concept does not refer to the lawfulness of data processing, compliance with data protection rules,
but that the instrument used is not in itself infringing (such as a black market

database is an infringing tool regardless of the data processing it performs). By infringing means
it is not possible to carry out lawful data processing from the outset, but by lawful means from other conditions - purpose,
legal basis, etc. - depending on the law, the data processing may be lawful or illegal. In the absence of identifiable
based on the results of the analysis, the customer service would obviously not know who to call back,
nor would the customer service staff be as controllable as the Customer
checks them on the basis of its own declarations.

(57) Although the Authority's investigation focused on the operation of the Software, it is such a complex data management
the nature of the personal data is not determined by the fact that they can be identified within a subsystem.
e is concerned. It is necessary to examine all data sources legally available to the Customer
whether the condition of direct or indirect identification is met. The pseudonym

(use of pseudonymous identifiers) enhances data security, but is not affected by
unique identifying nature and quality of personal information of third party affected callers
with regard to. With respect to Customer's telephone customer service personnel a
the nature of personal data cannot even be questioned, as their names are also stored in that particular recording
linked to an analysis result that is linked to a specific audio recording. The third
Article 4 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation is implicit in relation to data subjects

identifies identifiable with direct identification and general
Under Article 4 (5) of the Data Protection Regulation, the pseudonymous identifier itself is personal data
other information stored in connection with it, provided that the identifier itself is given
can be linked to a natural person. And a phone call doesn’t exist on its own, there is one behind it
is a natural person. Customer service is always available at the beginning of telephone conversations
identifies the person you are talking to, so both the listener and the potential

retrievable recordings contain identifying information. That it turned out to the Customer
according to his own statement, that in some cases the emotion recognized belonged to his own employee,
it also justifies the possibility of unique identification.

1https: //curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf? Docid = 184668 & doclang = HU & cid = 1095511, 22

(58) Based on the above, the emotional state recognized by the Software, the length of silence, and the
data associated with the caller ID and telephone number used will continue to be personal data

shall be deemed to be independent of their encryption or pseudonymisation as long as they belong to certain persons
may be linked to other data lawfully available to the Customer. The tapping back
during the first audible data on the audio recording is always the identification of the speaker, so the listener
in the case of recordings, there is not even a pseudonym at this point in the data management. It is independent of that

whether the connection is made by the Customer in 2 specific cases, it is sufficient that legal means are available a
available to you. From the fact that the length of silence, for example, is not primarily to the calling party, but to
draw conclusions about the work of a customer service representative - which you are
whether or not they are relevant to the human inspection - even where appropriate by the worker
their personal data for the duration of the data processing. The fact that a piece of data is subsequently incorrect, inaccurate

it turns out it does not yet call into question the nature of its personal data, as any - not just real
- data linked to a specific natural person results in personal data.

(59) In the light of the above, the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation apply in principle
apply to data management using the Software and is not applicable in the present case

the opposite is true.

III.3. Application of Artificial Intelligence in the Software

(60) The Client received the present proceedings on 29 October 2021 under number NAIH-7350-2 / 2021.
in its registered reply, it stated that “the Software does not use artificial intelligence
contains no automated decision, the results of its analysis are solely with human input,
may be used for interpretation. "

(61) Information about the Software available through a public Internet search is provided by the company that developed it
examining the website, the questions asked by the Authority and the answers given to them
found the following. The software development company has one, its products more

(62) The basis of the operation of the Software is highlighted on the above Hungarian language website of the company
An application called the Sound Analysis Platform ('the Platform'), which is described on the website as

                                                             4
(63) According to the description in the English information page on the Platform, the Platform is mechanical
it uses learning and artificial intelligence to identify and measure speech style
based emotions, keywords and phrase-based emotional and such
                                                                                         5
speech characteristics such as speech rate, pitch, and articulation. On the side
a statement from the developer regarding the operation of the product,
that a well-trained neural network sorts the sound fragments into three main ones
             6
category.

(64) As stated in the descriptions referred to, the Platform is concerned with both

artificial intelligence, machine learning and neural networks.

(65) Artificial intelligence is the development of computers and robots in a way that

allows them to operate in ways that can mimic or exceed
human capabilities. Programs using artificial intelligence are able to analyze and
place the data in context to provide information, or automatically
                                                                  7
trigger certain events without human intervention.

(66) Machine learning is, in fact, one of the possible paths to artificial intelligence
algorithms are used in this subfield of artificial intelligence
in such a way that they learn to automatically recognize what is present in the data

patterns and correlations and then apply what they learn to make better decisions
(or make better and better decisions). 8

(67) Neural networks are a possible approach within the field of machine learning, which
building on a simplified scheme of human brain function, it seeks to provide a solution such as
tasks that ordinary algorithms fail. The neural network is simple

consists of units - neurons - each of which, in the pattern of real nerve cells, receives incoming signals
receives and then outputs them together. However, the incoming signals are not the same
individual neurons are taken into account to determine the output value, but

described in statistical terms - weighted. The reason for this is illustrated by an example in
best to use the neural network to estimate (forecast) real estate prices

is located on the first floor. It is important to note that although neurons perform calculations, they do
yet no processors. The main difference between the two is that as long as the processors

programmed, that is, to be executed one after the other, essentially bound, and thus not by itself

they are given a modifiable sequence of instructions that are always predefinable output

meanwhile, the neurons are taught by adjusting the values of the weights, so they a
depending on the algorithm used, even a value not known in advance by the user of the algorithm
may result. 10

(68) According to the descriptions referred to above, the developer itself provides information that
Platform as a software product, what parameters can identify and evaluate, and how to do so
what IT methods and solutions in the field of artificial intelligence
apply.

(69) The Software is capable of being received and initiated by call center employees
calls are automatically evaluated according to predefined rules, such as
Check the employee according to the “greeting rule”
properly greeted the customer, or the so-called. “Test rule” that the system is capable of

check that the employee has tried to collect a sufficient number of questions from the client
necessary information.

(70) The system is an automatic evaluation of the performance of telephone customer service staff

it is also able to measure how long it takes to ask a question within a call
and the substantive response by listening to the worker (the so-called ‘silence period’), from which it is clear
a conclusion can be drawn as to the level of knowledge and preparedness of the employee. 12

(71) Based on the above, it can be concluded that the Software using artificial intelligence

performs the automatic processing of personal data, the result of which is, on the one hand, the data set up by it
a list of the order to be recalled and, on the other hand, until they are deleted - which is the duration in the Client History Case
45Days - Recognized Emotions and Voice Recording Features for Individual Calls
(eg length of breaks). It is not a condition for automatic data processing that the machine brings the

decision, it is sufficient if the aim is to produce a result that influences decision-makers,
are taken into account in the human decision that is being made here. This is confirmed by the Customer in the History
Case 2021. The annex to the reply, received on 5 July, registered as NAIH-5161-5 / 2021
which, in the name of the file name, is a balancing of interests, in fact a privacy impact assessment

document (identifier: ‘balancing test voicemining.xlsx’), according to which ‘Data management

for audio recordings are analyzed automatically using artificial intelligence
and findings are also made automatically. The totality of the data is from both stakeholder groups
suitable for profiling or scoring, although automated decision making is not

in the process, the processing may have legal effects on data subjects. ".

According to the Customer Statement and the online source identified in paragraph 66. It also supports profiling

to rank dissatisfied customers for recalls based on keywords and emotions,
which qualifies as a personal characteristic within the meaning of Article 4 (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation

In accordance with the risk-based approach set out in Articles
the responsibility of data controllers has also increased.

III.4. Lack of proper information and right to protest

data subjects do not receive any information on what specific type of data they are
how and how they are treated to evaluate their emotional reactions. Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
It does not contain all the mandatory information other than the legal basis and does not indicate the purpose
complete. Neither the “Telephone Customer Service and Complaint Handling Detailed Data Management Information”
3.1.8 of the Business Rules. does not indicate clearly and intelligibly to the average person concerned
the duration of the data processing.

(75) The purpose of the above information is to ensure quality assurance and to prevent complaints. Neither is that
preventing customer migration or increasing internal efficiency are not included
among the objectives set for it.

(76) The Client’s statements set out in sub-paragraphs (vii) and (viii) of paragraph 4 above shall also be

(77) The right to object to an automated data processing is not based on a legitimate interest
depends on the decision of the data controller, the Customer is obliged to ensure the general data protection

also under Article 21 of that Regulation. Due to the complete lack of a right to protest, basically in the present case
there is in any case a breach of Article 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation, but in principle a

shall have an objective right of objection in accordance with paragraph 1, for other purposes,

A conditional right of objection pursuant to Article 1 (1) shall be granted. Not because of that, among other things

the different purposes of the processing and the interests of the controller in the balancing of interests are appropriate,

co-washing and joint evaluation as the end result - and the corresponding end result
conditions to be met - may not be the same for each goal.

(78) Although the consent was not cited by the Client as a legal basis, it also referred to this. With this
In this respect, the Authority notes that it is only appropriate under the General Data Protection Regulation
with in-depth knowledge, consent could be given through free and active action
the basis of data management, which is the refusal of the service (telephone customer service) as

excluded with legal consequences. The same is true for employees, as a rule of thumb
According to the Commission, the application of that plea is precluded, it is entirely free from interference
unthinkable in connection with the order. It is also fundamentally flawed and unacceptable
Customer's argument that no complaint has been received so far with the data processing under investigation
even if the persons concerned could not have been aware of it.

(79) Based on the above, it relates to the analysis activity of the Customer's customer service sound recording

processing of personal data in its present form infringes Article 5 (1) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
and (b), Article 12 (1), Article 13 and Article 21 (1) and (2).

III.5. Qualification of Balance of Interest in Data Management with the Software

(80) Artificial intelligence is defined in section III.3 above. operating principle as set out in point

difficult to see and follow. This is one of the reasons why it requires special attention - not only that
described on paper but actually implemented - the use of artificial intelligence is
in the case of data processing where the transparency and transparency rules of the General Data Protection Regulation apply
the data controller wants to meet the accountability conditions. This is beyond an average risk
from the default expectation level for data processing, and - taking into account the
risk-based approach under Articles 24 and 25 of the General Data Protection Regulation
In view of the difficulty, the controller must decide when and for what

uses artificial intelligence and how it ensures transparency in this regard.

(81) An emotion analysis and satisfaction evaluation and recording system used in the Software
effectiveness of the technical annexes submitted by the Client in the History Case (identifier: “voice
screens.docx.doc ”) is relatively low. Nor does it reinforce that particular form
implemented sound analysis is suitable to achieve the stated goals and use the current
would be an unavoidable and proportionate restriction on the rights of data subjects, even if -

not as in the present case - the rights of the data subject would be adequately secured by the Client. The client
its balance of interests did not take this into account in any way from the date of the balance of interests
or information about the review is not supported by the documents provided by the Customer,
nor does it appear from the balance of interests that any regular review would be scheduled
to verify that the actual operation of the Software meets expectations and
adequately protects the rights of those concerned.

(82) Customer's voice analysis activity using artificial intelligence

- in particular, the assessment of the emotions of data subjects raises in itself a principle of data protection
issues. In its 2012 annual report, the Authority stated years ago that “A
The financial sector is at the forefront of new data management technologies. The bank

they can also be extracted, from which the customer's ability to pay and ability to pay can be deduced. THE
the use of tools to examine psycholinguistic traits and the emotional charge of speech
However, it is not sufficient to examine the formal existence of the data subject's consent. THE

Ranking technology based on speech processing is an intervention to such an extent that
to the private sector and carries risks which the data subject incurs when giving his consent,

unable to recognize and judge their impact on his or her rights to privacy. The Authority drew attention
that data mining technology puts the financial institution in possession of data that
which the client is not even aware of, so the use of such tools is the subject of the procedure
                                        13
from its subject to its subject matter. " This is also evidenced by artificial intelligence
the choice of the method of data processing and the guarantees and rights of the data subject
is of paramount importance. Aliasing - the use of an internal sound recording identifier - in general
useful, but not sufficient in itself, especially in the present case.

(83) Decision No 5/2021 of the European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Data Protection Supervisor. s. common

opinion on harmonized rules for artificial intelligence (artificial intelligence)
Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council
The European Data Protection Supervisor and the
The European Data Protection Supervisor also believes that MI is an individual's emotion

specific uses - namely for medical or research purposes
(for example, patients for whom it is important to recognize emotions), except in all cases
adequate safeguards and, of course, all other data protection conditions and restrictions
including purpose limitation. ”4

(84) In addition to the above, the findings and the reasoning set out in paragraph 4 (vii) and (viii) above

on the basis of the statements set out in points (a) to (d)
is not provided for the specific data management method, so the rights of the data subjects are the Customer's customer service
his practice of analyzing recordings made by telephone voice recording completely empties him.

(85) The balance of interests was not determined on a case-by-case basis, but all objectives were combined into one

data management. The issue of suitability and proportionality had to be achieved in order to achieve the given data management purpose
instead, the Client has only its own interests, whether perceived or real, in its judgment
whether data management is necessary and proportionate, and even this is only formal
according to the criteria. The Client has only determined that it has an interest in achieving it
data management is required to enforce it, not the rights of the data subject compared to individual purposes

the impact of its activities in the event of Proportionality, the affected side is not actually
examined and downplayed significant fundamental rights risks. He took it out in a very factual manner
taking into account the guarantee effect of adequate information and the right to protest, which rights a
in reality, due to the design of the system, they are not fully provided to those concerned
depriving the data subject of the right to self-determination. Thus, the result of the balancing of interests is explained above
is fundamentally incorrect and misleading as to suitability and proportionality, nor is it

it compares what it should. The fact that the Customer has fewer customer service staff
performing the tasks is not in itself a disproportionate and appropriate reason for those involved
and by the Authority and the European Data Protection Board
data processing, which is considered undesirable and a high risk
form. Innovation only benefits people if it is

effective and coupled with strong guarantees. The Customer provides the increased warranties instead of the opposite
demonstrated during the clarification of the facts in relation to the sound analysis.

(86) Unfounded or incorrect planning and consideration of data processing does not constitute
For an unavoidable reason beyond the Client's control, it is solely an intentional act of the Client,

which started or continued the data management in the knowledge that it is essential
suffered from deficiencies and was not actually substantiated by a balance of interests, only
papered. Customer has not demonstrated that any alternatives have actually been considered. THE

they are missing, which, despite the knowledge of the Client, was not taken into account later, even in the knowledge of the Client
continued data management. This justifies the intentional nature of the infringement.

(87) At the discretion of the Client, the voices of its employees will also be analyzed and evaluated,
which is based, inter alia, on Customer's declaration under paragraph 4 (i) above
they are also used for performance pay. In the case of employee employees, it is also questionable whether
how much actual protest they would have because of the dependency. This circumstance as well

not considered by the Customer. Monitoring the performance of the contract with regard to employees,
quality assurance, due to labor law rules, may be justified in certain circumstances
certain legitimate interests. However, even in this case, suitability and proportionality are paramount
which is, inter alia, the Client's own statement pursuant to paragraph 4 (xi) above

associated profiling, as well as a thorough analysis of the rules and guarantees involved
required before processing data with a new technology, which the Customer also did not do
in the balancing of interests.

(88) The Authority also does not share the Client's view that there is no harm to the parties concerned

suffer in connection with the data processing under investigation. The General Data Protection Regulation a
serves the protection of the right to the protection of personal data, which is enshrined in Article VI of the Basic Law. Article 3
and Article 8 (1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union
is a fundamental right. In the relevant legislation - such as the general data protection
Regulation III. The rights of data subjects for the protection of fundamental rights set out in
even without direct financial loss, causes significant violation of fundamental rights,
and this is the case for a large number of stakeholders. According to the Customer's statement, this is
means data management for about 1-1.5 million voice recordings per year.

(89) The Authority also considers the applicability of Article 22 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
considered with respect to the data processing that is the subject of the present case, as it is also affected by the Customer
rights of the data subject to be ensured. The Customer also failed to do so in the data management planning

established the applicability of Article 22 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, thus
nor is it a violation of it. However, in the case of extensive automated data management, the consideration of interests

The deficiency of the data controller is confirmed by the fact that the data controller does not consider this possibility in substance, such as
it was also omitted by the Customer in the present case.

(90) As explained in this section, the balancing of interests carried out by the Client does not

the priority of the legitimate interest established over the rights and freedoms of the data subject is not

III.6. Legality of Data Management with the Software

(91) Due to the invalidity of the balance of interests, the Authority considers that the sound recordings should be excluded
nor in connection with its automatic analysis by the Customer
legal basis under Article 6 (1) (f) of the Data Protection Regulation, nor any other general data protection

There is no legal basis listed in Article 6 (1) of the Regulation.

(92) The Customer makes no warranties or representations with respect to third party parties
no right of protest has been granted so far, so there are objective factors outside of emotion in this regard
(words, pauses) is only possible if it is appropriate for proportionality and necessity

perform this activity with appropriate guarantees. If it is
requires an analysis of factors other than emotions that can be clearly identified in the information
to be performed by the Customer, only with the guarantees in accordance with the general data protection regulation, no
you can do it indefinitely. One of the great challenges of artificial intelligence is to ensure transparency
which, in the present case, has completely failed to reach the parties concerned.

(93) It is easier for the Customer to know about its employees than for third parties
to base the analysis of objective factors (words, pauses) other than emotions, as the

However, the use of new and high-risk technology - including Hungary

taking into account the EU legal framework. " https://ai-hungary.com/api/v1/companies/15/files/146072/download, 30

raises a number of legal and ethical issues that the Customer has not identified
and not handled during data management.

(94) Based on the above, by automatically analyzing the customer service voice recordings
data processing practices in this form violate the general data protection regulation
Article 5 (1) (a) and Article 6 (1) and Article 6 (4).

III.7. Systemic violation of data subjects' rights

(95) Pursuant to Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Customer must be so concise
and provide, in a comprehensible manner, the minimum information necessary to understand data management
data subjects, on the basis of which the data subjects are at least as essential as the data processing
they are aware. This will not be done by the Customer in advance or during recalls

and those who call customer service on the phone can’t guess their voices are automatic
and cannot reasonably expect to be recalled without request, inter alia
because of the tone of their voice. In accordance with Article 24 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
novelty nature of data management, analysis of emotions and other psycholinguistic analyzes
based on the sensitive nature of the data and the other data processing conditions set out above
the data processing should be designed to ensure the maximum protection of the rights of the data subject and
freedoms, which he clearly did not do. The fact that there have been few complaints about this so far

received does not confirm that it did not bother those concerned, but that it did not reasonably bother
they may have known about this, which in itself strongly questions privacy compliance.

(96) Pursuant to Article 12 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Client is obliged to facilitate
the exercise of the rights of the data subject. The right to protest is a fundamental guarantee that is lacking at all
regardless of the other circumstances, it could in itself have failed to give priority to the legitimate interest
the finding. The existence of a legitimate interest is not sufficient, it must precede it

which is clearly not the case in the absence of adequate guarantees
may exist. Given that it is within the Customer’s discretion and is manifestly untrue
circumstance is the assurance of the rights of the data subject, this is not a careless mistake, only
it is intentionally so far removed from the facts and the theory described in the deliberations is practical
its implementation can only be deliberately ignored for years without a substantive review.

(97) Pursuant to Article 25 (1) and (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Customer has become obliged

should be assessed before starting automatic sound analysis using artificial intelligence,
whether data management is feasible in the current technical and social context
subject to maximum compliance with data protection rules. The Client's consideration of interest is the reasoning above
Contrary to the statements made in paragraph 4 (vii) and (viii) and the facts
illegal status. Customer knew, or with due diligence
he or she could have known in a way that was possible or not before starting data management
it is possible to inform those concerned and to enforce the rights of protest and other data subjects.
Pursuant to the above and Articles 24 and 25 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Customer does not presume

it could have decided to start voice analysis data processing in this form.

(98) Customer may use the Software prior to the application of the General Privacy Policy a
It was introduced in 2017. It is not clear from the text of the impact assessment and the balance of interests that:
when it was created by Customer and reviewed at any time. The general privacy policy

appropriate, but its content as explained in this decision does not correspond to reality, the

was clearly aware at the time of the impact assessment and during the operation of the mandatory regular, 31

review, including the review due to the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation,
at the time. This is confirmed by the statements of the Client presented in this decision.

The system of adequate information in the General Data Protection Regulation serves to:
the data subject must be aware of which personal data, which data controller and for what purpose,
how will you handle it. This is essential to be in a position to affect your rights
can practice on the merits. Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation

in accordance with paragraph 47 of the General Data Protection Regulation
information requirement applies. It is referred to in Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation
in addition to specific information, it is an additional condition that the reasonable expectation of the data subject should be
cover that data processing, you should expect that. In the absence of adequate information
the data subject is not in a position to exercise his or her rights properly,
especially when there is no real possibility to exercise the substantive right of protest. THE
the obligation to provide information is not, as explained above, a mere administrative,

Means a “securitization” obligation in the General Data Protection Regulation. A document
its production is not in itself the fulfillment of the data controller's obligations, it is only a means of recording it
there must be a substantive consideration and decision preparation, decision, and necessary
at intervals to review them. Applying a new type and high-risk technology
There is an increased expectation for both regular and substantive review. All in the preamble
both Articles of the General Data Protection Regulation require the controller to achieve a result
in determining its responsibilities, not just a specified minimum administration

by the controller. The purpose of the information is to put the person concerned in a position to
to be in an appropriate decision-making position regarding the exercise of the data subject's rights. THE
There is nothing meaningful about data management and sound analysis using software
information is not available to those who call the Customer's customer service by phone,
or who are called or recalled by Customer Customer Service.

(100) In the context of a legitimate interest, it is important to emphasize that it does not serve to

that, unless otherwise possible, the controller may at any time and for any reason on other grounds
in the absence of applicability, in accordance with Article 6 (1) (f)
data. Although it seems to be the most flexible legal basis, using it is the controller
takes significant responsibility - not only for the processing of personal data in the strict sense, but also for
by assuming other related warranty obligations. No
It is therefore a question of 'paperwork', but of a substantive task, a statement which is particularly true
in the case of data processing, where the data controller is in a position of trust and significant dominance

against price participants. Infringement of the rights of the data subject in the absence of appropriate guarantees
the risk is such that the balance of interests is the result of its actual exercise
it can only reasonably be expected that the legitimate interest of the third party will be overridden by the rights of the data subject.

(101) It is very important for data controllers to be aware that they are not concerned and are not
the Authority has the task and responsibility to process the data instead of the data controller in an official procedure
identification and justification of its purpose and legitimate interests. What purpose and how legitimate
intends to process personal data in the interests of the data subject, the data controller must be specific, at the data and target level

be clearly justified, weighed up and guaranteed. These guarantees must
to ensure, inter alia, that the data subject is aware of the data processing and that
be able to object to the data before the processing, since after the processing,
especially in the case of short-term or one-off data processing - the right to protest is already exhausted, thus
in fact, this right is not granted to him. In the present case, as explained above
it can be stated that in recital 47 of the General Data Protection Regulation
specified predictability and warranty conditions at system level, selected by Customer

have not been met due to the mode of implementation. Possibility of adequate information and prior protest,

it cannot be technically ruled out, only the solution chosen by the Customer did not allow
the Client is aware of the statements made during the procedure and presented in the explanatory memorandum.

(102) The violation or reduction of the rights of the data subject also means that the right chosen by the Customer is legitimate
in the case of data processing based on the consent of the data subject
the Customer provides worse conditions. In the case of the data subject's consent, the consent of each
for data processing purposes, such as voice recording initiated by the data subject

due to the handling of complaints and the subsequent analysis of the sound recording thus made - a separate reason for rejection
would deserve. Because the recording of the sound is not in the first place with the consent of the data subject, but for the most part
is based on a legal obligation which significantly restricts the freedom of the data subject from the outset
in addition, with respect to further data processing, the Customer shall, at the unilateral discretion of all parties concerned
the removal of the option only exacerbates the already severely restrictive situation. The client
- among other things - he deliberately ignored this obvious fact on paper only
in the sole discretion of its own business, which is contrary to the general rule

with the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation for data controllers.

(103) The systemic violation of the rights of the data subject is also confirmed by the fact that in the
The customer was not able to provide basic information about the data management to the complainant in an understandable way either,
not even by expressly requesting this to be complained about by the complainant on the Customer's website for a single general
sentence which aroused his suspicion (see paragraph 3 (iii) (c) above). The client
nor could he subsequently describe in a way that was comprehensible and specific to the complainant for what purposes, which

data on which legal basis and how it handles in the context of sound analysis are only specific
without making general findings and references in his response to data management
compliance. Customer's defense that no such issue has arisen so far is not
relevant on the one hand because there is no such aspect in the General Data Protection Regulation
on the other hand, the main lack of information of the data subjects so far is the main reason
lack of interest so far. Information under Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation
obligation is not infinite, its express purpose is to protect the data controller, in this case the Customer.

the vast majority of information available to data subjects regarding their data processing operations
equalization. If it is a complex and new technology of data management, then this
information dominance is also typically greater than data processing without such characteristics
so the Customer should have paid even more attention to compensating for this. This
however, despite its legal obligation, the Customer has not done so. This in turn supports
that generally does not meet the Customer 's consciously designed system of built - in and
the principle of default privacy.

(104) Based on the above, by automatically analyzing the customer service voice recordings
data processing practices in this form violate the general data protection regulation
Article 12 (1), Article 24 (1) and Article 25 (1) and (2).

III.8. Legal consequences

(105) In accordance with Articles 58 (2) (i) and 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the
may impose a data protection fine in place of or in addition to other measures. That's not it
it was doubtful that the general data protection regulation would violate the general data protection law
Article 58 (2) (d) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 requires the controller to
bring data management into line with the general data protection regulation. Due to the nature of data management
the Authority set a deadline of 60 days instead of the usual 30 days. In addition, the Authority
in accordance with the applicable case law, the general rule for imposing a fine in such a case is

the aspects listed in Article 83 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation
in the statement of reasons for the decision

(106) As to whether a data protection fine is justified, the Authority
Article 83 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation and Infotv.75 / A. § considered ex officio
all the circumstances of the case and found that in the case of the infringements detected in the present proceedings
a conviction under Article 58 (2) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation does not
is a proportionate and dissuasive sanction and a fine should therefore be imposed. Above all, in this round
the Authority took into account that the Client's data management practices are essentially complete

in its entirety disregarded the relevant legal obligations without being treated personally
that it has made any real effort to ensure the lawfulness of the data processing
outside the formal administration. In the present case, the protection of personal data - which a
It is the task of the Authority - not in the light of all the fining circumstances detailed below

the Client does not qualify as a small or medium-sized enterprise. The imposition of fines is both special and
it also serves general prevention, for which purpose the decision is also on the Authority's website

will be published.

(107) In setting the level of the data protection fine, the Authority took it as an attenuating circumstance
taking into account:

    (i) no direct decision is made with the Software as a result of artificial intelligence
    which are corrected by human review (Article 83 of the General Data Protection Regulation)

    Paragraph 2 (a)
    (ii) the Authority has not yet identified a data breach against the Customer (general
    Article 83 (2) (e) of the Data Protection Regulation).

(108) In setting the level of the data protection fine, the Authority considers aggravating circumstances
has taken into account:

    (i) The nature of the breach is particularly serious, serious, the case is significant, general data protection
    The Customer has violated several provisions of this Regulation. The largely automated data management,
    the use of new technology, the societal issues it raises about the challenges of the digital age,
    and the inadequacy of the controller's responses to them in the present case beyond the individual assessment

    they also make it significant on a theoretical level. The conduct of the data protection authorities in the present case
    many data controllers may be decisive in the future for many similar data processing operations,
    which is an invaluable amount of personal data for many millions of data subjects in Hungary
    may affect your treatment. (Article 83 (2) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation)

    (ii) A longer period of time before the General Data Protection Regulation became applicable
    from the date of application of the General Data Protection Regulation
    has existed continuously and continues to exist. (Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation)
    paragraph (a)

    (iii) The extent and market position of the Client's data management and in the financial sector
    based on its activities, the expectation of the Client is higher than the average
    in the case of a data controller, the number of sound recordings affected by automated data processing is 1-1.5 per year
    million. (Article 83 (2) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation)

    (iv) The data management activity was performed using new and risky technology. The bank
    sector is a particularly sensitive area, the responsibility of financial institutions to customers and
    usually of a similar magnitude but operating in a different field
    compared to data controllers. It is fundamentally the opposite of confidence in the financial sector

    inadequate use of technology that raises significant fundamental rights issues,

    and, in the absence of adequate guarantees, significantly infringes the rights of the data subject. (general

    large-scale downgrading and disregard of risks is internal to the Client

    in its materials and regulations, in its balance of interests, the impact on the stakeholders is substantial
    complete lack of investigation in advance and during data processing, the right to information and
    Emptying the right to protest is supported by data protection rules
    to circumvent. There must have been at least a possible intention to infringe, accidentally a
    the above is not feasible. Based on its statements, the Customer may have known that due to the above

    data management may be problematic, but you have deliberately ignored these considerations
    in making its decisions on data management, based on a fictitious situation
    turning a blind eye to reality. (Article 83 (2) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation)

    (vii) The Customer has not done anything about the right to information and the right to protest
    because, according to his statements, he considered it impracticable instead of
    would have modified the processing in accordance with the general data protection regulation

    able to fulfill its obligations. (Article 83 (2) (c) of the General Data Protection Regulation)
    (viii) Article 24 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation takes a risk-based approach

    prescribes to the Customer, which it did not fulfill in the present case. No recording of voice recordings
    can be avoided by those concerned, in which case they may be used for any further purpose
    should be judged more strictly. Exclusion from the use of telephone customer service is the Customer
    the only alternative offered by the Commission, which is not a real choice for those concerned, moreover
    this is also questionable for the parties called by the Customer, nor in the absence of adequate information

    most of those involved in a decision-making situation under Article 25 of the General Data Protection Regulation
    can be traced back to a systemic problem that violated this principle. Artificial intelligence is not
    applied with due care without prior artificial intelligence
    poses orders of magnitude greater risk than automated data processing,
    which can only be assessed in the strictest way. (Article 83 of the General Data Protection Regulation

    Paragraph 2 (d)
    (ix) The regulation governing a specific new technology is still very rudimentary, so this

    should have been considered as an increased risk in the assessment, as well as the specific
    In the absence of strong specific guarantees arising from the unregulation of this area, the Customer
    would have been stronger than usual under the General Data Protection Regulation
    guarantees, but did not reach the average level of guarantees. (general

    Article 83 (2) (d) of the Data Protection Regulation)
    (x) The guarantee effect of the pseudonymisation used was negligible only because a

    in practice, all employees who access the Software and listen to the recordings
    times the caller is identified, as the recorded call is always with personal identification
    begins, and among other things, this obvious circumstance appeared untrue

    during the balancing of interests, as a guarantee existing only on paper. (General Data Protection Regulation 83.
    Article 2 (2) (d)
    (xi) Data processing involved the recording and analysis of personal data
    such as the emotional state, the voice of the person concerned, the obscene vocabulary that touches more deeply on

    the privacy of data subjects as a technical or contact data, their treatment is a priority
    need. (Article 83 (2) (g) of the General Data Protection Regulation)
    (xii) The Authority only became aware of a complaint in the History Case

    The delayed processing of data by the customer in the present proceedings
    the acquisition was due to the Customer's omission detailed in paragraph 51 above.
    (Article 83 (2) (h) of the General Data Protection Regulation)

    (xiii) The Client's total annual net sales in 2020 were HUF 81,002,000,000, therefore a small
    no punitive or deterrent effect would be individual or detrimental
    in general terms. (Article 83 (2) (k) of the General Data Protection Regulation)

    (xiv) The Customer shall use the data processing specifically for indirect profit-making purposes, internally
    in order to reduce costs and make a profit by retaining customers, and
    unlawfully subordinated to this to all other statutory account
    aspect to be taken into account. (Article 83 (2) (k) of the General Data Protection Regulation)

(109) In view of the above, the Authority considers that, in all the circumstances of the case, the operative part
considered that the imposition of a data protection fine of EUR 1 000 000 was proportionate in all the circumstances of the case and
deterrent.
