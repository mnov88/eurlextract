At the time the letter was sent, the defendant was also mayor of the
municipality where the complainant has her main residence and where the complainant should share
take part in the aforementioned municipal council elections. The complaint is initially directed against the
local party.
4. In the aforementioned letter, the complainant is referred to as a "potential new resident". The
The complainant states in her complaint that the letter was "specifically addressed" to her. According to the
the complainant was able to register the local party on the basis of the electoral roll for the municipal council elections in
2018 it is impossible to know that the complainant is a new resident of the municipality.
5. The complaint also contains a number of pieces of evidence, including the letter which is the subject of the complaint,
as well as a number of screenshots of the social networking site Facebook. On the
Screenshots can be read that a person is writing the following:
"\[...\] anyone who gets a list of voters (every candidate) and who has a little bit of
excel can work can filter it out, but of course you have to make a little effort

to transmit the following information:
an extract from the electoral roll showing the October communication by the
local party can be based;

for the municipal elections;
the name and contact details of the Data Protection Officer of the
municipality;
an explanation of the working method that makes it possible for the citizens of the municipality to
select as a new voter. The Inspectorate hereby refers to the reaction
of a candidate on the local party's list on Facebook.
9. On 14 March 2019, the Inspectorate will receive a reply from the defendant if

municipality. The letter includes, among other things, an extract from the electoral roll for the
Municipal elections in 2018. According to the letter, "may" the communication of the local

10. On 9 April 2019, the defendant 'in \[his\] capacity as a framer for the
past municipal elections" an e-mail message to the Inspectorate.
In that message, the defendant stated that "correspondence had indeed been sent to the
new inhabitants" of the municipality concerned. The defendant clarifies that the
"concrete addresses of the new residents were extracted from the 2018 electoral rolls".
11. In the same e-mail, the defendant also states:
"The identity of the new residents was, moreover, a matter for the existing residents.

Decision on the merits 39/2020- 4/23
...
13. On 4 June 2019, the Inspectorate issued a reminder by registered letter of the questions raised by an
month earlier. The inspectorate points out - as it did in its previous letters - that
the duty of cooperation for those responsible for processing in accordance with Article 31 of the AVG
and the obligation under national law in Article 66 §2 of the WOG.
14. On 17 June 2019, the defendant will send an e-mail to the Inspectorate in response to
the letters from the Inspectorate. The defendant points out that the personal data, which
were used to send the letter to new residents, were merely
taken from the 2018 electoral roll. The defendant points out that several
candidates on his party's list removed the voters from the electoral roll so that only the
new voters remained on the list. According to the defendant, this was done on the basis of
"ready knowledge". In this sense, it can be noted that the Inspectorate established that the
municipality has more than 10,000 inhabitants. The defendant clarifies that the aforementioned
ready knowledge could be harnessed by the fact that "many of the candidates have been active for 18 to 30 years.
in politics, and certainly in civil society'.
15. Furthermore, the defendant writes:
"At the end of the 'deletion exercise', I have the 2018 electoral roll in addition to that
of 2012 to try to avoid major errors or certain ambiguities.
It is an established fact that the 'summary' juxtaposition of these 2 lists is not for it.

a few 'mistakes' were also passed on by our candidates: some new
residents had apparently not received the letter'.

for the use of the electoral rolls, that is what it says:
"The copies or copies of the electoral roll issued with
application of §§ 1 and 2 may only be made for electoral purposes
used, including outside the period between the date of issue of the list
and the date of the election falls'.
17. The defendant points out that the processing of all personal data was carried out solely
for electoral purposes and states that "personal data from the 2012 electoral roll were
not used or abused'.
18. Furthermore, the defendant points out that the local party is a de facto association where
no specific responsible person was identified for the sending of the letter. The

in accordance with Article 91 §2 of the WOG.
20. In addition to the factual findings with regard to the complaint, the Inspectorate also establishes
established that the local party does not provide any public information in relation to the
personal data protection. The Inspectorate also notes that the letter to the
new residents "has not made any reference to the rights of the person concerned

evidence to support the merits \[of the complaint\]'.
21. On 25 September 2019, the Disputes Chamber decides that the file is ready for
treatment on the merits in accordance with Article 98 ff. of the WOG.
22. On 28 October 2019, the Disputes Chamber will receive a reply from the complainant.
23. The complainant refers to the Inspectorate's report and mentions the defence that the list
of new residents on the basis of readily available knowledge has been identified as 'seized by the hair'. The
the complainant points out that she is not active in any social association in the municipality and that there are
are not available (public) parameters that could identify it as a new
inhabitant.
24. The complainant also commented:
"In the email of 17 June \[2019\], \[the defendant\] admits that he has 'even' the list of
2012 compared to 2018. As far as I know, that list is not permitted
to be used after the elections. Not even 'for a while' either.
The complainant refers to the website of the Data Protection Authority where
explained that the principle of purpose limitation means that an electoral roll can only
be used for the election in the context of which the list was originally drawn up
provided.1
25. Furthermore, the complainant points out that one of the persons (person Z) who provides a hello and
submitted a signed declaration stating that he cooperated with the

Facebook had transmitted by means of a screenshot in its complaint to the
Data protection authority.
In its conclusion, the complainant again quotes a screenshot of Facebook, where
the aforementioned person Z states, in the wording of the complainant, 'that it is child's play by

26. On 28 November 2019, the defendant lodged his claims. In it, the defendant
that the personal data from the 2012 electoral roll were "not used" by the
establishment of the new list of inhabitants in 2018:
"Only the 2018 electoral roll and the 'deleted' list of possible \[new
inhabitants\] were drawn up by the candidates themselves on the basis of their ready knowledge
used as grounds for sending the letters'.
27. And so on:

"However, the defendant does have to make ('self annoying mistakes') major errors and

2012 was used for the 2018 elections and propaganda for the 2018 elections".
28. The defendant underlines that the letters were only sent to people who
possibly be a new resident of the municipality. In that regard, the defendant points out that
the ready knowledge with regard to the new inhabitants of the municipality is "very large".
This is explained in the defendant's conclusion as follows:
"Indeed, the defendant has been a \[doctor\] in the municipality for 41 years and has been in the municipality for 30 years.

29. With regard to the written statements made by the aforementioned person Z on Facebook, the
Defendant in the main proceedings:
"The electoral roll in the EXCEL file had already been considerably shortened by its deletion.
This had given \[person Z\] the impression, which led to this misunderstanding in the
Facebook discussion, that an EXCEL operation had already taken place on the
electoral list. This is not correct, it was a 'manual' deletion,
the result of which was recorded in an EXCEL file. There was no use
made of all kinds of algorithms in EXCEL. This is because the defendant can only use a few
apply simple calculations via EXCEL, let alone complex operations
carry out."
30. With regard to the lack of information relating to
protection of personal data, the defendant contends in its conclusion that in the meantime

processing but has never done so. The defendant decides:
"This does not, of course, prevent the defendant from disclosing information relating to the
the persons concerned (right to object), in order to preserve their dignity and
ensure transparency. Defendant takes this as a lesson for the future
that data subjects should always be made aware of their rights'.

The defendant states that the letter which is the subject of the complaint in the present case is the address
of the defendant. As against the Inspectorate, the defendant declares that there is
"no specific person responsible" for the letter, but that the defendant

37. In addition, the defendant states that the 'deletion' for the purposes of the new list of residents

only the defendant who submitted the new list of residents on the basis of the 2018 electoral roll in addition to
submitted the 2012 electoral roll, according to his own statements.
38. On the basis of the factual elements of the case and the defendant's statements,
the Chamber of Disputes finds that it is the defendant who is responsible for processing
within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the IPPC, for the processing operations which are the subject of
this complaint.

However, this case concerns the head of the list as a physical person, in view of the local party

takes responsibility for this case as the head of the list.2
3.2. The principles governing the processing of personal data and the
lawfulness of processing (Articles 5 and 6 of the AVG)
a) Processing of personal data from old electoral rolls
40. In his statements to the Inspectorate, the defendant refers to the
Electoral Code of 12 April 1894, but that reference is erroneous. For the legal
provisions on the use of voters' lists for local elections, it is Local and
Provincial Electoral Decree of 8 July 2011 (hereinafter: Local Electoral Decree) applicable.
3
41. Article 3 of the Local Electoral Decree states that the decree applies to the
organisation of the municipal council in all the municipalities of the Flemish Region. The situation
where the defendant and his local party stand for election as candidates to the
municipal elections in 2018 for a Flemish municipality, and in that period
sending out electoral propaganda - including the contested letter - falls within the ambit of the
scope of application of the aforementioned Decree.

of 15 July 2005, the provincial decree of 9 December 2005 and the decree of 19 December 2008 concerning the organisation
of the public social welfare centres, B.S. 25 August 2011.
Decision on the merits 39/2020- 9/23
...
42. Article 20(3) of the Local Electoral Decree states:
"§3. The Municipal Executive may not submit lists of voters to the Provincial Executive.
to persons other than those who, in accordance with paragraph 1
or paragraph 2, first paragraph, have requested the list. The persons who have applied for a
have an electoral roll available, that list may be used only for electoral purposes
use and only in the period between the date of the
making the list available and the date of the election".
43. The electoral lists made available in the context of a given election shall be drawn up in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 3.
election should therefore only be used until the date of that election. The
purpose limitation of the electoral roll is thus not limited to its use in the
within the framework of elections ('electoral purposes'), but also cumulatively until the election
for which the voters' list was created. Applied to the facts of the case, this means
that a 2012 electoral roll may not be used for the purposes of the
Municipal elections in 2018.
44. The defendant claims that he juxtaposed the electoral rolls for 2012 and 2018, and
continues that the information from the 2012 electoral roll was not "used or misused by the
establishment of the 'new' list of 'possible' new residents'.
The Dispute Chamber points out that merely storing and consulting the
personal data included in the 2012 electoral roll, including processing of
constitutes personal data within the meaning of the AVG, in accordance with Article 4(2) AVG.
45. The processing did not merely constitute a breach of this principle with regard to the processing of
personal data for those data subjects whose personal data are entered on the electoral roll of
2012, but also for those concerned - such as the complainant - who did not appear on the
electoral list of 2012 were mentioned. Determining the absence of the
personal data of data subjects on an old electoral roll, by consulting that list
old electoral roll, to modify and structure personal data of the same
persons concerned to be included on a new list of residents in 2018, should be considered to be
a diversion from the purpose of the old electoral roll in accordance with Article 5(1),
point (b) AVG.
46. The Chamber of Disputes finds that the storage and consultation of the electoral roll from 2012
by the defendant infringes the principle of purpose limitation in accordance with
Article 5(1)(b) AVG.
47. In addition, it may be established that the processing of personal data of the
2012 electoral roll with disregard for the purpose limitation, ipso facto an unlawful
processing within the meaning of Article 6(1) of the AVG. In this respect, the Disputes Chamber deems the
unlawfulness sufficiently clear, in view of the Local Kiesdecreet's use - i.e. also
consultation and comparison - of voters' lists for another party
election than that for which they have been made available. That is why it does not
raise the issue of Article 6(4) of the AVG in the light of the legal
provision in Article 20 of the Local Electoral Decree no assessment can be made with other
interests of the defendant, in the same way as the legal provision does not allow an account to be taken
be kept with other circumstances in order to allow the personal data to be kept
process.
Decision on the merits 39/2020- 10/23
...
48. Even if disregarding the legal provisions relating to electoral rolls is in itself
sufficiently clear to establish the unlawfulness, the Chamber of Disputes shall designate
the completeness also on the reasoning in section b) below, where the Dispute Settlement Chamber
justifies the creation of a 'new list of residents' with the personal data
on an electoral roll is not lawful in this case, even if it occurs during the period
within which the electoral rolls may be consulted and used. A fortiori, the following applies
justification for the processing of personal data on an old electoral roll from 2012,
whereby, by analogy, unlawfulness may be established for the purpose of making
a 'new list of inhabitants'.
b) Drawing up a list of new residents with the personal data on an electoral roll
49. In accordance with Article 16 of the Local and Provincial Electoral Decree, the voters' list mentions
the first name(s) and surname, date of birth, sex, and
main residence and, in certain cases, the nationality of the voters. Candidates at
elections may use the personal data contained in those electoral rolls for the purposes of conducting elections
of political prospection in the run-up to elections on the basis of the applicable
electoral legislation, which makes such processing somewhat foreseeable for the
person concerned.4
50. The defendant and some other candidates of the local party for which the defendant
is a front-runner, indicate that they are submitting personal data on the basis of their "ready knowledge".
have amended the electoral roll for the 2018 municipal elections in this way
and structured in such a way that they retained a list of (potential) new residents of the
municipality. The list was subsequently used by the defendant and his local party to
send letters to those (potential) new residents.
51. The defendant does not refer to any particular basis for the lawfulness of the
processing described above, and in particular one of the conditions laid down in Article 6(1), - processing as described above, and in particular one of the conditions laid down in Article 6(1).

also applies to the other parties involved. In addition, there is no agreement between the
data subjects and the defendant and his local party making the processing necessary
(Article 6(1)(b) of the AVG), nor is the processing necessary to protect vital interests
of the persons concerned or another natural person (Article 6(1)(b)) (Article 6(1)(c)).

provision, given that there are only individual interests or interests limited to the local party
in the context of the 2018 municipal elections (Article 6(1)(e) AVG).
53. The Chamber of Disputes finds that the processing of personal data from electoral rolls,
and in this case the modification, structuring and further use of those personal data,
may be carried out only where such processing is necessary for the purposes of promoting
the legitimate interests of the defendant within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f) AVG.
54. The Litigation Chamber understands that the defendant has an interest in having the personal data
on the electoral roll of a municipality in such a way that it changes,
structuring and further use of the electoral roll provides a list of new residents
who are members of the electoral public for the 2018 municipal elections in the
municipality where the defendant stands as a candidate.
55. Article 6(1)(f) AVG provides that the legal basis may be used in so far as
"processing is necessary in order to safeguard the legitimate interests of
the controller or of a third party, except where the interests or the
fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject who seek to protect
personal data outweigh those interests, in particular when the
person concerned is a child'.
56. The case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union requires that reliance be placed on
Article 6(1)(f) of the AVG must meet three cumulative conditions, "namely,
first, the representation of a legitimate interest of the parties concerned in the
controller or of the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, in
Secondly, the need for the processing of personal data for the purposes of the
defence of the legitimate interest and, thirdly, the condition that the
fundamental rights and freedoms of the data protection officer
do not prevail."

57. In other words, the person responsible for processing must prove that:
(1) the interests pursued by the processing can be considered legitimate
recognised (the "target test");
2) the intended processing is necessary for the realisation of these interests (the
"necessity test"); and
3) the balancing of these interests against interests, fundamental freedoms
and fundamental rights of persons concerned in favour of the
Processing controller or of a third party (the "balancing test").
1) The target test
58. In this case, it is important to underline that the legal predecessor of the European
The Data Protection Committee ("the Committee") states that the importance of the
processing controller is closely related to the purpose of a processing operation.7
The purpose of the processing of the personal data by the defendant is the following

2) The necessity test

person concerned.
13
68. The criterion relating to the seriousness of the infringement of the rights and freedoms of the person concerned
constitutes an essential part of the consideration required by Article 6(1)(f) AVG
on a case-by-case basis. In that regard, according to the Court of Justice, account must be taken in particular of

70. In that sense, the Conciliation Chamber also refers to recital 47 AVG: "the interests and the
fundamental rights of the person concerned may, in particular, override the interests of the
controller when personal data are processed in
circumstances in which the data subjects cannot reasonably be expected to carry out further processing

12 In this context, the following can be considered relevant: the Flemish legislator considers the identification number

71. The Litigation Chamber takes the view that the defendant's legitimate interest in
modify, structure and further amend the electoral roll in the manner described above
use, do not pass the weighting test.
72. The Chamber of Disputes points out, among other things, the nature and concrete manner of processing
of the data concerned: having regard to the defendant and other candidates of his local
batch for (many) years several ship mandates and the
take up the mandate of mayor, it can be expected that knowledge will be put to use
for processing collected in the exercise of those mandates.
73. In addition, the defendant himself states that his ready knowledge of the inhabitants of the
municipality stems from his decades-long professional career as a doctor, and the years of
the exercise of political mandates within the municipality, including the mandate as
mayor.
74. It is not in line with the principle of purpose limitation for knowledge that was, inter alia
acquired in the course of the exercise of the profession of doctor or within the framework of the
mandate of the defendant as mayor, to be applied when amending, structuring
and further use of a voters' list.
75. In addition, the Chamber of Disputes noted that a large number of those involved in the present case
in view of the number of inhabitants of the municipality stated by the Inspectorate, and
having regard to the number of voters on the electoral roll transmitted by the defendant to
the Inspectorate. In the 'form for reaction against proposed fine' it states
the defendant itself that the municipality has 8,074 voters, a significant number of those concerned
whose personal data were further processed.
76. In addition, it is not insignificant to establish that the data subjects did not in all reasonableness
Further processing could be expected.15 For example, the complainant refers in her complaint to the
information on a website of the Flemish government, which is the legislation on electoral lists
and municipal elections.16 Here it can be reiterated that the
electoral rolls on the basis of the legal provisions only of the first name(s) and
surnames, date of birth, sex, principal place of residence and in certain cases
cases, indicate the nationality of voters.
77. The persons concerned may therefore reasonably expect that the use
of those electoral rolls shall be limited to the personal data which are listed exhaustively
in legislation. Taking into account the legislation on the protection of
It is indeed possible, on the basis of the personal data collected, to
consult in the electoral roll itself, a proportion of the voters can be registered.17 The complainant
did not expect, however, that the defendant and the other candidates of his local party

...would process its personal data even further, and those personal data on a
change, structure and use in other ways.
78. In addition, the Litigation Chamber finds that the defendant pleads that the modified
and structured new list may not fully reflect reality,
and that perhaps not all the new residents were written to. Conversely

79. The possible inaccuracy of the personal data 'new resident' (by means of amending

Proper processing of personal data is, after all, a principle relating to the processing of
personal data in accordance with Article 5(1)(d) of the AVG. This strengthens the
Disputes Chamber in its opinion that that processing on the basis of a justifiable
importance does not pass the weighting test.
4) Conclusion
80. On the basis of the target test, the necessity test and the weighting test, the
Dispute resolution chamber established that there can be no lawful processing on the basis of lawfulness
of the legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f) AVG. There is no

data subjects have the right to request access to and rectification of personal data

dealt with in previous cases, in particular Decisions 04/2019, 10/2019, 11/2019 and the
most recently in decision 30/2020.
In each of those cases, the Chamber of Disputes proceeded to impose an
administrative pecuniary penalty, in particular for non-compliance with the principle of the
purpose limitation, as laid down in Article 5(1)(b) AVG.
100. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that, due to the reasons given above
infringements, an administrative fine within the meaning of Article 100, §1, 13° j° Article 101
WOG, as well as Article 83 AVG, is justified, taking into account the following considerations
elements.
101. Taking into account article 83 AVG and the case law of the Market Court,
The Chamber of Disputes justifies the imposition of an administrative sanction in concrete terms:
a) The seriousness of the infringement
102. The foregoing reasoning shows the seriousness of the infringement. Infringements of the
basic principles in Articles 5 and 6 AVG give rise to the highest fines in Article
83, paragraph 5 AVG.
Also with regard to the infringements of Article 14 of the AVG on transparency and information on the
personal data, the Chamber of Disputes notes that the lack of information in a letter
draw the attention of those concerned to the seriousness of the infringements.
In the event of infringements of those rights, the highest fines shall also be imposed.

technical and organisational measures have been taken in order to comply with the
obligations under the AVG. Not only is the defendant not sufficiently precise

information and does not offer sufficient transparency with regard to those concerned.
(c) The duration of the infringement:
105. In view of the special nature of the processing of personal data in function of (the
preparation for) the sending out of electoral propaganda in the run-up to the
Municipal elections in 2018,
24 has the processing only within a short
time period took place. However, it should be pointed out that the electoral roll of a
previous municipal election, in 2012, was still used to make an amendment and
structure the electoral roll in 2018 (supra, 3.2., part a).

The defendant argues that, in view of the processing operations carried out within the framework of a local
electoral campaign, a proposed fine of EUR 5 000 would be disproportionate. The
Dispute Settlement Chamber takes these new elements into account in its deliberations and decides
as a result, to reduce the amount of the fine, given an amount of EUR 3 000,

conclusion of the defendant, and the complainant states that he or she considers that he or she has been sufficiently heard, and
in order to be able to include all relevant elements in the deliberations of the Dispute Settlement Chamber
the Chamber of Disputes has decided to uphold the conclusion with the pleas in law put forward by the
