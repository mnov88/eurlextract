## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject filed complaint regarding a violation to their right to rectification against a bank. The DPA launched an investigation which over time broadened its scope towards the role of the bank's DPO. The investigation revealed that there might be a conflict of interest since the DPO held a number of other functions, including leading the bank's Operational Risk Management, the Information Risk Management department and Special Investigation Unit.

The bank argued that the head of these services did not have decision-making power to determine the purposes and means of processing of personal data, but a purely advisory and supervisory role.

### Holding

The Belgian DPA refuted the bank's argument, stating that the role was not 'purely advisory and supervisory'. Particularly, the DPA held that the DPO could still determine the means and purposes of processing of personal data. This was further proven by the bank's Record of Processing Activities, which listed a substantial number of categories of personal data which are processed by these departments.

Thus, because the DPO held the final responsibility over the referenced departments, the DPA held that there was a conflict of interest, in breach of [Article 38(6) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_38_GDPR#6 "Article 38 GDPR").

In light of this violation, the DPA fined the bank €75,000.

I. Facts and Procedure
A. Investigation of the Inspectorate
1. On 22 April 2020, the Executive Committee of the Data Protection Authority (hereinafter referred to as GBA) decided 
to bring a case before the Inspectorate of the GBA on the basis of Article 63, 1° WOG.
Following decision No. 01/2019 taken by the Dispute Resolution Chamber on 15 May 
2019 and the subsequent judgment of the Markets Court dated 9 October 2019, the 
Executive Committee indeed found that there were serious indications of practices that could give rise to 
could give rise to breaches of the fundamental principles of personal data protection. 
The Management Board has therefore referred the matter to the Inspectorate with the request to conduct an investigation into the extent to which the 
request to conduct an investigation into the extent to which the defendant's information systems 
enables the exercise of the rights of the data subject, in particular the right to rectification (Article 
16 AVG), is possible. This means that the Inspectorate has been caught up in verifying whether the 
information systems of the defendant are in line with the requirements of the AVG 
with regard to the exercise of the rights which each data subject1 has in his 
as a client of the defendant.
2. The Inspectorate shall transmit its report dated 23 March 2021 to the Dispute Resolution Chamber on the basis of

II. Reasons 
17. Hereafter, the Litigation Chamber assesses each of the findings included in the report of the Inspectorate in the light of the relevant information provided by the parties. 
Inspectorate in the light of the pleas put forward in that regard by the Respondent.
(a) Principle of accuracy (Article 5.1(d) of the AVG), accountability (Article 5.2 of the AVG), transparency 
information, communication and detailed arrangements for exercising the rights of the data subject 
(Article 12 AVG), right to rectification (Article 16 AVG), data protection by design and 
default settings (Article 25 AVG) and the duty to cooperate (Article 31 AVG).
18. The first element to be examined by the Inspectorate concerns the 
assessment of the extent to which the Respondent has made the necessary adjustments in order to remove the 
diacritical marks in its ICT systems. 
The Inspectorate finds that the Respondent is unable to provide a clear and systemic picture of the 
in terms of time horizon for the implementation of diacritical marks in the current ICT system (applications + mainframe) and possible first results showing the efforts made.

"exploratory phase" of preliminary studies and discussions without wanting to achieve concrete goals and results. 
achieve.
20. The Inspectorate concludes that the Respondent is in breach of Articles 5.1 d, 
5.2, 12, 16, 25 and 31 of the AVG because the Respondent does not want to or is not able to present a concrete time horizon with concrete results, nor is it able to

subject to the carrying out of some preliminary study work (feasibility) - has not changed and has therefore not improved.
Decision on the merits 141/2021 - 5/26
21. The Inspectorate makes the following considerations in this regard:
o The Respondent has IT applications and database systems (some 150) including the 
central customer system which concerns a mainframe system that was put into use in 1995. 
taken into use in 1995. That central customer system supports only EBCDIC ("extended binarycoded decimal interchange code"). Although diacritical marks have since been
added to the EBCDIC table in the meantime, the defendant did not make any changes to the central customer

rectification.
o With regard to the number of underlying applications that interact with the central customer system 
system, which need to be changed due to the introduction of diacritical marks, the Inspectorate 
diacritical marks, the Inspectorate notes that the Respondent in the initial letter 
dated 6 November 2019 lists 150 applications and is only able to 
deliver a list that corresponds to the exact number as stated on 6 
November 2019, supplemented by the correct systemic naming and filtering out 
of double counting. The Inspectorate notes in this regard that the Respondent often 
replied that the analysis was 'not yet complete', which is strange given the number of 
months of lead time, the number of staff, the financial resources and 
capabilities of the Respondent.
o With regard to the large and very old systems for which the Respondent on 6 November 
2019 states that a lead time of 18 months is expected for their adaptation, 
the Inspectorate notes that the Respondent does not issue a list until 2 November 2020

o By examining the 'change management' and the plan of approach to proceed

principle of AGILE, which means that the Respondent will resolve the restriction of accented letters in small, manageable steps. 
the restriction of accented letters.
On 12 October 2020, the Respondent reports that it has taken initiatives to include the 
diacritical marks into the central customer system, following a 4-phase approach 
is being followed and at that time phase 1 and 2 are being processed:
1) analysis of all systems and applications potentially affected;
Decision on the merits 141/2021 - 6/26
2) adaptation of these systems in the test environment and testing them separately for the 
processing of diacritical marks;
3) Performing chain tests to ensure consistency of the applications;
4) actually implementing the changes 
On 2 November 2020, the defendant documents how AGILE was translated into 
its organisation and provides information about the feasibility study in the form of two 
diagrams of the testing approach.
The Inspectorate concludes that it is strange that there is little structured and umbrella 
and umbrella information is available to follow up on this change over all. 
follow-up. Apart from general information about the AGILE approach and the pre-study phase, 
the Respondent is unable to provide any information that demonstrates any progress or concrete 
results that could have a positive impact on the data subject and the exercise of his 
exercise of his rights.
o Following the examination of the technical design, the inspection report contains the 
technical figures with regard to the architectural design whereby the defendant 
indicates whether, and if so to what extent, changes can have an impact on each of the components, both for 
each of the components, both for the central customer system, the supporting and 
underlying technologies - middleware, the mainframe Z applications, the non-mainframe Z applications, as well as for the channels and front-end 
applications.
Articles 5.1 d), 12 and 16 AVG
22. The Respondent submits that Articles 5.1(d), 12 and 16 AVG are complied with and argues 
as follows:
- The exercise of the data subject's rights is facilitated in accordance with Article 12 
AVG by allowing customers to modify their data themselves via the 
Internet banking applications, or have them changed by employees in the front office. The Privacy 
Statement also provides the necessary contact details for exercising the right to correction. 
In addition, there is also an internal guide and documentation of the procedures for exercising the 
of the rights of those involved. Furthermore, the necessary processes have been implemented to 
adequately handle requests to exercise rights.
- The right to rectification (Article 16 of the AVG) is respected for all requests for adjustment or 
rectification. The impossibility for the respondent to comply with the request for rectification is limited to the processing of the data. 
request for rectification is limited to the processing of diacritical marks in a name.
Decision on the merits 141/2021 - 7/26
- The implementation of a complex IT project involving adjustments to many systems, which requires a great deal of time and 
time and investment in order to be able to satisfy an absolute minority of requests for improvement is, according to the 
improvement requests cannot, in the opinion of the defendant, be regarded as a reasonable measure within the meaning of Article 5(1)(d) TFEU. 
of Article 5.1(d) of the AVG.
- The Respondent cites that the judgment of the Markets Court dated 9 October 2019 is still pending 
before the Court of Cassation and, pending the judgment, it cannot be simply claimed 
that Articles 5.1(d), 12 and 16 of the AVG are not complied with because of the lack of display 
of diacritical marks.
23. The Respondent's Conclusion states that it was initially foreseen to implement diacritical marks in its 
signs in its ICT systems as part of the UNITE ICT project already underway in 2019 within the Y Group, which aimed to upgrade the systems and applications of the 
Y entities in Belgium and those of the Y entities in the Netherlands, 
but the UNITE project proved to be too ambitious, with the result that in 2020 the defendant will be operating under separate

implement. On the basis of this statement, the Dispute Resolution Chamber finds that there was an intention to 
diacritical marks in the Respondent's applications, but that this did not take place due to the 
the Respondent within the UNITE project. The defendant 
now concludes that the inclusion of diacritical marks in the applications presupposes 
that this exceeds the bounds of reasonableness, whereas Article 5.1(d) of the AVG merely requires that the

24. Based on the inspection report, the Dispute Resolution Chamber notes that the central customer system

that his name is correctly displayed, precisely in view of the importance of correctness of data in

also refers in this regard to the judgment of the Markets Court dated 9 October 2019 in which it states 
that a correctly operating banking institution may be expected to have a computer program that meets

of a customer's request for the amendment of his name.
26. The Dispute Resolution Chamber is therefore of the opinion that the Respondent's inability to proceed to date with the rectification of the name of the Client is a serious problem.

Dispute Resolution Chamber to conclude that the Respondent has not complied with any exercise of the right to rectification. 
right of rectification. However, the right of rectification must be respected in all its facets.
27. However, in determining the sanction for these breaches, the Dispute Resolution Chamber shall take into account 
the defendant's statement to undertake to implement all the necessary changes by 15 November 2021 in order to 
to make all the necessary adjustments to the diacritical marks in the names and first names by 15 November 2021. 
2 The judgment of the Market Court is drafted in the following terms:
"\[...\]
The fact that it would require a technical 'effort' to use a computer program that does place accents on 
capital letters is neither serious nor relevant.
To state now (in the year 2019!) that adapting a computer program would require several months of work and/or financial 
additional costs for the banking institution, does not allow NV Y BELGIUM to disregard the rights of the person concerned. The 
rights granted to the person concerned are equivalent to obligations to produce a result on the part of the processor of the 
personal data.

In this result commitment, two caveats are made by the defendant, of which the Litigation Chamber takes note:
1° In accordance with the globally applicable industry standard, bank cards do not show diacritical marks. 
1° In accordance with the globally applicable industry standard, bank cards do not bear diacritical marks. If the Defendant were to do so, this could lead to problems in using the bank cards.

there is progress in this respect. Specifically with regard to the Complainant in Decision 01/2019 of 15 May 
2019, the Respondent also demonstrates that the diacritical mark is processed in his name.
28. With respect to Article 12 AVG, the Dispute Resolution Chamber finds that the Respondent adequately

It follows that no infringement of Article 12 of the AVG can be established.

merits.
Article 25 AVG
30. The Respondent submits that the Inspectorate establishes an alleged breach of Article 25 AVG 
but does not explain what this breach would consist of.
31. The Dispute Resolution Chamber considers that the Inspection Report clearly demonstrates that the Respondent 
continues to use for its central customer system a mainframe which was brought into service

The Respondent cites that Article 25 AVG also refers to the costs of implementation as criteria for determining the appropriate measures, as well as to the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons associated with the 
processing. In that regard, the defendant claims that there is no risk whatsoever in relation to 
as regards the identification of the person on the basis of the specific use of a given name 
without displaying the specific diacritical mark. Moreover, the implementation of a 
very complex IT project involving adjustments to numerous systems takes a great deal of time and investment in order to 
respond to an absolute minority of requests for correction which, in the defendant's view, means that the risk is extremely limited. 
According to the defendant, the risk is extremely limited in terms of seriousness and probability with regard to the rights and 
freedoms of natural persons.

38. However, on the basis of the documents provided by the Respondent, the Dispute Resolution Chamber must 
establish that the Respondent is able, by means of the necessary documentation, to demonstrate the extent to which the 
AVG is complied with. Not only does the Respondent have an internal guide and documentation of

42. The Inspectorate concludes that this processing activity by the Respondent is a 
violation of Articles 5.1 c) and f), 5.2, 24, 25 and 32 of the AVG, which is based on the 
consideration that the use of the plaintiff's surname is not necessary for the purpose for which it is processed and 
purpose for which it is processed and can therefore be avoided. The name for the project or 
the case could bear another name and the surname of the complainant has no added value. There 
According to the Inspectorate, there are various words in other languages with diacritical marks that 
can be used for this purpose, the use of the complainant's surname could be stigmatising and 
and by spreading it throughout its organisation the Respondent has no control over it. 
The inspection report concludes that using the family name as a "test person" or as a "case" is not 
proportionate to

44. In accordance with Article 6.1(f) AVG and the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union

50. In order to verify whether the third condition of Article 6.1(f) of the AVG - the so-called

"Also relevant to this balancing exercise are the reasonable expectations of the data subject that his or her 
personal data will not be processed if, in the given circumstances of the

52. From both the decision No. 01/2019 taken by the Dispute Resolution Chamber on 15 May 2019, and the judgment 
of the Markets Court dated 9 October 2019, it follows that the Respondent had to adapt its applications, at least as regards the

The report of the Inspectorate establishes with regard to the position of the DPO that there is a conflict of interest on his part and that he does not report directly to the highest management body.

56. The DPO is himself a permanent member of the Data council, which is a 
delegated subcommittee and extension of the Executive Committee, whereby the decisions of the Data 
Data Council's decisions are binding on the Executive Committee. The Respondent underlines that the 
Data Protection Officer's seat on the Data Council constitutes a form of 
reporting to the highest level.
57. The Respondent also adds that the Executive Committee is a collegiate body, whereby the 
CEO has one vote in the decision-making process, as do all other members of it. The Respondent
emphasises during the hearing that the DPO does not have to report to the highest individual 
namely the CEO, within the highest body, but that reporting to the highest body 
is sufficient. Moreover, all other members of the Executive Committee, including the 
CEO, are responsible for departments that process data. It follows, according to the 
Respondent that it cannot be argued that any particular member of the Executive 
would be more neutral than the other members.

Dispute Resolution Chamber that no violation of Article 38.3 AVG can be established.

The data controller is the one who determines the purpose and means of the processing in the sense of Article 4, 7) AVG. The second tier function determines - as an entity within

second-line function to fulfil its own supervisory and advisory role. This is 
indisputably from the processing register. It follows that the Data Protection Officer 
who also holds the position of Head of Department of the 
ORM/IRM/SIU, determines the purposes and means of the data processing operations carried out by the 
first-line function to the extent that this information is necessary for the tasks entrusted to the second-line function and

73. This leads the Dispute Resolution Chamber to conclude that the combination of the capacity of 
Data Protection Officer with the function of Head of Service of the three departments

Data Protection Officer. Consequently, the Dispute Resolution Chamber finds that the breach of Article 38.6 
AVG has been proven.
74. It is important that the Data Protection Officer is able to perform his or her duties and tasks 
with respect for the position assigned to him by Article 38 AVG, in particular that 
he can act without any conflict of interest. The Litigation Chamber therefore instructs the 
The Dispute Resolution Chamber therefore instructs the Respondent to bring the processing in this respect into line with article 38.6 of the 
38.6 AVG in this respect and thus ensure that these tasks or duties do not give rise to a conflict of interest.

Article 58.2(i) AVG. The instrument of administrative fine therefore does not aim in any way to 
terminate infringements. To that end, the AVG and the WOG provide for a number of corrective 
measures, including the orders mentioned in Article 100, §1, 8° and 9° WOG. 
77. First of all, the nature and seriousness of the infringement is taken into account by the Dispute Resolution Chamber 
77. First of all, the nature and seriousness of the infringement is taken into account by the Dispute Resolution Chamber in order to justify the imposition of this sanction and its amount. 
78. In this respect the Dispute Resolution Chamber finds that although there is no evidence of a deliberate infringement, there is a 
In this regard, the Dispute Resolution Chamber finds that, although there is no evidence of an intentional breach, there is evidence of gross negligence on the part of the Respondent. 
Although the Data Protection Officer is a function that was first mandated at the European level in the AVG, it is not a

data protection officer is not new and has existed for a long time in many Member States and in many organisations.14
79. Moreover, already on 13 December 2016, the Working Party 29 adopted guidelines for these 
officers. These guidelines were, after a wide public consultation, on 5 April 2017 
revised. As shown below, these guidelines are clear on the extent to which the 
which the data protection officer can also fulfil other functions within the 
company, taking into account the organisational structure specific to each organisation and 
should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
80. In short, in the opinion of the Dispute Resolution Chamber, there is no doubt that combining the function of DPO with that of a company can be a good thing. 
In short, in the opinion of the Dispute Resolution Chamber, there is no doubt that combining the position of data processing officer with a position as head of a department (in which personal data are also processed) which 
(where personal data are also processed) which the data processing officer must supervise, cannot take place on a 
must supervise, cannot be done in an independent manner.
81. An organisation such as the Respondent may be expected to carefully prepare for the 
introduction of the AVG and already from the time of the entry into force of the AVG 
pursuant to Article 99 AVG in May 2016. After all, the processing of personal data is a 
core activity of the Respondent, which moreover processes personal data on a very large scale. 
82. The duration of the breach is also taken into consideration. The Data Protection Officer 
data protection officer was created in the AVG applicable since 25 May 2018, so that the 
breach of Article 38.6 AVG has already been established from that date. In any event, the breach lasted 
until the date on which the full-time appointed Data Protection Officer took up his duties, i.e.

appointment of a data protection officer who does not comply with the requirement of 
a code of conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating factors. The imposition of sanctions, including 
administrative pecuniary sanctions, should be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with general principles of Union law and the Charter

potential impact on a huge number of stakeholders.

proportionate and dissuasive sanction within the meaning of Article 83 AVG, taking into account the assessment criteria laid down therein, in the amount of

85. The mitigating circumstances referred to by the Respondent in its response to the 
The mitigating circumstances referred to by the Respondent in its response to the Dispute Resolution Chamber's intention to impose an administrative fine, namely 
the absence of harm to the data subjects (Article 83.2(a) AVG ); the measures taken 
to detect and prevent potential conflicts of interest in a timely manner, notably by 
implementing appropriate policies and mechanisms as described in the conclusion (Article 83.2, c) AVG 
83.2 (c) AVG); the absence of previous relevant infringements (Section 83.2 (e) AVG), as well as the cooperation in good faith with the 
cooperation with the GBA in good faith (article 83.2 f) AVG), are taken into consideration by the Dispute Resolution Chamber when 
taken into account when determining the amount of the administrative fine. 
86. To answer the Respondent's objection concretely, the Dispute Resolution Chamber stated that 
although it has not been established that there was any damage on the part of the parties concerned 
the absence of any injury has not been established, nor have any previous infringements been identified. 
have been established. This finding leads the Chamber to reduce the initially proposed amount of the administrative fine, i.e. the amount of the fine that was imposed on the parties involved. 
EUR 100,000 to EUR 75,000. 
87. As regards the implementation of policies and mechanisms to avoid conflicts of interest, the 
With regard to the implementation of policies and mechanisms to avoid conflicts of interest, the Dispute Resolution Chamber notes that these were adopted late, i.e. well after the 
entry into force15
as well as the applicability16 of the AVG. The Conflicts of Interest Policy 
dates from 20 January 2020 and the specific DPO policy was implemented on 12 October 
2020 following the decision on the merits no. 18/2020 of 28 April 2020, as mentioned in the 
conclusion, a full-time DPO was not appointed until 1 July 2021. 
appointed on 1 July 2021. This means that although the Respondent cooperated with the 
GBA to remedy the breach and mitigate its potential negative effects, but 
this took place well after the entry into force and application of the AVG, 
which has an impact on the duration of the breach (see above, peripheral).
15 Pursuant to Article 99.1 AVG, the AVG entered into force on 25 May 2016.

annual accounts of the defendant.
d) Register of processing activities (Article 30 of the AVG)
90. With regard to the register of processing activities, the Inspectorate makes the following 
findings, as summarised below:
- The register of processing activities of the ORM/IRM/SIU19 services is incomplete;
- the register of processing operations contains only three processing operations, namely 
one processing activity for each of the services. The Inspectorate finds this strange, 
since in each of the three services there are different processing activities within the 
second-line function, so that it is rather abnormal to combine these processing activities into a single processing activity. 
these processing activities into one processing activity;

Decision on the merits 141/2021 - 24/26
- The defendant failed to provide a complete list of all processing purposes of personal 
personal data in accordance with Article 30.1(b) of the AVG;
- the following information in the register of processing activities is not visible:
- the name and contact details of the data protection officer 
in accordance with Article 30.1(a) of the AVG;
- a description of the time limits envisaged for the deletion of the different categories of data in accordance with Article 30.1(a) of the 
of data are to be erased pursuant to Article 30.1 f) AVG;
- a description of the technical and organisational security measures 
in accordance with Article 30.1 g) AVG.
- The register of processing activities should be complete and clear in itself, but the 
following terms are not explained: "12. TIN" and "S9. Criminal data" . Also, the description 
of the purposes of the processing is vague: 'E7\_To support the activities to safeguard and 
ensure the security and integrity of Y and/or the financial sector" and "C6\_Compliance with legal 
obligations', and does not accurately reflect the processing activity and processing purpose of these 
services provided by the defendant.
- Specifically with regard to the SIU service, the register of processing activities states that 
personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences are processed with 
processed with the following statement "S9. Criminal data". The Inspectorate finds it strange that 
The Inspectorate finds it strange that this is not specifically explained.

register and the obligation to communicate the register to the supervisory authority upon request, the AVG does not impose any 
authority, the AVG does not impose any other legal obligation concerning the register.
