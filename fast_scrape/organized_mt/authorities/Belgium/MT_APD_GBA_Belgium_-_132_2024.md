## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject filed a complaint to the Belgian DPA against (a) the owners of the building that the data subject was previously renting (hereinafter: controller 1) and (b) the First Instance Tribunal (hereinafter: controller 2). The complaint concerned the unlawful processing of the data subject´s civil status.

The processing happened in the context of a litigation in front of controller 2. More specifically, Belgian law requires the tenant to notify the lessors of any change in their civil status. In this instance, the data subject informed controller 1 about their divorce who then communicated this information to controller 2.

The data subject advanced two claims:

\- The data processing was unlawful under [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"); and

\- Controller 2 considered the change in civil status excessively as an infraction happened in 2013 cannot be justified by a divorce that happened in 2020.

The DPA first asked the data subject to contact the two controllers. However, the data subject replied that the violation of the GDPR was so blatant and that they saw no reason to contact them.

### Holding

The DPA dismissed the case against (a) controller 1 because the request is manifestly unfounded and excessive on the basis of [Article 57(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_57_GDPR#4 "Article 57 GDPR"). Particularly, the communication of the civil status change to controller 2 falls within the “legitimate interest” linked to their defence in the context of a dispute, and thus was in line with [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR").

Furthermore, the DPA dismissed the case against (b) controller 2 as the analysis of data processing has happened in connection with the exercise of a court's functions, rendering another court, and not the DPA, exclusively competent to examine the complaint.

Finally, the DPA further considered that there is already an open administrative procedure with a decision concerning similar matters.
