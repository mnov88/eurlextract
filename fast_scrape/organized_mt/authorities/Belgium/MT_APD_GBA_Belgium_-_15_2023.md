A public authority can rely on [Article 6(1)(e)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1e "Article 6 GDPR") to geo-locate the company cars of its employees since there were no less invasive alternatives and tracking was necessary for an efficient usage of its limited resources. In this case, the controller was however reprimanded for several other breaches of the GDPR.

## English Summary

### Facts

The controller was a public authority and the data subject was its employee. The data subject used a company car which the controller was tracking with a GPS.

At some point in the past, the data subject received a fraud report from the employer. The report showed that the car (and therefore the employee) stopped at certain addresses during working hours such as the employee's mother, a bar and some random streets.

On 31 March 2021, the data subject submitted a complaint explaining that he was not informed about the GPS tracking before receiving the report, nor was it included in the privacy policy.

Following the complaint, the DPA investigated and the Investigation Service issued a report which concluded that the controller breached the GDPR in several ways. The controller did not refute this and in the meantime, implemented new compliance measures.

### Holding

Regarding the legal basis for the processing, the DPA firstly stipulated that the controller relied on legitimate interest under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"), which could not be relied upon by a public authority in the performance of its tasks according to [Article 6(1)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR").

The DPA secondly assessed if the processing was necessary for the performance of a legal obligation under [Article 6(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1e "Article 6 GDPR"). The DPA held that under national law, public authorities only possess competences formally assigned to them by law. This implies that a public authority may only process personal data if this is necessary for a task it is legally obliged to fulfill. [Article 6(1)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1e "Article 6 GDPR") could therefore not be considered as a legal basis.

Thirdly (and finally), the DPA analysed if the controller could rely on [Article 6(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1e "Article 6 GDPR") as a legal basis. For it to be possible, the GPS tracking had to be necessary and directly related to the performance of a task in the public interest. The DPA considered that this should be interpreted in a broad way. It held that the efficient use of scarce government resources by checking the time tables of employees and the use of the company's car falls under the concept of "task carried out in the public interest".

For the necessity condition, the DPA analysed whether the GPS tracking in this case was necessary for the performance of the public interest task and if there were less invasive alternatives. The DPA determined that the processing happened under specific parameters (professional activities, with the company car, limited to the strictly necessary personal data). Other tracking mechanisms could also be more invasive and there was no other possible way for the controller to monitor the movements of the company car. Lastly, the amount of people who could access the data was strictly limited. The DPA concluded that the controller only processed personal data related to movement of a company car and that the intrusion on the personal life of the data subject was limited to what was strictly necessary for the purpose of fulfilling a public task. There was therefore a legal basis for the processing under [Article 6(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1e "Article 6 GDPR").

However, following the investigation, the DPA found violations of other sections of the GDPR, in particular :

*   The old cookie policy breached [Article 4(11) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#11 "Article 4 GDPR"), [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") while the new one partially remedies these breaches ;
*   The controller did not comply with the transparency and information obligation in its privacy policy, which constituted a violation of [Articles 12(1)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR"), [12(6)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#6 "Article 12 GDPR"), [13(1)](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#1 "Article 13 GDPR"), [13(2)](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#2 "Article 13 GDPR"), [14(1)](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR#1 "Article 14 GDPR"),[14(2)](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR#2 "Article 14 GDPR"), [5(2)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR"), [24(1)](/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR#1 "Article 24 GDPR") and [25(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR#1 "Article 25 GDPR") ;
*   The controller breached article [Article 30(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_30_GDPR#1a "Article 30 GDPR") by not including the contact details of the data protection officer in the register of processing activities ; and
*   The controller violated [Article 38(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_38_GDPR#3 "Article 38 GDPR") in the past but remedied to it in the meantime.

Consequently, the DPA reprimanded the controller but also held that most of the infractions have been remedied since the start of the proceeding.

## Comment

The Belgian DPA reversed the burden of proof in paragraph 117. as it stated that there were no concrete examples that allowed the DPA to conclude the DPO was not involved in a timely manner. It should come to the controller to prove the DPO was involved in a timely manner.

II. Motivation

 15. The Disputes Chamber then assesses each of the findings included in the report

      of the Inspectorate in light of the arguments put forward by the defendant in this regard

      resources.

    II.1. Article 5 (1) (a) and (2) of the GDPR and Article 6 (1) of the GDPR

        II.1.1. Article 5 (1) a) and Article 6 (1) GDPR with regard to legality

 16. The Litigation Chamber recalls that pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR personal data

      must be processed lawfully, fairly and transparently. This means that the

      processing must be based on the grounds for processing as set out in Article 6,

      paragraph 1 GDPR. When personal data is processed lawfully, the

      processing it properly. Finally, it must be clear for which
      purposes personal data are processed and how this is done.

 17. In further elaboration of this basic principle, Article 6 (1) GDPR states that personal data

      may only be processed on the basis of one of the following legal grounds:

               “a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his

               personal data for one or more specific purposes;

               b) the processing is necessary for the performance of an agreement in which

               the data subject is a party, or at the request of the data subject before the conclusion of

               an agreement to take measures; Decision on the substance 15/2023/2023 - 5/35

              c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation

              rests on the controller;

              d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of

              to protect another natural person;

              e) the processing is necessary for the performance of a general task

              interest or of a task in the exercise of public authority
              has been assigned to the controller;

              f) the processing is necessary for the protection of the justified person

              interests of the controller or of a third party, except when
              the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject

              that require the protection of personal data outweigh those

              interests, in particular when the data subject is a child.

              Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing by public authorities
              in the exercise of their duties.”

     Findings from the Inspection Report

18. The Inspectorate argues that the defendant has fulfilled the obligations imposed by Article 5(1)(a)

     and paragraph 2 of the GDPR and by Article 6 of the GDPR. To this end, the

     Inspectorate the following considerations apply:

          a. “The program processes the number plate of the vehicle and

              tracked, as well as the route followed. In principle, no names are given

              directors, but a head of department knows in most cases

              who is on the road with a vehicle.” It is clear from the complaint that the defendant

              concretely processed personal data of the complainant for the preparation and

              delivery of a note dated October 14, 2020.

          b. The defendant does not clarify in its answer on what legal basis

              the personal data of the directors are processed, despite the

              express request in this regard from the Inspectorate.

     Defendant's position

19. In its submissions, the defendant disputes these findings of unlawfulness

     processing of personal data in the context of the geolocation system is not. He poses
     take the necessary steps to avoid this in the future and until then the geolocation system

     no longer usable.

20. During the hearing dd. November 18, 2022, the defendant explains the steps taken

     since the submission of the above claims. Meanwhile, on September 21
     Approved a revised and up-to-date geolocation policy in 2021, in which the legal basis and Substantive decision 15/2023/2023 - 6/35

    purposes for the data processing at issue were included. As for the

    legal basis of the geolocation system, the defendant relies on it

    legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) in being able to trace its service vehicles.
    The defendant states that he has made an extensive weighing of interests between

    on the one hand its interest in operationalizing and optimizing its services, and on the other hand

    the interest of employees not to be subjected to excessive

    processing of their personal data.

    Review by the Litigation Chamber

21. The Litigation Chamber points out that the complaint relates to the control of the works

    testing times in August and September 2020, but that the geolocation policy has been in place since
    2009 until it was put on hold pursuant to the present proceedings.

22. The Disputes Chamber determines from the documents submitted by the defendant

    that the processing of personal data collected through geolocation, by the defendant
    started in 2009. On August 20, 2009, this geolocation system was discussed

    during the meeting of the Special Negotiating Committee. In this context, it was

    drafted an information document on the geolocation system on 19 August 2009.

    A note on the modalities of the geolocation system and a step-by-step plan of the

    its implementation was also drafted on August 19, 2009. After a collegiate
    decision of the Board of Mayor and Aldermen was made on September 28, 2009

    internal service note transferred to the staff, after which the geolocation system is switched on

    came into effect.

23. It is important to note that the information document predates the
    entry into force of the GDPR. Thus, no account could be taken of its creation

    be taken into account with the obligations under the GDPR, but with the obligations

    arising from Directive 95/46/EC, the legal predecessor of the GDPR. In the

    information document therefore describes the installation and use of it

    geolocation system tested against the principles of purpose limitation, proportionality and
    transparency. The Disputes Chamber concludes from this that the defendant has made a decision

    has made to protect the right to privacy of the data subjects as much as possible

    to protect. Also on September 28, 2009, an internal service note was distributed

    within the Implementation service in which the geolocation system is explained. In this note

    the various purposes are described, including combating unauthorized
    use of service vehicles as well as mapping the movements so that the

    proper and correct execution of the agreed work can be checked. The

    note explains which data can be obtained by the geolocation system

    (location of the car in real time, route traveled per day and per vehicle, etc.). In the note

    it is also stated that only the heads of service have access to the Substantive Decision 15/2023/2023 - 7/35

      geolocation data via a license and login code. All the above information,

      including examples of reports and a step-by-step implementation plan

      transferred to the staff.

  24. The GDPR has been applicable since 25 May 2018. The processing of personal data via

      the geolocation system should therefore be based on a foundation as specified in

      Article 6, paragraph 1 GDPR and the processing had to be done in accordance with the

      principles from Article 5 (1) GDPR. It belongs to the controller

      to indicate a lawful basis for its processing. This requirement also makes

      part of the principles of legality and transparency that he must apply

      (Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR - as explained in Recital 39 of the GDPR).

      Since different effects follow from one or the other legal basis, with

      in particular with regard to the rights of the data subjects, it should be clear to the data subjects

      on which legal basis the disputed processing is based. Serving those involved

      therefore be informed of the legal basis of the processing in accordance with the

      Articles 13 (1) (c) and 14 (1) (c) of the GDPR. As determined by the Inspectorate

      the aforementioned 2009 information document does not state on what legal basis the

      personal data of the directors are processed after they have been sent via the

      geolocation system are collected, despite the express requests of the

      inspection service in this regard. The defendant does not dispute this finding in its submissions.

  25. In view of the above, namely the lack of identification of the appropriate

      lawful basis for collecting and processing geolocation data

      of the complainant, the Litigation Chamber concludes that the defendant has committed an infringement

      to Articles 5(1)(a) and 6 GDPR as regards the period from 25 May 2018

      to cessation of the processing operations in question following the findings of the

      Inspection Service. In the present case, the Disputes Chamber finds that the defendant has already

      was aware of the need to adjust the geolocation policy even before the

      complaint was filed in this case, as a result of which the defendant acted negligently.

      The Litigation Chamber considers it to be part of the normal expectation pattern of

      a citizen whose data is processed by the government, who at the same time also their

      employer is that the obligations under the AVG and other legal provisions -

      proactive - be complied with. After all, the starting point should be that the defendant, just

      like any other controller, makes every effort to

      process personal data in a correct manner in accordance with the

      applicable regulations and does not adopt a wait-and-see attitude and therefore does not merely follow

      intervention of the Data Protection Authority takes action for that adjustment
                          3
      to accomplish. However, the Disputes Chamber also takes into account the fact that the

      defendant, already took into account when drawing up its geolocation policy in 2009

      taking into account the principles of finality, proportionality and rights of those involved.

      In addition, the 2009 geolocation policy transparently informs the

      those involved in the installed geolocation system.

  26. During the hearing, the defendant points out that the geolocation policy was adopted in 2021

      altered. This new policy explicitly explains that the geolocation system

      is based on the legal basis of the legitimate interest as understood in Article 6, paragraph

      1, f) GDPR. Consequently, the Litigation Chamber must verify whether the legitimate interest ex

      Article 6 (1) f) GDPR can serve as the legal basis for such processing by the

      defendant.

  27. The last sentence of Article 6 (1) f) GDPR stipulates that this legal basis of the

      legitimate interest does not apply to the processing of personal data by

      government authorities in the exercise of their duties. The question therefore arises whether

      the defendant can rely on this legal basis for the geolocation system.

  28. Since the defendant is a government agency, the above must be assessed

      in light of the principle of conferral of administrative powers, it

      principle of the specialty of legal persons and the principle of legality, which the

      determines the conditions under which the administration can interfere with the right to
      protection of privacy, of which the right to protection

      personal data is part. 4 According to the principle of the allocation of

      administrative powers, which is enshrined in Article 105 of the Constitution and Article

      78 of the Special Institutional Reform Act of August 8, 1980, the

      administrative authorities have no powers other than those formally vested in them

      granted by the Constitution and the laws and decrees that are thereunder

      issued. Furthermore, the specialty principle of legal entities states that each

      legal entity may only act to achieve the purpose or purposes

      achieve for which it was established, provided that only a legislature

      standard can entrust a legal entity with a public service mission. The Council of

      State, in its opinion on the draft law "on the protection of

      natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data".

      interference with the right to the protection of privacy of the

      data subjects. Under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and

      Article 22 of the Constitution, as interpreted in the settled case-law of the

      Constitutional Court, such interference must in particular have a legal basis

      are proportionate to the objective pursued and are sufficient

      organized in a clear way so that it is foreseeable for the citizen".

  29. In short, a government agency may only process personal data if this is the case
      processing is necessary for compliance with an obligation imposed by or pursuant to a

      legal provision has been imposed on one of the controllers (Article 6 para

      1, c) GDPR) or if this communication is necessary for the performance of a task of

      public interest assigned to one of the controllers by or

      pursuant to a law (Article 6(1)(e) GDPR). The Disputes Chamber will determine as much as necessary

      points out that it cannot be ruled out that in limited cases a public authority may appeal

      do on Article 6(1)(f) but that this for the geolocation system as described by

      the defendant is not possible. The legal basis from Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate

      interest) cannot apply to the processing at issue.

  30. In order for a controller to be able to rely on Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR,

      professions to process personal data, this processing must be necessary for

      the fulfillment of a task of general interest or of a task within the framework of the

      exercise of public authority vested in the controller

      assigned.

  31. The Disputes Chamber notes that the AVG offers no starting point for the

      answering the question to what extent understanding "processing necessary for the

      performance of a task in the public interest" would also include human resources management.

  32. However, a clear starting point for a broad interpretation of this concept is possible

      found in Regulation (EU) No. 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and the
      Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons

      with the processing of personal data by the institutions, bodies and authorities of the

      Union and the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No.

      45/2001 and Decision no. 1247/2002/EC, recital 22 of which reads: "\[...\]. The processing of

      personal data for the performance of the tasks assigned by the institutions or bodies of

      the Union in the public interest includes the processing of the

      management and operation of those institutions and bodies \[...\]".

  33. From this consideration, the Litigation Chamber deduces that Article 6(e) GDPR is not alone

      relates to processing operations that are necessary for the fulfillment of

5 Advice of the Council of State no. 63.192/2 of 19 April 2018, in Parl. St., K., Regular Session, 2017-2018, no. 54-3126/001, p.
421-422 Decision on the substance 15/2023/2023 - 10/35

      the task of public interest in the strict sense, but also to processing that is necessary

      for the performance of duties directly related to that duty of general

      interest, including those necessary for the management and operation of the

      bodies entrusted with that task of general interest.

  34. The Knowledge Center of the GBA has already confirmed that the processing of

      personal data by a government in the context of the management of its personnel

      means can take place on the basis of 6 (1) e) GDPR provided that the taken

      measures are actually necessary. 6

  35. In view of the above, the Litigation Chamber concludes that the concept of "processing that

      necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest".

      to be interpreted. Consequently, the notion of “processing is necessary for the

      performance of a task of public interest” refers to processing that is necessary

      are for the fulfillment of the task of general interest in the strict sense, but also on

      processing that is necessary for the performance of tasks that are directly related

      with that task of public interest, including those necessary for

      the management and functioning of the bodies entrusted with that task of general interest.

      Since the defendant without personnel and associated management of human resources

      could not perform its tasks in the public interest, processing of

      personal data in the context of personnel management should also be based on

      Article 6 (1) e) GDPR.

 36. In order to legitimately rely on the legal basis of Article 6(1)(e) GDPR

       personal data may therefore only be processed if this is necessary for the

       performance of a task in the public interest or if it is necessary for the exercise

       of the public authority entrusted to the controller. The processing must

       in these cases always have a basis in the law of the European Union or that of the

       Member State concerned, which must also state the purpose of the processing. Consequently, there must be

       whether these conditions are met in this case.

 37. Pursuant to Article 6(3) and Recital 45 of the GDPR, processing based on

       Article 6(1)(e) GDPR meet the following conditions:

            a. The controller must be responsible for fulfilling a

                assignment of public interest or an assignment that forms part of the

                exercise of public authority on any legal basis, regardless

 38. The Litigation Chamber will determine the conditions of public interest, legal basis and

       assess necessity below.

       Public interest task

  39. In this case, the defendant adopted the geolocation policy in order, on the one hand, to

      professional use of the service vehicles and the proper execution of it

      to check assigned work within the planned work schedule and, on the other hand, to check the

      monitor staff in the performance of their duties. The Disputes Chamber is therefore of

      believes that the public interest lies in scarce government resources, in this case the

      deploy fleet and personnel efficiently and to prevent fraud and misuse of services

      so that these resources can be used for the performance of the tasks
                                                8
      assigned to the municipality.

       A clear, precise and predictable legal basis

 40. According to recital 41 of the GDPR, this legal basis or legislative measure

       be clear and precise and its application must be for the litigants

       be foreseeable, in accordance with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the

       European Union (hereinafter: Court of Justice) and the ECHR. The European Court of the Rights of

       de Mens (hereinafter: ECHR) used the concept of predictability in the Rotaru judgment

       legal basis specified. Since that case involved surveillance systems

       of a state's security apparatus, the context of the present case differs. In

       in other cases, the ECtHR has indicated that it adheres to these principles

       can be guided, but it considers that these criteria, which in the specific context of

       that specific case have been established and followed thus not as such on all cases of

       be applicable.

                                                                11
 41. Pursuant to article 186, §1 of the Local Government Decree, the municipal council of each

       municipality determines the legal status of municipal employees. The city council and

       the council for social welfare establish a joint deontological code

       for the staff. This concretises the provisions included in the Local Decree

       Board and can assume additional deontological rights and obligations,

       in accordance with the organizational management system, as stipulated in articles 217 and
                                              12
       220 of the Local Government Decree The organizational system to be

       adopted by each municipality is described as the set of measures and

       procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that one:

       1°knowingandcontrollingthedefinedobjectivesachievedtheriskstoachievethese;

       2° comply with legislation and procedures;

       3° has reliable financial and management reporting;

       4° works in an effective and efficient manner and the available resources are economical

       stake;

       5° protects the assets and prevents fraud. 13

 42. In view of the above, the defendant is under a statutory obligation to take measures

       and procedures in relation to its organization to ensure that they are on

       works efficiently with an economic use of resources and prevents fraud,

       without explicitly specifying how this should be done concretely.

 43. The Litigation Chamber has already pointed this out in decision 149/2022 dd. 18

       October 2022 14 that tasks of public interest or public authority with which

       controllers are in charge, often not based on accuracy

       defined obligations or legislative standards, which define the essential features of the

       capture data processing. Rather, processing takes place on the basis of a

       more general authorization to act, such as for the fulfillment of the task that

       is necessary, as is also the case in this case. This leads to the relevant legal

       basis in practice often does not contain any concretely defined provisions regarding the

       necessary data processing. Controllers who are based on

       want to invoke such a legal basis on Article 6 (1 e) GDPR, you must do so yourself

       verify whether the processing is necessary for the task of public interest and interests

       of those involved.

      Necessity

 44. Pursuant to Article 6(1)(e) GDPR, processing is lawful only if and for

       insofar as the processing is necessary for the performance of a task of public interest or

       of a task in the context of the exercise of public authority vested in the

       controller is instructed. Contains as explained above

  Article 217 Decree on Local Government.
14See also decision 124/2021 dd. 10 November 2021. Decision on the substance 15/2023/2023 - 13/35

       legislation often lacks concretely defined provisions regarding the necessary

       data processing.

                                                       15
 45. The Court of Justice ruled on this condition of

       necessity:

       “Having regard to the aim of providing equivalent protection in all Member States, the concept

       necessity as it emerges from Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46, which a

       want to provide precise delineation for one of the cases in which the processing of

       personal data is permitted, i.e. does not have a content that differs from Member State to Member State

       member state. It is therefore an autonomous concept of Community law, which must be

       be interpreted in a way that fully fulfills the purpose of the directive such as
                                   16
       defined in Article 1(1).’

 46. The Advocate General also stated in his Opinions that “\[t\]t

       concept of necessity \[has\] a long history in Community law and a

       an integral part of the proportionality criterion. It means that the authority that

       adopts a measure to achieve a legitimate aim that

       Community law affects guaranteed rights, must demonstrate that this measure is the

       least restrictive to achieving this goal. In addition, when the processing of

       personal data can lead to an infringement of the fundamental right to respect for the
       privacy, Article 8 of the

       European Convention for the Protection of Human and Fundamental Rights

       freedoms (ECHR), which guarantees the right to respect for private and family life.

       As the Court has stated in its judgment in ÖsterreichischerRundfunke.a., a national

       regulation that is not in accordance with Article 8 ECHR, also does not comply with the provisions of Article 7, sub e, of

       requirement laid down in Directive 95/46. Article 8(2) of the ECHR provides that interference with the

       private life is permitted to the extent that it serves one of the purposes listed herein

       is pursuedand this is “necessary in a democratic society”.According to the

       European Court of Human Rights holds the adjective “necessary”

       in that a "compelling social need" for a particular action by the

       government exists and that the measure is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.

 47. This case law formulated in relation to Article 7(e) of Directive 95/46/EC

       remains relevant to this day. Article 6(1) of the GDPR takes over the wording from

       Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC.

 48. The Court of Justice has also clarified that if there are realistic and less
                                                                         17
       are radical alternatives, the treatment is not "necessary".

 49. The Litigation Chamber must therefore assess whether installing the

       geolocation system was necessary for the aforementioned public interest and whether there

       other less invasive options were to pursue the aforementioned public interest

       aim.The necessity of a geolocation system is apparent from the fact that the report

       of the meeting of the special negotiating committee of the defendant in which the

       geolocation system was explained and discussed, mentions that the organization of the

       fleet of the A should be better monitored as there were quite a few in the past

       have been incidents that could not pass the bracket. Since these incidents

       relate to movements outside the premises or domains of the defendant,

       states that it is impossible for him to verify in any other way whether the

       fleet is used optimally and to detect and prevent possible fraud.

       The geolocation system aims to put an end to these practices.

                                                                                               18
 50. Recently, the ECtHR has ruled in Florindo de Almeida Vasconcelos Gramaxot. Portugal
       spoke out about the use of geolocation systems for professional

       track movements. The ECtHR states that, by using only the geolocation data that

       relate to the professional displacements, to handle, the interference on it

       right to protection of private life was limited to what was necessary for the

       defense of the public interest of the defendant. The Disputes Chamber states that it

       processing of personal data via a geolocation system is therefore only possible

       in the specific circumstances set out in this judgment. In the present case, the

       findings of the ECtHR apply by analogy. The processed

       personal data also only relates to professional travel, with a

       service car, which is necessary for the promotion of the public interest, te

       know how to prevent fraud and the proper management of public funds.

  51. In view of the above, the geolocation system does indeed constitute an interference

      the right to protection of the private life of those concerned, but this one is earlier

      limited.The Litigation Chamber notes that, if the processing of geolocation data
                                                20
      happens under the conditions set, namely with regard to professional

      movements within working hours with a service car and limited to the data that

    are necessary, with the necessary guarantees that the processing of the data collected

    is done in accordance with the basic principles of Article 5 (1) GDPR, which in addition

    explained transparently, this system constitutes a less invasive interference than

    other methods of surveillance. Moreover, for the defendant there is no other
    feasible method to monitor the cars and the service movements in the context of

    the goals mentioned above. In addition, only consultation will be possible due to a limited

    number of persons described in the geolocation policy and if there is a specific

    there is reason to.

      II.1.2. Article 5(1)(a) GDPR with regard to transparency

52. When the controller bases processing on the public interest,

    then he must be transparent about this because of, among other things, the public interest pursued

    name, make clear for what purposes the personal data are processed,

    which personal data is processed, whether the data is shared with others

    parties and how long the personal data is kept.

53. As already mentioned, the defendant has drawn up a new geolocation policy. During the day

    the hearing provides the defendant with a draft of this amended

    geolocation policy. In this, the defendant explains and explains the legal basis and purposes

    he explains how the geolocation system works and how the people involved
    prior to moving with a vehicle equipped with such a system

    to verify its presence. In addition, the policy determines which data is there

    and not processed and for what purposes this data is processed and for

    which purposes it is not (such as checking speed limit compliance, a

    monitor employee permanently, etc.). Next, the geolocation policy clarified

    who has access to the personal data, how access can be obtained
    by these persons (such as via a login code) and the retention period of the data. The

    Defendant notes that the new geolocation policy has yet to be approved

    – early 2023 – after which the geolocation system can be started. In this context

    the defendant will develop a process to explain this new policy to all

    persons involved, for which a signature will be required for acknowledgment.

54. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that the mere fact that the defendant is not the correct one

    lawful basis has applied in the past the processing in the future

    not necessarily invalid. The Litigation Chamber notes that it is as above

    described collection and processing of geolocation data may be lawful,

    if the appropriate legal basis is correctly determined and the above
    transparency obligations in this regard are complied with by the defendant

    of its staff. The Disputes Chamber refers to the design of the new

    geolocation policy approved by the city council on September 21, 2021. Substantive decision 15/2023/2023 - 16/35

      Since only the data related to the movements carried out in the context of
      the performance of (certain aspects of) the job, is the degree of interference with the law

      on data protection limited to what is necessary to protect the public interest

      pursuit, namely the proper organization and management of public funds of the

      defendant on the other. The Disputes Chamber therefore states that the processing of

      personal data collected through a geolocation system can be done by the

      defendant provided that the conditions of Article 6(1)(e) are met.

    II.2. Article 5 of the GDPR, Article 24(1) of the GDPR and Article 25(1) and (2) of the
         AVG

        II.2.1. Article 5 (2) GDPR, Article 24 (1) and Article 25 (1).

 55. The Litigation Chamber recalls that each controller has the

      basic principles on the protection of personal data as understood in Article 5,

      must comply with paragraph 1 GDPR and must be able to demonstrate this. That follows from the

      accountability in Article 5(2) GDPR in conjunction with Article 24(1) GDPR as
                                         21
      confirmed by the Litigation Chamber.

 56. Based on Articles 24 and 25 of the GDPR, the defendant must take appropriate technical and

      take organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the

      processing takes place in accordance with the GDPR. The defendant must do so

      effectively implement data protection principles, the rights of data subjects

      as well as only process personal data that is necessary for each

      specific purpose of the processing.

 57. As part of its investigation, the Inspectorate assessed to what extent the

      the defendant has taken the necessary technical and organizational measures to

      comply with these principles from Article 5 (1) GDPR and in particular the principle of

      legality and transparency (see II.1). In this regard, the Inspectorate decides that the

      the defendant has not sufficiently demonstrated that he has taken the necessary measures

      so that the incontestable processing takes place in accordance with article 5, paragraph 1a) and article

      6 (1) GDPR, since the Inspection Service has concluded that the processing

      were inconsistent with these principles.

 58. During the hearing, the defendant explained that a new

      geolocation policy has been drawn up and approved. This is the next step in the process

      to communicate to all employees involved, according to the defendant. In this way

      the defendant wanted to comply with the guidelines on making the way of transparent

      work towards employees.

21 Decision on the merits 34/2020 of 23 June 2020 available via the web page
https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be/professioneel/publicaties/besluiten. Decision on the substance 15/2023/2023 - 17/35

59. The Litigation Chamber ruled in part II.1 that there was indeed an infringement

     to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR with regard to legality for the period between 25 May

     2018 and when the defendant ceased the processing at issue. For

     with regard to the transparency principle, the Litigation Chamber notes that in the
     geolocation policy from 2009 and the accompanying internal memorandum show that the

     employees have been informed, but the defendant does not show that they

     in this respect complies with accountability since the entry into force of the GDPR,

     for example by updating the geolocation policy

     and request confirmation of receipt from the employees concerned. As

     already explained above, the defendant had to check on its own initiative whether
     he complies with the obligations under the GDPR from 25 May 2018. The Disputes Chamber also states

     established that the defendant could not demonstrate that he had the necessary technical and organizational

     has taken measures to comply with the principle of legality and the

     principle of transparency as understood in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR since 25 May 2018. Therefore

     the Disputes Chamber rules that there is a violation of Article 5(2) in this context

     Article 24 (1) and Article 25 (1) GDPR.

      II.2.2. Article 5 (1) GDPR

60. Although Article 5(1) and (2) GDPR are closely linked, any one means

     violation of the accountability obligation of Article 5 (2) GDPR is not automatically also a

     Violation of Art. 5 (1) GDPR. After all, accountability is the formal one
     externalization through documents to ensure compliance with the material

     basic principles of the GDPR.

61. As regards compliance with Article 5(1)(a), the Litigation Chamber refers to section II.1

     of this decision. As regards the basic principles contained in Article 5(1),
     b)t.e.m.f)does the Dispute Chamber not have sufficient elements to make an assessment

     to go over.

  II.3. Article 4, 11) of the GDPR, Article 5, paragraph 1, a) and paragraph 2 of the GDPR, Article 6, paragraph 1, a) of the
        GDPR and article 7, paragraph 1 and paragraph 3 of the GDPR for the use of non-strictly necessary
        cookies

62. Based on Article 4, 11), Article 5(1)(a) and (2), Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7(1) and (3)

     GDPR, it is necessary that the controller who invokes the consent

     as a legal basis for the processing, can demonstrate that the data subject has effective consent

     has given. Article 7, paragraph 3 GDPR sets strict conditions for withdrawing a

     valid permission.

      II.3.1. Findings from the Inspection Report Substantive decision 15/2023/2023 - 18/35

63. The Inspectorate first established that there could be no question of a valid

    consent to the placement of cookies that are not strictly necessary, given on the one hand the

    interface design of the cookie banner and, on the other hand, the flawed information in it

    cookie policy. Secondly, the Inspectorate finds that the defendant did not comply with
    the conditions regarding the withdrawal of a valid consent.

64. With regard to the consent process and more specifically the interface of the

    cookie banner, the Inspection Service determines that a data subject on the cookie banner two

    options for the use of cookies that are not strictly necessary, namely
    on the one hand 'continue' and on the other hand 'more info'. These were not on an equal footing

    way. In addition, the choice was missing in the cookie banner that came with the

    opening the website allows data subjects to use not strictly necessary

    cookies in the first information layer by refusing one click.

65. With regard to the transparency obligations in the context of an informed

    permission, the Inspectorate has determined that the defendant's data subjects

    did not receive transparent information about the consequences for their personal data

    the use of cookies. After all, the defendant was informed by the parties involved in the

    cookie window is not given an explanation of the consequences of their choice. The privacy statement

    of the defendant provided only vague information about the consequences for them
    personal data through the use of cookies by the defendant, such as which are not strict

    necessary cookies exactly the defendant uses on its website and what the purposes

    of the processing of the personal data of the data subjects for each of them

    cookies; how long the personal data of the data subjects that were processed via not

    Strictly necessary cookies are stored on the defendant's website or which ones

    the criteria are for determining that period; what concrete steps should be taken by those involved
    if they wanted to change the cookie settings via their internet browser.

66. Finally, no explanation was given to data subjects in the cookie window about how a

    given consent can be withdrawn.

67. In view of the above, the Inspectorate has determined that there are no legally valid

    consent within the meaning of Article 5, Article 6 (1) a) and Article 4.11) in conjunction with Article 7 GDPR

    asked the website visitors for the use of not strictly necessary

    cookies, which means that it cannot be demonstrated either.

      II.3.2. Defendant's position

68. First, the defendant emphasizes that the process of updating its cookie and

    cookie policy had already started, even before he was informed of the findings

    of the Inspection Service and shortly afterwards the new cookie and cookie policy
    implemented on the website and the consent policy regarding the use of Decision Substance 15/2023/2023 - 19/35

    cookies on the website. The cookie banner has been adjusted so that the data subject

    is no longer steered in a certain direction with regard to the placement of

    analytical and other not strictly necessary cookies. The person concerned can also contact any

    visit the website in a simple way to adjust his preferences again via a link
    'cookie settings' at the bottom of the website. By way of illustration, the defendant makes several

    screenshots about.

69. With regard to these findings, the defendant argues that a new cookie policy

    was worked out. At the time of drafting the conclusion, the proposal was with its services
    ICT and Communication for review and implementation was scheduled for March 18, 2022.

    During the hearing, the defendant admits that the new cookie policy is now transparent

    explains which cookies are used, for what purposes this happens, what

    what happens to the collected data, how the data subject can manage its use,

    when the defendant passes the cookies on to third parties and under which

    conditions this would happen. The defendant also points out that in the new cookie policy
    it is indicated how the data subject can determine via the browser settings how the

    web browser handles cookies. Furthermore, the new cookie policy informs the

    data subject about his rights and about the possibility of contacting the

    defendant as controller, or with the officer for

    data protection, and how the visitor can manage its use, when the

    cookies are passed on to third parties and, if applicable, under what conditions.
    Finally, the new cookie policy also informs users about their rights and the

    possibility to contact the defendant as data controller,

    or with the data protection officer.

      II.3.3. Review by the Litigation Chamber.

70. With regard to legal consent within the meaning of the aforementioned articles,

    the Litigation Chamber determines that the interface of the cookie banner and the cookie policy

    were indeed adjusted since the Inspection Report, as indicated by the

    defendant at the hearing. Although the adjustments were only made after the

    intervention of the Inspectorate, which does not detract from the earlier

    findings of the Inspectorate, the Litigation Chamber will only discuss the new ones below
    cookie banner and review the new cookie policy. by the Inspectorate

    the established infringements were after all clear and were not contested by the defendant.

71. The Litigation Chamber will first assess the consent process, in particular the interface

    of the cookie banner and the information obligations regarding the cookies in the cookie policy.
    Subsequently, the Litigation Chamber will check whether the conditions regarding the withdrawal of the

    valid permission was respected. Decision on the substance 15/2023/2023 - 20/35

            1. Consent lawfully given

  72. Before examining whether there is valid consent in the present case,

      reminds the Litigation Chamber of the conditions that must be met in order for a

      legally valid consent. Article 5.3 of the ePrivacy Directive , 22

      as transposed in article 10/2 of the law of 30 July 2018 on the protection of

      natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data (hereinafter:

      Data Protection Act). 23 stipulates that the consent of the data subjects is required

      for placing the cookies, except when it concerns strictly necessary cookies.

  73. Recital 17 of the ePrivacy Directive clarifies that for the application of the concept

      “consent” should have the same meaning as “consent of the data subject” such as

      defined and specified in the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (which is now

      replaced by the GDPR). This was also clarified in guidelines on consent

      by the Data Protection Group. 24

  74. Article 4, 11) GDPR defines “consent” of the data subject as “any free, specific,

      informed and unambiguous expression of will by the data subject by means of a

      statement or an unequivocal active act concerning him processing of

      accepts personal data”.

  75. Article 7 GDPR stipulates the conditions applicable to the consent:

      1. When processing is based on consent, the controller must

      be able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing of

      his personal data.

      2. If the data subject gives consent in the context of a written statement that

      also relates to other matters, the request for consent shall be submitted in

      an intelligible and easily accessible form and in clear and plain language

      presented in such a way that a clear distinction can be made from the others

      matters. When any part of such statement constitutes an infringement

      to this regulation, this section is not binding.

      3. The data subject has the right to withdraw his consent at any time. Withdrawing

      of the consent leaves the lawfulness of the processing based on the

      consent before its withdrawal. Before being the data subject

      consents, he will be notified thereof. Withdrawal of consent

      is as simple as giving it.

22Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 on the processing of
personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive
on privacy and electronic communications), OJ L 201, 31.7.2002
23Law of 30 July 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of

personal data, B.S., September 5, 2018.

      4. When assessing whether consent can be freely given, the

      take into account, among other things, the question whether for the implementation of a

      agreement, including a service agreement, requires consent

      a processing of personal data that is not necessary for the implementation of that

      agreement.

           1.1 Consent lawfully given: cookie banner

  76. With the new cookie banner, the visitor to the website is given the choice of, on the one hand, the

      manage or otherwise agree to cookie preferences (i.e. all not strictly

      accept necessary cookies = global opt-in button). When you click on the

      option 'Manage cookie preferences', more information appears about the cookies that are used

      are divided into the following three categories: “necessary”, “analytical cookies” and

      "cookies with your preferences" where information is always given in understandable language about

      the purpose of these cookies. The data subject can therefore, as far as the not strict

      necessary cookies, give the consent per above category. So there is none

      button present at the same level as the global opt-in button where the

      can refuse permission for all non-strictly necessary cookies. Referring to it

      Report of the Task Force Cookie Banner of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) , 25

      the Disputes Chamber notes that these adjustments to the new cookie banner are already a step

      are in the right direction with regard to the findings of the Inspectorate with

      regarding the old cookie banner.

  77. For the sake of completeness, the Disputes Chamber notes the following matters. First

      the aforementioned Task Force Cookie Banner report clarifies the rules regarding a

      legally given consent. There should be a button for rejecting all non-strict

      necessary cookies to be available at the same level of information as the global opt-

      on the first layer of information, for example by buttons titled “accept all”

      and “reject everything”. At the moment, the new cookie banner only provides an opt-in button

      but no global button to deny permission. In view of the publication of this report

      after closing the debates, the Litigation Chamber formulates the above as

      recommendation.

  78. Secondly, the Disputes Chamber also notes that in the new cookie banner the button “my

      manage choice” is white, like the background of the cookie banner, while the button “all

      accept cookies” has a turquoise background, which contrasts with the white one

      background, and thus directs the data subject to accept all cookies. For as much as

      necessary, the Litigation Chamber points out that the aforementioned report of the Cookie Banner Task

      ForceoftheEDPBstatesthatthismayconsideraninvalidconsent,butthatthiscase

      must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In view of the publication of this report after the close of

      the debates, the Litigation Chamber formulates the above as a recommendation.

           1.2 Consent lawfully given: cookie policy

  79. The Litigation Chamber notes that the cookie policy has been amended in accordance with the

      most of the Inspectorate's comments. The Disputes Chamber takes this

      deed and will now only discuss the new cookie policy. Although the new cookie policy

      even if steps are taken in the right direction compared to the old cookie policy that was examined

      by the Inspectorate, it is recommended that the following elements

      also to provide for the new cookie policy. First, the Disputes Chamber determines

      that the cookies present are divided into the following three categories: necessary,

      analytical and cookies with preferences. The Litigation Chamber finds that in the category

      'cookies with your preferences' contains cookies with different purposes. So would the

      cookies with the purpose of collecting user feedback to improve our website

      improve, better placed in the category of analytical cookies, while the cookies

      for the purpose of “capturing your interests in order to provide tailored content and

      to be able to offer offers' have marketing as their purpose. Considering the principle of

      granularity, the Litigation Chamber formulates the recommendation to classify the cookies

      'cookies with your preferences' can also be classified per objective. This allows the person concerned

      to make a more nuanced choice. Secondly, the Litigation Chamber notes that

      it is not clear from the cookie policy to whom the data collected via the cookies

      is being sent. The Litigation Chamber also recommends that these recipients also be registered

      include in the cookie policy. Finally, the Disputes Chamber points out that with the

      browser settings no valid consent can be collected regarding the

      AVG.On the one hand, because the users cannot (yet) give permission according to

      the purposes pursued by the different types of cookies. The permission given through the

      browser settings is therefore not sufficiently specific with regard to the
                                28
      requirements of the GDPR. On the other hand, because the browser settings can default

      provide for the acceptance of the cookies, without the data subject being aware of this

      is, as a result of which the consent does not constitute an explicit active act and is therefore not

      is legally valid within the meaning of the GDPR.

  80. In view of the above, the Disputes Chamber rules that there was an infringement

      to Article 4, 11), Article 5, paragraph 1, a) and Article 6, paragraph 1 GDPR, and that these have been partially remedied

      became.

      2. Withdrawal of a given consent

  81. With regard to the transparent information about the withdrawal of a data

      consent to the use of cookies that are not strictly necessary, remembers the

      Litigation Chamber that the data subject has the right under Article 7(3) GDPR

      has to withdraw his consent at any time, and that the withdrawal of the

      consent should be as simple as giving it. The person concerned must do so

      shall be notified of this right under the same provision, before he is

      gives permission.

  82. In this context, the Litigation Chamber notes that at the bottom of the website a link 'cookie

      settings' is available, whereby the data subject returns to the above

      selection menu from the cookie banner regarding the consent of the categories of cookies.

      According to the aforementioned Cookie Banner Task force report, the website

      provide readily available options to withdraw consent, at any time

      moment, such as by placing a link in a visible and obvious place. 29 The link

      "cookie settings" is located at the bottom of the defendant's website, where common

      the links to the privacy policy and cookie policy are there, and the link is at any time

      accessible. The Disputes Chamber therefore concludes that the defendant is transparent

      provides information and functionality about withdrawing a given consent

      the use of cookies that are not strictly necessary in accordance with Article 7 (3) of the GDPR.

  83. In view of the above, concludes that there is no longer any infringement of
      Article 7, paragraph 3 GDPR. This does not alter the fact that there was a historic breach that became in the meantime

      remedied.

    II.4. Article 12, paragraph 1 and paragraph 6 of the GDPR, Article 13, paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of the GDPR and Article 14, paragraph

         1 and paragraph 2 GDPR, Article 5 paragraph 2 GDPR, Article 24 paragraph 1 GDPR and Article
         25 (1) GDPR

  84. Based on Article 12(1) GDPR, Article 13(1) and (2) GDPR and Article 14(1)

      and paragraph 2 of the GDPR, it is necessary for the defendant to be the controller

      provides the data subjects with concise, transparent and comprehensible information about the

      personal data that are processed. The aforementioned transparency obligations form

      a concretization of the general transparency obligation of Article 5(1)(a) of the

      AVG. As already explained, the defendant must have the appropriate technical and

29 EDPB, Report of the work undertaken by the Cookie Banner Taskforce, January 17, 2023,
https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-01/edpb\_20230118\_report\_cookie\_banner\_taskforce\_en.pdf, p. 8. Decision on the substance 15/2023/2023 - 24/35

    take organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the

    processing takes place in accordance with the GDPR. The defendant must do so

    effectively implement data protection principles, the rights of data subjects
    as well as only process personal data that is necessary for each

    specific purpose of the processing.

      II.4.1. Findings in the Inspection Report

85. Based on its investigation, the Inspectorate concludes that the

    the defendant's privacy statement was not transparent and understandable to the defendant

    data subjects as imposed by Article 12 (1) GDPR and from the point of view of

    data protection contained irrelevant and incorrect information. Different elements

    in the privacy statement were superfluous because it does not have the protection of

    personal data went. Second, created the defendant's privacy statement
    wrongly the perception to the data subject that the defendant fully complies with the GDPR

    complied with, quod non, according to the Inspectorate. Thirdly, the privacy statement stated

    wrong that the data subject always had to prove his identity before exercising

    the rights of data subjects in the GDPR. This was incorrect because the defendant complied

    article 12, paragraph 6 GDPR, only additional information may be requested from the data subject when he
    has reasons to doubt the identity of the natural person making the request

    submits as referred to in Articles 15 up to and including 21 GDPR. Fourth, the

    privacy statement of the defendant is wrongly not the possibility for the data subjects

    to submit a complaint to the Data Protection Authority. Finally, the

    the defendant's privacy statement is not clear and therefore not transparent to the

    stakeholders with regard to the interchangeable use of the terms
    “personal data” and “data”, the purposes and legal bases of the processing, the

    transfer of personal data and the adjustments that have been made.

86. In addition, the defendant's privacy statement was, according to the findings of the
    Inspection service, incomplete because not all mandatory according to Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR

    information to be stated was effectively stated. After all, no information was included

    about the contact details of the data protection officer, the

    processing purposes and the legal basis for the processing, the recipients or the

    categories of recipients of the personal data, the storage period or the criteria for
    determination of that period, the right of the data subject to limitation of the him

    regarding processing as well as the right to data portability,

    the right to withdraw a given consent and the right to lodge a complaint

    to the Data Protection Authority. Decision on the substance 15/2023/2023 - 25/35

      II.4.2. Defendant's position

87. . With regard to these findings, the defendant argues that a new privacy policy

    was worked out. At the time of drawing up the conclusion, the proposal was with the services

    ICT and Communication for review. The implementation took place on March 18, 2022.
    With regard to the privacy statement, the defendant argues that it has been updated

    to comply with the findings of the Inspectorate. So became irrelevant

    passages are omitted, so that the statement only contains the relevant provisions

    contains in accordance with the GDPR (principles of processing, purposes, legal basis,

    data transfer, rights of data subjects and contact and complaint options

    The involved). The defendant no longer automatically demands proof of identity
    prior to the exercise of the rights of the person concerned.This will only be requested

    when the identity of the data subject cannot be ascertained in any other way

    insured. The privacy statement was also supplemented with the various options that

    the data subject has to file a complaint in the event of a possible violation of the

    protection of his personal data. The privacy statement now also uses

    consistent wording and to clarify the grounds for processing
    specific examples are included, according to the defendant. In addition, the

    privacy statement under the title “History of changes” next to the date of revision

    also the subjects that have been effectively adapted. Finally, the defendant points out that

    following information has been added to the privacy statement: contact details of the

    data protection officer, purposes for processing, legal basis for

    the processing, mention that only the defendant acts as controller and the

    receives data, stating that the defendant no longer has the data in principle
    than necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, the rights of the

    data subjects and the possibilities for complaint of the data subjects. Thedefendantistherefore

    believes that the information it provides to data subjects meets the requirements of

    Articles 12, 13 and 14 of the GDPR

      II.4.3. Review by the Litigation Chamber

88. The Litigation Chamber points out that the GDPR determines which information must be mandatory

    included in the privacy statement, and more specifically in articles 13 and 14 GDPR. This

    Transparency requirements are further explained in the Transparency Guidelines

    in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the Data Protection Working Party.

89. Since the defendant carries out a large number of data processing operations, resulting in a

    large amount of information must be provided to the data subjects, the decision on the substance is 15/2023/2023 - 26/35

      Litigation Chamber is of the opinion that a controller such as the defendant has a

      multi-layered approach: 30

        - On the one hand, the data subject must have clear and

            accessible information about the fact that there are information about the processing of

            personal data exists (privacy policy) and where he will be able to do it in full

            find.

        - On the other hand, without prejudice to the accessibility of the

            privacy policy in its entirety, from the first communication of the

            controller with him be informed of the

            details of the purpose of the processing in question, the identity of the

            controller and the rights available to him.

  90. The importance of providing this multi-layered information ensures accessible and

      comprehensible information for the data subjects, an obligation arising in particular from

      Recital 39 of the GDPR. All additional information within the meaning of Articles 13 and 14 GDPR that

      necessary to enable the data subject on the basis of the information provided at this first level

      information to understand what the consequences of the processing in question will be for him,

      must be added.

  91. The Litigation Chamber consulted the current privacy statement of the defendant and stated
      thereby, indeed, that the latter was updated in such a way that the account becomes

      took into account most of the comments of the Inspectorate and the

      privacy statement was therefore almost completely aligned with the

      relevant provisions of the GDPR. The Disputes Chamber takes note of this.

  92. It is noted, however, that the new privacy statement does not yet address this

      arrived at all the findings of the Inspectorate.

  93. First of all, the Disputes Chamber notes that the privacy statement does not state clearly

      makes of the retention periods of the personal data concerned or the criteria for

      provision thereof, as required by Article 13 (2) a) GDPR. The privacy statement states

      the following in this regard: “In principle, \[we\] do not store your data longer than

      is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. Being a government agency

      however, we are often required by law to keep your personal data longer, under
      more on the basis of archive legislation. It is also possible that your personal data

      further processed for scientific and historical research or statistical purposes

      purposes". However, the Guidelines of the Data Protection Group show that

30 In the same sentence: decision no. 81/2020 of the Litigation Chamber (points 53 and following) and decision 76/2021 (points 58
et seq.), available via the web page
https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be/professioneel/publicaties/besluiten. Decision on the substance 15/2023/2023 - 27/35

      such formulation is not sufficient. The Data Protection Group points out in this regard

      note that the (mention of the) retention period is related to the principle of minimum

      data processing covered by Article 5 (1) c) GDPR as well as the requirement of storage limitation

      of Article 5 (1) e) GDPR. It specifies that “the storage period (or the criteria for

      determine) may be dictated by factors such as legal requirements or sectoral

      guidelines, but should always be formulated in such a way that the data subject, on the basis

      of his or her own situation, can assess the retention period for specific
                                31
      data/purposes”. The Litigation Chamber is of the opinion that this is a violation

      means of Article 13 (1) c) and 14 (2) c) GDPR.

  94. Secondly, the Disputes Chamber notes in this context that the privacy statement is not op

      mentions in sufficient detail the exact legal basis(s) and

      purposes of the processing and which personal data are used for this

      personal data concerned, as required by Articles 13 and 14 GDPR. The Dispute Room

      notes that the privacy statement does mention these elements, but that the way in which

      is not understandable and transparent to the data subjects, as it is not clear to the

      data subject which data are processed for which purpose and on what basis
      legal basis this happens. Ideally, the controller provides a list

      of the different purposes for which he processes personal data, with each time the

      indication of which (categories of) personal data are processed for this purpose, via which

      source they were obtained, for how long they are kept and with what (categories of)

      recipients they (may) be shared.

  95. The Disputes Chamber notes that the other findings of the Inspectorate
      meanwhile was met by the amendments made by the defendant

      to the privacy statement, but notes, however, that these findings at the time of the

      performance of the inspection investigation are indisputable. The Disputes Chamber points it out

      note that the defendant has made efforts to obtain the compensation under the

      Articles 12, 13 and 14 GDPR to adjust the information to be provided, albeit after receipt

      of the Inspectorate's comments.

  96. The Litigation Chamber deduces from the above-listed findings of infringements that the

      defendant's transparency obligations under Article 12 GDPR and its information obligation

      from Articles 13 and 14 GDPR has not been complied with. In doing so, the defendant has acted negligently
      acted contrary to his accountability as stipulated in Article 5, paragraph 2 and 24 of

      the GDPR.

  II.5. Article 30, paragraph 1, paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 of the GDPR

97. In order to effectively apply the obligations contained in the GDPR, it is of

    It is essential that the controller (and the processors) have an overview

    of the processing of personal data that they carry out. So this registry is
    primarily a tool to assist the controller in the

    compliance with the GDPR for the various data processing operations it carries out because it

    register makes its main features visible. The obligations regarding this

    register of processing activities are defined in Article 30 GDPR.

98. Pursuant to Article 30 GDPR, each controller must keep records

    of the processing activities carried out under its responsibility.

    Article 30(1)(a) to (g) GDPR stipulates that, with regard to the

    of processing operations carried out by the controller, the following information

    must be available:

    a) the name and contact details of the controller and any

         joint controllers and, where applicable, of the

         representative of the controller and of the officer for

         data protection;

    b) the processing purposes;

    c) a description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of
         personal data;

    d) the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be

         provided, including recipients in third countries or international organisations;

    e) where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or a

         international organisation, including the reference to that third country or countries

         international organization and, in the case of the organizations referred to in Article 49(1) second subparagraph GDPR,

         such transfers, the documents concerning the appropriate safeguards;

    f) if possible, the envisaged time limits within which the different categories of

         data must be erased;

    g) if possible, a general description of the technical and organizational

         security measures as referred to in Article 32 (1) GDPR.

99. The processing register must be in written form, including in electronic form,
    be drawn up (Article 30(3) GDPR). In accordance with Article 30 (4) GDPR, the

    controller shall make the register of processing available to the

    supervisory authority at its request. Decision on the substance 15/2023/2023 - 29/35

 100. With regard to the register of processing activities, the Inspection Service notes that

      the defendant does not have the obligations imposed by Article 30 (1), (3) and (4) GDPR

      complied. After all, the Inspectorate only has a part of the register
      receive processing activities, namely the building maintenance part.

      The part that was transferred meets the requirements of the Inspectorate

      does not meet the minimum requirements from Article 30 paragraph 1 GDPR as the following are mandatory

      entries are missing:

           a. The contact details of the defendant (Article 30(1)(a) GDPR).

           b. A description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of

               personal data (Article 30(1)(c) GDPR). There is a short general summary
               provided, but that is not a description, according to the Inspectorate.

101. The Litigation Chamber must rule on whether Article 30(1)(c) GDPR requires

      that a description is given of the categories of personal data and the
      categories of data subjects in the register of processing activities, or whether a

      summary will suffice.

102. Concerning the lack of protection of the categories of data subjects
      personal data, the defendant asks for clarification in its conclusions. There are

      indeed general examples are included in this regard, but the defendant states that

      they do give an idea of the type of data that is meant. In the GDPR, the

      Defendant cannot find a definition of what a description should be.

103. The Litigation Chamber notes that Article 30(1)(c) GDPR requires that a description of the

      categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal data

      included in the register of processing activities. Those involved are the

      identified or identifiable natural persons whose data are collected

      processed (Article 4 (1) of the GDPR). Regarding the categories data, of course it has to
      concern personal data as defined in Article 4 (1) of the GDPR.

104. The Disputes Chamber finds that the defendant in its register of

      processing activities enumerates:

    - the categories of data subjects (Article 30(1)(c) GDPR), i.e. “staff members”.

    - the categories of personal data (Article 30(1)(c) GDPR), namely the “Data

       Geolocation system \[...\]: number plate, route traveled, vehicle description”.

105. The Litigation Chamber recalls the purpose of the register of
      processing activities. To effectively fulfill the obligations contained in the GDPR

      apply, it is essential that the controller (and the

      processors) have an overview of the processing of personal data that they

      to carry out. This register is therefore primarily an instrument for

      assist the controller in GDPR compliance for the various

      data processing it carries outbecause the register retains its main features

      makes visible. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that this processing register is a

      essential tool in the context of the accountability obligation already mentioned (Article 5,

      paragraph 2, and Article 24 GDPR) and that this register forms the basis of all obligations that the
      GDPR imposes on the controller.

106. Regarding the mandatory information pursuant to Article 30(1)(c) GDPR regarding the

      description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of

      personal data, the Disputes Chamber notes that neither the text of the GDPR nor the

      objectives of the GDPR prevent an enumeration of the categories of

      personal data and categories of data subjects are included in the register of

      processing activities or whether a more detailed description would be required.

107. With regard to the categories of recipients, the Litigation Chamber refers to a
                              32 33
      recommendation of the CPP and the doctrine setting out that while it is not
      it is necessary to state the individual recipients of the data, but that they are

      can be grouped by recipient category. Mutatis mutandis can do this

      statement can also be applied to the categories of personal data and data subjects.

      The Disputes Chamber hereby emphasizes that the information about the categories of

      personal data and data subjects must be such that in the event of an exercise

      of the right of access by a data subject, the controller specific

      must be able to provide information to this data subject about the exact data processed

      data and the specific recipients of its personal data. 34

108. However, the Disputes Chamber points out that the completion of the register of

      processing activities must always be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the

      description or enumeration contained herein is sufficiently clear and concrete. In this

      case, the Litigation Chamber states that the description “personnel” is clear, since this

      file shows that it concerns the employees of the Maintenance Buildings service. Also the

      enumeration of the data generated by the software of the geolocation system

      processed are clear. Consequently, the Dispute Chamber determines that in the case mentioned above

      enumerations comply with the requirements of Article 30 (1) (c) GDPR.

109. As regards the missing entries from Article 30(1)(a) GDPR, the

      Litigation Chamber determines that the contact details of the officer for

  W. Kotschy, "Article 30: records of processing activities", in Ch. KUNER The EU General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), a commentary, 2020, pg. 621.
34ECJ, 12 January 2023, Österreichische Post AG, C-154/21, ECLI:EU:C:2023:3, para 36. Decision on the substance 15/2023/2023 - 31/35

      data protection are included in the modified version of the register

      processing activities.This does not alter the fact that there was a historical breach of Article 30,

      paragraph 1, a) GDPR and that it has been remedied in the meantime.

110. As regards the transmission of the register of processing activities, the

      defendant does not that it was not submitted to the Inspectorate in its entirety. This

      after all, the register of processing activities consists of several excel files, te

      know one document per government department and it was reasoned by the defendant that
      only the processing register of the service concerned had to be submitted. The

      In its conclusions, the defendant declares that it is willing to submit the complete register of

      processing activities, and has done so prior to the

      hearing. The Disputes Chamber cannot deduce from further correspondence that the

      Inspectorate would have requested these additional sheets.

111. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that the defendant has timely filed the processing register in the

       particularly with regard to the geolocation system at issue

       electronic form by e-mail at the first request of the Inspectorate. The additional
       sheets were not further requested by the Inspectorate. Consequently, the

       Litigation Chamber that there is no violation of article 30, paragraph 3 and 4 AVG. However, there was one

       historical infringement with regard to article 30, paragraph 1, a) of which the Litigation Chamber determines

       that it was remedied by remedial measures.

    II.6. Article 38(1) and (3) GDPR and Article 39(1) GDPR

112. The GDPR recognizes that the data protection officer is a key figure for what

      concerns the protection of personal data, whose designation, position and tasks are regulated

      to be subjected. These rules help the controller to comply with

      its obligations under the GDPR, but also help the officer

      data protection to properly perform its tasks.

113. Article 38(1) GDPR requires the controller to take care of it

      that the data protection officer is involved in a timely and appropriate manner

      all matters related to the protection of personal data.

114. In addition, Article 38(3) in fine GDPR stipulates that the officer for

      data protection reports directly to the top management

      within the organization involved. In addition, the data protection officer
      to report annually on the activities carried out by him and this ter

      available to top management.

115. The Inspectorate finds that the defendant has fulfilled the obligations imposed by Article 38,
      has not complied with paragraphs 1 and 3 GDPR. According to the Inspectorate, the defendant does not show Substantive decision 15/2023/2023 - 32/35

      that its data protection officer has been properly and timely involved

      in the context of the complaint. In addition, the defendant does not demonstrate that his

      data protection officer reports effectively to the highest

      managerial level of the defendant.

116. The Respondent does not dispute that it is of crucial importance that the official for

      data protection is involved as early as possible in all matters related to

      data protection related. Efforts have been made to this end

      awareness of it, among other things, at the heads of department meeting of 3 December 2021. Brings further
      the data protection officer will formally advise the data protection officer if necessary

      Municipal Council/Social Welfare Council and/or the Municipal Executive

      and Aldermen, this concerns 5 formal recommendations in 2021. The defendant also prepares documents

      on demonstrating that the data protection officer is proactive,

      such as 44 informal opinions in 2021. Finally, the defendant indicates that the annual report ter

      notification is placed on the agenda of the Board of Mayor and Aldermen and the
      Fixed desk.

117. In view of the above, the Disputes Chamber finds that the officer for

      data protection is involved on a regular basis in matters with

      regarding the protection of personal data. Specifically regarding the context of
      the complaint, the Litigation Chamber notes that the official was involved in the run-up to

      the present complaint. The complaint was filed on March 31, 2021 after being filed on November 16

      2020 and on 23 February 2021, there was consultation between the defendant and the officer

      for data protection about the geolocation policy. From the whole of all the pieces that

      were submitted, are no concrete elements that allow the Disputes Chamber to

      conclude that the data protection officer would not be involved in a timely manner
      have been. However, the Litigation Chamber points out that documenting the timely

      involvement can be useful for the controller itself, but also for the

      Inspectorate in the event of a complaint, as well as during the (casuistic) assessment by the

      Litigation room.

118. The Inspectorate also found an infringement of Article 38(3) regarding the

      reporting to the highest management level. The defendant had during the

      investigation clarifies to the Inspectorate that the official for

      data protection chairperson of the Information Security Cell, which reports

      to the General Manager via the annual report. The Inspectorate refers in this regard

      to an earlier decision of the Litigation Chamber in which it was clarified that in a
      municipality the college of mayor and aldermen the highest daily

      managerial level. The Disputes Chamber notes that in the course of October to

      December 2020 an audit of the defendant carried out by Audit Vlaanderen has Substantive decision 15/2023/2023 - 33/35

      occurred. This included a recommendation that the defendant has

      its own organizational management framework, which includes reporting to the College

      The Mayor and Aldermen foresees that this is lacking in practice. The
      The Disputes Chamber notes that the defendant has set to work with this recommendation

      since in 2021 5 formal and 44 informal recommendations will be made directly to the Executive Board

      Mayor and Aldermen were addressed, in addition to the annual report that the officer for

      data protection issues annually.

119. Based on the above, the Disputes Chamber concludes that there is no infringement of

       Article 38 (1) and (3) and Article 39 (1) GDPR. This does not alter the fact that it is historical

       has been an infringement with regard to Article 38 (3) GDPR and that this has been done by remedial

       measures were remedied.

III. Sanctions

120. On the basis of the documents in the file, the Disputes Chamber establishes that there is

      following (historical) infringements:

    - Article 5 (1) a) and (2) and Article 6 (1) GDPR, and Article 24 (1) and Article 24 (1) and (2) of

        the GDPR with regard to the geolocation system;

    - Article 4, 11), Article 5(1)(a) and (2), Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7(1) and (3) for what
        concerns the use of cookies that are not strictly necessary;

    - Article 12(1) and (6), Article 13(1) and (2), Article 14(1) and (2), Article 5(2), Article 24(1)

        and Article 25 (1) GDPR with regard to the information obligations;

    - Article 30 (1) (a) GDPR with regard to the contact details of the officer in the

        register of processing activities; and

    - Article 38, paragraph 3 GDPR with regard to direct reporting to the highest

        managerial level.

121. Although the defendant has taken remedial measures to remedy these infringements, whether

      not already completely remedied, it is certain that there are infringements of the right to

      data protection have taken place. As already explained are the principles

      of legality and transparency fundamental principles of the GDPR. Also the

      data protection officer plays a vital role in data protection

      controller.TheDispute ChamberremindsthattheAVGreeds
      entered into force in 2016 and became applicable on 25 May 2018. In the meantime, almost

      5 years have passed since the GDPR became applicable, a period specified by the defendant

      has been insufficiently used to make its operation GDPR-compliant.

122. When determining the sanction, the Disputes Chamber takes into account the fact that the

      the defendant has already (partially) rectified these infringements and evidence of this Decision on the merits 15/2023/2023 - 34/35

      transfers. Needless to say, the Disputes Chamber points out that it is not authorized to

      impose an administrative fine on public authorities, in accordance with Article 221,

      § 2 of the Data Protection Act. 35In view of the above, the Disputes Chamber

      is of the opinion that a reprimand based on Article 100, § 1, 5 WOG is appropriate in this case

      is.

123. The Disputes Chamber proceeds to dismiss the other grievances and findings of the
      Inspectorate because, based on the facts and the documents in the file, they do not belong to the

      conclude that there has been a breach of the GDPR. These grievances and

      findings of the Inspectorate are therefore regarded as manifestly unfounded

      within the meaning of Art. 57(4) GDPR.

IV. Publication of the decision

  124. Given the importance of transparency with regard to decision-making by the

      Litigation Chamber, this decision will be published on the website of the

      Data Protection Authority. However, it is not necessary for the

      identification data of the parties are disclosed directly.

  FOR THESE REASONS,

  the Disputes Chamber of the Data Protection Authority decides, after deliberation, to:

  - on the basis of Article 100, §1, 5° WOG to formulate a reprimand with regard to the

     defendant for the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) and (2) and Article 6(1);

     Article 24(1) and Article 24(1) and (2); Article 4, 11), Article 5(1)(a) and (2), Article 6(1)(a)
     and Article 7(1) and (3); Article 12(1) and (6), Article 13(1) and (2), Article 14(1) and (2),

     Article 5 (2), Article 24 (1) and Article 25 (1) GDPR; Article 30 (1) GDPR and Article 38 (3)

     GDPR;

  - pursuant to article 100, §1, 1° WOG with regard to all other determinations in

     dismiss.

notification against this decision may be appealed to the Marktenhof (court of

Brussels appeal), with the Data Protection Authority as defendant.
