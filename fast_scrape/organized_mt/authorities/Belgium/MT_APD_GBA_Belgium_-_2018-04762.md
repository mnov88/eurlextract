## English Summary

### Facts

Complaint

On the 18 June 2018, the data subject lodged a complaint with the DPA against Radio Télévision Belge de la Communauté francaise (RTBF), the controller.

The data subject complained that the live services of the controller are only available in Belgium if an email, login via Facebook or Google account is provided. Further, if users deactivate cookies and tracking by third parties, the connection fails. The data subject set out that the service should be available without having to surrender personal data.

Initially, the controller argued that it is pursuing a legitimate interest under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") in collecting the data.

Investigation by the Investigative Service (IS) of the Belgian DPA (APD)

The investigation found that the controller collected the following data: first and surname, password, email address, phone number, date of birth and gender identity.

To the investigation by the SI, the controller argued that the principle of impartiality under [Article 41 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights](https://fra.europa.eu/en/eu-charter/article/41-right-good-administration) had not been respected. The controller alleged that the language used in the report issued by the investigative service of the DPA strongly favoured the position of the data subject.

Furthermore, the controller stated that it did not have enough time to answer the questions posed by the DPA and that the DPA had denied to meet the controller in person. It argued that due to this time pressure, it had made a mistake regarding the legal basis of the processing. Therefore, the true legal basis for the processing was in fact [Article 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1b "Article 6 GDPR"). The controller described that the TV service is a personalized service and that users are informed of this in the privacy policy. Therefore, creating an account for the service equates to a contractual relationship according to the controller and the data collected is necessary for the contract.

### Holding

Alleged partiality of the SI

In regard to the allegations of partiality on the part of the IS, the Litigation Chamber of the DPA found that based on Article 66 §1 of the Belgian law on the powers of the DPA (_[La loi du 3 décembre 2017 portant création de l'Autorité de protection des données - LCA](https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/publications/reglement-d-ordre-interieur-de-l-autorite-de-protection-des-donnees.pdf)_), the IS of the DPA did not have the power to meet with the controller and therefore rejected the controller's argument.

Account creation

The IS had found that the users were not adequately informed that the Facebook login option in fact created an account with the controller. However the LC found that the controller had made it sufficiently clear that a login with Facebook would create a user account with the controller and therefore found no violation.

Legal basis for the processing

The Litigation Chamber (LC) held that the controller cannot switch between legal basis and that the legal basis for processing must be set prior to the processing. The LC further pointed out that the tight deadline could not have been a valid reason for mixing up the legal basis as the legal basis should have been determined before the processing began.

However, the LC chose not to sanction the failure to identify the correct legal basis and assessed whether [Article 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1b "Article 6 GDPR") could provide a valid legal basis for the processing. The LC found that a contractual relationship existed and that the contract was valid under Belgian law. With regard to the necessity requirement, the LC pointed out that the service cannot be deliverable unless the data is processed, otherwise, the necessity requirement is not met. In addition, the LC highlighted that the data subject’s understanding of the necessity of the data processing must also be taken into account by the controller.

The LC found that the following details were in fact necessary for the contract in order to securely identify individuals: Name, password and email address. In regard to the phone number, date of birth, gender identity and profile picture, the LC held that the contract provided by the controller stipulated that it offered a personalised service and that a certain amount of personal data is therefore necessary to fulfill the purpose of the contract. The LC highlighted that the controller must make it clear to data subjects that entering this information is optional. It found that entering further details such as the date of birth, was in fact optional and not a requirement for the account creation.

The LC therefore found no violation of [Article 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") in regard to the collected data. Further, the LC concluded that although the controller had violated [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), [5(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") for failing to determine the legal basis before processing data, it chose to dismiss these violations based on the specific circumstances of the case. It therefore merely issued a reprimand to the controller for the failure to identify a legal basis prior to processing.

Took the following decision concerning:

The complainant: X, hereinafter "the complainant";

The defendant: The Belgian Radio and Television of the French Community (RTBF), an autonomous public company of a cultural nature,

Having as counsel Maître Peter Craddock, lawyer, whose firm is established

Avenue Louise, 54 in 1050 Brussels.

Hereinafter “RTBF” or “the defendant”.

I. Facts and procedure

1. On 18 June 2018, the complainant filed a complaint with the Data Protection Authority (DPA)

against the defendant.

2. Under the terms of his complaint, the complainant denounces the fact that the defendant’s live service (web streaming – Auvio) is accessible on Belgian territory only if

visitors provide their personal data (email address/login, Facebook or Google

accounts). He also points out that the process of connecting to the live service does not work if the user deactivates the cookies and trackers of third-party companies used by the defendant's website.

3. On 15 October 2018, the complaint was declared admissible on the basis of Articles 58 and 60 of the

LCA and forwarded to the Litigation Chamber under Article 62, § 1 of the LCA. The

complainant was informed of this on the same date.

4. On 23 October 2018, the Litigation Chamber decided to request an investigation from the

Inspection Service (SI) under Articles 63, 2° and 94, 1° of the LCA.

er
5. On 29 October 2018, in accordance with Article 96, § 1 of the LCA, the request of the Litigation Chamber to conduct an investigation is transmitted to the SI. The complainant is informed of this on

the same date.

6. On 28 January 2020, the SI investigation is closed, the report is attached to the file and the latter is transmitted by the Inspector General to the President of the Litigation Chamber (Art. 91, §
er
1 and § 2 of the LCA). The investigation report is based on two technical analysis reports dated 1 July 2019 and 9 January 2020 respectively.

7. According to its report, the SI makes the following findings: Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 3/27

- As regards the legal basis underlying the processing of registration data on the one hand and data relating to personalisation (profiling) on the other hand (finding 1):

The SI is of the opinion that the defendant cannot rely on its legitimate interest which it invokes in support of the processing of registration data (Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR).

With regard to the consent invoked above concerning the lawfulness of data processing

related to personalization, the IS recalls that the data controller

must have identified a basis for lawfulness prior to the processing of data (in

this case, collection) and cannot switch from one basis to another.

- As for the legitimacy of the processing of personal data for the purposes of

advertising profiling and the possibility of opposition (findings 2, 3 and 4): the IS notes

that while the defendant's management contract allows it to use content

recommendation algorithms, the definition of this term does not include advertising. The IS

concludes that the legitimacy of the advertising profiling purpose of the processing on the

part of the defendant (and therefore compliance with Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR) may be called

into doubt. Since at the time of registration, the user cannot refuse advertising profiling and the platform does not seem to allow easy opposition to it after registration, the IS concludes that the provisions of Articles 12.2., 21 and 25 of the GDPR do not seem to be met. Finally, the IS notes that the updating of the purposes in the registration form by including the purpose of advertising profiling has not, as of January 9, 2020, been carried out even though the defendant had undertaken to do so. The IS concludes that this appears incompatible with the requirements of Articles 12.1. 13 and 14 of the GDPR. - As for the use of social media data for login/registration purposes

(findings 5 and 6): the IS concludes that the difference between the login

and registration mechanism for the platform via social media (Facebook, Google) lacks

clarity and explanation, in contradiction with Articles 12.1, 13 and 14 of the GDPR. The IS adds

that the mechanism used under the cover of logging in via a Facebook account is in fact

the creation of an RTBF account with the provision of the user's Facebook data,

without the latter being informed. The IS concludes that this process is in contradiction

with Articles 5.1.a), 5.1.b) and 5.1.c) as well as with Articles 12.1, 13 and 14 of the GDPR.

2The SI refers in this regard to the Guidelines on consent under the GDPR adopted by the Article 29 Working Party on 28 November 2017 as revised and adopted on 10 April 2018. For information, the Litigation Chamber adds that this prohibition on switching from one basis of lawfulness to another has been confirmed by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) in its Guidelines 5/2020 on consent within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. See. point 123: https://www.edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb guidelines 202005 consent fr.pdf
3
The Litigation Chamber indicates that Article 27/1 of the Digital Service Act (DSA) (Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on a single market for digital services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (Digital Services Regulation).) provides as follows in this regard: "Online platform providers that use recommendation systems shall set out in their general terms and conditions, in simple and understandable language, the main parameters used in their recommendation systems, as well as the options available to recipients of the service to modify or influence these main parameters". This is for information purposes, as these findings are not part of the referral to the Litigation Chamber ( cf. infra). Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 4/27

8. On 17 March 2020, the Contentious Chamber decided, pursuant to Article 95, § 1, 1° and

Article 98 of the LCA, that the case could be dealt with on the merits.

9. On the same date, the parties concerned were informed by registered mail of

the provisions as set out in Article 95, § 2 and Article 98 of the LCA. They were

also informed, pursuant to Article 99 of the LCA, of the deadlines for submitting their

submissions, namely 14 April (submissions in response) and 14 May 2020 (submissions in

reply) for the defendant and 29 April 2020 (submissions in reply) for the

complainant.

10. On 19 March 2020, the defendant requested a copy of the file (art. 95, §2, 3° LCA),

which was sent to it on 25 March 2020. It also expressed the wish to be

heard by the Litigation Division in accordance with Article 51 of the

Rules of Procedure of the APD.

11. On 14 April 2020, the Litigation Division received the

defendant's submissions in response. On 14 May 2020, it received the latter's summary submissions.

Its argument can be summarised as follows, the details of its defence being

discussed in the reasons for this decision (see below).

- The first part of the defendant's submissions tends to demonstrate that the

findings of the SI investigation must be dismissed since the preparation of

its report and the technical analysis reports on which it is based were not

done in compliance with the principles of good administration.

- As for the substance, the defendant denies that there is any breach of the

GDPR on its part.

12. On 28 April 2020, the Litigation Chamber received the complainant's submissions in response.

In general, the complainant denounces the defendant's attitude and insists

in particular on the practice of cookies, the lack of transparency and the question of the

relevance of the collection of personal data as a mandatory step to access

online content.

13. On 22 November 2022, the Litigation Chamber adopted Decision 170/2022, pursuant to which

it dismissed the complaint pursuant to Article 100.1.1° of the LCA, which

concerns the grievances covered by the Litigation Chamber's settlement decision 168/2022.

14. This settlement decision 168/2022 was addressed to the defendant of the present

decision, namely RTBF. It was the result of an own-initiative investigation carried out by the IS into

a series of grievances common to the complaint in question here.

15. The subject of this transaction concerned "potential infringements of the GDPR, with regard

to cookies and, more generally, the storage and consent to the placement and subsequent processing of information on the user's device as

a data subject". The transaction thus covers the "cookies" complaint in its entirety raised by the complainant under the terms of his complaint (second part) as well as

findings 1 (only for advertising profiling), 2, 3 and 4 of the IS investigation report.

16. Within the limits of this decision 168/2022, the Litigation Chamber had thus exhausted its

jurisdiction with regard to the facts reported by the complainant and the corresponding "cookies"

complaints. Pursuant to its aforementioned decision 170/2022, the Litigation Chamber has

therefore dismissed the complainant's complaint in light of these grievances on technical grounds,

within the same material and temporal limits.

17. For the period from 20 November 2020 (time limit of the transaction - which is

moreover after the closing date of the SI investigation on 28 January 2020 in

this case) to date, the Litigation Chamber does not have any findings
supporting the said grievances invoked by the complainant, it has therefore been unable to

find any failure on the part of the defendant and dismissed the complaint

on this point on technical grounds also in support of criterion A.1. of the

dismissal policy note.

18. In the same decision 170/2022, the Litigation Chamber specifies that, with regard to the data processing in the context of connection and

registration to the Auvio platform (findings 1 (regarding registration) and

findings 5 and 6 of the inspection report), it will continue the procedure with

an examination of the merits (point 28 of the decision):

“With regard to the complaints relating to data processing in the context of

connection and registration to the Auvio platform (first part of the

complainant’s complaint and findings 1 (regarding registration), 5 and 6 of the

inspection report), the Litigation Chamber decides to continue its examination,

as these complaints are not covered by its settlement decision 168/2022. The defendant

having requested to be heard in this case, the Litigation Chamber will

schedule a hearing in the presence of the parties in due course."

19. On 30 November 2022, the parties were informed that the hearing would take place on 27 January
2023. In accordance with its letter of invitation to the hearing, the Litigation Chamber stated

that, taking into account its decision 170/2002 issued with regard to part of the grievances

raised in the complaint (see above), the hearing would focus only on the grievances not

covered by this decision 170/2022, as mentioned by the Litigation Chamber in

point 28 thereof.

20. The Litigation Chamber also requests the defendant, taking into account the period of

time that has elapsed since the facts and since the findings of the IS, as well as taking into account the

changes made by the defendant to its website during the proceedings,

to kindly update the information provided to the Litigation Chamber: (a) regarding

the process of logging in/creating an account-registration to the Auvio system, in

particular via social networks on the one hand, and (b) regarding the information

given to users to date regarding this on the other hand. The defendant is requested to communicate this

factual information to the Litigation Chamber and to the complainant by 4 January 2023 at the

latest. The Litigation Chamber adds that if it so wishes, the complainant may respond to

these updates until 13 January 2023. The defendant will ultimately have, if applicable, a final right of reply until 24 January 2023.

21. On 4 January 2023, the defendant informed the Litigation Chamber that to the extent that

the registration functionality by logging into a Facebook or Google account had not

changed, but the interface had evolved (both on the RTBF side and on the Facebook/Meta side on the one hand and Google on the other), it sent it a document containing

updates mainly in the form of new screenshots. She specifies

that this document must be read in combination with her summary conclusions of 14 May

2020.

22. On 27 January 2023, the defendant alone was heard by the Litigation Division, the
complainant having indicated to the Litigation Division that he would not participate in the hearing.

23. On 31 January 2023, the minutes of the hearing were communicated to the parties.

24. On 14 February 2023, the Litigation Division received from the defendant some

comments relating to these minutes, which it took into account in its deliberation.

II. Reasons

II.1. As to the lawfulness of the processing of data collected during the registration phase

II.1.1. The SI’s point of view

25. As mentioned above, the SI is of the opinion that the defendant cannot rely

on the legitimate interest that it claims to have and that it invoked during the investigation in its

letter of 11 July 2019 in response to the SI’s questions regarding the lawfulness of the

processing of registration data, in particular that the SI identifies as a surname, a first name,

a password and a valid email address. The SI does not exclude the possibility that the defendant may

be qualified as a public authority within the meaning of Article 5 of the LTD, it questions the
4
applicability of Article 6.1. f) of the GDPR and points out in any event that the defendant has not

demonstrated to the SI that it has carried out the balancing of interests required by Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR.

4See recital 47 of the GDPR. Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 7/27

26. The SI considers that the defendant is not more justified in relying on its legitimate

interest and/or on the consent of users with regard to the processing of

data collected in the registration phase for the purposes of personalization. The basis of

lawfulness must be identified prior to processing and the data controller

cannot switch from one to the other.

II.1.2. The parties’ point of view

The complainant

27. The complainant challenges the impossibility of watching a programme live on Auvio

(in this case a Red Devils football match) without having to communicate certain personal

data to the defendant (the creation of an account with

communication of certain data being obligatory). He states that he cannot agree

with the way in which the defendant has designed the Auvio service - the added value of which

would be that of a personalised service: see below - considering that “he should be able to go online to the

defendant’s website and follow the programme of his choice live without

communicating data” (page 2 of the complainant’s conclusions). Consequently, the complainant is of the opinion that

"RTBF has done nothing to limit the processing of personal data only to

essential cases, necessary for the provision of services and with the free and clear consent

of the person concerned" (page 1 of the complainant's conclusions of April 28, 2020).

28. The complainant also alleges that by requesting to be able to enter into dialogue with the

APD services during the investigation, the defendant made “repeated attempts to

distort the investigation of the Chamber (read the SI)”, in particular by

“requesting privileged access to the members of the Chamber” (read the

members of the SI) (page 5
2 of the complainant’s submissions).

The defendant

29. In its “Submissions” and “Summary Submissions”, the defendant

argues primarily that the SI reports are inadmissible and must be dismissed

for violation of the general principle of good administration to which the APD (and its organs) is

bound in its capacity as an administrative authority. In particular, the defendant is of the opinion that the

principle of impartiality (Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union ) has not

5It should be noted at the outset that, contrary to what the complainant states, the defendant requested contact
with the services of the Inspection (SI) and not with the Litigation Chamber.
6
Article 41: right to good administration 1. Everyone has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially,
fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union. 2. This right includes
in particular: (a) the right of every person to be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely is taken;
(b) the right of every person to have access to the file concerning him or her, while respecting the legitimate interests of
confidentiality and professional and business secrecy; (c) the obligation for the administration to provide reasons for its
decisions. 3. Everyone has the right to have the Union make good any damage caused by the institutions or by its
servants in the exercise of their duties, in accordance with the general principles common to the laws of the
Member States. 4. Any Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 8/27

respected, given that the investigation was conducted much more "for the prosecution" than "for the

defence", particularly in view of the turns of phrase in the reports, the

vocabulary chosen and the punctuation used in them (inappropriate exclamation

marks in particular). As a result, according to the defendant, these reports support an

appearance of bias on the part of the Litigation Chamber.

30. The defendant adds that the duty of thoroughness and the principle of internal reasoning (Article

41.2, 3rd indent of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union) are also flouted, the

final report containing errors of law, particularly with regard to

the interpretation of Regulation (EU) 2017/1128 “Portability” of 14 June 2017 on the

cross-border portability of online content services in the internal market. 7

31. The defendant adds that since the S.I. has not complied with the LCA, in particular Article

66 § 1 thereof, the entire investigation procedure is tainted. In particular, the

defendant criticises the SI for refusing to respond to its request for a meeting of

17 June 2019, a request it made to explain itself with a view to active

cooperation within the framework of the SI’s hearing powers.

32. In the alternative, the defendant argues that the SI’s substantive allegations are

unfounded.

33. As for the legal basis for the processing of registration data (finding 1 of the

SI), the defendant states that this question cannot be examined without taking into account the

context in which it was put to it by the SI and the time limit within which it was

required to respond. The defendant thus emphasises that it had (too) little time to

answer the dozen or so questions put to it, in the middle of the summer holidays,

under the threat of a finding of lack of cooperation in violation of Article 31 of the GDPR and

by being refused a meeting with the IS (Article 66 of the LCA – see above). The time taken by the

IS to respond, after the defendant’s reminder of 21 June 2019, to this request

person may contact the institutions of the Union in one of the languages of the Treaties and must receive a response in the
same language.
7
The defendant thus considers more particularly that the IS was wrong to reject the “Portability:” regulation. Indeed, the
citizen, when he or she resides in the European Union, continues to have access to certain audiovisual content. Therefore, compliance
with this portability regulation requires verification of the user's residence in the European Union (see below).
8To investigate the case, the Inspector General and the inspectors may, in accordance with the procedures determined by this Act:

1° identify persons;
2° interview persons;

3° conduct a written investigation;

4° carry out on-site examinations;

5° consult computer systems and copy the data they contain;

6° access information electronically;

7° seize or seal property or computer systems;

8° request the identification of the subscriber or regular user of an electronic communications service or the electronic communications means used. Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 9/27

meeting was also included in the already short period granted to it

to submit its responses, the IS having refused any extension of the deadline. The

defendant emphasizes that it is in this context that an unfortunate error regarding

the legal basis crept into its response letter of 11 July 2019.

34. However, this error is of no consequence according to the defendant since it is acting

in compliance with the GDPR.

35. The defendant thus develops that notwithstanding the mention of Article 6.1. f) of the GDPR, its

letter of 11 July 2019 nevertheless contains all the factual indications attesting

that the true legal basis for the processing of registration data is the

contract entered into with the user (Article 6.1. b) of the GDPR). She emphasizes that in this regard, the

Litigation Chamber cannot stop at the formulation of the legitimate interest (article 6.1. f)
of the GDPR) taken up in the said letter of July 11, 2019 since it is up to it to verify

the facts in light of the law, independently of this manifest error by the defendant.

36. The defendant explains that according to its General Terms of Use (GTU), the user

may "access our \[read its\] services either freely or by registering

in advance, in particular via a form mentioning the data necessary to be

completed to enable optimal use" (Article B.1. GTU)

37. The defendant describes that the Auvio service is not a simple content service: it is

a personalized service as evidenced by the information provided on this subject in the

registration window on the site as well as in the first elements of its Data

Usage Charter, under the terms of which the following is specified: "We offer you

new content to be as close as possible to your tastes" and "Your experience is enriched;

a use of your information solely to serve your interests" or that the

defendant "seeks first and foremost to provide you with added value, both in terms of

the content and the form in which it is delivered. This added value may, for example,

take the form of personalized recommendations or services aimed at improving

the accessibility of our content."

38. The defendant specifies that when creating its account (whether or not

through a social network connector such as Facebook or Google), it is made clear to the

subscriber that he must accept the defendant's T&Cs before being able to benefit

from the service. Registration thus creates a contractual relationship between the user and the

defendant.

39. In response to the complainant who considers that he should be able to freely follow the defendant’s programmes live on Auvio without any communication of personal data concerning him (i.e. without subscription) as well as to the question of the SI on this same Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 10/27

subject, the defendant, both on 15 April 2019 in response to the SI and by way of submissions,

replied “that it is currently not permitted to access the live broadcasting service

on the Auvio site without providing registration data in order to ensure sound, centralised and

secure management of the services offered by RTBF on its various internet and mobile

platforms, in accordance with Article 43 of the RTBF management contract

which imposes on it a universal service obligation only in terrestrial broadcasting on

radio and TV or through cable distribution on TV”.

40. As for the data processed during the registration phase, the defendant states that what is

“necessary for the performance of the contract” within the meaning of Article 6.1.b) of the GDPR does not

only include data whose provision is mandatory. The delivery of the service

may differ depending on whether all the data that the subscriber is asked to

provide are actually provided or not. In other words, the Auvio contract has

several functionalities whose delivery depends on whether or not the optional personal

data is provided. The fact remains that these data are, according to the defendant, all

necessary for the performance of the contract within the meaning of Article 6.1.b) of the GDPR.

- Thus, the first and last name are processed for the purpose of providing personalized

recommendations but also for security purposes, more particularly to combat

fraud.

- The email address is processed for authentication purposes to close the

registration procedure. Either the email address entered is already known to the

defendant, which attests to an existing account; or the address is not known to the

defendant, which sends to the said email address provided by the

candidate subscriber an email containing

a hyperlink to be activated to finalize the registration.

- The date of birth (introduced during the proceedings) is processed following

a decision of 8 March 20128 by the Higher Audiovisual Council (CSA) which complained

that the defendant did not comply with the obligation to set up a system

protecting minors against television programmes likely to harm their

physical, mental and moral development, in application of the decree of the

Government of the French Community of 21 February 2013 relating to the

protection of minors against television programmes likely to harm their

physical, mental or moral development, more particularly Article 4 § 1. In order to comply

with this obligation, the defendant states that it has set up several

To the extent necessary, the Litigation Chamber specifies that this statement results from the content of its conclusions as

well as those of its update factual day and what was explained in the hearing.
10Article 4.1: "In a non-linear television service, a category 3, 4 or 5 program can only be accessed by the user after entering a parental access code" Ministry of the French Community, Order of the Government of the French Community of 21 February 2013 relating to the protection of minors against television programs likely to harm their physical, mental or moral development, Official Journal, 11 March 2013. Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 11/27

measures recommended by the CSA such as the introduction of parental control by default, the possibility of creating an access code for content from "-12 years old" and

the prohibition for children under 13 to create an Auvio profile.

- As for the GSM number, the defendant states that Regulation (EU) 2017/1128 of the

European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the cross-border

portability of online content services in the internal market, applicable

since 20 March 2018, requires the provider of this service (i.e. the defendant) to

verify the subscriber’s Member State of residence (which must be a

Member State of the European Union (EU)) using one of the verification

means listed therein. A simple email address ending in “.be” is not part of the

list of verification means listed by this regulation. The GSM number, however, is part of it.

The defendant, by requesting their mobile number from Auvio users who

wish to benefit from cross-border portability when they go on holiday in

one of the EU countries, therefore complies with the GDPR since this is

information necessary for the use of AUVIO abroad.

- The processing of the address meets the same need but also that of

personalisation.

- Gender data is also processed for the purposes of personalising the

Auvio service.

41. Finally, the defendant points out that consent (Article 6.1. a) of the

GDPR) – which the complainant alleges should have been collected – is not the only basis for lawfulness that

can be mobilised and that, therefore, consent is not always required before any

processing can take place.

II.1.3. Assessment of the Litigation Chamber

As to the admissibility of the IS reports

42. With regard to the complaints of bias and lack of thoroughness raised by the

defendant against the inspection reports, the Litigation Chamber considers that, even if

they were well-founded, they do not have any repercussions on its impartiality with regard

to the complaint based on the lawfulness of data processing during the

registration phase.

1As already mentioned, the RTBF will indicate in a letter dated 11 July 2019 addressed to the SI, that the collection of the date of
birth is being implemented in order to comply with the CSA decision to limit minors' access to certain
content Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 12/27

43. When it chooses to refer the matter to the SI as in this case, the Litigation Chamber retains,

as the Market Court recognises, a sovereign power of assessment of the

complaint. Both the findings of the SI and the arguments developed by way of conclusions and the

documents filed by the parties inform the decision-making of the Litigation Chamber.

As an autonomous body, it nevertheless retains a power of assessment and the freedom

to issue, not without relevant and reinforced motivation in accordance with the requirements of

the Market Court, its own legal considerations on the situation brought before it,

including with regard to the inspection report and the grievances raised, where

appropriate, against it by the parties.

44. In this case, the Litigation Chamber notes that the SI report had, with regard to the grievance

discussed in this section, concluded that the recourse to Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR

invoked by the defendant itself was inadmissible. The Litigation Chamber remains free, after

examination, to subscribe or not to this analysis. This own assessment is a fortiori

essential in this case since the defendant indicated in terms of conclusions

that it had wrongly - and this following the circumstances in which it was

led to have to respond to the IS - invoked Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR in place of

Article 6.1. b) of the GDPR and that the Litigation Chamber will take this into account in this

decision as will be detailed in the section below.

45. As for the refusal to follow up on the request for a meeting with the IS made by the

defendant, the Litigation Chamber notes that by letter of 24 June 2019, the IS

replied that "holding a meeting with the data controller did not fall within

its investigative powers as mentioned in Article 66 §1 of the LCA". It added

that it had chosen to conduct a written investigation in this case. The Litigation Chamber cannot

substitute its assessment for that of the SIquantàce. It notes that the defendant

in any event had the opportunity to inform the latter of its position. As for

the plaintiff’s interpretation that the defendant, by its request, attempted to

distort the investigation, the Litigation Chamber is of the opinion that this interpretation belongs

exclusively to it and that it has no evidence to corroborate it.

As for the obligation to identify a basis of lawfulness

46. Pursuant to Articles 5.1. a) and 6.1. of the GDPR, any data processing must be based

on one of the bases of lawfulness listed in Article 6.1. a) to f) of the GDPR. The Litigation Chamber

14tps://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/publications/arret-du-20-decembre-2023-de-la-cour-des-marches-ar-801.pdf
The Cour des marchés, the appeal body for decisions of the Litigation Chamber, has in this regard explicitly validated the
possibility for the decision-making body of an administrative authority to deviate from the conclusions of the body of the same
authority in charge of the investigation/inspection. See in this sense: Cour des marchés (19th ch. A), 28 February 2018, 2017/AR/1139
& 2017/MR/1, §25. Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 13/27

recalls that, pursuant to Article 6.1 of the GDPR, the processing of personal data is in fact lawful only if, and to the extent that, it is based on one of the

bases of lawfulness listed therein.

47. This basis of lawfulness must be identified prior to processing. There is no doubt

that this prior identification results from Article 6.1. of the GDPR even if it is not

15
explicitly formulated therein. It results from the combined reading of said Article 6.1 of the GDPR and

Article 13.1.c) of the GDPR, in particular under the terms of which the data controller is

required to provide the data subject, at the time he obtains the data concerning him from

him, all the information listed in Article 13.1 and 13.2 of the GDPR, including "the purposes of the

processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal

basis for the processing" (Article 13.1. c) of the GDPR). The implementation of this obligation

necessarily presupposes that the data controller has identified this legal

basis beforehand. This identification of the basis of legality prior to

the operationalization of the processing contributes to the respect of the principles of loyalty and

transparency (article 5.1. a), 13.1 c) and 14.1 c) of the GDPR) as well as that due to the principle

of accountability and the obligations which result from it (article 5.2 and 24 of the GDPR).

48. The Litigation Chamber also recalls that it is the responsibility of the data controller

to identify a single basis of lawfulness on which it bases its processing. This requirement

also contributes to the principles of loyalty and transparency that it is the controller’s

responsibility to implement (Article 5.1.a) of the GDPR). Since different consequences arise from one or the other

basis of lawfulness, particularly in terms of the rights of the persons concerned, it is not
17
accepted that the data controller invokes one or the other according to the circumstances.

Generally speaking, by invoking distinct bases of lawfulness, the data controller

creates a certain vagueness in terms of the exercise of the rights of the persons concerned.

49. The Litigation Chamber notes that in this case, the defendant (even if

erroneously as it claims) initially declared that it based the processing of

15
See European Data Protection Board (EDPB), Guidelines 5/2020 on consent within the meaning
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. See point 121:
https://www.edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb guidelines 202005 consent fr.pdf
16The Litigation Chamber emphasizes that while Article 30 of the GDPR relating to the Register of processing activities does not require in

its §1 that the lawfulness of the processing be included among the elements to be included in the Register, the purpose of the processing must
be mentioned, which should lead the data controller to define the corresponding lawfulness basis.
In this sense, without calling into question its non-mandatory nature, the Commission for the Protection of Privacy had
recommended at the time to include this basis of lawfulness as part of the additional information in the Register. See
Recommendation No. 06/2017 of 14 June 2017 relating to the Register of Processing Activities (Article 30 of the GDPR) (page 17/35 of the French version). https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/publications/recommandation-n-06-2017.pdf
17
As an illustration, the data controller cannot consider that he bases the processing on the consent
of the data subject (Article 6.1.a) of the GDPR) and on his legal obligation (Article 6.1.c) of the GDPR). Consent can indeed be withdrawn at any time and if it does not have the effect of compromising the validity of the processing carried out before this withdrawal
(article 7.3. of the GDPR), it does not however allow, a priori, the data controller to continue the processing in the future
(article 17.1.b) of the GDPR), at least not for the same purpose. By declaring that the processing is based on its legal obligation
to take another hypothesis (article 6.1.c) of the GDPR), the data controller excludes in principle any possibility
of opposition to the processing, the withdrawal of consent cannot be invoked nor the right of opposition which is reserved for the

hypotheses of article 21.1. of the GDPR or to the processing of personal data based on article 6.1. e) or 6.1.
f) and not on article 6.1.c) of the GDPR. Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 14/27

registration data on Article 6.1. f) of the GDPR (with the IS as part of the investigation

as already mentioned) to then declare that it relies on Article 6.1. b) of the GDPR in its

conclusions. If the defendant may have considered its response time to the IS too short, it is not up

to the Litigation Chamber to comment on the length of the latter. Without prejudging the
loyalty of data controllers faced with investigation duties, it appears in

any event to the Litigation Chamber that since this is an obligation that must

be satisfied before the processing is operationalised (i.e. from the design of the latter),

the information regarding the basis of legality used should a priori be

immediately available, the identification of which should have been made before any

implementation of the Auvio service.

50. However, the Litigation Chamber notes that, on the one hand, it is in a detailed manner and with regard

to the various data processed that the defendant stated the basis of the legitimate

interest in its responses to the IS while, on the other hand, highlighting, in this same letter to

the IS, elements of its documents which, according to it, clearly reflect that the

processing falls within the framework of the "performance of the Auvio contract". If, as the

defendant maintains, these textual elements were to reveal that a contract had indeed been

entered into with the user at the time of the facts, it is all the more incomprehensible that the

defendant relied on them in a letter in which it invokes its

legitimate interest, even though it had identified the adequate basis of

lawfulness beforehand.

51. In view of all the circumstances of the case, the arguments of the

parties and its duty of care, the Litigation Chamber will examine below the relevance

of the use of Article 6.1. b) of the GDPR, not without concluding that there was a breach of Articles 5.1. a)

and 6.1 of the GDPR on the part of the defendant due to the fact that the defendant

communicated Article 6.1. f) of the GDPR as a basis of lawfulness by the

defendant to the IS. This communication,
even by mistake - which error does not eliminate said breach -, reflects, according to the

Litigation Chamber, a failure to identify in advance the basis of lawfulness that it

will nevertheless choose not to sanction (see below).

As for the use of the basis of lawfulness of Article 6.1.b) of the GDPR

52. The Litigation Chamber recalls that the use of the basis of lawfulness of Article 6.1. b) of the

GDPR is subject to 3 conditions:

- (1) a contractual or pre-contractual relationship exists between the data

controller and the data subject;

- (2) the contract must be valid under the applicable law;

- (3) the processing of personal data meets the condition of

necessity, in other words, the data processed are actually necessary for

the performance of the contract. Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 15/27

53. The manner in which Article 6.1. b) of the GDPR must be applied has been the subject of several clarifications in recent years

through Guidelines of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), binding decisions of the EDPB on the basis

of Article 65 of the GDPR and ultimately by a judgment of the Court of Justice of the

European Union (CJEU) of 4 July 2023. This case law is summarised below and

applied to the present case.

54. With regard to conditions (1) and (2), the data controller must, in accordance

with its obligation of accountability under Article 5.2. of the GDPR, be able to

demonstrate a) that a contract exists – that is, that the data subject and the data

controller are engaged in a contractual relationship – and b) that the contract is valid

under the applicable national contract law.

55. In this case, the Litigation Chamber is of the opinion that a contract is

effectively concluded between the user on the one hand, here the complainant, and the

defendant on the other hand by means of the subscription to the Auvio

service (adherence to the conditions of the General Terms and Conditions and

provision of personal data). Nothing calls into question the validity of this contract under the

Belgian law applicable to it. As to the question of whether the passage through a contract was

essential, the Litigation Chamber takes note of the defendant’s management

contract and the absence of an obligation for the latter to provide free access to its media

content via the Internet. In this case, the Litigation Chamber has no element of a nature, in the exercise of its powers, to challenge the applicability of this management contract, its content or the consequences drawn from it in casu. 56. As regards the condition of necessity for the processing of the personal data concerned (3), the Litigation Chamber recalls that in its Huber judgment, the Court of

Justice of the European Union (CJEU), specified the following in regard to this condition of necessity:

"having regard to the objective of ensuring an equivalent level of protection in

all Member States, the concept of necessity as it results from Article 7,

subse) , of Directive 95/46, which aims to precisely delimit one of the cases

in which the processing of personal data is lawful, cannot

have a variable content depending on the Member States. Therefore, it is an

autonomous concept of Community law which must be interpreted in a manner that

fully meets the purpose of this directive as defined in Article 1,

paragraph 1 thereof" 22 (emphasis added by the Litigation Chamber).

57. This case law formulated in light of Article 7.e) of Directive 95/46/EC applies to

all bases of lawfulness that retain this condition of necessity. It remains

relevant today even though Directive 95/46/EC has been repealed

since this condition of necessity is maintained under Article 6.1 b) to f) of the GDPR.

58. The Article 29 Working Party also referred to the case law of the

European Court of Human Rights (Eur. Court HR) to identify the requirement of

necessity. 23 It concluded that

the adjective “necessary” does not have the flexibility of terms such as

“admissible”, “normal”, “useful”, “reasonable” or “opportune”. 24

59. With regard in particular to Article 6.1.b) of the GDPR, the necessity of data processing is thus assessed first of all in the light of the main objective of the contract: the

data controller must ensure that the provision of the product or service cannot

take place without the implementation of the processing of the data in question. If, on the

contrary, the objective of the contract can be achieved without the processing of

specific data being implemented, the condition of necessity is not met.

60. The necessity of the processing is further assessed in light of the expectations of

each party regarding the purpose of the contract: the controller must not

rely exclusively on its point of view to assess its necessity in view of this

purpose, it must also take into account the perspective of the data subject, his

understanding of the main purpose of the contract or the way in which the service has been

promoted. The purpose must be mutually understood as requiring the processing of

data concerned.

61. The condition of necessity should therefore be interpreted restrictively when analysing the legal basis of the contract: it does not cover situations in which the processing is not genuinely necessary for the performance of the contract but rather imposed

21
The Member States provide that the processing of personal data may only be carried out if: (…) e) it is
necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or the third party to whom the data are communicated.

unilaterally to the data subject by the controller. In other words, the processing concerned must not pursue another objective, for example allowing the pursuit of distinct or exclusive interests of the controller.

62. In summary, the processing in question must be “objectively indispensable” to the performance

of the contract (i.e. to achieve a purpose that is an integral part of the

contractual service intended for users) such that the main purpose of this contract could not

be achieved without this processing. Necessity is not determined by

the sole formalisation of the contract and its content. If there are

realistic and less intrusive alternatives, the processing is not necessary. The

controller should be able to justify the necessity of its data processing in relation to the

fundamental and mutually understood contractual purpose. In this regard, it should

finally be possible for an ordinary user to know the “fundamental and

mutually understood” purpose on the basis of the information presented by the

controller. 63. The Litigation Chamber decides that since the Auvio service is designed as a contract

for the provision of personalised content, the objective of this contract cannot be achieved without the

processing of a certain amount of personal data (see below). It

considers - in addition to the fact that it can reasonably be thought that the perception of a

personalised offer necessarily involves, at the present time, a certain amount of

personal data - that in the context of the present case, the information provided by

the defendant when subscribing to the contract (via the creation of the

account) is also sufficiently explicit. In other words, the objective of the Auvio contract must, according to the

Litigation Chamber, be considered as mutually understood.

64. Only data “necessary” for the execution of said contract, regardless of the method

chosen to subscribe to it (by directly providing personal data on the

“Auvio” page of the defendant’s website or via the

connection to the Facebook or Google social network of the

subscriber, depending on the latter’s choice) may nevertheless be

processed.

65. As for the data noted by the IS in its investigation report as being the

mandatory registration data at the time of the investigation (surname, first name,

password and email address), the Litigation Chamber considers that they are indeed

“necessary for the execution of the “Auvio” contract. This data makes it possible to

securely identify the user and create their account.

25
(paragraphs 88-94 of decision 02/2022).

26As stated in the investigation report, this purpose must nevertheless be repeated by the defendant in its
documents. Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 18/27

66. As for the other data referred to in point 40 above, the Litigation Chamber

makes the following findings.

- With regard to the telephone number and residence of the user, the

Litigation Chamber is of the opinion that the applicability of Regulation (EU) 2017/1128 of the

European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the cross-border portability of

online content services in the internal market is indeed likely to
require the processing of these data for the purposes of allowing access to the Auvio

service to Belgian residents when they are in another EU country. In doing so,

these data can be considered as "necessary for the performance of the contract"

thus "expanded" with regard to the accessibility of the Auvio service. The Contentious Chamber recalls

that if one of these data should be sufficient for the purposes of this expanded personalized

offer, only one of them could be processed in execution of the principle of

minimization, notwithstanding the fact that the residence data is also

processed for personalization purposes (weather for example).

- Regarding the processing of the subscriber's date of birth, the Contentious

Chamber is of the opinion that it does not have sufficient elements and

technical findings to conclude on the objective necessity of its processing for the purposes

of executing the contract. The Litigation Chamber notes the reasoning invoked

by the defendant based on a decision of the CSA and on the obligations to which it is bound

arising from the decree relating to the protection of minors with regard to certain

content. Age verification for these purposes, if such is the obligation arising from it,

must be carried out in compliance with data protection rules, in particular the
principle of minimisation. As with any age verification system, the

data controller must opt for a system that guarantees respect for the

privacy and protection of the personal data of the users concerned. The

defendant must therefore be able to demonstrate that the date of birth is

actually essential in order to be able to perform the contract in full legality and that

any other measure that is less prejudicial in terms of the protection of

personal data could not achieve the desired result.

- As for the gender data, the Litigation Chamber notes that here too, it does not

have sufficient information regarding the personalization of the service to which the processing of this data results. The Litigation Chamber recalls that

this processing for personalization purposes must necessarily take place in the

27
As part of the implementation of Article 8.2 of the GDPR in particular, the French data protection authority
like its Spanish counterpart have published the following informative documents: https://www.cnil.fr/en/online-age-

28
compliance with the law in general, including, in addition to the GDPR, non-discrimination rules for example and all the standards (legal in particular)

to which the defendant is bound. It is also up to the defendant to be able to demonstrate that this is the case.

- With regard to the profile photo processed when the user chooses to register via the social network to which he is already registered, the Litigation Chamber refers to point 89 below.

67. In conclusion, provided that it can demonstrate that all this data is

essential for the variable personalization of the “Auvio” service (service as presented

under the terms of the various information documents brought to the attention of users

of the service), the defendant is authorized to rely on Article 6.1. b) of the GDPR. When

this data is optional, it is important that this is very clearly specified to the

user as well as the personalization of the service that will result from it; this is so that the

subscriber can make an informed choice.

II.2. As for the use of social network data for connection/registration purposes

II.2.1. The IS’s point of view

68. As stated above, the IS notes in its investigation report

that the distinction between the login and registration mechanism via

social networks lacks clarity, contrary to Articles 12.1, 13 and 14 of the GDPR. It notes that the

registration and login mechanisms are almost identical.

69. The report adds that following his login with his Facebook ID, a

technical advisor of the IS was, without his knowledge, created a profile with his Facebook data on the

defendant’s website, data that he was also asked to complete. The IS concludes that

the mechanism used, under the guise of logging in via a Facebook account, is in fact the

creation of an RTBF account with the provision of the user’s Facebook data, without

the latter being informed. The SI concludes that this procedure is in contradiction with

Articles 5.1a), 5.1.b), 5.1.c), 12.1, 13 and 14 of the GDPR.

28The Litigation Chamber draws the defendant's attention to the recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union
(CJEU) of 9 January 2025 - whose factual circumstances and legal elements are admittedly different - in Case C-394/23,
Mousse v. Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (CNIL) and SNCF Connect, more particularly the CJEU's focus on the risk of gender discrimination. Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 20/27

II.2.2. The parties’ point of view

The complainant

70. The complainant states that the problem lies not so much in the question of informing

the user who seeks to register as in the choice made by the defendant to make Auvio

a personalized service for which it will therefore be necessary to create an account and

communicate certain personal data for this purpose.

The defendant

71. As a principal point, the defendant concludes, as already mentioned in section II.1.1., that

the findings of the IS must be dismissed. Since findings 5 and 6 made by the IS are, according to

it, here too, sad examples of its lack of thoroughness and impartiality, they taint

the impartiality of the Litigation Chamber by repercussion.

72. As for finding 5, which accuses it of failing in its duty of transparency in the

presentation of the two options for creating the Auvio account, namely “registration” on the one hand

and “connection” on the other, the defendant considers that users are

never misled as to the consequences of each of these procedures.

73. As for finding 6, which it considers intrinsically linked to finding 5 and
which accuses it of not informing the user that logging in via a Facebook account is

“in fact the creation of an RTBF account with the provision of the user’s

Facebook data”, the defendant considers that it is unfounded. It adds that it never

has access to the user’s Facebook or other account.

74. In its “Summary Conclusions”, the defendant detailed the steps of the
29
registration procedure via a social network connector (Facebook or Google).

75. The defendant considers that it follows from these steps that, contrary to the conclusion of the IS,

it is very clear to the user that his name, photo and email address are

communicated to the defendant in view of (1) the numerous occasions on which

both the Data Usage Charter and its T&Cs are brought to the attention of

the user and (2) the express indication by Facebook that this personal data is

shared. Thus, with regard to the sharing of data itself,

findings 5 and 6 of the IS for lack of transparency are unfounded. The process

described

29The user begins by clicking on a REGISTER button via Facebook. A separate window then opens in

which the user is asked to log in to their Facebook account, for example. Once logged in to this account,
Facebook warns them that the process will lead to the transmission to the defendant of their name, profile picture and

the email address linked to their Facebook account. This window presented by Facebook contains links to the defendant’s Data Usage Charter (RTBF’s privacy policy) and to the defendant’s T&Cs. Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 21/27

in terms of screenshots updated during the hearing, attests to this according to the

defendant in the same way.

76. Finally, the defendant denies any flow of data "from RTBF to Facebook" as

the complainant claims. It emphasizes that, however tainted by lack of thoroughness and impartiality

the IS reports may be, they do not in any way mention such a flow. It insists on the fact that

on Auvio, interaction with Facebook is only done to search for information

enabling an Auvio account to be created more easily. More explicitly, as stated in

the hearing minutes, when the user chooses to register in order to be

able to connect to Auvio or connects to Auvio from the said social

networks, there is no communication of data by RTBF to these social

networks in return (for example, data relating to what has been viewed).

II.2.3. The assessment of the Litigation Chamber

As for the admissibility of the IS reports

77. As for the complaints raised against the IS reports, the Litigation Chamber reiterates the arguments

that it developed above in section II.1.3. according to which, assuming they are well-founded, these complaints

do not affect its power of assessment and its decision-making.

Given the time that has elapsed since these reports, the Litigation Chamber has therefore requested
as already mentioned, that the defendant present the manner in which the procedure

for registration via connection to a social network was carried out as close as possible to the hearing date (point

20 above).

As for the transparency of the account creation process via connection to a social network

78. The Litigation Chamber recalls that in application of the principle of loyalty and

transparency and its obligation to provide information (Article 5.1.a) and 12.1 read in
combination with Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR), the defendant is required to present the data

processing that it carries out in a manner that is easily understandable for the user, any

deception or confusion must be excluded.

79. It is therefore necessary that the registration process via the creation of an Auvio account, - whether

via a social network connector (Facebook, Google) or not - be clearly

presented both in words and visually without confusion with a possible direct

connection without going through the "account creation" or "I already have an account" box.

80. Allowing the future user to create an account based on data from a social network

on which he is already registered is a conscious choice by the defendant. During

the hearing, the latter highlighted that this choice had been made to facilitate access to

Auvio content for its users. However, the person making this choice cannot

completely exonerate himself from the way in which the communication of data from the social network to

his service is carried out. Creating an Auvio account "from scratch" or via a social network is a

choice that belongs to the user, however. The latter must nevertheless be informed of the

data processing that will take place in this case to allow him to make a conscious

choice.

81. The information provided for this purpose must be perfectly explicit - in text and

in visual form - so that the user understands that he has the choice, (1) either to create an account via the

communication of data to the defendant directly from the "Auvio"

registration page, (2) or to create an account via a connection to his favorite social network,

the data available and necessary for the execution of the Auvio contract (see below)

of which will be reused for the creation of the Auvio account. As for the creation of an account via a

social network connector, it must also be clear that the connection to

said social network is part of the registration process and aims to create

an account on Auvio based on the data available on said social network that

are necessary for this service. It must undoubtedly follow that this is not, as has already been mentioned, a simple direct connection to Auvio via the social network.

Any creation of an account without the user's knowledge when the latter logs in

via a social network (outside the registration procedure) is prohibited.

82. The information relating to the data processing that this creation of

an account entails must be available (where applicable via an active hyperlink that refers to

the relevant information document(s)) at the time of creation of the account.

83. In each case, only the data essential to the execution of the Auvio

contract may be processed under Article 6.1.b) of the GDPR (see above, Title II.1.).

84. The Litigation Chamber is of the opinion that during the hearing, the defendant

sufficiently demonstrated to it that, with regard to the registration process, there was, at that date, no

confusion between connection on the one hand and registration on the other.

- After clicking on "Log in" on the Auvio page, a window appears with two

separate buttons: "I already have an account" and "Start my registration".

- By clicking on "Start my registration", a new window appears with the

buttons "Continue with Facebook", "Continue with Google" as well as a

registration form to be completed directly on the Auvio page.

85. The Litigation Chamber therefore notes that the possible connection via the social

networks Facebook or Google is indeed done in the continuity of the registration process. The

configuration of the pages does not allow connection without a new account "Start a

registration" or without a pre-existing account "I already have an account". Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 23/27

86. The Litigation Chamber also notes that under the buttons “Continue with

Facebook” and “Continue with Google”, the following text is provided “If you register 30

via Facebook or Google, you authorize RTBF to have access to

some of your personal data and you accept the general conditions

of use of RTBF (hyperlink highlighted) and the Auvio user agreement (hyperlink

highlighted). RTBF does not transmit personal information about you to Facebook

and Google in this context. For more information, see the FAQ. Their tracking cookie

will be activated automatically”.

87. It follows that the candidate subscriber is thus informed that data from his social network

will be transferred to the defendant for the purposes of subscribing to the Auvio contract, the

content of which is detailed in the documents also provided. The Litigation Chamber

understands that this data is that detailed in the step below. It considers that
31
more immediate information would be preferable.

88. The Litigation Chamber also notes from the defendant's submission that by clicking

on "Continue with Facebook", a login window appears which states

"Log in to use your account with RTBF" and that once the candidate

user of Auvio is logged in via his Facebook credentials, the following

message appears: "RTBF requests access to your name, profile photo and

email address". Once the account has been created, the user can provide additional

information. Thus, in addition to the email, password and first and last name, the user can add his

address, postal code, city and country as well as his mobile number and date of birth or gender (see

the screenshot of the presentation of January 23, 2023 and the factual update of January 4, 2023, page 3). 32The Litigation Chamber notes that a comparable process is

planned via Google.

89. With regard to the profile photo, the Litigation Chamber considers that the defendant has

failed to demonstrate that it is “necessary for the performance of the contract within the

meaning of Article 6.1. b) of the GDPR. For the remainder, and to the extent necessary, the

Litigation Chamber specifies that the considerations it issued in Title II.1.3 apply

regardless of the method of creating an account.

90. In conclusion, the Litigation Chamber is aware of the time that has elapsed since the

investigation report and since the hearing was held. It adopts this decision on the basis

30
It is the Litigation Chamber that emphasizes.

31 During the hearing, the Litigation Chamber shared its observation that the link to the FAQ was deactivated. The hyperlink
should therefore be reactivated, which the defendant committed to in its response of 14 February 2023 to the minutes of
the hearing.

32The defendant stated in its observations on the minutes of the hearing that, contrary to what had been
pointed out during the hearing, there is no difference between the data requested during the direct registration phase on the
defendant's website or registration via an existing social network account. Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 24/27

of the above elements, including those presented to it during the hearing and

concludes that it does not have any evidence at the current stage allowing it to conclude that there has been a violation
of the articles highlighted by the IS in its investigation report in light of findings 5 and 6

(points 7 and 68-69).

91. Subject to some adaptations of unavailable information hyperlinks or referring

to an incorrect document and more appropriate wording, the Litigation Chamber

considers that it was able to note that the registration procedure was presented in clear steps

and that one method of this procedure allowed one to connect to a social network with a view to

creating an Auvio account.

III. Corrective measures and sanctions

92. Under Article 100.1 of the LCA, the Litigation Chamber has the power to:

1° dismiss the complaint;

2° order that there be no further action;

3° order a suspension of the ruling;

4° propose a transaction;

5° issue warnings or reprimands;

6° order compliance with the requests of the person concerned to exercise their rights;

7° order that the interested party be informed of the security problem;

8° order the freezing, limitation or temporary or permanent prohibition of the processing;

9° order the processing to be brought into compliance;

10° order the rectification, restriction or erasure of the data and the notification of

these to the recipients of the data;

11° order the withdrawal of the accreditation of the certification bodies;

12° impose periodic penalty payments;

13° impose administrative fines;

14° order the suspension of transborder data flows to another State or an

international body;

33
The hearing report states that the clause relating to registration via Facebook or Google is
identical depending on whether the Internet user chooses to “Continue with Facebook” or “Continue with Google”, whether
they already have an account (and are therefore only trying to log in) or are starting a registration. In the case where
they already have an account (and are trying to log in and not register), the wording does not appear relevant since it
explicitly refers to the registration process. The defendant indicated that it would take this into account in its observations on
the hearing report. Decision on the merits 17/2025 — 25/27

15° forward the file to the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the King of Brussels, who will inform it of

the follow-up given to the file;

16° decide on a case-by-case basis to publish its decisions on the website of the Data Protection Authority

93. In support of the above findings, the Litigation Chamber decides, taking into account the

circumstances of the case, in particular the age of the case (1) to send the

defendant a warning that, if the defendant were in the future not to be

able to demonstrate that the data processed during the registration phase are

all “necessary for the performance of the Auvio contract” within the meaning of Article 6.1. b), it would be

guilty of a breach of Article 6.1 of the GDPR.

94. For the remainder, the Litigation Chamber decides to dismiss the

complaint, in accordance with Article 100.1, 1° of the LCA, for the reasons set out below.

95. In matters of dismissal, the Litigation Chamber is required to justify its
34
decision in stages and to:

- pronounce a dismissal of technical action if the file does not contain or

not enough elements likely to lead to a sanction or if it contains a

technical obstacle preventing it from rendering a decision;

- or pronounce a dismissal of opportunity, if despite the presence of elements

likely to lead to a sanction, the continuation of the examination of the file does not seem

appropriate taking into account the priorities of the Data Protection Authority (DPA)

as specified and illustrated in its Dismissal Policy.35

96. In the event of dismissal based on several grounds, the latter (respectively,

the ground(s) for dismissal of technical action and the ground(s) for dismissal of

opportunity) must be treated in order of importance.

97. The Litigation Chamber decides that in this case, the complaint must, apart from the warning

formulated above in point 101, be closed without further action. This

closing without further action occurs on technical grounds since it concluded that no finding of a violation of the

GDPR could be held against the defendant in relation to the other complaints raised against it

by the complainant or the SI, with the exception of the breach of Article 5.1 a) and

34Cour des marchés (Court of Appeal of Brussels), 2 September 2020, judgment 2020/AR/329, p. 18.
35In this regard, the Litigation Chamber refers to its policy on classification without further action as developed and published on the

website of the Data Protection Authority: https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/publications/politique-de-
