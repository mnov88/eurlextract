## English Summary

### Facts

Data subject was a member of a political party. On 10 March 2023 the data subject contacted Political Party Data Protection Officer claiming that their personal data was illegally disclosed to other members by the party communication officer, objecting to such a disclosure and requesting information on the measures which would be taken to stop such treatment. On 03 April 2023 the Political party data protection officer replied, claiming that the data was processed in accordance with legal requirements and that there was no disclosure. On 11 April 2023, Data subject announced their dissatisfaction with the decision and listed a number of claims supporting their claims. After further communication, data subject first filled on 6 june 2023 a request for mediation in front of the ADP. Political Party maintained its position during the mediation and added in subsequent communication that person who was supposed to have disclosed the data did not have access to it at all. On 18 August 2023, the Data Subject converted their request for mediation into a complaint as permitted by Article 62, §2 of the Loi du 3 décembre 2017 portant création de l'Autorité de protection des données (LCA).

### Holding

ADP rejected the complaint under Article 95, § 1, 3° of the LCA.

Firstly, the ADP found that the data subject claim of data disclosure was not sufficiently proven. During the mediation and proceedings, data subject claimed that the disclosure was supported by testimonies of several persons and police complaint but no such proof was presented. Data subject also claimed that the person who allegedly disclosed data communicated such fact to them, but did not present any communication which would prove this fact. Data subject brought up also disciplinary action against the communications officer, who was supposed to have disclosed the data, carried out by the data controller, but ADP noted that it was not enough to prove that there was disclosure of personal data in the party. Finally ADP decided that there was no necessity to launch an investigation into the activities of the data controller join order to collaborate the claims of the data subject. Regardless of being proven or not, the grievance raised by the complainant does not correspond to the criteria of high general or personal impact. Therefore it is up to the ADP to weigh up the personal impact of the circumstances of the complaint and to decide whether it is appropriate to deal with the complaint further. Given the the lack of substantial evidence and for the reasons of expediency, ADP decided not to investigate the matter further.

## Comment

ADP’s criteria for "high personal impact" is stated as follows: "3.2.1 General criteria for high social and/or personal impact In principle, the \[Belgian DPA\] will deem it appropriate to deal with your complaint in depth if it involves grievances with a major social and/or personal impact, in other words if it involves one of the following situations: 1. Profiling and predictive activities relating to aspects of the individual's work performance, economic status, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, or location and travel. 2. Automated decision-making with legal effect (or similar significant effects) on the data subject (e.g. granting credit based on automated criteria). 3. Processing operations used to observe, monitor or control data subjects, including the collection of data over networks or by "systematic surveillance of a publicly accessible area" (e.g. camera surveillance in public places). 4. Processing of sensitive data of a highly personal nature, namely personal data as referred to in Article 9 of the GDPR (data concerning health, data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a person, or data relating to a person's sexual behaviour or sexual orientation), as well as personal data relating to criminal convictions or offences (Article 10 of the GDPR). 5. Widely processed data, taking into account the following factors: o the number of people affected, either in absolute terms or in relation to the population under consideration; o the volume of data and/or range of different data elements processed;- The geographical scope of the processing activity (e.g. cross-border or not). 6. Cross-referencing or combining data sets from different processing activities in a way that goes beyond the data subject's reasonable expectations (e.g. other than the purposes for which the data were collected). 7. Data concerning vulnerable persons who cannot freely consent (e.g. children,workers, mentally ill people, asylum seekers, patients). 8. Use of new technological or organisational solutions whose impact on data subjects is not easily foreseeable (e.g. facial recognition systems). 9. Processing that prevents data subjects from exercising a right or receiving a service or contract.

§ 1 of the LCA, the Litigation Chamber decides on the follow-up to be given to the file; in

17. In matters of dismissal, the Litigation Chamber is required to provide reasons for its decision.
step-by-step decision1 and:
- pronounce a classification without technical follow-up if the file does not contain or not
sufficient evidence likely to lead to a sanction or if it includes a
technical obstacle preventing it from rendering a decision;
- or pronounce a classification without further opportunity, if despite the presence
of elements likely to lead to a sanction, the continuation of the examination of the
file does not seem appropriate given the priorities of the Authority of

opportunity) must be treated in order of importance3

precisely on two reasons why it considers it inappropriate to
continue monitoring the file, and therefore decides not to proceed, among other things, to

Decision 141/2023 - 5/7
20. The Litigation Chamber notes that the complainant denounces the unlawful processing of her
personal data.
21. Firstly, the Litigation Chamber notes that the complaint is not sufficiently
supported by evidence of the existence of a violation of the GDPR or protective laws
personal data (criteria A. 1 of said policy). Consequently, the Chamber
Litigation decides to dismiss the complaint for technical reasons.
22. Despite the allegations that the plaintiff makes against the defendant concerning
the alleged disclosure of his personal data to other party members
political, the Litigation Chamber notes that no evidence to this effect appears in the
case. The complainant, in fact, claims to have received testimonies from people
who may have obtained illicit access to their personal data, but does not provide any
nevertheless no trace.
23. In addition, the complainant relies on the existence of a precedent under which the
communications manager of the defendant was sanctioned by a former
employer. However, this sanction cannot lead the Litigation Chamber to
determination of the existence of a violation of the GDPR or data protection laws
personal for the facts in this case.
24. Furthermore, the complainant states that the president of the Braine-l’Alleud local section of
political party would have confirmed the position of the communications manager of the
defendant, presumed author of the offense, and as such refers us to an exchange
informal non-time-stamped between her and him. However, nothing of the sort appears when reading this
part of the file.
25. Finally, the complainant expresses her dissatisfaction with the answers given by the DPO of the
defendant, however, it turns out that he always responded within the time limit given to him
imposed by Articles 12.3 and 12.4 of the GDPR (see points 5, 8 and 9).
26. Secondly, and without prejudice to the above, the Litigation Chamber proceeds to
classification without further action for reasons of expediency (criteria B. 2 and B. 5 of said policy)4
.
27. On the one hand, the Litigation Chamber notes that the grievance raised by the complainant does not
does not meet the criteria of high general or personal impact, as defined by the ODA
in its note on the no action classification policy of June 18, 2021.
28. On the other hand, if the criteria of high general or personal impact do not apply, the
Litigation Chamber weighs the personal impact of the circumstances of the complaint
4 A dismissal for reasons of expediency does not mean that the Litigation Chamber legally finds that no
violation has occurred, but the resources required to substantiate the complaint are potentially excessive. ; Protection Authority
data, “Policy of classification without further action of the Litigation Chamber”, June 18, 2021, available on

Decision 141/2023 - 6/7
for the rights and fundamental freedoms of the complainant, and the efficiency of her intervention,
to decide whether it considers it appropriate to deal with the complaint in depth.
In this case, the Litigation Chamber notes that there is a legal proceeding in progress
which includes the grievances made in the complaint filed by the complainant with the police on
October 7, 2022. However, the Litigation Chamber recalls that it assesses the efficiency
of its intervention as well as the means necessary to handle the complaint in a manner
in-depth. In this context, given the absence of substantial evidence (see points
21 to 25) and the significant resources that this would imply, the Litigation Chamber
concludes that it would not be appropriate to launch an investigation through the Inspection Service
to corroborate the complainant's allegations, nor to make decisions parallel to a
ongoing legal proceedings. Consequently, the Litigation Chamber decides not to
carry out an examination of the merits of the case.
29. In conclusion, the Litigation Chamber decides to proceed with the classification without further action.
the complainant's complaint, both for technical reasons and for reasons of expediency.
30. For information purposes, and without this constituting any corrective measure
or sanction within the meaning of article 95, §1 of the LCA, the Litigation Chamber recalls
nevertheless, any data controller must be able to demonstrate the
compliance of its processing with the GDPR, and throughout, by virtue of
Article 5.2 of the GDPR.
III. Publication and communication of the decision
31. Given the importance of transparency regarding the process
decision-making and the decisions of the Litigation Chamber, this decision will be published on the
website of the Data Protection Authority. However, it is not necessary for this
so that the identification data of the parties are directly communicated.
32. In accordance with its policy of dismissal, the Litigation Chamber
will communicate the decision to the defendant(s)
5
. Indeed, the Litigation Chamber decided
to communicate the decisions of dismissal to the defendants by default. There
Chambre Litigation, however, refrains from such communication when the complainant
requested anonymity with regard to the defendant(s) and when the communication of the
decision to the defendant(s), even pseudonymised, nevertheless risks allowing their reidentification6
. This is not the case in the present case.

the complainant to the explanations provided in its classification policy without further action9
.

to be taken into account by the Data Protection Authority in order to set its future priorities
and/or could inspire future initiative investigations by the Inspection Service of the Authority of
Data protection.
