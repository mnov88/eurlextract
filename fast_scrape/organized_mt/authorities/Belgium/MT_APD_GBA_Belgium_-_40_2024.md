## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject received unsolicited letters from the controller on a regular basis. On 27 July 2023, the data subject requested the controller that his data be deleted and to stop the communications. The data subject alleged that the influx of letters increased after these communications. The data subject lodged a complaint with the Belgian DPA (“APD”) asking them to force the controller to delete their data.

### Holding

[Article 17(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1 "Article 17 GDPR") establishes that under certain conditions, a data subject may obtain the erasure of personal data without undue delay. [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR") specifies this period by indicating that the controller provides information on action taken under a request regarding the data subject’s rights, without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. This period may be extended by two months if necessary. [Article 12(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#4 "Article 12 GDPR") adds that if the controller does not take action, it must inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within one month of receiving the request of the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility of lodging a complaint with the DPA.

In the present case, the APD found that the controller did not respond to the erasure request. Therefore, the DPA concluded that there was a breach of [Articles 12(3)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR"), [12(4)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#4 "Article 12 GDPR") and [17(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1 "Article 17 GDPR") and ordered the controller to proceed with the deletion of the data subject’s data.

## Comment

As this was a prima facie decision, if the controller does not agree with the contents of the decision or believes that it has factual and/or legal arguments that could lead to a different decision, it may submit a request for a hearing to the APD within 30 days of the notification of the decision.

       November 2023, December 4, 2023 and December 12, 2023. The complainant asks the GBA between

 5. Article 17.1 GDPR provides that the data subject of the controller without

       can obtain the deletion of personal data relating to him without unreasonable delay. The

       controller is obliged to process personal data without unreasonable

       delay to erase when the personal data is no longer necessary for the
       purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.

 6. In accordance with Article 12.3 GDPR, the controller shall provide the

       person concerned without delay and in any case within one month of receipt of the request

       pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 GDPR information about the outcome of the request

        However, it cannot be determined on the basis of the complaint that the complainant has received an answer. The inde

        documents attached communication from the defendant on the date of August 11, 2023, 4
