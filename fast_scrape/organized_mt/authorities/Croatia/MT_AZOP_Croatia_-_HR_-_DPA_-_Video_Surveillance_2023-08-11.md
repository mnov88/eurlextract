## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant alleged that the owner had installed two surveillance cameras on metal poles at their residential property.

The cameras captured areas including properties owned by the complainant and their father, as well as parts of a public pathway used by others.

Following an inspection, the agency confirmed that the cameras were positioned to monitor the public pathway excessively. The findings were documented in a report dated 11 August 2021.

### Holding

The AZOP determined that the surveillance system violated [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") because monitoring public areas is permissible only for public authorities or other authorized entities, and only when legally mandated and strictly necessary.

The agency ordered the owner to: Adjust the camera angles to ensure that public areas were no longer monitored beyond what was necessary for property protection and delete all recordings obtained unlawfully.

The owner was given 15 days to comply and instructed to provide proof of compliance, including photographs of the adjusted camera views and evidence of deleted recordings.

The decision specified that no appeal was allowed but permitted the initiation of an administrative dispute before the Administrative Court within 30 days.
