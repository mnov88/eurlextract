## English Summary

### Facts

The Croatian DPA carried out an investigation over the processing of personal data by a car dealership in Zagreb (the controller). The controller used a video surveillance system on its premises.

### Holding

The Croatian DPA held that the controller violated Article 27(1) of the Croatian GDPR Implementing Act which provides for an obligation to clearly mark premises that are under video surveillance. This notice must be visible at the latest when entering the area in question. The DPA found that the controller did not put up a notice that its premises were under video surveillance and hence violated the Act.

```
Administrative fine of HRK 30,000 for not marking the facility under video surveillance

The Agency for the Protection of Personal Data ex officio, without prior notice, carried out direct supervision over the processing and implementation of the protection of personal data, the collection and processing of personal data carried out by the video surveillance system, and determined that the processing manager - the car sales and service center based in Zagreb was not indicated that certain rooms in it, as well as the external surfaces of the object in question, are under video surveillance, which is against Article 27, Paragraph 1 of the Law on the Implementation of the General Regulation on Data Protection.

In accordance with Article 51, paragraph 1, subparagraph 1 of the Act on the Implementation of the General Regulation on Data Protection, the Agency imposed an administrative fine in the amount of HRK 30,000 for the aforementioned violation.

Precisely the corrective measure in the form of an administrative fine is effective, proportional and deterrent and fully appropriate to the circumstances for both imposed fines, which are paid to the state budget.
