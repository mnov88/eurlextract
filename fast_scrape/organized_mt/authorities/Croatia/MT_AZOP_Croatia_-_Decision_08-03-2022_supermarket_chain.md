## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is an supermarket chain owner. The DPA received the data subject's complaint, which stated that employees of the controller, without authorisation and contrary to internal acts and instructions of the controller, recorded video surveillance footage with a mobile phone and distributed it to the public through social media. Moreover, this recording remained available on social media. The DPA then investigated the matter further.

### Holding

The DPA found that the controller did not take appropriate measures to prevent its employee from filing the video surveillance with their phone.

The DPA considered that the controller took certain organisational measures, such as the education of employees, and the adoption of internal acts that prescribed the authorisation of access to video surveillance. Moreover, the controller required employees to sign a confidentiality statement. However, according to the DPA, this was not enough. First, the controller did not supervise, test, evaluate and determine the effectiveness these measures ([Article 32(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1d "Article 32 GDPR")). Second, the controller did not ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability of personal data ([Article 32(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1b "Article 32 GDPR")). Hence the controller did not take appropriate organisational and technical security measures that could have minimised the risk of the same, or a similar violation. Therefore, the DPA concluded that the controller violated [Article 32(1)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1b "Article 32 GDPR"), [Article 32(1)(d)](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1d "Article 32 GDPR"), [Article 32(2)](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#2 "Article 32 GDPR"), and [Article 32(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#4 "Article 32 GDPR").

Therefore, the DPA decided to impose a fine of HRK 675,000 (approx. €89,000).

## Comment

Regarding the height of the fine, the DPA mentioned that "_corrective measures in the form of administrative fines are effective, proportionate and dissuasive and that the amount is fully appropriate to the circumstances of both cases_". However, due to the limited reasoning, it is unclear why the controller found that this amount was effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
