The Dutch DPA fined an administrative agency responsible for providing employment benefits €450,000 for failing to adequately secure personal data, including special categories of data, in messages that were erroneously sent to the wrong recipients on its website. Although the agency took certain organisational measures to secure user data, technical measures were only implemented after nine data security breaches affecting 15,000 individuals.

## English Summary

### Facts

The Employee Insurance Agency ('Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen', or 'UWV') is an independent administrative body, established under Article 2 of the Work and Income Implementation Structure Act (‘Wet structurur uitvoeringsorganisatie werk en inkomen’, ‘SUWI’). Individuals wishing to apply for employment benefits must register with the UWV as jobseekers. Every jobseeker has a personal environment on a section of the UWV website titled My Work Folder (‘Mijn Werkmap’).

Between August 2016 and the end of 2018, the sending of group messages in the ‘My Work Folder’ environment was not properly secured by UWV. As a result, files containing various personal data of job seekers ended up with the wrong recipients, namely in the My Work Folder environment of other job seekers. The personal data included: addresses, details about education, nationality, citizen service numbers, information about physical limitations, psychological and physical work ability, and whether people were too ill to work. The AP initiated an investigation after nine such data leaks had occurred at UWV, impacting more than 15,000 individuals.

### Holding

The AP held that UWV had vailed to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a risk-appropriate level of protection for the processing of personal data in the My Work Folder environment, in violation of Articles 32(1) and (2) GDPR.

In particular, it considered that: the UWV had failed to sufficiently mapped out the risks involved in the processing personal data of jobseekers in advance; rather than taking organizational measures (for example, UWV had sent messages urging employees not to send attachments with group messages in the My Work Folder environment) the UWV should have implemented technical measures earlier (it was not until the end of 2018 that UWV took technical measures to prevent similar data leaks); and, the UWV insufficiently checked and evaluated its own security measures.

The AP emphasised that under Article 32(1) and (2) GDPR, the more ‘sensitive’ data are, the greater threat the data poses to individual privacy, and the greater the demand for security. Si nce the data leaked by UWV included special category health data, the consequences of a security incident relating to the personal data may be very serious for a wide group of individuals, and may relate to, for example, stigmatization or exclusion. The data leaked also included social security numbers, which can be used to link various data files on individuals and therefore pose a higher threat to privacy.

The UWV may still appeal the AP’s decision.

1 Introduction

1.1Government body concerned

This decision relates to the Employee Insurance Agency Implementing Institute (hereinafter: UWV).
august2016 nine data leaks have occurred at UWV that were similar in nature
data leaks all happened when sending a group message to a group of job seekers.
In doing so, a wrong (Excel) file with a multitude of sensitive and special
personal data of a varying number of job seekers sent with them, such as in the 'My Work Folder'-
environment of job seekers. The number of job seekers whose data between 2016and

2018 were leaked, ran from 10 to 11,062 persons per data leak.

Because in a period of two years, nine similar data leaks had occurred despite that
UWV had indicated that it had taken measures, it was suspected that UWV did not have an appropriate
technical and organizational measures (as required by law) to be appropriate

to achieve a level of security that could prevent new similar data breaches.
That is why the AP has started an official investigation. This decision covers the period from 2012 to
enwith2018.

1.2Process flow

On 4 September 2018, an AP supervisor contacted the op by telephone
data protection officer (hereafter: DPO) of UWV.Supervisors of the AP then have
requested information several times from UWV on which UWV has supplied this information. UWV also has
Further documents sent to the AP on its own initiative.

On 31 October 2019, your WV was asked to respond to the facts as known to the AP until then.

On 14 and 18 November 2019, UWV responded to that request. By letter of 11 March 2021, the AP
sent to YOURVWanintentiontoenforcement.AlsowiththisletterbytheAPinthe
given the opportunity, the UWV on April 8 and 19 gave an opinion on this intention in writing
and the underlying findings report.

                                                                                    2/41Date Unidentified

2.3Group Messaging

On 16 July 2012, the management of the WERKbedrijf, after data leaks via e-mail,

group messaging functionality in Sonar required for sending group messages to
several job seekers at the same time. This decision was also decided together with the QuickReference

Card “send group sonar mail to workbook” into the executive's attention
to bring employees of UWV. AQuickReferenceCardisbyUWVwithintheWORKcompany

used to record procedures and communicate the direction of UWV employees of these
procedures.

Certain actions are required to send a group message or an invitation to a selection via Sona

send job seekers. First of all, an employee of UWV selects a certain group

Then this data is converted into an Excel/csv file. There is no limit on the number

persons whose data can be exported. In addition, the files are not protected,
because according to UWV this would complicate implementation. Then this file is used as a base
                                                           15

In the period from January 2016 to September 2018, according to YOURVintotal61,214

group messages sent via the My Workbook environment, with an average of 215 recipients

2.4Data leaks related to the group messages

In total, nine data leaks have occurred since the beginning of 2016 related to the personal
                                                  22 23
environment of job seekers: MyWorkbook. UWV has reported eight of these data leaks to the AP.
Before January 1, 2016 there is no obligation to report data leaks to the AP.

With these data leaks, when creating the group message, the Excel file with the export from . is always

Sonar added. This resulted in this export file (instead of a message that had been sent
should be like for example a vacancy text) in the MyWorkbook environment of job seekers

rightly so.So itcouldnotseesecurethefilewiththeindividualdataaboutall
recipients of the message will reach all intended recipients. 24

The AP has shown in the table below the most important facts about the data leaks. 25

3.Legal Review

3.1Processing of personal data

As of May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will apply. Given the

facts in this investigation took place between 2012 and 2018, the AP will both
personal data (Wbp) as the AVG keys.

The concept of personal data is defined in article 1, sub, of the Wb and article 4, part 1, of

the AVG.Inarticle 16 of the Wbp, data about health are considered special
personal datamarked.TheGDPRmarkedinarticle9dataabouthealthas well as
special data.

Personal data within the meaning of the Wb and AVG are all information about an identified or
identifiable natural person.Sonar contains data about natural persons such as
names, addresses, the SSN and other information. This information allows the Sonar registered
natural persons, among which job seekers are identified directly or indirectly.Sonar contains
so personal data within the meaning of article 1, under a, of the Wb and article 4, part 1, of the AVG.

Sonar also includes data on physical limitations and the mental and physical
workabilityofpersons.Also statesinSonarofpersonsfeelingsicktowork.On
under article 16 of the Wb and article 4, part 15, of the AVG, this is data about the

health.

From the above it follows that UWVwhen sending group messages via the MyWorkbook environment
personal data, including the BSN and health data, processed within the meaning of the Wbpen

the AVG.

4 On that date, pursuant to article 51 of the UAVG, the Personal Data Protection Act (Wbp) was withdrawn.

3.2 Controller

The term (controller) is defined in article 1, sub, of the Wb and article
4, part 7, of the AVG. In the case of independent administrative bodies at state level, the body charged with the
duties and exercise of powers for which the data is processed, as a controller

are notable.

As stated in section 2.1, YOUR V is set under a law, namely the SUWI. U W V is a
independent administrative body of the central government with its own legal personality. As above

in the case of independent administrative bodies at state level, is the body charged with the tasks and exercise
of powers for which the data is being processed, as responsible.UWVW
has both legal and de facto control over the processing of data that
are collected within the scope of group messaging through the workbook.

Based on the above, the APUW marks Vaan as (controller) responsible as referred to in
article 1, part, of the Wb and article 4, part 7, of the AVG for the processing of

personal data in the context of sending group messages via the workbook.

3.3Securityofdataprocessing

3.3.1Legal framework
From September 1, 2001 to May 25, 2018, the security of the processing of
personal data, article 13 of the Wbp. The security obligation extends to all parts of

the process of data processing. The term «appropriate» implies that the security in
in accordance with the state of the art. This is firstly to no demand from professional
ethics of persons in charge of information security. The standards of the sea ethics are applied in this
provision of a legal capstone, in the sense that there is a legal obligation for the

the responsible person is connected. The term «suitable» also indicates a proportionality between the
security measures and the nature of the data to protect. For example, as the data
have a more sensitive character, or the context in which they are used a greater threat to the

privacy, strict requirements are placed on data security.

The European Directive on the basis of which, among other things, Article 13 of the Wbp has been drafted under
otherwith regard tothesecurityoftheprocessingofpersonaldata:“thatthe

principles of protection (…) must be reflected in the obligations imposed on persons, public authorities,
undertakings or other bodies that carry out the processing are imposed, and obligations that in particular
relate to the quality of the data, the technical security, the registration with the supervisory
authorities and the circumstances in which the processing may be carried out (…)”. It also includes

with regard to the security of the processing of data: “that the protection of the
rights and freedoms of data subjects in connection with the processing of personal data, both in design and in

in the execution of the processing requires appropriate technical measures, in particular to ensure safety
guarantee and thus prevent any unauthorized processing;(…)”. 42

The Dutch DPA has in a case that concerned access to electronic medical records - with respect to
of the taking of security measures in the context of article 13 of the Wbp is judged as follows:

“A responsible person may only proceed to take purely organizational measures if he can demonstrate that
it is not possible to take appropriate technical measures. This must be compensated for with additional
                                                           43
organizational measures and monitoring compliance with them”.

In order to implement article 13 of the Wbp, the Dutch DPA has in 2013 guidelines with regard to security

of the processing of personal data (hereinafter: Dutch DPA guidelines). When drafting the
CBP guidelines have been sought to join the ISO27001. The guidelines set as necessary

preconditions to ensure a continuous appropriate security level of processing of
to obtain and guarantee personal data as required by law: “take measures based on

risk analysis, security standards and applying and embedding in a plan-do-check-act cycle”.

The CBP guidelines state about this PDCA cycle: ''After establishing the reliability requirements, the

responsible measures with which he ensures that the reliability requirements are met. Then
The person responsible checks whether the measures have actually been taken and have the desired effect. The total

reliability requirements, measures and control are regularly evaluated and adjusted where necessary, so that
a permanently appropriate level of security is achieved”.5

Like ISO27001, the CBP guidelines (as part of the PDCA cycle) also write before the

different steps of the PDCA cycle below.

Weighing the risks for persons before determining measures
Thestartingpointthatisperformedunderthesecureoftheprocessingof

personal data is a weighing up of the risks of that processing. Based on this, it is determined
what measures are necessary to counter these risks.

It follows from the WB and the AVG explanation that when considering data security risks

attention should be paid to risks that arise in the processing of personal data. Such as
unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to processed data
and assessing the risks are relevant mainly to the consequences that persons may experience from a
unlawful processing of personal data. The more sensitive the data is,

or the context in which they are used a greater threat to privacypersoonlijk
mean, stricter requirements are placed on the security of personal data.

When sending group messages via the MyWorkbook environment, as stated in section 2.4,

there have been several (accidental) unauthorized disclosures or unauthorized disclosures

The AP did not take your plan to have an external investigation carried out as a fact

In addition, UWV did not come up with the recommendation until after the eighth data breach (August 3, 2018)

The AP agrees that the findings do not indicate that the

It appears from what YOUR Vwel has documented that only the jamming was taken into account

of the systems of UWV where the risks for those involved were not mentioned. UWV has furthermore
some organizational measures taken, but not the necessary (and technical) measures

4.Penance

4.1 Introduction

UWV has acted in conflict with article 13 of the Wb and article 32, first stone and second paragraph, of the AVG.
For the established violation, the AP uses its power to fine your
layfortheperiodfrom1january2016(startpenaltyauthorityAP)untilDecember2018.Consideringseverity

of the violation and the extent to which it can be blamed on UWV, the AP considers the imposition of
a fine. The AP motivates this in the following.

Considering that in this case, there is a continuing violation that is subject to both the Wbp and the GDPR
occurred, the AP has checked against the substantive law as it applied at the time when the
behavior took place. In this case, both article 13 of the Wb and article 32, first stone, second paragraph, of
the AVG. These provisions are intended to guarantee the same legal interests and there is no (material)

material change of the regulations on this point. Given that the gravity of the infringement is
at the time of the Wbp, the AP sees reason in this case to join the 'Penance policy rules'
Dutch Data Protection Authority2016'.

systematically.

between €120,000 and €500,000. Within the bandwidth, the AP sets a basic fine. As a starting point
applies that the AP sets the basic fine at 33% of the bandwidth of the violation linked to
fine category. In this case, the basic fine is set at €245,400.

4.3 Fine amount

The amount of the fine adjusts the AP to the factors mentioned in article 6 of the

Fine policy rules, by decreasing or increasing the base amount. It is about an assessment of the
seriousness of the violation in the specific case, the extent to which the violation may affect the offender

circumstances in which the offender finds himself.

With regard to the nature of the data, the AP has determined that YOURVinSonar has a multitude of

In addition to the sensitive nature of the data, UWV also processes data from a great many citizens.

persons. All these people were at risk because of the insufficient security level of
UWV.In addition, YOURVal has leaked personal data on several occasions. Out of a total of 15.331

people has leaked YOUR data when sending group messages via the workbook.Finally
the AP notes that the violation lasted 2 years and 11 months. The AP considers this very serious.

In view of the above, the AP sees, on the basis of the degree of seriousness of the violation, reason to

to impose a fine on YOU and increase the basic amount of the fine to €450,000.

4.3.2 Blame
According to article 6, second paragraph, of the Policy Rules, the AP takes into account the extent to which the

violation can be blamed on the violator. If the violation was committed intentionally or it
as a result of serious culpable negligence as referred to in article 66, fourth paragraph, of the Wbp,
assuming that there is a significant degree of culpability on the part of the offender.

According to the parliamentary history of 'serious culpable negligence' as referred to in Article 66,
fourth paragraph, of the Wbp, applies if “the violation is the result of serious culpable negligence, i.e.

                                                                                       21/41Date Unidentified

the result of gross, considerably careless, negligent or injudicious action.” In this connection
                                                                                  60
it is noted that by “acting” as referred to herein, is also meant an omission.

YOURFISH believes that the findings of the AP do not follow that there are serious culpable
negligence. The first four data leaks were for YOUR reason to make serious adjustments in the process

acted negligently, resulting in serious culpable negligence on the part of
UWV. In view of the circumstances of this case and the criterion of seriously culpable negligence
Under the Wbp, however, the AP sees no reason to reduce or further increase the fine.

4.3.3Proportionality
Finally, the AP assesses on the basis of article 5:46 of the General Administrative Law Act
codifiedproportionalityprincipleortheapplicationofitspolicytodeterminealtitude

of the fine, given the circumstances of the specific case, does not lead to a disproportionate outcome.

The AP believes that, given the seriousness of the violation and the extent to which it can be charged to UWV
accused, (the amount of) the fine is proportional. The organizational measures that according to UWVwel

are affected, according to the AP, the present infringement of article 13 of the Wb and article 32, first
and the second paragraph, of the AVG, not removed. Not weighing the risks for citizens, the lack of
have appropriate security measures and fail to check and evaluate these measures
after all, led to an insufficiently risk-adjusted security level
in addition, it took almost 3 years with the privacy of 4,500,000 persons not being sufficiently guaranteed.

In view of all the circumstances of this case, the AP sees no reason for the amount of the fine based on
the circumstances mentioned in proportion and at the end of the Fine Policy, as applicable in
the present case, further increase or decrease.

The AP sets the total fine at €450,000.

2.1 Weighing the risks in practice

UWV indicates that it is: “an organization that generally
and is also pragmatic in investigating and preventing data leaks. UWV opts for a pragmatic
approach with concrete improvements instead of bulky reports. Documents that we, for example, as 'risk analysis'
can be called 'research' by the department, which makes it understandably only

To the question whether before the decision in 2012 to group messages in any other way than through Outlook

sending a risk analysis has been carried out, UWV reports: “There is a risk of sending group messages via the
workbook no risk analysis prepared”. 70

When asked howYOURVin2012determinedthatsendinggroupmessagesviatheMyWorkbook-

To the question whether the specific data leaks have led to the carrying out of a risk analysis
indicates UWVaan:“YOURVeninthespecialdivisionWORKcompanyhasareasonofthefourleaksin2016a

In response to the question whether a risk analysis was carried out after each data, UWV stated the following:
“During 2016, UWV saw no need to carry out a PIA as such. The Business Security Officer (BSO) of

With regard to the data leaks, five to eight UWV reports: “The risk of more leaks became low

UWV indicates that all measures (mentioned on page 30) have been implemented. UWV has 87

UWV has not provided any proof that the measure has actually been introduced or checked.

UWV further states with regard to the fifth data leak in 2017: “Important for the decision on less time,

The step-by-step plan is on May 1, 2018 via the newsletter to employees of the WERKbedrijf
communicated: 109

To the question whether there are technical measures between the first stone and the eighth date on August 3, 2018

implemented, UWV replied: “UWV did not implement any technical measure during that period,
but several organizational and process-related measures have been implemented.However, we are of the opinion that this fact

must be viewed in the light of the risk assessment that UWV made at the time and the earlier outlined
the area of IB&P measures as a result of targets, which is described in the letter”. 110

After the eighth data leak, UWVanalyzed on August 20, 2018 how the data leak could have been
take place and how specific data leak direction involved is handled. This analysis is described
                                                                      111

Furthermore, about the above-mentioned analysis, UWV stated: “First of all, WERKbedrijf in September

At the first point in the above-mentioned passage from QRC group messages of September 3, 2018

states that the export lists for the sending of group messages must first be carried out by the employees
be cleaned by removing data from the file, leaving only the row ID
about.Furthermore, this version of the QRC group messages states that the 4-eyes principle must be used

In earlier versions of the QRC group messages provided, these instructions about the
clean and the row ID and the 4-eye principle are not included.

On September 4, 2018, the AP had a telephone consultation with the FG of UWV.
others considered whether technical measures had meanwhile been introduced. In that conversation

the FG has indicated that, to his knowledge, no technical
measures had been introduced. He further indicated that the four-eyes principle had been introduced. He thought

In response to the eighth data, the FG of UWV has been requested by the Board of Directors of

     “Measure to disable the upload of Excel files to the workbook is working for this specific leak.

     “Plasters Paste: Process agreements are not ‘hard’ enforced”(…)
      “Policy Doesn't Come to the Workplace:

           Understanding process agreements
           Awereness does not reach all employees”

Finally, in mid-December 2018, UWV introduced a technical measure, namely blocking
of the ability to add, among other things, Excel files, when sending

group messaging through the Myworkbook environment. 117
