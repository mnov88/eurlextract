## English Summary

### Facts

A mafia boss was caught after 30 years of hiding during a medical treatment in a private hospital. A newspaper published detailed information on his state of health and more specifically about the fact that he was terminally ill. The Italian DPA intervened to ascertain whether the processing of personal data was legitimate.

### Holding

The Italian DPA struck a balance between freedom of information and right to privacy. Health data are special categories of data covered by [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"). According to Article 137 of the Italian Data Protection Code, health data can be processed for journalistic purposes without the data subject´s consent provided that the controller complies with the principle of essentiality of information and the facts are of public interest. In addition, the controller shall respect the deontological rules governing journalism. In the present case, the Italian DPA found that the principle of essentiality was violated. Thus, it imposed the temporary limitation of processing concerning data already published and equivalent ones.

## Comment

It is possible to draw some parallels between this decision and the ECtHR attempt to reconcile privacy rights and freedom of expression in journalism. In its extensive case law on the matter, the ECtHR developed a list of criteria orienting this balance. The criteria are as follows: (i) contribution to a debate of public interest; (ii) whether the person concerned is known to the public, and the subject of the news report; (iii) the prior conduct of the person concerned; (iv) the way in which the information was obtained and its veracity; (v) the content, form and consequences of the publication; and (vi) the severity of the measure imposed (see [Axel Springer AG v. Germany, application no. 39954/08](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre#{%22itemid%22:%5B%22001-109034%22%5D}), points 89-95; [Hurbain v. Belgium, application no. 57292/16](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre#{%22tabview%22:%5B%22document%22%5D,%22itemid%22:%5B%22001-210884%22%5D}), point 94; [Biancardi v. Italy, application no. 77419/16](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre#{%22itemid%22:%5B%22001-213827%22%5D}), point 61). In the present case, the Italian DPA maintained that the mere fact that the data subject was a notorious public figure was not sufficient to legitimise privacy limitations. Given their nature and content, the information revealed did not contribute to a debate of public interest.
