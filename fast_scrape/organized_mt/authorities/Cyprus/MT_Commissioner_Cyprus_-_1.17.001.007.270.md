## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject (X) was working as a professional assessor for the Pancyprian Association for Automotive Engineers Assessors (hereinafter AAEA). Following the rescission of X's membership, AAEA sent a letter to several insurance companies, informing them of the fact that X was no longer one of their members, without however obtaining the prior consent of X.

X decided to file a complaint with the Cypriot DPA (the 'Commissioner') against AAEA, considering that they should not have shared such information with the concerned insurance companies, and had therefore unlawfully processed his personal data.

After hearing X on the subject, the Commissioner required information from AAEA with respect to the processing of X's personal data. AAEA however did not reply to the Commissioner.

### Holding

The Commissioner considered that, by sending a letter to insurance companies regarding the rescission of X's membership, AAEA had violated [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"), [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") and [Article 9(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"). The Commissioner therefore decided to impose a Reprimand on AAEA, as the latter had failed to substantiate and/or prove the lawfulness of the relevant processing act. For reaching this decision, the Commissioner took into account, among others, the fact that compliance by AAEA with its Code of Professional Ethics was not demonstrated, but also the fact that AAEA is not a regulated or institutionalized supervisory authority (cf. there is no Cypriot law specifically regulating the profession of automotive engineer assessors).

The Commissioner also considered that by failing to reply to its requests for information in the course of the procedure, AAEA had not complied with its obligation to cooperate under [Article 31 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_31_GDPR "Article 31 GDPR"). The Commissioner stressed that the requested information was not complex, and that AAEA ought to have responded in due time. However, since, in the end, AAEA provided answers to the Commissioner, the Commissioner decided to impose a warning rather than a fine.

His clients' positions on the case could be submitted either

C. Defendant's allegations

15. On September 21, 2020, the Chairman of the Board of the Defendant presented to
My office, the answer of the Defendant's lawyer.

15.1. In his letter, the defendant's lawyer stated that:

15.1.1. Unable to grasp the legal meaning and interpretation of the term “seems to
there was ... »violation of the provisions of the Rules of Procedure. He wondered if he could
and that there was no infringement, and why his clients are then called upon to submit them
posts and their comments. I note that the Defender's lawyer refers to
my letter to him, dated 18 June 2020, in which I stated that “with
Based on the evidence before me, it appears that there was, at first sight,
infringement of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (...) ".

15.1.2. In his view, three important questions arise:
         - Why it was needed XXXXXX from the letter of the President of the Defendant,
date XXXXXX 2018, in order to "offend" the complainant and proceed to
his complaint?
         - Because it took XXXXXX months from the letter of the Association to

insurance companies, dated XXXXXX 2019, in order to "affect" the complainant and
to make the complaint?
         - Because my office took almost a month to
inform its customers about the complainant's complaint?

15.1.3. The letter of the president of the Defendant to the members of the Association,
dated XXXXXX 2018, bears the form of informing the members of the Association about

the General Assembly that preceded, in XXXXXX 2018, refers to a plethora
issues, consumes a few lines towards the end on the issue in question and finally
is signed only by the president of the Association.

                                           615.1.4. The time frame I set in my letter dated 02
January 2020, to the Defendant, for reply by 31 January 2020, and
in fact, as he mentions, during the holiday season for Christmas and
New Year's Eve is an "objectively impossible" thing. Also, that the above is

incompatible with the not-so-immediate response, as he states, of my Office,
since, for example, it took 13 days for him to be asked to send
re-appointment document with specific details.

15.1.5. Through the calendar data quoted in my letter
dated 18 June 2020, is attributed to its customers, as it states, a
form of inconsistency and / or obstruction. He points out that from these same calendars

evidence, it turns out the exact opposite, that is, that his customers and himself,
given the given conditions and circumstances, were completely consistent and
formal in relation to anything they should do about the case.
Except, as he mentions, if one would expect that in the middle of the New Year holidays
initially and most importantly "in the middle of the Coronavirus pandemic" afterwards, will
set the complainant's complaint and submission as the highest priority
of the requested information in my Office. He also wonders if my Office

it worked, and if so, if it performed such work, from the moment they
Courts suspended their work. For this reason, please be informed
about the manner and the days and hours of operation of my Office for the time
period January - May 2020.

15.1.6. It is my position that my conclusion about existence at first sight
violation of the Regulation and Law 125 (I) / 2018, is based mainly on

erroneous, as he states with all due respect, a finding of 'non-performance
of due importance and non-cooperation "on the part of its customers. For the reason
this, submits that the above is not correct and should be revoked and / or
revoked.

15.1.7. The question arises, as he states, about how his provisions
Regulation and Law 125 (I) / 2018, which I quoted in my letter to

on the same date 18 June 2020, were applied in the case, and also sets the
question about what the relevant findings are legal and real. Submits,
yet, the position that neither findings are legally and factually cited nor
how to apply and evaluate them in relation to the case.

15.1.8. The right to be heard by the "accused", the citation of the evaluation

and its justification in relation to any findings of the defendant, the information
(caution) of the "accused" about the existence of proceedings against him and the
informing (caution) of the "accused" about the possibility of her trial
in his absence, are, as he states, its cornerstones
administration of justice. It has also been emphasized that the above is well-established
underlined in without exaggeration thousands of decisions over time.

He is of the opinion that the above did not happen in any way or in any way
implementation. In addition, it states that its importance and criticality are understood
proper application of the above principles, given that cases of this nature
treated as "quasi-criminal cases".

                                         715.1.9. It raises the question, whether what the complainant attributes to them
his clients, constitute a violation of the Regulation and Law 125 (I) / 2018,
meeting first the conditions required and secondly the
components of any alleged breach. It also states that having

Deep down the case, he undoubtedly answers "no" to the above questions.
I quote the data as it is, as he states, on which he bases his opinion:

         "A) No form of intention appears from the facts to have existed in the en
         generates actions of either the Association or the President personally.
         B) There is no connection or connection between the two letters
         namely the President of the Association day XXXXXX 2018 and the Association day.

         XXXXXX 2019.
         C) Between the above two letters, there is a time difference XXXXXX
         months, so that the complainant's claim that the
         combination of these two letters, violates in any way "the
         personal data and in particular his participation in
         association and its connection with illegal actions ".
         D) None in the letter of the Association dated. XXXXXX 2019 reference is made

         in the letter of the President dated XXXXXX 2018 nor is it related to it,
         moreover, these two letters are completely different from each other
         content.
         E) The Complainant received official knowledge of his expulsion (and no
         deletion) by relevant letter dated XXXXXX 2019 after it preceded
         meeting with the Board of Directors of the Association.
         F) The conclusion that the Complainant himself comes to through

         combination of the two letters in question is unfounded and arbitrary,
         and lacks any legal or factual basis.
         G) In the same complaint of the Complainant dated. XXXXXX 2019, which
         took place by letter of his lawyer it is clear that the
         The complainant is possessed by a sense of revenge against the Association.
         Specifically, the Complainant refers to paragraph 6 thereof
         letter / complaint:

            "With the above and in combination with the letter dated. XXXXXX 2019
            essentially our client is photographed as the person making it
            in illegal and / or dishonest acts. Note that it is known to members
            of the Board of Directors of that Association that our client
            mostly cooperates with a specific insurance company, the

            General Insurance of Cyprus, providing appraiser services after
            award to him which he submitted to the group
            of the Bank of Cyprus. The members of the Board of the Association and in particular o
            President of this cooperate themselves with this insurance company
            company."

         In other words, the Complainant points out that the Board of Directors hastened

         of the Association deleted him for vested interests. From her and
         only the thought of the Complainant I respectfully submit that they appear
         his other motives and aspirations ".

                                         815.1.10. Takes the position that all the data that make up the present case,
lead effortlessly to the conclusion that no infringement was committed by his customers
and that, in any event, the present case does not ultimately fall with the whole
respect, as it states, for my responsibilities and powers as defined

and are delimited in the Regulation and in Law 125 (I) / 2018.

15.1.11. It conveys the assurance of its customers about the sense of legitimacy that
distinguished them and distinguishes them, their unwillingness to hurt in any way
the prestige, reputation and character of anyone and their disposition and intention,
in order to avoid such issues.

15.2. The Defendant's lawyer's letter contained his Statute

of the complainant dated XXXXXXX 2015, the letter of approval of the complainant
for admission to the Association dated ΧΧΧΧΧ 2015, his expulsion letter

E. Rationale

28. Although I take it for granted, I make it clear that I did not consider it
actions, facts, evidence and / or allegations which do not relate to
responsibilities provided to me under the Regulation and Law 125 (1) / 2018.

28.1. Therefore, I did not consider issues relating, inter alia, to correctness or
of the Defendant's decision to expel / delete the complainant from
Link, to the connection / identification or not of the complainant with alleged illegal
actions, in the existence or non-existence of libel, defamation and harmful falsehood against
of the complainant, whether or not there is an intention in the actions of either the Defendant or
of the president of the Association personally, in the existence or not of relevance or connection

between the letter of the president of the defendant dated XXXXXX 2018 and
letter of the Defendant dated XXXXXX 2019, on whether the complainant
possessed by a sense of revenge, as well as whether in deeds and / or
allegations made to me, there is a discrepancy between the two parties or
skip my update, as I quote for example in the next one
paragraph, but in no way affect its substance or nature
processing of personal data relating to

my responsibilities.

For example and in continuation of the above, I quote the following: despite
fact that the Defendant's lawyer in his letter dated 21 September
2020, attached the letter of dismissal of the complainant from the Association

                                        14-day XXXXXX 2019, as well as receipt of registered mail to the
complainant dated XXXXXX 2019, the complainant's lawyer in
letter in which the complaint was submitted on 09 December 2019, stated that the
the complainant, up to that time, had not received any letter or

any information about his alleged deletion, but neither the reasons
for which it has allegedly been deleted, and that, on the complainant's instructions
has written a letter to the Defendant. I note, further, that the aforementioned
The complainant's letter to the Defendant is dated 02
December 2019, for which, however, the Defendant's lawyer has not done anything
report. The validity or otherwise of the information in this paragraph does not affect
substance of the complaint concerning the data processing act in question

therefore I have not, nor will I, proceed to
an attempt to clarify or clarify them.

28.2. From the above, I explicitly point out that the competence given to me by
Regulation and Law 125 (I) / 2018 is to examine whether the disclosure
the expulsion / deletion of the complainant to the insurance companies, as
act of processing personal data, was lawful and in accordance with

the legal framework I mentioned above.

29. I note that, in this Decision, as well as in previous letters
I use the terms expulsion and deletion, without any discrimination
between them, since while in the Articles of Association of the Association, article 8, in his letter
of the President of the Defendant to the members of the Association dated XXXXXXX 2018 and in
Defendant's letter to the complainant dated XXXXXX 2019 appears on

word expulsion, or its equivalent, in the Defendant's letter to the insurance companies
companies dated XXXXXX 2019 the word deletion appears.

30. I quote my ex-officio evaluation (reasoning) as it stands
This is contained in my letter to the Defendant, dated 18 June 2020:

         «26. I have not been presented with any evidence to defend him

         Association that refutes the allegations of the complainant about her
         breach of his personal data after, despite the fact that they have
         grant your customers three extensions of submission
         requested in my Office letter dated 02 January 2020,
         did not take any action, contact or even inform him
         Office.

         27. The non-sending to my Office of the Statute of the Association, as well
         and Regulations, if any, governing the operation of the Association, as
         was requested in my Office letter dated 02 January 2020,
         does not prove that personal data are submitted to
         lawful and lawful processing in a transparent manner in relation to the subject.

         28. Despite the fact that the Association, as the person in charge of processing, has the
         responsibility and must be able to demonstrate compliance with
         paragraph 1 of Rule 5, your customers did not
         any action to my Office.

                                        15 29. No evidence or argument has been provided for the documentation
         the legality of the processing carried out by your customers.

         30. Your customers have not taken any action to prove it

         non-prohibition of the processing of personal data which
         reveal participation in a trade union organization and in general the
         processing of specific categories of personal data.

         31. The three deadlines for submitting the requested letter of the Office
         dated 02 January 2020, which had been granted to them
         your customers, expired without submitting any item, and without

         be informed or contact my Office for non
         their submission. Moreover, not even after the expiry of the deadline
         your customers did not submit any information, nor did they update or
         contacted my Office. The above data prove the non
         their collaboration with my Office.

         32. In a letter from my Office dated 02 January 2020,

         the Articles of Association and any Regulations governing its operation were requested
         Link. I consider that their submission required minimal or no burden.
         Your customers were also asked to specify whether the
         Practicing the profession of motor appraiser presupposes the
         registration in the Association, and, if not, indicate the number of its members
         Link, as well as the number, or estimate number, of appraisers
         motor vehicles not owned by the Association, as well as to provide

         any other information or documents they deem necessary for
         investigation of the complaint. I consider the above data or information
         was aware of your customers, and therefore easily accessible and
         available for submission.

         33. Based on the above, and taking into account that time has elapsed
         more than five months after sending my letter to my Office

         without submitting the above or any other information,
         the choice of improper performance is clearly demonstrated and
         of non-cooperation with my Office in which your clients were
         obliged to proceed, in the exercise of my duties.

         34. After evaluating the information I have before me I find out

         that there is a prima facie violation of Articles 5, 6 (1), 9 (1) and 31 thereof
         Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 33 (1) (b), (l), (m) of the Law
         125 (Ι) / 2018. »

31. Regarding the reference of the Defendant's lawyer in his letter
dated 21 September 2020, as referred to in paragraph 15.1.1. of
present, that he is unable to grasp the legal meaning and interpretation of the term “it seems

that there was ... »a violation of the provisions of the Rules of Procedure, as well as in his question, whether
that is, there may not have been an infringement, and why its customers are called, then
submit their posts and comments, I have to remind him that with the
This letter is updated on the basis of the information previously provided
before me, that there is a violation of specific provisions of the Rules of Procedure and

                                        16 of Law 125 (I) / 2018, and before my final decision is made, it is given an opportunity
as heard, since its customers may be affected by the issue
administrative act, submitting comments and positions to mitigate any
ratification. In addition to the above, by evaluating the positions and answers, the

which he was called upon to give, it would eventually be deemed a possible breach of its provisions
Regulation and Law 125 (I) / 2018, as well as the enforcement of the corresponding, under
circumstances, administrative sanction.

32. Defendant's lawyer comments on specific points, such as these
are presented in paragraphs 15.1.2. and 15.1.4. of this, delay
actions of my Office. I must, however, point out to him that even if there was

any delay, in no case did it adversely affect him and
its customers. Especially for the appointment document that he was asked to send from
new and in which there is clearly the seal of the Association it represents
and indicate the name and capacity of the person signing it,
it was something he had to take care of from the beginning and dutifully
write correctly.

33. I must point out that during the restrictive measures due
of the COVID-19 pandemic, my Office was in continuous and uninterrupted operation.

34. Regarding the reference of the Defendant's lawyer in his letter
dated 21 September 2020, as presented in paragraph 15.1.7.,
that neither findings are legally and factually presented nor the manner
implementation and evaluation in relation to the case, I emphasize that the analysis and

documentation contained in my letter dated 18 June 2020, emerged
based on all that data I had at my disposal up to that point. Or not
his response and the non-submission of the Defendant's positions resulted in the
specific analysis and documentation. Moreover, pursuant to Article 5 (2) thereof
Regulation, “The controller is responsible and is able to prove
compliance with paragraph 1 ("accountability") ".

35. In the letter of the Defendant's lawyer, dated 21 September 2020,
he states that they were not implemented in any way or in any way
following:

         "The right to be heard by the 'accused'"
Both with my letter dated 02 January 2020 and with the letter

dated 18 June 2020, the Defendant was granted the right to be heard.
After all, the defendant's lawyer himself admitted in his letter dated
September 21, 2020, that its customers are invited to submit positions and
their comments.

         "The citation of the evaluation and its justification in relation to any
         Findings of the Judge »

The evaluation and the justification are included in Part C. At first sight
Commissioner's assessment (reasoning) of my letter of 18 June 2020
to the Defendant. I repeat, as above, that analysis and documentation
presented, arose on the basis of all that information to me
were listed and I had, until that moment, at my disposal.

                                         17 "The caution of the" accused "about the existence of a procedure
         against him"
This information is evidenced by my letter dated 02 January

2020. The Defendant's no or no timely response, in no case
annuls his act of briefing, which I have duly proceeded with.

         "The caution of the" accused "about the possibility of a trial
         of the case in his absence "
My letter dated 02 January 2020, but mainly my letter
dated 18 June 2020, requesting the positions and comments of the Defendant

before taking a decision on the possible imposition of an administrative sanction,
prove that there is no possibility of a trial in his absence
"Accused", since the Defendant was properly informed about the case and
was invited to submit his positions. The option of not submitting the positions of Prof.
which, in any case, is not meant as a "trial of the case in his absence".

On the basis of my explanations, as set out above, it follows that

none of the specific positions of the Defendant are substantiated.

36. In my Office letter dated 02 January 2020, the
Articles of Association and any Regulations governing the operation of the Association. Also,
Defendant was asked to clarify whether the practice of his profession
motor appraiser presupposes registration in the Association, and, if not, to
indicates the number of members of the Association, as well as its number, or estimate

number of appraisers of motor vehicles that do not belong to the Association, as well as
provide any other information or documents it deems necessary for
investigation of the complaint. I consider that the submission of the requested documents required
minimal or insignificant burden, while I consider, at the same time, that the above elements or
information was known to the Defendant, and therefore easily accessible and
available for submission, therefore in no case is it substantiated that it was
which is "objectively impossible", as the defendant's lawyer claims in

letter dated 21 September 2020, if we also take into account that in
This period included 19 working days after the Epiphany holiday.

37. The initial deadline as well as the three extensions of submission of the requested
of my Office letter dated 02 January 2020, ie the
Dates 31 January 2020, 14 February 2020, 25 February 2020 and 08

March 2020, which had been granted to the Defendant and his lawyer,
expired without any evidence being submitted, and without taking place
information or contact my Office for non-submission. Therefore,
it appears that the above, given the given conditions and circumstances, were
inconsistent and atypical with regard to anything they should do about
the case. I can not understand the reason or reasons that his lawyer
As he considers the opposite, in his letter dated 21 September 2020.

In addition, the report of the Defendant's lawyer "in the midst of his pandemic
Koronoviou "is considered, if nothing else, very unfortunate, since the first case in Cyprus
was announced on 09 March 2020, ie after the expiration of the third
extension granted to Defendant.

                                        1837.1. As above, as I mentioned in my letter to his lawyer
Defendant, dated June 18, 2020, proves the choice of non-return
and non-cooperation with my Office in which clients
they were obliged to carry out, in the exercise of my duties.

38. Regarding the reference of the Defendant's lawyer in his letter
dated 21 September 2020, that “cases of this nature are dealt with
as "quasi-criminal cases", I would like to emphasize that the Commissioner for Protection
Personal Data is an independent administrative authority and the
procedure followed in the investigation and handling of complaints
submitted by the data subject or by a body or organization or association

in accordance with Article 80 of the Rules of Procedure, obeys the General Administrative Principles
Law.

39. In fact, by the letter of the Defendant's lawyer dated 21
September 2020, Defendant has not exhausted or responded to all of them
questions I asked in my letter dated 02 January 2020. Specifically, no
has been placed on the legal or legal basis of the processing act which

falls within my responsibilities, ie the disclosure of his dismissal / deletion
complaining to insurance companies. Relevant is the following excerpt, from
the response of the Defendant's lawyer dated 21 September 2020, and the
which is presented in paragraph 15.1.9 of the present: “No form
intention appears from the facts to have been inherent in either his actions in general
Association or the President personally. "

39.1. With the above statement, the Defendant acknowledges that the
specific act of processing disclosure of its elimination / deletion
complaining to insurance companies, and makes intent as an ingredient
element of a breach of personal data. However, it is not possible
acceptable to substantiate the non-existence of a breach, this statement.

40. The Statute of the Defendant, as well as the Code of Professionalism

Ethics, are binding documents for all members of the Association. There is,
also, the clear reference of the Articles of Association to the Professional Code
Ethics, since under Article 8 - Obligations of members and discipline, members
of the Defendant must comply with the Code of Ethics adopted by
General Assembly of the Defendant. In addition, the Code of Professional Conduct,
states that “The following terms bind, oblige and govern the professional

behavior of members of motor appraisers ".

41. By virtue of its Associations and Institutions and for Other Related Issues
Law of 2017, Law 104 (I) / 2017, article 12 (3), “Expulsion of a member is allowed on
cases provided for in the articles of association, as well as in the case in which
the member, in all his conduct, acts or omissions, brings or
causes humiliation or reduction of the credibility or prestige of the association or other damage

in his interests ".

42.1. The Statute of the Defendant, article 8, provides that “A member may
dismissed repeatedly and despite warnings from the Executive Committee

                                        19 behaves inappropriately or violates the purposes of the Association or them
Ethics Regulation or the provisions of these Articles of Association ".

42.2. The Code of Professional Ethics of the Defendant provides that “10) The

The board of directors of the association will be the competent body that will determine whether the
professional code was not observed by a member or members and will have the power to
decide as the case may be until the expulsion of the member or members ".

Also relevant is Article 8 of the Code of Professional Ethics of the Defendant,
"8) The member must always behave in a way that does not expose or
offends the association, the other members or its position as a member ", after

based on this article, as mentioned in the letter of the Chairman of the Board. of
Association to the members of the Association, dated XXXXXX 2018, will be
Defendant is forced to expel members.

42.3. After a thorough study of the Articles of Association and the Professional Code
Ethics of the Defendant, it can be concluded that it does not exist
any article or provision which provides for the disclosure of the decision

expulsion / deletion of Defendant members in insurance companies or in general in
third parties.

43. In the letter of the Defendant to its members, dated XXXXXX 2018,
The following excerpt is included, which I quote as is:

         "To achieve our goal which is the recognition of the Association for

         the legal regulation by the state, of the scientific and professional
         branch of Mechanical Appraisers of Motorcycles as independent
         scientific and professional class, we have prepared a strategy, to
         promotion of a bill recognizing the Pancyprian Association
         Motor Appraisers, as the Competent Authority, which regulates the qualifications
         of the appraiser and extend the issuance of his license
         profession.

         At the same time and in relation to the draft law, we implemented a program
         training of the mechanical assessor for its preparation
         written examination that will be organized by PSEM for the issuance of the professional
         Certificate of the Mechanical Appraiser ".

44. Bearing in mind that:

         - Defendant never denied the data processing act
personal nature of the complainant, ie its disclosure
expulsion / deletion of the complainant to the insurance companies,
         - the existence of intent is not a component of a breach
personal data, but, on the contrary, is an element which

taken into account when measuring administrative sanction,
         - the Defendant failed to document and / or prove the lawfulness of the relevant
processing operation,

                                        20as well as the following, which possibly and under certain conditions to
justified the processing operation in question:

         on the basis of the relevant documents before me, and more

in particular the Statute and the Code of Professional Ethics of the Defendant,
as well as the letter of dismissal of the complainant from the Association
date XXXXXX 2019, the fulfillment of any condition is not demonstrated
pursuant to Rules 6 and 9 of the Rules of Procedure, on the basis of which it could
the legality of the processing operation in question is established,
         - the profession represented by the Defendant is not institutionalized and
legally guaranteed,

         - Defendant is not an established supervisory authority,

it appears that the disclosure of the expulsion / deletion of the complainant on
insurance companies is not based on, nor has a legal basis in the provisions of Article
6 (1), or for specific categories of Rule 9 (1) of the Rules of Procedure, and therefore Prof.
has violated the principle of legality of Article 5 (1) (a) of the Rules of Procedure.

45. Considering that:
         - the Defendant was granted three extensions of submission of the requested
data,
         - the Defendant and / or his lawyer did not, during that time,
submitted any information, nor did they update or contact
my Office for non-submission of requested information,
         - the questions I asked in the letter were not answered in full

dated 02 January 2020,
         - the lack of complexity and the possession of the requested data do not
justified any delay or request for extension, and
         - the defendant's lawyer insisted on his and the defendant's consistency,

evidence of lack of appropriate cooperation with my Office for the exercise
of my duties as provided for in Rule 31 of the Rules of Procedure.

F. Conclusion

46.1. Exercising the duties conferred on me by the provisions of Article 57 (1) (f)
