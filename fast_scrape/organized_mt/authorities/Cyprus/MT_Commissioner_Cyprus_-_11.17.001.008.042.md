## English Summary

### Facts

In this particular case, the employee had no possibility to refuse or withdraw such consent without negative consequences, because without consent a person would not have been offered employment. In addition, the DPA considered that, in principle, consent should not be used as a basis for data processing in the relationship with the employee due to the imbalance of the parties. An employer should explore the specific exceptions in [Article 9(2)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR") to [Article 9(2)(j) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR") to lawfully process health-related data of employees.

An employee who worked for the company Sea Chefs Cruises Ltd (the controller) lodged a complaint in Germany against the company. The complaint was transmitted to the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection (Cyprus SA), which was acting as the lead authority in this matter.

The complainant considered a document named “Authorization for release of medical records" as violating the GDPR provisions. The above document is required by the company from its employees before beginning work on a ship to have access to their medical records to be able to assist the employees with medical care, arrange any associated travel and handle any medical claim, in the event of a medical incident taking place onboard.

The information provided by the company concerning the requirement to sign an authorization indicates that a person may refuse to give authorization, but it would then not be possible to employ that person on the ship due to the company's inability to fulfil its obligations under the collective agreement, to provide medical assistance if necessary, or to establish that the person is fit to work.

### Dispute

Does the processing of employee’s health-related data by Sea chefs Cruises Ltd based on consent violate the GDPR?

### Holding

The DPA ordered the controller: a) to cease the processing of health data of employees based on consent, b) to bring the processing operations into compliance with the provisions of the GDPR and in particular to take actions as to process only those health related data in the employment context which are necessary for the discharge of obligations laid down by law or by the collective agreements for the purposes of the recruitment, the performance of the contract of employment, health and safety at work, and the exercise and enjoyment of rights and benefits of employees, c) to inform the Commissioner on the actions taken to comply with this Decision at the latest within one month from the date of this decision.
