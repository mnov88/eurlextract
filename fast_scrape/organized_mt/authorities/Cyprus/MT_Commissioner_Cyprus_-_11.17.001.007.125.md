## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject made a request for erasure of his personal data to a video game provider, Gaijin Netword Ltd. Gaijin requested additional information in order to identify the data subject. The data subject failed to provide the authentication information and Gaijin rejected the request.

### Dispute

Was the rejection of the data subject's request for rectification as well as the company's request for additional identification information lawful?

### Holding

The Comissioner found that in this particular case Gaijin could not comply with the request for erasure as authentication information was missing. However, Gaijin should implement additional modalities to facilitate the exercise of data subjects' rights. The current Gaijin's modalities do not fully comply with the GDPR and additional mechanisms should be implemented so that users with hacked accounts could be also identified according to Article 12(6) GDPR.
