## English summary

### Facts

Patient filed a complaint with the Commissioner because her doctor published her sensitive personal data in addition to her full identity on the social network Instagram without her prior consent. After investigation, the Commissioner found that the patient's consent for processing of her personal data did not cover the communication of this data on Instagram.

### Dispute

### Holding

The Commissioner found that the patient's consent must cover this publication for its lawfulness. Therefore, she fined the doctor € 14.000 for unlawful processing of personal (sensitive) data.
