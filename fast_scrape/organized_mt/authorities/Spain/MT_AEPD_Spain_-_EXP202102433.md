## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject received an e-mail from the controller with the subject 'horror dinner'. Copied to the email, there was a list with the visible email addresses of several other recipients. In other words, the controller did not use the blind copying tool. The data subject took a screenshot and brought it to the attention of the Spanish DPA, filing a complaint. Upon consulting the website of the controller, the DPA found that the legal basis given for the processing of the personal data previously collected was its legitimate interest in offering products and services to its customers.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA found that the controller, by sending an email to multiple recipients without using the hidden copy tool, breached the principle of integrity and confidentiality provided for by [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR"). In doing so, the controller gave access to the data subject's email address to a long list of recipients without having their consent to do so. The DPA stressed that the duty of confidentiality, which is complementary to the duty of professional secrecy, must be observed not only by controllers and processors of personal data, but by anyone who intervenes at any stage in the data processing process. Likewise, the DPA considered that sending an email to a large number of recipients without the use of a blind copy characterizes a security incident, to the extent that the controller failed to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to prevent the unauthorized access to personal data by third parties, also violating [Article 32(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1 "Article 32 GDPR"). In view of the above, the DPA imposed a fine of €3.000 for breach of [Article 5(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") and a further fine of €2000 for breach of [Article 32(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1 "Article 32 GDPR")

                           FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

                                            Yo
       In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the

Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

       Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The

procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed
by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, for the
regulatory provisions dictated in its development and, as soon as they are not
contradict, on a subsidiary basis, by the general rules on the
administrative procedures.”

                                           II
       The facts claimed materialize in the receipt of emails
from the address \*\*\*EMAIL.1 belonging to the defendant in which the
recipients are not "blind carbon copies".

       Article 5 of the GDPR establishes the principles that must govern the treatment
of personal data and mentions among them that of "integrity and confidentiality".

       The cited article states that:

       "1. Personal data will be:

       (…)
       f) processed in such a way as to guarantee adequate security of the
       personal data, including protection against unauthorized processing or
       illicit and against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application

       of appropriate technical or organizational measures ("integrity and
       confidentiality").
       (…)

                                           II
       The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the

claimed, violated article 5 of the RGPD, principles related to treatment, by sending
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/12

email without using the blind copy option violating confidentiality
in the processing of personal data. Thus, the claimant had
access to the email addresses of other recipients.

       This duty of confidentiality must be understood as its purpose
prevent access to the data without the consent of the owners of the data
themselves.

       Therefore, this duty of confidentiality is an obligation that incumbents not

only to the person in charge and in charge of the treatment but to everyone who intervenes in
any phase of the treatment and complementary to the duty of professional secrecy.

                                          IV.
       Article 83.5 a) of the GDPR, considers that the infringement of "the principles

principles for treatment, including the conditions for consent under
of articles 5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the
mentioned Article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, "with administrative fines of
€20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, an equivalent amount
at a maximum of 4% of the overall annual total turnover of the financial year
above, opting for the one with the highest amount”.

       The LOPDGDD in its article 71, Violations, states that: "They constitute
offenses the acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the
Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to the
present organic law”.

       And in its article 72, it considers for the purposes of prescription, which are: "Infractions
considered very serious:

       1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)

2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
particular, the following:

       a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees
       established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

       (…)

                                           V
       Secondly, article 32 of the GDPR "Security of treatment",
states that:

       "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and

appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which may include, among others:

       a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/12

       b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
       c) the ability to restore availability and access to data

       quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
       d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness
       technical and organizational measures to guarantee the safety of the
       treatment.

       2. When evaluating the adequacy of the level of security, particular attention should be paid to

take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data
personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or
unauthorized access to such data.

       3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct pursuant to article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the
present article.

       4. The person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to

ensure that any person acting under the authority of the controller or the
manager and has access to personal data can only process such data
following the instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the
Law of the Union or of the Member States”.

                                           SAW
       The violation of article 32 of the GDPR is typified in article
83.4.a) of the aforementioned GDPR in the following terms:

       "4. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, according to

with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 10,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

       a) the obligations of the person in charge and the person in charge according to articles 8,

       11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43.
       (…)”

       For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 73, for prescription purposes, qualifies
of "Infringements considered serious":

       "Based on what is established in article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
are considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

       (…)
       f) The lack of adoption of those technical and organizational measures that
       are appropriate to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/12

       of the treatment, in the terms required by article 32.1 of the Regulation
       (EU) 2016/679.
       (…)”

                                          VII

       The GDPR defines breaches of personal data security as
“all those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or
accidental or illegal alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or processed
otherwise, or unauthorized disclosure of or access to such data.”

       From the documentation in the file, there are clear indications of

that the defendant has violated article 32 of the GDPR, when an incident of
security when sending email to a large number of recipients without the
blind carbon copy function, without having adequate technical and organizational measures.

       It should be noted that the GDPR in the aforementioned precept does not establish a list of

the security measures that are applicable according to the data that is
object of treatment, but it establishes that the person in charge and the person in charge of the
treatment will apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk
that entails the treatment, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of
application, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, the risks of
probability and seriousness for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.

       In addition, security measures must be adequate and
proportionate to the risk detected, noting that the determination of the measures
technical and organizational procedures must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymization and
encryption, the ability to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability and
resiliency, the ability to restore availability and access to data after a

incident, verification process (not audit), evaluation and assessment of the
effectiveness of the measures.

       In any case, when evaluating the adequacy of the security level,
particular account of the risks presented by data processing, such as
consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data

personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data and that could cause damages
physical, material or immaterial.

       In this sense, recital 83 of the GDPR states that:

       "(83) In order to maintain security and prevent processing from infringing what
provided in this Regulation, the person in charge or in charge must evaluate
the risks inherent to the treatment and apply measures to mitigate them, such as the
encryption. These measures must ensure an adequate level of security, including the
confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of its application

regarding the risks and nature of the personal data to be
protect yourself. When assessing risk in relation to data security, considerations should be
take into account the risks arising from the processing of personal data,
such as the destruction, loss or accidental or unlawful alteration of personal data
transmitted, stored or processed in another way, or communication or access not

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/12

authorized to said data, susceptible in particular to cause damages
physical, material or immaterial.

       The responsibility of the defendant is determined by the incident of
security evidenced by the claimant, since he is responsible for taking
decisions aimed at effectively implementing the technical and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk
to ensure the confidentiality of the data, restoring its availability and preventing
access to them in the event of a physical or technical incident. However, from the

documentation provided shows that the entity has not only breached this
obligation, but also the adoption of measures in this regard is unknown,
despite having notified him of the claim presented.

       Pursuant to the foregoing, it is estimated that the defendant would be

allegedly responsible for the infringement of article 32 of the GDPR, infringement
typified in its article 83.4.a).

                                          VIII
       In order to establish the administrative fine that should be imposed, the
observe the provisions contained in articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR, which

point out:

       "1. Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines

       2. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances
of each individual case, as an addition to or substitute for the measures contemplated
in article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine

       damages they have suffered;

       b) intentionality or negligence in the infraction;
       c) any measure taken by the controller or processor
       to alleviate the damages and losses suffered by the interested parties;
       d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or the person in charge of the

       e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or in charge of the
       treatment;
       f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put

       g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
       h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in
       particularly if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such a case,

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/12

       i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
       previously ordered against the person in charge or in charge in question

       case, such as the financial benefits obtained or the losses avoided, direct
       or indirectly, through the infringement.

Article 76, "Sanctions and corrective measures", establishes that:

       "2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of the Regulation (EU)
