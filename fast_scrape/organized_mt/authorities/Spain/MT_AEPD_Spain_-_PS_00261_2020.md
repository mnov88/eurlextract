## English Summary

### Facts

Following a complaint, the Spanish DPA (AEPD) launched an investigation of a public radio-tv company that was using a video surveillance system on their premises.

The complainant alleged that the company had kept images during more than a year, as more than a year after recording them they were able to provide them to a court that asked for them.

Additionally, the AEPD noted that one of the system's cameras were pointing to the door of the employees' resting room, in order to control access to it. However, the camera also recorded images of part of the room itself, including a table and two chairs, a bulletin board, and two vending machines.

### Holding

The AEPD concluded, in the first place, that even if there might had been an infringement in the storage of the images for more than a year, the violation was already prescribed, according to the [former Spanish Data Protection Act](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1999-23750), as more than two years had passed since the moment in which the controller handled the images to the court.

On the other hand, the AEPD found that the controller had violated Article 5(1)(c) GDPR when recording part of the employees' resting room. Even if the [Spanish Workers' Statute](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-11430) allows under its Article 20(3) the employer to use different methods of control and surveillance, the [Spanish Data Protection Act](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673) regulates the use of videocameras in the workplace. Its Article 89 allows for the use of videocameras, but specifically prohibits the recording of images of resting places for employees.

Therefore, the controller illegally recorded such images, and hence violated Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, for processing inadequate and irrelevant personal data of its employees.

The AEPD suggested that, if they needed to record images of the door providing access to the room, they could either move the camera, so the angle was the appropriate one, either mask the part of the image that was filming the resting room, other than the door.

The AEPD fined the controller €20,000 for the violation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, reduced to €16,000 due to early payment.

Additionally, the AEPD found that the informative signs regarding the video cameras were not up-to-date, as they only mentioned the former Spanish Data Protection Act. The AEPD considered that the controller had had enough time to update the signs since the publication and the entry into force of the GDPR, and that therefore the controller had violated Article 12 GDPR, by not fulfilling their information obligations.

The AEPD fined the controller €6,000 for the violation of Article 12 GDPR, reduced to €3,600 due to the recognition of responsibility and early payment.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                             I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

                                            II

Regarding the obligation to preserve images for a period not exceeding 30 days, the
(RGPD), in its recital 39, announces the need to “ensure that it is limited to a
strict minimum ”the period of conservation of personal data, which in turn
must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which

be treated ”. Article 22.3 of the LOPDGDD specifies - regarding the treatments with
video surveillance purposes– that “the data will be deleted within a maximum period of one month
since its recruitment ”.

With the application of the RGPD since 05/25/2018, it should be considered that most of

Instruction 1/2006 of 8/11, of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, on the treatment of
data collection for surveillance purposes, BOE 12/12/2006, entry into force 13,
has been displaced, since its content, such as legitimation or
the rights of people, is displaced by what is established in this regard by the norm
European.

In addition to being the same conservation period, at the time the events occur,
if the aforementioned provision on the preservation of images was applicable.

With the RGPD, the obligation to register files referred to in the Instruction disappears.
1/2006, it may be considered that the provisions of article 6 of the citation remain in force.

gives instruction that regulates the conservation period, and that refers to the occurrence of the
cancellation of images within a maximum period of one month.

On the other hand, an interpretation in accordance with the RGPD, since it does not contemplate the cancellation
but deletion, supposes that this conservation period of a maximum of one month does not

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/18

will be of cancellation but of suppression, except in those cases in which they must
Serve to prove the commission of acts that threaten the integrity of persons,
goods or facilities. The AEPD, in 2019, in its Guide on the use of video cameras to

security and other purposes, has specified that the period of one month indicated in said Ins-
truction is, effectively, suppression.

However, if during the legitimate treatment (within the month from its capture)
observes that the images can “prove the commission of acts that violate the

approves the revised text of the Workers 'Statute Law (LET) Workers' Statute
Workers, note that its article 20.3 states:

  "3. The employer may adopt the measures he deems most appropriate for monitoring and

control to verify compliance by the worker of their obligations and duties

taking into account, where appropriate, the real capacity of workers with disabilities. "

The proportionality alleged in relation to said article does not apply to the present case,
where the purpose of the installation and collection of the images is the pure security of

facilities, that no foreign element enters through the door that focuses the access, that
it cannot be confused with the control of the fulfillment of labor obligations. The
proportionality will have to be assessed between said purpose that is not related to the
labor control purposes as reiterated by the one claimed.

Not being its purpose that of labor control, it follows that it is not necessary to inform the
employees for this purpose, but if it is to be reported in general, and for the public

whether or not they are employees who circulate in said spaces. In this sense, both the LOPD and
the RGPD and the LOPDGDD establish how to do it, proving that the claimed
paid the amount of the fine for said offense.

Article 22 of the LOPDGDD indicates:

  1. Natural or legal persons, public or private, may carry out the treatment
of images through camera or video camera systems in order to preserve
the safety of people and property, as well as its facilities.

  3. The data will be deleted within a maximum period of one month from its capture, except
when they had to be conserved to prove the commission of acts that attempt against
the integrity of people, property or facilities. In this case, the images must be
made available to the competent authority within a maximum period of seventy-two
hours since the existence of the recording was known.

  The blocking obligation provided for in article will not apply to these treatments.

sufficiently visible identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment, the identity of the
responsible and the possibility of exercising the rights provided in articles 15 to 22 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679. A code may also be included in the information device
connection or internet address to this information.

  In any case, the data controller must keep at the disposal of the
affected the information referred to in the aforementioned regulation.

  7. What is regulated in this article is understood without prejudice to the provisions of the Law
5/2014, of April 4, on Private Security and its development provisions. "

The permanent implementation of a system that allows continuous monitoring through

of video cameras for security reasons has a legitimate basis in the LOPDGDD, whose
explanatory memorandum indicates:

"Along with these assumptions are collected others, such as video surveillance, files of

advertising exclusion or internal complaint systems in which the legality of the treatment
comes from the existence of a public interest, in the terms established in the article
6.1.e) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 "

It should be remembered that article 6.1.e) of the RGPD states;

     1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

      e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
  public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller; "

Article 89 that refers to the treatment of images obtained with a camera system
or video cameras, for the exercise of control functions of workers or employees
public, which is not the case under examination, it adds, in section 2:

  "two. In no case will the installation of sound recording systems or
video surveillance in places intended for the rest or recreation of workers or
public employees, such as changing rooms, toilets, dining rooms and the like. "

This means that neither the installation intended expressly for said
purpose, nor the deviation from another lawful purpose that partially incurs in said prohibition as in
this case, which with a legitimate purpose, is focusing on the space or area mentioned,
when it is proven that this is not at all necessary, and the purpose of

security by strictly focusing on the target of the door.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/18

Without prejudice to the obligations of information to people who may transit through
said spaces, it is a public space. Therefore, the focus of the camera should

focus on monitoring the concrete and specific areas of particularized risk,
confined and limited to what is necessary in order not to affect the space available to
employees.

The possible and continuous monitoring through video of the employees in the
Rest is exceptionally justified for express, motivated and justified reasons.

Logically, in the areas where employees rest, relax or have a coffee there are
genuine and reasonable expectations for your privacy to be respected.

The sacrifice or limitation of this right of the employees must obey some

motivated and duly explicit reasons. However, in this case, the conflict of
interests of the right to security of the company's facilities for the
conservation of its facilities and assets can be combined with the rights of the
employees to their privacy. In this case it is appreciated that they could coexist, the camera
focusing on the security objective centered on the access door, if it is adjusted and reduces the
excess data collection that invades part of the rest area, adjusting it to the

purpose that is sought without hindering its objective.

It is estimated that when the defendant compares the spaces indicated in the image, numbered
randoing parts of the space, it does not take into account that in addition to the part itself that is already
In the image, (chairs, tables, machines and notice board), there is a space in front of the

machines and to the right of the chairs whose capture could also be avoided so as not to invade
the reserve of the area, so that by partially limiting the effects of the focus would preserve
a higher degree of privacy reserve in that area. It would not only make them not see each other

The image to be obtained must be in front of the door, specifying well a cam-

car in another area, such as more forward, in the middle of the room, changing
the capture space or putting a mask on the left side of it.

The general principles applicable to the treatment and recording of images by the

video surveillance, at the date of the claim, were contained in the LOPD, and are the same
that are contained in the GDPR.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/18

According to the claimed, the purpose of the collection of images is security, not
it seeks to control employees. Faced with this, it should be noted that the treatment of

data must be limited and adjusted to the purpose for which it is established, it must not be processed
when the purpose is incompatible, or must be treated in its fair terms, making it compatible
other rights that concur when the purpose is not ceased to be obtained with it. Either
should be treated with such extensive data collection, that they are not considered necessary,
adequate or accurate for the purpose.

Along with this, there are general limitations that prohibit capture in spaces not only
private, but intimate of the employees such as the locker room, dining room,
or break room.

This ultimately implies the commission for the claimed of an infringement of article 5.1.c)
of the RGPD, which indicates: “1. The personal data will be:

       c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are processed ("data minimization"); "

The security of the facilities is capturing images of a large part of the space

destined for the rest of the staff, thus proving the infringement charged.
