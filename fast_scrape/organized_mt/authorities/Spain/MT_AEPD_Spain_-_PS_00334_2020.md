the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate

                                            II

       Sections b), d) and i) of article 58.2 of the RGPD provide the following:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/6

       “2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers
corrective measures listed below:

       (…)

       b) punish any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with

                                           IV

clients of the entity in which he worked, without having legitimacy to do so.

art. 6.1 GDPR.
That there are no data in my files of the claimant's clients that have not
been collected in accordance with the legitimizing basis for it, in accordance with the regulations

following:

       "1. Initiated a sanctioning procedure, if the offender acknowledges his

       Therefore, based on the foregoing, the Director of the Agency
