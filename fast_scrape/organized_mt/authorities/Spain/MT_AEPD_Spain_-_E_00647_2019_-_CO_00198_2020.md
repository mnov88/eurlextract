The Spanish DPA referred a case to the Irish DPA regarding Facebook transfers of data to third parties. The Irish DPA rejected the case, since Ireland has not implemented [Article 80(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_80_GDPR#2 "Article 80 GDPR") and the consumer organisation that brought the claim in Spain could therefore not act without an individual mandate.

## English Summary

### Facts

A consumers organisation lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against Facebook, since according to a series of news articles, Facebook had shared their users' personal data with over 150 third organisations without the users' consent.

### Holding

The AEPD referred the complaint to the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) through the Internal Market Information system (IMI), since Facebook Ireland has their main establishment in Ireland, pursuant to the definition set by [Article 4(16) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#16 "Article 4 GDPR"). And, since the DPC is the lead authority with regard to Facebook Ireland, the DPC is in charge of cases regarding Facebook's international transfers of personal data, in accordance to [Article 4(23) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#23 "Article 4 GDPR").

According to the AEPD, there are other concerned DPAs in this case, as defined in [Article 4(22) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#22 "Article 4 GDPR"): Spain, Belgium, Rhineland-Palatinate, Netherlands, Lower Saxony, Italy, Luxembourg, France, Sweden, Thuringia, Hesse, Norway, Berlin, Hungary, Finland, Saarland, Slovenia, North Rhine-Westphalia, Portugal, Slovakia, Greece, Austria and Poland.

The DPC rejected the case, alleging that it came from an organisation without an individual mandate. According to the DPC, Ireland has not implemented [Article 80(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_80_GDPR#2 "Article 80 GDPR") and therefore the authority cannot handle a complaint lodged by an organisation mentioned in such Article (a not-for-profit body, organisation or association which has been properly constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State, has statutory objectives which are in the public interest, and is active in the field of the protection of data subjects' rights and freedoms with regard to the protection of their personal data).

Since the case had been rejected, the AEPD manifested that it was the competent authority to notify the complainant, in accordance with [Article 60(8) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_60_GDPR#8 "Article 60 GDPR"). Therefore, the AEPD archived the proceedings, without prejudice of the consumers organisation lodging a new complaint following the mandate of an individual data subject.

Notwithstanding, according to the DPC, these facts are currently under investigation by the DPA within the competences attributed to it as lead authority.

Therefore, this authority cannot manage a claim filed by an entity,
non-profit organization or association that has been properly constituted
under the law of a Member State, the statutory objectives of which are to
public interest and act in the field of protection of rights and freedoms

independence of the mandate of an interested party.
