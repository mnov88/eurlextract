## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a complaint against their employer (the controller). They had sent the controller a professional email about a labour issue. The controller then displayed a screenshot of this email on the company Whatsapp profile of the data subject. The screenshot included the name and surname of the data subject along with the related question about the labour issue.

The Spanish DPA reached out several times to the controller to ask for an explanation but was ignored at each turn, receiving no reply.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA fined the controller €5,000 for an infraction of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR").

First, as the controller did not reply, the DPA used the evidence available to it (the screenshot) and considered that the controller had failed to ensure the security of their employee's personal data by disseminating it on the employee's company Whatsapp account.

Second, the DPA gave the controller the option to attend a hearing within 10 days of the decision. Should the controller acknowledge its responsibility, the fine will be reduced by 20% to €4,000. If the controller does not reply to the decision, the DPA will take this as an indication of the controller's final decision and mantain the original amount of the fine.
