## English Summary

### Facts

An individual lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) arguing that the defendant has set surveillance cameras in a public area, not properly oriented to his private property.

The defendant stated that there is a sign in place warning about being a video-recorded zone, that the images are not being stored and that the cameras are aiming to his property.

### Dispute

Since the GDPR requires that the personal data shall be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (data minimization), would that be an infringement of the Article 5.(1)(c) GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD held, that it is responsibility of the demandant to make sure his surveillance cameras are set up in a lawful manner. The surveillance cameras must preferably be oriented to the private property, otherwise that might constitute a privacy violation for third parties, when believing that they are being permanently recorded.

Besides, recording public spaces is an exclusive competence of the Spanish state.

Therefore, the AEPD imposed a fine of €2000 to the defendant for a violation of the Article 5(1)(c) GDPR, for having surveillance cameras recording public space, affecting the rights of third parties without a lawful ground.

## Comment

The initial fined was reduced to €1200 due to a voluntary payment made by the defendant along with acknowledgment of his liability.
