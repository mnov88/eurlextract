## English Summary

### Facts

SIDECU S.A. (the controller) is a company that operates and manages sports centres. The controller replaced its method of access of cards or fingerprints system with a mandatory facial recognition system. This was implemented without informing or consulting its members. The data subject refused to use the new system, arguing that it is invasive and excessive. In response, the controller refused to grant the data subject access.

The case involves nine complaints presented by different data subjects. The first complaint was filed in August 2023, and the other complaints were joined by the DPA during its investigations. The DPA also received a complaint by FACUA (a consumer association).

The controller argued that it could install the facial recognition systems without prior consent of the members. According to the controller, it was not processing any data at all (including sensitive data), because the facial recognition systems did not identify the person at any moment. According to the controller, a 2020 report by the DPA supported their argument, as it stated that not all biometric data falls under the definition of sensitive data under [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"). It is important to note here that the controller used this reasoning to argue that it did not process any data at all.

The controller argued that it had carried out a risk assessment before implementing facial recognition, and that the new system did not pose any risks because there was no processing of personal data. This meant that is was also unnecessary to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA). Finally, the controller argued that it had included signs in the sports centres, allowing the members to be informed of the data protection implications of the new system.

### Holding

First, the DPA found a violation of [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"). Biometric data is personal data when it is processed for the purpose of allowing or confirming the unique identity of a person ([Article 4(14) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR")). The DPA stated that there was no doubt that facial patterns extracted from facial images are personal data; the purpose of the facial recognition system is to identify (directly or indirectly) the individuals that have access to the centres. Furthermore, the entrance and exit times are recorded, and the process of assigning a unique numerical identifier allows to single out an individual.

The DPA then highlighted the protected status of this biometric data, as it falls under the scope of sensitive data under [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"). [Article 9(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#1 "Article 9 GDPR") explicitly prohibits processing biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual, unless an exception applies in accordance with [Article 9(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2 "Article 9 GDPR"). The DPA clarified that while a legal basis under [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") is necessary for processing to be lawful, the question in this case was whether the controller could rely on an exception under [Article 9(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2 "Article 9 GDPR"). In this case, the controller cannot rely on any of the exceptions under [Article 9(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"), especially explicit consent ([Article 9(2)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR")) because it imposed the use of the system to access the centre. The DPA then saw no need to evaluate whether the controller had a valid legal basis under [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR").

The DPA found a violation of [Article 35 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR "Article 35 GDPR"), because the controller had not carried out a DPIA. In this case, the DPIA was needed as the processing involves a high risk to the data subjects’ rights. Facial recognition systems were explicitly included in the DPA’s list of processing activities that require a DPIA. Therefore, there was a clear violation of [Article 35 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR "Article 35 GDPR"), taking into consideration the fact that the controller did not evaluate whether facial recognition was necessary or proportionate.

Finally, the DPA found a violation of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). The controller has an obligation to inform the data subject at the moment personal data is obtained. The DPA considered the sign placed at the centre ineffective in informing members. Furthermore, members were not informed of the processing of special categories of data, its purpose, risks involved, or their rights as data subjects. The DPA considered this a serious violation, since the controller had stated that the facial recognition systems did not process personal data.

The DPA fined the controller €160,000 in total: €80,000 for the violation of [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"), €50,000 for the violation of [Article 35 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR "Article 35 GDPR"), and €30,000 for the violation of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). The DPA considered this a serious violation, due to the unlawful processing of Article 9 data and the fact that the controller misinterpreted its guidelines. Pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the DPA informed the controller that it may make a voluntary payment of the proposed fine and waive their right to appeal. This action reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The fine can be reduced by a further 20% if the controller acknowledges its liability. The controller opted for both and reduced the fine by 40%, paying the reduced sanction amount of €96,000.

In addition, the DPA ordered the controller to carry out a DPIA and inform data subjects in accordance with [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). The DPA stated that the controller may not continue to use facial recognition systems if the DPIA found no legal basis for the processing, or if it did not meet the necessity and proportionality requirements. Finally, the DPA issued a temporary ban on the controller's use of facial recognition systems.

Regarding the actions taken by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following
FACTS

FIRST: On August 4, 2023, A.A.A. filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency for a possible infringement attributable to SIDECU, S.A. with NIF A15435092 (hereinafter, SIDECU).

In his complaint, he states that he is a member of the Supera Entrepuentes Sports Center and that he is being denied access to the facilities of the entity in question since a new access method using a facial recognition system was implemented. The complainant refuses to do so, arguing that this system is invasive of his privacy and involves data processing that he considers excessive for access to said establishment. He understands that alternative access methods could be enabled that do not involve such data processing. He also points out that a card access system was previously used, that the new method is mandatory, and that the company has not given prior notice or consulted members about the implementation of this new access method. Along with their complaint, A.A.A. provides:

- Screenshots of the communications exchanged with the entity complained about through a messaging system, where they acknowledge receipt of their complaint, requesting the consent document to process their data, and inform them that this new processing system has been installed, but that it does not store images, but rather captures parts of the face to configure a mathematical algorithm that "falls outside the GDPR regulations," according to the software manufacturer. They also provide information about the data controller.
- An email sent by the complainant to the center requesting access via card.

Subsequently, two other complaints were filed against the SUPERA Entrepuentes de SIDECU center and a complaint against the SUPERA sports center for the same reason, by members of the center who disagree with access via facial recognition. Specifically:

- Claim dated 08/22/2023, by B.B.B. (hereinafter, B.B.B.).
He states that he requested from SIDECU on 08/10/2023: (i) the deletion of his fingerprint
previously used to access the sports center and (ii) information about
the legality of the new facial recognition access system

implemented. After SIDECU replied that neither the fingerprint nor the facial recognition image was stored, therefore no personal data was being processed, the claimant reiterated his request to delete his fingerprint, which was

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 3/93

denied by the sports center. The four emails exchanged with the center are provided.

- Complaint dated 04/09/2023 by C.C.C. (hereinafter, C.C.C.).

He states that he has been a member of the gym for several years, and that from the beginning, the access procedure to its facilities has been through a turnstile controlled by a magnetic card and a biometric fingerprint recognition system, although he was not informed at the time of the processing of this data (attached doc01: registration form).

Around the beginning of July, facial recognition systems were included, which he understands are used as alternatives due to the lack of personalized information on the matter (he does not receive any information regarding what was intended). Since both access systems coexist, he did not give the matter any importance until one of the original access control points was deactivated, and he was told by the staff that it was mandatory to go through the biometric control based on facial recognition.

That it refused to use the facial recognition method, having requested information on the matter on multiple occasions, the center responding with an explanation that, in its opinion, is insufficient, and that: "it has been ignored and even denied that the template obtained from facial recognition was personal data, and that this has been partly the justification for not needing to inform or declare the necessary actions for its protection." It is noted that specific questions have been asked about the system, such as the encryption system, storage, authentication-identification, etc., and that the company has simply responded that no personal data is processed since the images are not stored. The software used is \*\*\*APP.1 from the company \*\*\*COMPANY.1.

The email exchange is not provided, although it does transcribe them.

- Complaint of 09/20/2023 by the ASSOCIATION OF CONSUMERS AND USERS IN ACTION-FACUA (hereinafter, FACUA).

It states that the accused company is the manager and owner of the Supera gym chain, whose geographical extension covers several provinces throughout the country. It has learned that the entity uses a biometric control system to monitor user access to its sports centers. It considers that the system establishes a completely disproportionate access condition, as it is requesting specially protected personal data, which is neither necessary nor proportional.

The following are attached: (i) An image is provided as document no. 1 corresponding to one of the biometric controls installed at the entrance of the gyms, which proves this; (ii) as document no. 2, a copy of the standard document that, in agreement with the association, has been used by the gym to respond to users who have filed complaints about the system.

SECOND: In accordance with Article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the three complaints submitted to SIDECU were forwarded on October 2, 2023, so that it could analyze them and inform this Agency within one month of the actions taken to comply with the requirements set forth in the data protection regulations.

THIRD: On 11/2/2023, SIDECU responded to the first claim filed in the file (hereinafter, SIDECU's First Response), stating, essentially, the following:

- Regarding the first claim filed by the A.A.A., it notes that SIDECU has meticulously responded to each and every one of the points detailed in the four communications sent by the A.A.A., in which it stated that the new access method involved special category data processing. Document No. 1 includes a chain of emails exchanged between 8/9/2023 and 8/31/2023. They inform you that it is not necessary to obtain the members' prior consent to install this facial recognition access method, according to the company:

"because it is not considered special category data processing, as the system does not, under any circumstances, identify the natural person, nor does any data processing occur," given that the installed system does not store the image, nor does it pose a risk to the users' personal data.

- Regarding the complaint from C.C.C., it is stated that it has responded to it in the same way as the previous one, both verbally by the center's staff and in writing in response to your email dated 4/8/23, as you have provided to the file.

- Regarding B.B.B.'s complaint, it is stated that it has responded promptly to the complaint.

As attached as document no. 2, a chain of emails exchanged between August 10, 2023, and August 17, 2023 is attached. On August 11, 2023, SIDECU responded, providing information about the new system implemented and the impossibility of identifying the user through said system, as had been explained to the other users. That same day,
a new email was received from the user again requesting the deletion of their fingerprint.

On August 17, 2023, SIDECU informed this person that they could not comply with the request to delete their fingerprint because the systems used for access control did not store this data.

The person was provided with information about the new access system. - Regarding "THE RISK ANALYSIS PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED BY SIDECU," it is noted that a fingerprint access system had previously been installed that had experienced malfunctions, and that after analyzing the risks of the new facial recognition modality of \*\*\*COMPANY.1, it was concluded, based on the information provided by the manufacturer, that the system did not pose any risk since it did not process personal data. Specifically, it states the following (emphasis added):

“SIDECU, S.A. analyzed different types of access systems to its sports centers, which would prevent, on the one hand, access to the centers by people who were not members and, on the other hand, would comply with the condition of avoiding the processing of additional and unnecessary data, for which the user's express consent would have to be obtained.

Prior to using this access system, the sports centers had installed systems that also used complex mathematical algorithms developed by the manufacturer NITGEN, in which the user accessed using their fingerprint, but the system could never store it. This was a system similar to the one used currently, but the analysis of the numerical template was carried out using the fingerprint instead of facial recognition.
This system was already the subject of analysis in 2022 by That Spanish Data Protection Agency filed another case, but the Agency ultimately rejected the claim, understanding that SIDECU had complied with all established procedures and that we were not required to delete any data since we had not processed the user's biometric data. However, the system experienced malfunctions during access (frequent mechanical failures, in any case), which prompted SIDECU to look for another system that was similar and not invasive or intrusive to the users' rights and, in particular, one that did not process data or store user data. Thus, various information was obtained about different biometric systems, and SIDECU opted for the system from the company \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 and conducted a risk analysis prior to its acquisition. According to the manufacturer's detailed explanations, this system does not store the processed image of the individual as it does in other types of records, and therefore does not process personal data. According to the information provided to us by the manufacturer, a model is created with the NIR algorithm, patented by this manufacturer, which uses complex mathematical algorithms, generating a numerical model by using information from any of the capture points. At no time can physical characteristics of the person be deduced from this model. That is, the scanned data is not stored in the system, much less in the SIDECU databases. At the time of initial user registration for this type of system, the system analyzes specific points of the individual's image and creates a numerical model that functions as a key specific to each user for access to the facilities. Thus, the subsequent process of identifying the person consists of the user standing in front of the facial recognition system, creating a new template that is compared with those already stored. If this operation generates a A positive result indicates that the user is
considered correctly identified and is granted access to the sports center. The coded template is therefore similar to an alphanumeric key that would have to be entered to grant access to the facilities, or to an access card with a chip, magnetic strip, or RFID system, for example. This has the advantage that this system does not allow personal identification of the person. Furthermore, the templates cannot, under any circumstances, retrieve the user's personal image or even deduce specific physical characteristics. Therefore, no personal data is processed.

Consequently, based on the technical information provided by the manufacturer, it was concluded that the installation of these systems in SUPERA CENTERS did not pose any risk to the processing of users' personal data, given that the data extracted by the \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 readers could not, under any circumstances, be decrypted or dismantled. Only the keys for the algorithm were in the possession of the manufacturer, and no data was stored. No
information about the user's image.
We attach the identity protection certificate provided by the manufacturer as document no. 3.

- Furthermore, this same section indicates that a poster was posted
informing about the operation of the system in all centers, and photographs are provided as document 4: "In any case, SIDECU agreed that an informative poster would be posted in a visible location in all sports centers about these systems in order to inform users about the protection of personal data, the operation of the readers, and their scope.

Attached as document 4 is a photograph of the poster displayed at the SUPERA Entrepuentes sports center, where the date of posting is not shown.

And subsequently, in section 4 regarding MEASURES ADOPTED, it is indicated that (emphasis added):

"Given that the three users are members of the Supera Entrepuentes sports center in Seville, an internal investigation has been carried out into the possible causes that led these three users to file the aforementioned complaint and whether that center was offering its users the information through the Posting of informational posters at the facilities and through staff working there regarding the change in the access system. It has been verified that the sports center has posted information signs in a visible and accessible location for all users. This information provides users with the necessary information about the use of this system and informs them that this system does not process any personal data.

- In the section "REASONS THAT MAY HAVE LEAD TO THE COMPLAINT," the reasons why the data subjects' consent to process their personal data have not been obtained are stated. The respondent understands that the new gym access system does not process personal data based on the following:

"Although it is true that the user registration documentation does not include authorization for the collection of personal data related to the use of biometric data or special categories, this is due to the fact that, given the characteristics of the In the operation of the access system, not only is the image of users not saved by SIDECU, S.A. as the data controller, but no personal data is retained, as the template generated by the system does not allow association with any specific person.As the Spanish Data Protection Agency pointed out in its
Report 36/2020, this is not considered special category data processing, as it does not, under any circumstances, uniquely identify a natural person.

SUPERA CENTERS only access records of entry and exit and presence at the facilities, obtaining exclusively
information corresponding to the hours and number of people, but not their personal identification.
Likewise, the second paragraph of Article 4 of the GDPR states that "data processing" shall be understood as: "Any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, dissemination or any other form of enabling access, comparison or interconnection, restriction, deletion or destruction." For this reason, the case at hand cannot be considered personal data processing, as it does not fall within the category of such processing. We reiterate that, under no circumstances can the user's personal image be recovered from the templates, nor can specific physical characteristics be deduced from them. Therefore, no personal data is processed. The generation of the templates using the complex mathematical algorithms developed by \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 does not allow the system to save the image or associate the generated template with specific users. Therefore, there can be no data processing if the users are not subject to any of the operations described in the aforementioned article. The operation of this system is not covered by the aforementioned article of the GDPR, since, under no circumstances, can it be subject to compliance with the provisions of the regulations on data protection.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 8/93

to a mere access control system that does not process any personal data, as it neither collects nor stores it, nor does it allow for the identification of individuals. Consequently, and since there is no processing of personal data, the content of the regulations on personal data protection is not applicable, nor, therefore, is the obligation to notify of data processing. For this reason, our entity has not previously requested your consent to use your image, since, as we indicated, it is not processed or stored under any circumstances.

- Finally, regarding the alleged exfiltration of personal data from \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, which according to C.C.C.'s complaint affected more than 27 million users, they state that: "We inform you that after consulting with the manufacturer and analyzing the implemented systems, it is not possible that any alleged leak could have affected the templates corresponding to the users of our sports centers, as these are stored on our own computer servers (equipped with the appropriate security systems), and in no case has the company supplying the biometric access equipment been able to access them."

The defendant company provides the following documents with its letter:

- Documents 1 and 2: Email exchange chain with each complainant.
- Document 3: The identity protection certificate provided by the manufacturer \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, written in English (GDPR Compliance Statement).
- Document 4: A photograph of the posters that, according to the complaint, have been displayed in the sports centers.

FOURTH: On November 7, 2023, in accordance with Article 65 of the LOPDGDD, the first three complaints submitted were admitted for processing and an acknowledgment of receipt was sent to the complainants.
FIFTH: On November 15, 2023, the Subdirectorate General for Data Inspection carried out preliminary investigations to clarify the facts in question, pursuant to the functions assigned to the supervisory authorities in Article 57.1 and the powers granted in Article 58.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), and in accordance with the provisions of Title VIII of the LOPDGDD.

During the investigation, the following preliminary investigations were carried out: of

- 16/12/2023: A Diligence is issued to certify that on this date, a printout of the following information was obtained via the Internet regarding the facial recognition program of "\*\*\*EMPRESA.1" with its NIR algorithm referred to in The responses to the complainants from the respondent entity. This captures the screenshot of the

“Facial Data Protection Certificate of \*\*\*COMPANY.1,” which certifies that \*\*\*COMPANY.1, \*\*\*APP.2, and \*\*\*APP.3 extract the points from the raw facial images and create a template from this data.

- 01/03/2024. Complaint filed by D.D.D. in relation to the San Diego de Coruña sports center, which was forwarded to SIDECU on

02/20/2024.

- 01/19/2024. After requesting and extending the deadline for responding, SIDECU
responds to the request for information made during the investigation phase (hereinafter, Response 2), reiterating the above statement that the \*\*\*COMPANY.1 program does not process personal data, and

adding, in essence, the following:

o In In relation to the operation of the implemented system:

“(…) Thus, the subsequent process of identifying the person

consists of the user standing in front of the facial recognition system, creating a new template that is
compared with those already stored. If this operation generates a
positive result, the user is considered correctly
identified and is granted access to the sports center. The

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 10/93

coded template is therefore similar to an alphanumeric key
that would have to be entered to grant access to the facilities, or to an access card with a chip, magnetic strip, or RFID system, for example, with the advantage that
personal identification of the person is not permitted through

this system. From the templates, it is not possible, under any circumstances, to recover the user's personal image or even to deduce specific physical characteristics.
Therefore, no personal data is processed. That is, no additional device is used other than the system's own camera, which does not store user data beyond the encoded template, and does not allow the user's image to be recovered.

It should also be noted that the authentication system
is performed 1 to N (comparing the template encoded at the time of identification).

o Photographs of the centers' information sign are attached with the
information indicated by the manufacturer as Document 2.

o SUPERA CENTERS only access three entry and exit records and presence in the facilities, obtaining exclusively
information corresponding to the hours and number of people, but not their personal identification. That is, only the date and
time of access are recorded, along with the user code (membership number). Evidence of one entry and exit record from a center is provided as Document No. 3.

o Currently, the aforementioned facial recognition system is
installed in five sports centers, with the total number of users at said centers being 36,483. One of these centers is Entrepuentes in Seville, which currently has 8,978 users (as of January 4, 2024). Of these users of the Entrepuentes sports center, a total of 26 have expressed their opposition to the access system. SIDECU has enabled an alternative access system by means of identification at the center's reception desk by showing the National Identity Document to the sports center staff and manually opening the access code.

o In response to the request regarding the legal grounds for processing: the company does not mention either the legal grounds of Article 6 of the GDPR or the exception in Article 9.2 of the GDPR that allow processing, indicating again that it is not necessary to comply with personal data protection regulations, since the program does not process personal data. In addition to what has already been stated, it should be added that:

“As the Spanish Data Protection Agency indicated in its Report 36/2020, this is not considered special category data processing, as it does not, in any case, uniquely identify a natural person.
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 11/93

SUPERA CENTERS only access records of entry and exit and presence at the facilities, obtaining exclusively information corresponding to the hours and number of people, but not their personal identification.
Likewise, the second paragraph of Article 4 of the GDPR states that "data processing" shall be understood as: "Any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or sets of personal data, whether by automated means or not, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by

transmission, dissemination, or any other form of enabling access, comparison or interconnection, limitation, deletion, or
destruction (...)
The operation of this system is outside the
application of the aforementioned article of the GDPR, since

in no case can a mere access control system that does not process any personal data be subject to compliance with the
provisions of data protection regulations, as it neither collects nor stores them, nor allows for the
identification of individuals."

o Regarding the information provided to users: It is
noted that all requests for information were answered and that posters were
posted in all sports centers, provided as document 2, in a visible and accessible place to all; this being the
only information provided.

o Regarding the documentation provided:

A power of appointment/representation is provided as document 1.
A photograph of the displayed posters is provided as document 2, identical to those provided. in the First Response (from the Entrepuentes center).

Complaint filed against SIDECU by F.F.F., stating that "At the La Lanera Sports and Leisure Center in Palencia, an access system using a facial biometric analysis system has been implemented (card access and fingerprint detection have also been in place for about 10 years). The facial biometric analysis has been performed on users without informing them at all of the risk of the data they are providing and without written consent."

After the preliminary investigation procedures were completed, on June 21, 2024, the inspector issued a preliminary investigation report (hereinafter, the API report), which assesses the results of the actions carried out to date. Among its statements, the report states:

POINT 1. Procedure for Admission to Processing

Within the framework of the procedures for admitting claims to processing, the respondent stated that they had provided the claimants with information about the new system, outlining the reasons why the user's prior consent was not required "because it is not considered special category data processing, as the system does not, in any case, identify the natural person, nor is there any data processing."

They have also indicated that "the implemented system did not store the image, nor did it pose a risk to the users' personal data, and it was not necessary to obtain prior consent since, given the characteristics of the system, neither the image nor any data that could identify the user was stored, nor was any data processing performed."

The representatives of the respondent party have generally stated in their responses to the letters forwarding the complaints filed that they have responded to the users' requests, sending them comprehensive explanations, clarifying that the use of the systems used in their sports centers did not involve the processing of their data, since these systems only analyze specific points of the individual's image, creating a numerical model (template) that functions as a password specific to each user for the purpose of accessing the facilities. They indicate that the templates cannot, under any circumstances, retrieve the user's personal image or even deduce specific physical characteristics. They state that, therefore, no personal data is processed.

Specifically, they stated in their response dated 2-11-23 to the transfer of the

first 3 claims in this file that:

"The company SIDECU, S.A. analyzed different types of access systems to its sports centers, which would prevent, on the one hand,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 14/93

the access of persons to the centers who were not members and, on the other hand, would comply with the condition of avoiding the
processing of additional and unnecessary data for which the user's express consent would be required.

Prior to the use of this access system, the sports centers

had installed systems that also used complex mathematical algorithms developed by the manufacturer NITGEN, in which the user
accessed using their fingerprint, but in no case would the user system could store it.
It was a system similar to the one currently used, but the analysis of the numerical template was performed using a fingerprint instead of facial recognition.
This system was already analyzed in 2022 by the Spanish Data Protection Agency in another case. The Agency ultimately rejected the claim, considering that SIDECU had complied with all the established procedures and that no data deletion was appropriate on our part, as no user biometric data was processed.
However, the system experienced access malfunctions (frequent mechanical failures, in any case), which prompted SIDECU to look for another system that was similar and not invasive or intrusive to users' rights and, in particular, that did not process or store user data.

Thus, various information was obtained about different biometric systems, and SIDECU opted for the company's system. \*\*\*COMPANY.1 and conducting a risk analysis prior to its acquisition.
According to the manufacturer's detailed explanations, this system does not store the processed image of the individual as is the case with other types of records, and therefore does not process personal data. According to the information provided to us by the manufacturer, a model is created with the NIR algorithm, patented by this manufacturer, which uses complex mathematical algorithms, generating a numerical model using information from any of the capture points. At no time can the individual's physical characteristics be deduced from this model. That is, the scanned data is not stored in the system, much less in SIDECU's databases.
At the time of a user's initial registration for this type of system, the system analyzes specific points of the individual's image and creates a numerical model that functions as a password specific to each user for access to the facilities.

Thus, the subsequent process of identifying the individual consists of, after the user stands in front of the system, Facial recognition creates a new template that is compared with those already stored. If this operation generates a positive result, the user is considered correctly identified and access to the sports center is granted.

The coded template is therefore similar to an alphanumeric code that must be entered to grant access to the facilities, or to an access card with a chip, magnetic strip, or RFID system, for example, with the advantage that this system does not allow personal identification of the person.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 15/93

Furthermore, the templates cannot, under any circumstances, recover the user's personal image or even deduce specific physical characteristics. Therefore, no personal data is processed.
Consequently, based on the technical information provided by the manufacturer, it was concluded that the installation of these systems in the SUPERA CENTERS did not pose any risk to the processing of personal data. of users, given that the data extracted by \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 readers could not be decrypted or disassembled under any circumstances, with the manufacturer having only the keys to the algorithm, and no information about the user's image being stored."

POINT 2. Information for users.

The registration document (administration and reception procedure at the centers), the center registration form, contains the new member's personal information (name and surname, ID number, date of birth, address, telephone numbers, email address, bank details) and provides the following information:

"By signing this document, I affirm that I have read and accept the data protection conditions.

You expressly consent and authorize SIDECU, S.A. to process the data you have provided to conduct statistical studies and to periodically offer you information about products, activities, services, and commercial promotion and/or marketing actions related to providers of transportation, sports, insurance, real estate, financial, and banking services,
for the purpose of providing information about their products or services and making commercial offers,
including by electronic means."

This registration document contains several links, one of which is "Data Protection," which has been verified to provide the following information:

"PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING RESPONSIBILITY CLAUSE

The data provided will be stored and processed by SIDECU, S.A. as long as the contractual relationship is maintained, as long as its deletion is not requested, and, in any case, until the expiration of the legally required deadlines.”

The “General Conditions” link does not contain data protection information. The Internal Regulations link, which varies for each center, contains the following data protection information:

“1.8. For the purposes of Organic Law 15/1999 of December 13, on official data protection, by registering at the facility, you authorize the use of your personal data and its computer processing for the management of the facility and, where applicable, the sending of commercial information related to the management of the Center.”

The representatives of the respondent indicate that they have posted informational posters about the facial recognition system in all centers, providing a photograph of its placement as well as the content reproduced below:

“What is a biometric identification system? These types of biometric systems use a physical, non-transferable characteristic of a person to perform identification or verification. \*\*\*EMPRESA.1's biometric systems extract facial data points from raw images and create a template from this data.

What are the advantages of biometric systems?
- They guarantee user identification and verification in a fast,

easy, and reliable manner.
- It is a robust technology that has been extensively studied and tested.
- By using a non-transferable characteristic, fraudulent use of keys by replacing another person's identity is impossible.

User privacy and protection?
\*\*\*EMPRESA.1's biometric systems do not save the processed image; they create a template using \*\*\*EMPRESA.1's patented NIR algorithm. Using complex mathematical algorithms, the numerical template is generated using information from certain points of the capture. Physical characteristics cannot be deduced from the template; the extraction algorithm is only known to the manufacturer.

How it Works
The face template is not a raw image. It is created using \*\*\*EMPRESA.1's patented NIR technology and algorithm, and the template is a dataset that is a fusion of 2D and 3D features of a user's face, acquired by a visual camera and a NIR camera. To protect this template, cryptographic tools and encryption methods, such as 256-bit AES encryption, are used.

POINT 3. Regarding the operation of the system

Regarding the operation of the system, the respondent repeats in all of its responses that the program used by \*\*\*COMPANY.1 to perform the facial recognition of members does not store the facial image but rather a template generated by a mathematical algorithm; and that it is not possible to recover the facial image or physical characteristics of the person from the template, stating that, therefore, no personal data is processed.

To substantiate this point, they provide a certificate from the manufacturer in each of the four responses stating that the facial image is never stored on the device but rather a template that is generated and encrypted, and that it is not possible to recover the original image of the face from the template. No mention is made in this certificate as to whether or not personal data is processed.

The company maintains that the program does not involve the processing of personal data, given that:

“(..) The second paragraph of Article 4 of the GDPR states Data "processing" shall be understood as: "Any operation or set of operations
performed on personal data or sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization,
structuring, storage, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation,
use, communication by transmission, dissemination or any other form of

enabling access, comparison or interconnection, restriction, deletion or
destruction."
For this reason, the case at hand cannot be considered personal data processing, as it does not fall within the
category of such data. We reiterate that, from the templates, it is not possible,

under any circumstances, to recover the user's personal image or even deduce specific physical
characteristics. Therefore, there is no processing of personal data.

They indicate that no additional device is used besides the system's own camera (identification cards or wristbands).

A comparison is performed 1 to N, that is, comparing the template obtained at the time of entry with those stored in the system.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 18/93

In the second response (response to the investigation request), they indicate that only the date and time of access are recorded, along with the user code (member number). They provide as evidence in this regard the printout of the system's screen, which shows the following data for each entry to one of the Centers: date and time, device ID (turnstile), Center, user ID, and the result of the comparison, which in all the listed cases appears as "1:N authentication successful (Face)."

POINT 4. Registration Processing Activities (RAT), Risk Analysis (RA), and

Related Impact Assessment (DPIA)

Along with the second response, a copy of the RAT is also provided. Section 5 regarding the processing of personal data of customers (subscribers) indicates the purpose of the processing as "management of the relationship with customers or potential customers." Biometric data is not mentioned in the section on categories of data processed.

The Risk Analysis is also attached, entitled "RISK ANALYSIS PRIOR TO A DPIA" and refers to the initiative to implement facial recognition systems by \*\*\*COMPANY.1 for access to SUPERA GROUP sports centers. It states that no personal data will be processed and concludes:

"According to the information provided by the manufacturer, the implementation of the facial recognition system manufactured by \*\*\*COMPANY.1 does not entail No

personal data processing for sports center users who access the system.

The system generates a template based on the user's image (the first time they access it) that does not associate it with any particular person, but simply analyzes whether or not the accessing user has the right to do so.
In particular, the data extracted by \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 readers could not be decrypted or disassembled under any circumstances. Only the keys for the algorithm are in the possession of the manufacturer, and no information about the user's image is stored.
The facial recognition system also does not connect to the database or list of sports center users at any time.
The certificate issued by the manufacturer for this purpose is included in this report.

In short, no Impact Assessment is necessary, as there is no data processing involved, as it is not possible, under any circumstances, to recover the user's personal image, nor even to deduce specific physical characteristics, nor to identify the individual.
It is agreed that information posters will be made available to users that provide information about the new system implemented and its features.

Since there is no data processing, nor can it be considered special category processing, it is also not necessary to obtain prior consent from the user.

In any case, users may be provided with alternative access options in cases where they refuse to use this system.

In short, it can be concluded that the proposed system is neither intrusive nor violates the rights of sports center users, as it does not process or store their personal image or any other data that could identify them.

POINT 5. Security Measures

The RAT includes the following security measures for the processing of subscriber data in general: perimeter access control; data center access control; hardware security; removable device control; cloud solutions security; operating system security; antivirus; network segmentation and firewall; application security; paper documents under security systems.

The technical documentation provided by the manufacturer states:

- “Devices are equipped with a secure tamper feature, which ensures the security of data stored in the devices. If the device is removed from the wall and tampered with, the secure data (biometric templates, user IDs, logs) within the device will be automatically deleted.” - It is also noted that encryption techniques such as 256-bit AES are used, that audit trails exist for access, and that the false negative rate is less than 1% and the false positive rate is less than 0.00002%.

III. Preliminary issues.

3.1. Personal data subject to processing.

Definition of personal biometric data.

Biometric data processing systems are automatic methods that are based on collecting and processing personal data related to the physical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics of individuals, which may include their neural characteristics, using devices or sensors, creating biometric templates (also called signatures or patterns) that enable the
identification, tracking, or profiling of such individuals.

As already noted in Opinion 4/2007 of the Article 29 Working Party (Art. 29 of Directive 95/46 EC, as an EU body with an advisory and independent nature) on the concept of personal data (WP136), dated June 20, 2007, biometric data can be defined as:

“…biological properties, physiological characteristics, personality traits, or tics, which are, at the same time, attributable to a single person and measurable, even if the models used in practice to measure them technically imply a certain degree of probability. Typical examples of biometric data include fingerprints, retinal patterns, facial structure, voices, but also hand geometry, venous structures, and even certain deeply rooted skills or other behavioral characteristics (such as handwriting, heart rate, a particular way of walking or speaking, etc.). One peculiarity of biometric data is that they can be considered both as information about a specific person (So-and-so has these fingerprints) and as an element linking information to a specific person (this object has been touched by someone with these fingerprints, and these fingerprints correspond to So-and-so; therefore, So-and-so has touched this object). As such, they can serve as "identifiers." In
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 22/93

Indeed, since biometric data corresponds to a single person, it can be used to identify that person. This dual nature also exists in the
case of DNA data, which provides information about the human body and allows for the unequivocal identification of one, and only one, person.

The GDPR defines biometric data in Article 4.14 as a category of personal data, stating that it is: “personal data obtained through specific technical processing, relating to the physical, physiological or behavioral characteristics of a natural person, which allow for or confirm the unique identification of that natural person, such as facial images or fingerprint data.” (emphasis added).

For its part, Article 4.1 of the GDPR, when defining personal data, emphasizes this same purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, stating that “1.
Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an identifiable natural person is any person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to a physical, physiological, genetic, mental, or physical identity. economic, cultural or social status of said person.”
83

Thus, in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR, in order to determine whether we are dealing with personal biometric data, the following requirements must be met, which are derived from the joint interpretation of Article 4.14 (definition of biometric data) and Article 4.1 of the GDPR (definition of personal data):

(i) The nature of the data: they must relate to the physical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics of a natural person.

If the processing requires the prior registration of the image, fingerprint, voice, iris, etc.; takes into account behaviors, or differentiates characteristics such as race, sex, etc., it meets this initial characteristic, even if it does not store them and only uses them to generate the biometric pattern.

(i) The purpose of the processing: the biometric data must allow or confirm the unique identification of said person.

Not all biometric data can be used to identify individuals.
However, biometric systems designed to enable or confirm the unique identification
of a person do process personal biometric data.

Biometric technologies allow for the use of two main types of biometric systems that aim to uniquely identify individuals, as stated in Opinion 3/2012 on the evolution of biometric technologies of April 27, 2012, of the Article 29 Working Party, the independent European advisory body on data protection, predecessor of the current European Data Protection Board (hereinafter, Opinion 3/2012):

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 23/93

“Biometric identification: the identification of an individual by a biometric system is normally the process of comparing their biometric data (acquired at the time of identification) with a series of biometric templates stored in a database (i.e., a one-to-many matching process). (Hereinafter, 1:N)

-Biometric verification/authentication: The verification of an individual by a biometric system is typically the process of comparing their biometric data (acquired at the time of verification) with a single biometric template stored on a device (i.e., a one-to-one matching process)." (Hereinafter, 1:1).

Although this issue has been the subject of various guidelines and opinions, the truth is that since the approval of the GDPR, it is understood that references to "allow" can be understood as identification, and "confirm" as authentication. In both cases, whether verification-authentication or identification, the techniques used are based on an estimated match between templates: the one being compared and the reference template(s). From this point of view, they are probabilistic techniques: the comparison deduces a greater or lesser probability that the person is indeed the person to be authenticated or identified; And if this probability exceeds a certain threshold in the system, defined by its user or its developer, the system will consider that there is a match.

However, regardless of the differences between the two biometric systems regarding the probability of errors, or from the point of view of security measures, the truth is that the purpose of both techniques is the same, since both aim to uniquely identify a person, both being considered to process biometric data of a personal nature.

(ii) The means and forms of processing: data "obtained from specific technical processing" that "allow or confirm the unique identification of said person."

Opinion WP80 of the Article 29 Working Party already stated that biometric systems are: "applications of biometric technologies that allow for the automatic identification and/or authentication/verification of a person. Authentication/verification applications are often used for various tasks in very different fields and under the responsibility of a wide range of different entities.

And any biometric system intended to enable or confirm the unique identification of individuals, in order to be used, must first register the user's identity in the system by capturing a series of raw biometric parameters.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 24/93

It is important to clarify that biometric information about individuals (on physical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics) can be processed and stored in different ways:

a) Sometimes, the biometric information captured from a person is stored and processed in its raw form, allowing the source to be recognized without special knowledge; for example, a photograph of a face, a photograph of a fingerprint (sample), or a voice recording. These will be personal data, but according to Article 4.14 of the GDPR, they will not be personal biometric data since the requirement that raw biometric data has been processed through technical processing that allows its identification by a machine through automated processing is not met.

For this reason, images of a person appearing in a video surveillance system are personal data according to Article 4.1 of the GDPR, but they cannot be considered personal biometric data (and a special category according to our GDPR) if they have not been technically processed in a specific way to contribute to the unique identification of that person through a system. As provided in Recital 51 of the GDPR,

it also expressly refers to this, when it states that:

“The processing of photographs should not be considered
systematically as processing of special categories of personal data, as they are only
included in the definition of biometric data when the

fact of being processed with specific technical means allows
the unique identification or authentication of a natural person.”

Likewise, the digital image or samples taken from a
fingerprint (whether the entire fingerprint or some of its fragments)

will not be considered personal biometric data if they are not
processed to allow the identification of the person through
specific technical processing (which is generally automated).

b) Another option—the one used by biometric systems such as this one—

is for this biometric information to be expressed in the form of a biometric template or biometric pattern (alphanumeric code).

In these cases, the captured raw biometric information is technically processed by software so that only certain characteristics or features are extracted from it (such as fragments of the fingerprint sample or points of the facial image, etc.) and saved as a biometric template, called a "vector" or "biometric pattern," which allows for the automated identification of its owner.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 25/93

The Guidelines on the use of facial recognition technologies, issued by the Council of Europe on April 28, 2021 (Guidelines on Facial Recognition, Council of Europe), define a biometric template as "a digital representation of the unique characteristics that have been extracted from a biometric sample and stored in a biometric database."

A biometric template or biometric pattern is a way of writing a human biometric characteristic, such as a face or fingerprint, that is expressed in the form of an alphanumeric code, so that it can be efficiently and effectively interpreted by a machine for a specific purpose or purposes. The biometric template is not intended to be interpreted by a person, like a photograph, but rather to be processed in an automated process, that is, to be efficiently and effectively interpreted by a machine. This form of storage would allow an individual to be identified and actions to be executed automatically, profiling or inferring information about a subject such as attitudes or behavioral patterns, etc.

In other words, the biometric template or pattern is the method of
measuring the "physical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics of a natural person" that are processed to assign a unique identifier to each individual, so that it can be automatically interpreted by the software and hardware devices associated with a biometric identity verification/identification system upon each reading, allowing for automated data comparison and identity verification.

In short, according to Article 4.14 of the GDPR, for processing of personal biometric data to take place, it is necessary, specifically, that a technical process (software or program like the one used in this case) be applied to the raw biometric information collected (digital image of the fingerprint, face, voice recording, etc.) to obtain a "biometric pattern" from the collected samples. Therefore, the biometric pattern or biometric template is truly the personal biometric data referred to in Article 4.14 of the GDPR, since the raw sample of a person's fingerprint or face, iris, voice, etc., does not allow for automated identification.

Consequently, whenever a biometric system is used that processes raw physical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics of individuals to convert them into a biometric pattern or template that can be interpreted by a machine in an automated manner to uniquely verify a person's identity, there is no doubt that personal biometric data is being processed that is subject to the obligations established by the GDPR, being considered a special category and requiring the prior preparation and completion of a DPIA.

- Characteristics and risks of the processing of personal biometric data.

Systems that process personal biometric data use technology that can be truly intrusive and requires a calm ethical and legal debate, as it can have very adverse effects on fundamental values and human integrity. Consider just some of their special characteristics and consider the significant impact they produce when these data are compromised—generating additional risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects—compared to the processing of other types of personal data:

- Biometric systems are closely linked to a person, since they can use a specific unique property of an individual to identify them. Each individual has unique fingerprints that show specific characteristics that can be measured to determine whether a fingerprint matches a registered sample. Therefore, they are unique, permanent, or definitive over time, and the person cannot get rid of them. They cannot be changed at any time, not even with age. Therefore, the damage created in the event of a compromise, loss, or system intrusion is irreparable. Unlike a password, if lost, our fingerprint or face data cannot be changed.

- Furthermore, because biometric data is unique to a person and perpetual, the user can use the same data on different systems.

- While traditional authentication methods such as passwords require a 100% character-by-character match to allow the user to access, for example, an account or application (deterministic methods), biometric methods are called "probabilistic" because they are based on the probability that the user attempting to access a given device or application is the same person as the registered user. We can measure the performance of a biometric system based on three main characteristics. These are: false rejection rate (FRR), false acceptance rate (FAR), and equal error rate (ERR). The false rejection rate represents the probability of detection errors by a biometric system, meaning that it cannot recognize a user whose biometric characteristics are already in the database. In the case of a rejection, the person must verify their identity again. From a security and safety perspective, this rate does not necessarily mean a negative result. Each biometric method, whether facial, fingerprint, palmprint, iris, etc., has different values for different rates based on which a system rejects or accepts entries. Finally, it should be noted that EDPB Opinion 11/2024 of May 23, 2024, on the use of facial recognition to streamline airport passenger flow, recalls and confirms the need to consider the high level of risk that this type of biometric processing entails and emphasizes the need to assess its risks and impact, and in particular, to determine whether there are less intrusive alternative means to achieve the purpose in question (verifying the identity of the students taking the exam in this case), with comments such as the following:

"As a preliminary observation, the Board recalls that the use of biometric data, and in particular facial recognition technology, entails greater risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. It refers to the processing of biometric data to which the special protection under Article 9 of the GDPR. Before using such technologies, even if they are considered particularly effective, controllers must assess the impact on the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects and consider whether less intrusive means can achieve their legitimate processing purposes.

3.2. Special category and high-risk biometric personal data.

As noted, according to Article 4.14 of the GDPR (in conjunction with Article 4.1 of the GDPR), biometric personal data are all data that: (i) relate to the physical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics of a natural person; (ii) are intended to enable or confirm the unique identification of a natural person (including 1-to-1 authentication and 1-to-N identification systems); (iii)
and that they are subject to specific technical processing aimed at enabling or confirming the unique identity of individuals in an automated manner (which results in the generation, archiving, exploitation, and destruction of biometric templates obtained from the raw data samples captured).

After the approval of the current GDPR, and unlike the regime applicable prior to it, whenever biometric personal data is processed in accordance with the definition in Article 4.14 of the GDPR, these will be: (i) considered special category personal data according to Article 9 of the GDPR, the processing of which is generally prohibited unless one of the exceptions regulated in said provision is available; (ii) and the processing of such data will be considered "high risk" according to Article 35 of the GDPR.

It should be kept in mind that technological developments in this area are advancing at a gigantic and unstoppable pace, especially in recent years, as biometric technology can be combined with artificial intelligence techniques. The regulations prior to the current GDPR dated back to 1995, when biometric technologies were not yet applied in the field of personal identification. Therefore, the previous "Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data" made no reference to the concept of biometric data. It only contained a definition of what was considered personal data in Article 2 of the Directive. And since biometric data did not exist at that time, they were not included among the special categories of personal data whose processing was prohibited—with exceptions—by the previous Article 8.
In this sense, it must be taken into account that the approval of the GDPR has represented a paradigm shift in personal data protection that aims to further guarantee citizens control over their personal data, establishing high protection standards adapted to the digital environment in which we live.

That is, whenever personal data of any type is processed, the data controller must comply with the principles and obligations set forth in the data protection regulations for all types of personal data.

However, when the personal data to be processed is biometric data intended for the unique identification of individuals, it should also be considered that—unlike what occurred under the regime prior to the GDPR—since the GDPR came into force on May 25, 2018, pursuant to Article 9, biometric personal data that fall within the definition of Article 4.14 of the GDPR are considered special category personal data as provided for in Article 9 of the GDPR, the processing of which is generally prohibited, unless one of the exceptions provided for in Article 9.2 of the GDPR applies. This does not exempt the data controller from the need to always have a legal basis, as provided for in Article 6 of the GDPR, among many other requirements and principles that must be met by anyone who decides to opt for this type of processing.

Thus, in accordance with Article 9.1 of the GDPR, the processing of biometric data is prohibited when they are: "biometric data intended to uniquely identify a natural person."

It should be emphasized that the classification of biometric data as special category data necessarily implies the observance of special caution by the data controller when determining whether it is possible to carry out data processing of this nature. Among other things, and in addition to the existence of an exception that allows the prohibition of Article 9.1 of the GDPR to be overcome, the existence of a legal basis under Article 6 of the GDPR, and compliance with the principles of the GDPR, the entity intending to implement biometric data systems (in this case, SIDECU) should have previously analyzed the existence of the mandatory criteria of necessity, suitability, and proportionality of the processing.

That is, anyone intending to implement personal data processing of this nature must, first and foremost, ensure that it meets what has been called in case law as the "triple test of proportionality," considering in particular whether the processing of biometric data is suitable, proportional, and, above all, necessary. If other non-biometric systems exist that can achieve the same purpose of effectively and securely identifying and verifying people's identity, it will not be necessary to initiate biometric processing, and therefore, implementing this system will be considered contrary to the GDPR. This judgment should be the starting point for your analysis, as only if these methods pass the aforementioned triple standard will compliance with other requirements or guarantees be required. Furthermore, in addition to being special category data, the processing of biometric data is always considered high-risk under the provisions of Article 35, Section 4, which states that "The supervisory authority shall establish and publish a list of the types of processing operations that require a data protection impact assessment in accordance with Section 1," given that it is included in the List of types of data processing that require a data protection impact assessment, published by the AEPD in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 of the aforementioned Article 35.

There is no doubt about the high-risk nature of biometric data, given that all biometric data intended to uniquely identify a person must be used. A person meets at least two of the three criteria contained in said list, since those corresponding to numbers 4, 5, and 10 of said document apply to them (those that involve the use of special categories of data; the use of biometric data; and those that involve the use of new technologies or innovative use of established technologies).

Therefore, since the entry into force of the GDPR, when processing is "high risk," as is the case with presence or access control methods based on biometric time clocking methods, it is mandatory to always conduct a data impact assessment (DPIA), in accordance with the provisions of Article 35.1 of the GDPR. This DPIA must be carried out prior to the start of processing, but must also be carried out on an ongoing basis. And it will not be enough to carry it out; it must be considered valid because it meets the requirements set forth in the aforementioned article, in particular, that it contains at least the information provided for in Article 35.7 of the GDPR, which states the following:

"The assessment shall include at least:

a) a systematic description of the planned processing operations and the

purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller;

b) an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations with respect to their purpose;

c) an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1; and

d) the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures, and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data, and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other affected persons."

In conclusion, the controller processing biometric personal data must be aware that this processing is classified as high-risk processing, requiring the prior preparation and completion of a DPIA that complies with all the requirements set forth in the aforementioned Article 35 of the GDPR, and that it is processing special category data. Therefore, it must justify that one of the exceptions in Article 9.2 of the GDPR applies before starting or continuing such processing. This will generally apply when using both identification methods based on fingerprint detection systems and those based on facial recognition systems.

3.3. Analysis of the present scenario: processing carried out by the newly implemented time recording system.

3.3.1. Personal data subject to processing.

In the present case, it is proven that the defendant company, SIDECU, is the manager and owner of the Supera gym chain, which has several sports centers located both within Spain and abroad, according to the information recorded in the Diligence of 2-4-25.
In relation to this procedure, a total of 9 complaints have been filed against the implementation of the new facial recognition access method at 5 SUPERA sports centers managed by SIDECU (Entrepuentes in Seville, San Diego in Coruña, La Lanera in Palencia, Palero Superior in Valladolid, and Guadalquivir in Seville), as well as 2 complaints against the system filed by FACUA and an individual.

SIDECU has submitted three written responses to the complaints filed by this Agency, as well as a written response to the request for information made by the inspector during the preliminary investigation phase. It has acknowledged the following facts:

- First, that it has implemented a new access method in five of its sports centers based on facial recognition software developed by \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, and that prior to this system, it implemented an access method based on fingerprint detection, which replaced the previous access method using an identification card. It even states that, following the complaints filed at the Entrepuentes center in Seville, it has implemented an access method based on the presentation of an ID card.

Thus, in its First Response to the transfer of complaints, SIDECU states that:
"Prior to the use of this access system, the sports centers had installed systems that also used complex mathematical algorithms developed by the manufacturer NITGEN, in which the user accessed using their fingerprint, but the system was never able to store it. It was a system similar to the one used currently, but the analysis of the numerical template was performed using the fingerprint instead of facial recognition. (...)

However, the system experienced malfunctions during access (frequent mechanical failures, in any case), which motivated SIDECU to look for another system that was similar and not invasive or intrusive to the rights of users and, in particular, that did not process or store user data.

Thus, various information was obtained about different biometric systems, and SIDECU opted for by the company's system
\*\*\*COMPANY.1 and conducting a risk analysis prior to its acquisition.
According to the manufacturer's detailed explanations,
this system does not store the processed image of the individual as it does in other types of records, and therefore does not process personal data.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 31/93

- In its Second Response, responding to the request for information during the investigation phase, SIDECU provides additional information, stating that: "Currently, the aforementioned facial recognition system is installed in five sports centers, with a total of 36,483 users. One of these centers is Entrepuentes in Seville, which currently has 8,978 users (as of January 4, 2024). Of these users at the Entrepuentes sports center, a total of 26 have expressed their opposition to the access system. SIDECU has enabled an access alternative through identification at the center's reception desk by showing the National Identity Document to the sports center staff and manually opening the access volume."

- According to the records of April 30, 2024, and March 13, 2025, the entity with which the defendant company claims to have contracted the implementation of the new facial recognition access method to sports centers is \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, which has replaced NITGEN's previous fingerprint access method. According to the information published on its website (\*\*\*EMPRESA.1.inc.com/es), it offers biometric readers among its products and specializes in developing and implementing several access methods that use identification techniques based on facial recognition (\*\*\*APP.2 and \*\*\*APP.3), in addition to offering access methods based on fingerprint detection (\*\*\*APP.1), which are compatible with identification cards (RFID cards).

- However, the respondent company has not provided the contracts signed with
\*\*\*COMPANY.1 for the supply of this facial recognition software nor the one previously signed with NITGEN for the fingerprint access system, nor has it provided any supporting documentation in this regard.

The respondent has also not specified the dates of implementation/go-live of each access method at the centers, nor how long they have existed. The life cycle of the processing carried out by the respondent for the purpose of controlling its partners' access to its centers has not been specified.

The respondent also states that it has posted informational posters at the five centers and has provided photographs of them, but does not specify when, and the photographs do not show any date from which it can be deduced when they were distributed at each center.

However, focusing the subject of this procedure on the facial recognition system against which all the complaints and claims that are part of the file have been filed, there is evidence that this new facial recognition system was implemented at least since July-August 2023 and remains in place:

o The 9 complaints and the two complaints were filed with this Agency between 4/8/23 and 16/09/24.

o The company provides the email exchanges with the 9 complainants, in which it is observed that the first emails sent by them in relation to this new system date from

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 32/93

August 2023 onwards.

o The complaint filed by C.C.C. indicates that until
"approximately July 2023," the access procedure to the

Entrepuentes center facilities was through a turnstile
controlled by a magnetic card and a biometric fingerprint recognition system, and that from then on, the
new facial recognition access method was installed without informing
members about its use, so it was used as an
alternative system until the company decided to implement it as a
mandatory method for all members, deactivating the previous methods.

o And on the other hand, the one filed by F.F.F., stating that "At the La Lanera Sports and Leisure Center in Palencia, an access system using a facial biometric analysis system has been implemented

(access by card and fingerprint detection has also been installed for about 10 years). The facial biometric analysis has been performed on users without
informing them at all of the risk of the data they are providing and without
written consent."

- Furthermore, in responding to the request for information made by the inspector (letter dated 1/19/2024), the company states that it has not prepared a Data Processing Impact Assessment, considering that it does not process special-category personal data, and provides the following documents:

o Document No. 3: Event registration sheet for the program
\*\*\*COMPANY.1. Where the following types of data are collected when registering for entry to the center:

DATE/DOOR/DEVICE ID/ENTRY TURNSTONE/GROUP
USER (center between bridges)/USER (numeric codes)/EVENT (all show: 1:N Authentication (Face).

o As document no. 6, a copy of the SIDECU GROUP Processing Activities Record, section 5 of which, regarding the processing of personal data of clients (subscribers), states the purpose of the processing as "managing relationships with clients or potential clients." Biometric data is not mentioned in the section on categories of data processed.

o As document no. 5, it states that it provides the risk analysis performed.

It is a 2-page document, dated 9/2/22 and prepared by SUPERA, entitled "ANALYSIS OF RISKS PRIOR TO A DPIA,” which does not contain a description or purpose of the processing, but rather refers to:

“DATE: 2-9-22
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 33/93

INITIATIVE: Implementation of facial recognition systems by \*\*\*COMPANY.1 for access to SUPERA GROUP sports centers.”
MOTIVATION: Innovation in access systems to SUPERA sports centers as a result of existing security breaches…

PERSONAL DATA SUBJECT TO PROCESSING: NO is marked.
CONCLUSION:

According to the information provided by the manufacturer, the implementation of the facial recognition system manufactured by \*\*\*COMPANY.1 does not entail any processing of personal data for users of the sports centers who access it.
The system generates a template from of the user's image (the first time they access it), which does not associate it with any particular person, but simply analyzes whether or not the accessing user has the right to it.
In particular, the data extracted by \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 readers could not be decrypted or disassembled under any circumstances; only the keys for the algorithm are in the possession of the manufacturer, without storing any information about the user's image.

The facial recognition system also does not connect to the database or list of users at the sports centers at any time.
The certificate issued by the manufacturer for this purpose is included in this report.
Ultimately, no Impact Assessment is necessary, as there is no data processing involved, as it is impossible, under any circumstances, to recover the user's personal image, nor even to deduce specific physical characteristics, nor can the person be identified.
It is agreed to make informational posters available to users informing them about the new system implemented and its features.

As There is no data processing involved, nor can it be considered as special category processing, nor is it appropriate to obtain the user's prior consent. In any case, alternative access options may be made available to users in cases where they refuse to use this system.
Ultimately, it is concluded that the proposed system is not intrusive nor does it violate the rights of sports center users by not processing or storing their personal image or any other data that could identify them.

- The only technical documentation that refers to the characteristics and operation of the facial recognition software contracted with \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 are the certificates repeatedly provided by SIDECU in its four response letters. These are two certificates issued by \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, which bear no date or signature, written in English, and are as follows:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 34/93

1. GDPR compliance certificate, regarding the operation and technical characteristics of the fingerprint detection and facial recognition systems developed by \*\*\*COMPANY.1.

     1. Facial Data Protection Certificate, focusing on the operation and technical characteristics of the system used for facial recognition, whose publication on the \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 website in Spanish has been attached to the procedure by means of an inspector's Diligence, issued on November 2, 2023.

- Finally, the information contained in the response to the CCC's complaint is relevant. In this regard, when addressing the alleged data leak from the \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 database, the respondent reports that it stores the biometric templates on its computer servers: "We inform you that after consulting with the manufacturer and analyzing the implemented systems, it is not possible that any alleged leak has affected the templates corresponding to the users of our sports centers, since they are stored on our own computer servers (equipped with the appropriate security systems), and in no case has the company that supplies the biometric access equipment been able to access the templates." have access
to them."

Once all the data that the respondent and the complainants have provided regarding the implementation of the new access method to these sports centers has been presented, the

main controversial issue in the procedure lies in determining the
legal nature of the data processed by the facial recognition software
\*\*\*COMPANY.1 (\*\*\*APP.2/\*\*\*APP.3) used to identify the members who currently access the respondent's 5 sports centers.

In the four documents submitted to this Agency and in all the responses to the member complaints submitted to this procedure, SIDECU denies that the facial recognition software currently used to grant access to its members processes special-category personal biometric data, or even that it processes personal data of any kind, based on the following argument:

- In its first response to the transfer of the first three complaints submitted to this Agency, SIDECU explains why it believes that "as explained by the manufacturer," the facial recognition software \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 does not process special-category biometric data, nor personal data, and therefore believes that it poses no risk, and that the requirements set forth in the personal data protection regulations should not be met. In literal terms:

"While it is true that the user registration documentation does not include authorization for the collection of personal data related to the use of biometric or special category data, this is because, given the operating characteristics of the access system, not only is the user's image not saved by SIDECU, S.A. as the data controller, but no personal data is retained, as the template generated by the system does not allow association with any specific person.

As the Spanish Data Protection Agency stated in its Report 36/2020, this is not considered special category data processing, as it does not, under any circumstances, uniquely identify a natural person.

SUPERA CENTERS only access records. entry and

exit and presence at the facilities, obtaining exclusively
information corresponding to the hours and number of people, but not their personal identification.

Likewise, the second paragraph of Article 4 of the GDPR states that "data processing" shall be understood as: "Any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or
modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission,
dissemination or any other form of enabling access, comparison or
interconnection, restriction, deletion, or destruction." For this reason, the case at hand cannot be considered as personal data processing, as it does not fall within the category of such data.
We reiterate that, based on the templates, it is not possible, under any circumstances, to
recover the user's personal image or even deduce specific physical characteristics.
Therefore, there is no processing of personal data.
" The generation of templates using the complex mathematical algorithms developed by \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 does not allow the system to save the image or associate the generated template with specific users. Therefore, data processing cannot occur if the users are not subject to any of the operations described in the aforementioned article.

The operation of this system is not covered by the aforementioned article of the GDPR, since, under no circumstances, can a mere access control system that does not process any personal data be subject to compliance with the provisions of data protection regulations.

This system does not collect or store any data, nor does it allow for the identification of individuals. Consequently, and since no personal data was processed, the content of the regulations regarding the protection of personal data is not applicable, nor is the obligation to notify of data processing. For this reason, our entity has not previously requested your consent to use your image because, as we indicated, it is not processed or stored under any circumstances.

- In the letter of January 19, 2024, responding to the request for information made during the investigation phase, when describing the technical operation of the program, it is emphasized that the system does not store the image, and it is noted that the NIR algorithm patented by the manufacturer obtains a "numeric model that functions as a key specific to each user for the purpose of accessing the facilities" and a "template that functions as an alphanumeric key," without being aware that this is the biometric template that is considered the true personal biometric data, rather than the image.

However, contrary to what the defendant maintains, what can actually be deduced from the manufacturer's technical documentation is that the facial recognition software developed by \*\*\*COMPANY.1 processes personal biometric data considered to be of a special category by Article 9.1. of the GDPR.

It should be noted that the manufacturer's certificates, which are written in English, describe a common biometric processing system, which applies an algorithm that generates biometric templates and stores them, without storing the images from which the sample is taken, and other cryptographic tools that subsequently encrypt the members' biometric templates. However, in no case does it state in these certificates that the system does not process personal data of any kind, as the respondent alleges.
In view of the two certificates provided, there is no doubt that by using the facial recognition software developed by \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 as a method of identifying members who enter and leave the facilities of its sports centers, SIDECU is processing the personal biometric data of the members who use this access method, since the three requirements established in Article 4.14 of the GDPR are met:

1. First, the data that The program used to perform identity checks is based on the physical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics of a natural person.

The defendant company itself acknowledges that it was using a program for some time as a method of identifying people who access its sports centers based on reading members' fingerprints.

Later, and in response to the malfunctions detected, it contracted and implemented an access method for 5 of its sports centers based on facial recognition, which requires reading members' faces in order to identify them and allow them access. Therefore, there is no doubt that both methods, the previous and the current one, process personal data based on the biological characteristics of members.

Focusing on the current facial recognition system, the implementation of which has been the subject of the complaints that gave rise to this procedure, SUPERA's facial data protection certificate leaves no room for doubt, as we will see later when transcribing it, that the system obtains a facial pattern from a sample that is obtained from the points at the ends of the face.

2. Secondly, the documentation provided also shows that the
purpose of the facial recognition system (like the previous fingerprint/magnetic card systems) is "the identification of members entering

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 37/93

/leaving the sports centers in order to allow them access"
(or, in other words, in the words of Article 9 of the GDPR, the unique
identification of members).

In the present case, in responding to the investigation request, SIDECU

states that the software used to perform facial recognition is
based on a 1-to-many (1-N) identification system, so there is
no doubt that it was intended to uniquely identify members who
have access to the club.

And when describing the operation of \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, it points out that: "the system

analyzes specific points of the individual's image and creates a numerical model
that functions as a unique key for each user for access
to the facilities." And "Thus, the subsequent process of identifying the person
consists of the user standing in front of the facial recognition system,
creating a new template that is compared with those already stored.

If this operation generates a positive result, the user is considered
correctly identified and is granted access to the sports center."

This can also be deduced from document No. 3, which was provided by the company
along with the aforementioned document: Event log sheet for the program
\*\*\*EMPRESA.1. It shows the types of data captured when

registering entry to the center, where the event recorded in
all cases is: 1:N Authentication (Face). As well as the identification process described in the manufacturer's certificates, which will be
referred to below.

3. Third, because the facial recognition software (\*\*\*APP.2/\*\*\*APP.3)

of \*\*\*COMPANY.1, which has been contracted to serve as an identification method
for members who access its sports centers, performs technical processing of the raw images obtained from the members (photographs of their faces), extracting facial data points from the raw images and creating a biometric template or facial pattern from this data. This facial pattern is generated and stored to perform each reading or identity verification that is performed each time the member enters and exits the center using the facial recognition devices installed by the company.

This is clearly deduced from the manufacturer's technical documentation, in which \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 certifies that the software used generates a biometric template or pattern in the form of an identification code for each member, which is encrypted and stored:

o On the one hand, the "GDPR Compliance Statement" issued by \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 expressly states that during the registration process, a face/fingerprint template is generated, which is not directly saved on the server or on the device. Rather, the template is created and encrypted using a different algorithm depending on where it will be stored (on the server, device, or smartcard), which are the different means that the manufacturer allows, according to the services offered on its website, according to the Diligence issued in this procedure.

(…) Each element of sensitive data handled by the \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 system is protected by the following mechanisms:

- Fingerprint/Face templates: During the enrollment process, the raw image of the fingerprint/face is never stored on the device or server.
Instead, a template is created, which is also encrypted by 128-bit AES,
256-bit AES, DES/3DES, depending on the location where it is stored (Device, Server, SmartCard).

(Translation into Spanish by this Agency):

“Each element of sensitive data handled by the \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 system is protected by the following mechanisms:
- Fingerprint/face templates:
During the enrollment process, the raw fingerprint/face image is never stored on the device or server. Instead, a template is created, which is also encrypted by 128-bit AES, 256-bit AES, DES/3DES, depending on the location where it is stored (Device, Server, SmartCard).

And, on the other hand, the “Face data protection certificate” details exactly how the process of generating and storing the facial pattern or template occurs, as well as the comparison process performed to verify identity:

The original version provided indicates that:
“\*\*\*EMPRESA.1 Inc. (hereafter \*\*\*EMPRESA.1), certify that
\*\*\*EMPRESA.1 \*\*\*APP.2 extracts the face data points from the raw
               images and create a template from this data and does not keep the raw

               images in the device.
               The face template is not a raw image. It is created by using
               \*\*\*EMPRESA.1’s patented NIR technology and algorithm, and the face
               template is a dataset which is a fusion of 2D and 3D feature of a user's
               face which is acquired by a visual camera and NIR camera. In order to
               secure this template, cryptographic tools and encryption methods are

               used such as 256bit AES encryption making it very difficult to access the
               necessary data to reverse engineer the process. The ability to
               reduplicate the original image and prove the identity via a face
               recognition expert is not possible.
               \*\*\*APP.2 also calculates a matching score when executing an
               authentication. The matching score is a calculation of the match

               between a pre-registered face template and the actual face to be
               authenticated. The matching score helps protect \*\*\*APP.2 against
               spoofing. \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 also certifies that FAR(False Acceptance
               Rate) and FRR(False Rejection Rate) in face recognition algorithm in
               \*\*\*APP.2 are as below.

▶ FRR: Less than or equal to 1% ▶ FAR: Less than or equal to 0.00002% (1/5,000,000.”

By diligence of the inspector dated December 12, 2023, the Spanish version of this same certificate published on the website of \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, which coincides with the one provided by the respondent, is reflected in English:

“\*\*\*EMPRESA.1 Inc., (hereinafter \*\*\*EMPRESA.1), certifies that

\*\*\*EMPRESA.1 Face Station 2 and \*\*\*APP.3 extract facial data points from raw images and create a template from this data.
The face template is not a raw image. It is created using the technology and \*\*\*APP.1's patented NIR algorithm. The face template

is a dataset obtained by merging the ZD and 3D features of a user's face, acquired through
a visual camera and an NIR camera... To secure this template,
cryptographic tools and encryption methods are used, such as
256-bit AES, making it difficult to access the data needed to reverse engineer the process. The ability to duplicate the

original image and then attempt to authenticate by impersonating a user in expert facial recognition is not possible.
\*\*\*APP.2 and \*\*\*APP.3 also calculate a match score when
performing an authentication. The match score is a calculation
between a previously registered face template and the current face that

is intended to be authenticated.(...)
\*\*\*APP.1 also certifies that the FAR (False Acceptance Rate) and FRR (False Acceptance Rate) are the same as the actual face that is being authenticated. of
False Rejection Rate (FAR) in the facial recognition algorithm in \*\*\*APP.2 and \*\*\*APP.3 are as follows:

FRR: Less than or equal to 196 — FAR; Less than: equal to 0.00002%
(1/5,000,000)(…)”

In view of the evidence provided, there is no doubt that the respondent has
misinterpreted the technical documentation or instructions from the manufacturer

of the facial recognition software, as well as the content of report number
0036/2020 from the legal department of this Agency, which it cites in its responses, which
was issued in relation to file E/05454/2021 dated July 27, 2021, in connection with a consultation on the use of biometric data by universities and educational institutions (facial recognition as a

method of student assessment), conducting an analysis of the concept and some of the special category biometric data requirements of Article 9.1 of the GDPR that had been the subject of consultation.

In light of the statements made, it is observed that the defendant has

concluded that this software does not process special-category biometric data, because it is based on several erroneous premises:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 40/93

- First, by understanding that the personal biometric data (special-category) referred to in Article 4.14 of the GDPR is only the image of the face of members or subscribers, instead of also considering the biometric template or facial pattern generated by the program.

The company's argument has been based primarily on the understanding that
the personal biometric data referred to in Article 4.14 of the GDPR is the
raw facial image (raw biometric information), and not the
biometric template (facial pattern extracted from several points in the facial image).

Therefore, since the images are not stored, it considers that it is not processing special-category biometric data. It is precisely the other way around, since, as already explained in Legal Basis 3.1, it is the facial template/pattern that is the special-category biometric data, and
not the image (or the fragments taken from it).

To argue that \*\*\*COMPANY.1 does not process personal biometric data, the respondent describes the operation of the program without realizing that it is describing a biometric processing system that generates, stores, and uses a biometric template to identify members entering its center, which complies with the three characteristics and requirements of Article 4.14 of the GDPR (and therefore, Article 9.1 of the GDPR).

Therefore, as clarified in section 3.1 of this agreement, whenever a system is used that generates this facial pattern or biometric template used to verify the identity of people entering/exiting a facility, the requirements of Article 4.14 of the GDPR and Article 9.1 of the GDPR will be met, which is the case in this case.

- Secondly, it mistakenly understands that the alphanumeric code generated by the system (facial template or pattern) is not personal data according to the definition in Article 4.1 of the GDPR, since "from the templates it is not possible, under any circumstances, to recover the user's personal image or even deduce specific physical characteristics."

The respondent states that: "According to the information provided to us by the manufacturer, a model is created with the NIR algorithm, patented by this manufacturer, which uses complex mathematical algorithms, generating a numerical model using information from any of the capture points. At no time can physical characteristics of the person be deduced from this model. (...) Likewise, from the templates it is not possible, under any circumstances, to recover the user's personal image or even deduce specific physical characteristics. Therefore, there is no processing of personal data."

However, as stated above, the fact that the fingerprint image (raw biometric information) cannot be reconstructed from the sample captured by the devices to generate the biometric pattern is common in biometric data processing systems, as is the fact that the complete original images cannot be stored. However, this does not imply that: (i) personal biometric data is not processed, since a biometric pattern is generated and stored, even if the facial image is not stored; (ii) nor does it imply that the identity of the face holder cannot be deciphered, as the defendant alleges, since the biometric pattern allows

an individual to be identified and verified as being them and only them, through "elements of physical, physiological, genetic, and psychological identity" that manifest themselves
in the form of an alphanumeric code, and this code can be deciphered by an automated system, without the need for the sample or raw fingerprint data.

What the defendant argues is necessary in traditional systems of
manual or in-person verification performed person-to-person (for example,
through the verification of their ID by company personnel), in which
it is necessary to compare images, so it would be necessary to know the person's
physical characteristics to verify their identity by another person. But this is not necessary in the case of automated biometric systems, since the devices (machines) responsible for verifying identity do not analyze images, but rather the codes obtained by previously processing these images.

Therefore, we said that it is completely irrelevant that this numerical code cannot be reversed to obtain the image of the person to whom it belongs, since the system does not need the image to determine who has accessed the center. This code, which is the template, allows the person to be identified "indirectly" (by checking which member each code belongs to), so it is undoubtedly personal data for the purposes of Article 4.1 of the GDPR, in addition to being a special category of personal biometric data, as already stated.

Thirdly, the argument that the biometric template is encrypted as a motivation to justify that the encrypted numerical code is not personal data is also invalid.

Finally, the defendant states, arguing that there is no processing of personal data, that: "Consequently, based on the technical information provided by the manufacturer, it was concluded that the installation of these systems in the SUPERA CENTERS did not pose any risk to the processing of users' personal data, given that the data extracted by the readers of \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 could not be decrypted or dismantled under any circumstances. The manufacturer only possessed the keys for the algorithm, without storing any information about the users' images."

Later, it will be noted that it is not true that the processing of personal biometric data contained in the templates obtained from the program does not pose risks due to the fact that encryption measures were applied, as stated in the company's certificates.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 42/93

At this point, it should be clarified that the encryption processes applied by the defendant: (i) are not performed using the NIR algorithm, which generates the template, but rather, according to the "facial data protection certificate" of \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, they are

performed using cryptographic tools and encryption methods such as 256-bit AES encryption; (ii) they are applied after the template has been created and, based on it, they encrypt the personal biometric data; (iii) it is not true
that the encryption prevents the original image from being duplicated, but rather the NIR algorithm applied does so, with the subsequent encryption being an additional security measure that makes it difficult to access the data necessary to reverse engineer the process.

But, in any case, even if the biometric template is encrypted so that it cannot be read by unauthorized third parties who could access the data without authorization, it will always be readable and intelligible by the data controller's systems.

The data controller will have the decryption key and will use it each time someone enters or leaves the center to determine which person each biometric template is associated with each time the identity verification process is performed. Therefore, the encrypted biometric template that is stored is always, and without a doubt, special-category biometric personal data. The encryption process does not change its legal nature.

In conclusion, from all of the above, it can be deduced that there is no doubt that the defendant has been processing personal biometric data that falls within the definition of Article 4.14 of the GDPR, since: (i) the software is based on the physical characteristics of members (a facial image, from which it extracts a sample);
(ii) it technically processes them to convert them into a facial pattern (biometric template), which is a unique identifying code for each member that is encrypted and stored in the system; (iii) the biometric pattern is generated and used to identify each member using the facial recognition devices installed when they enter or leave the center.
Consequently, it can be considered that the facial recognition access method used by the respondent processes personal biometric data classified as special category data under Article 9.1 of the GDPR. And if the previous fingerprint access method contracted with NITGEN met these requirements, which is highly likely (generating a template or numeric code based on the sample of members' fingerprint fragments used to identify members entering the center), there is no doubt that, by implementing this system, the respondent would also have been processing special category biometric data.

3.3.2. Regarding the biometric data processing operations included in the center's access system.

Article 4.2 of the GDPR defines “personal data processing” as: “any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, dissemination or any other form of making available, alignment or interconnection, restriction, erasure or destruction.”

It should also be clarified that the concept of processing operations provided for in Article 4.2 of the GDPR includes:

The material processing of personal data, which, when technically processed

through a program or software, consists of different processes such as data collection, recording, storage, and its exploitation or use, its

transfer, deletion, or blocking, etc.

Thus, the proceedings show that the defendant company has begun to

identify its members through this facial recognition system in 5 sports centers, implementing this as the only mandatory access method to them,
approximately since July-August 2023. It has provided, as document 3,

the record sheet for a specific day that proves that it collected the samples (without storing them) and generated templates for each member who has agreed to use it. It has registered them in the system, stored them, and used them upon each entry and exit from the center, according to what it states when it notes that the program records the entry and exit times.

The design of the processing itself is also considered a processing operation that must be subject to the Principles and obligations set forth in the GDPR. This is because, according to the European Data Protection Board (GDPR) in its Guidelines 7/2020 on controllers and processors of July 7, 2021, and the Court of Justice of the European Union (in judgments such as that of October 5, 2023, C-659/2022), Article 4.2 of the GDPR establishes a broad concept of personal data processing. This broad concept begins with the design of the processing, from which the obligations to respect the data protection principles and other obligations provided for in the GDPR arise. According to the above, the implementation of the facial recognition system

developed by \*\*\*COMPANY.1 involved the processing of personal data by SIDECU, which is not reflected in the RAT provided by the company. The purpose of this RAT was to enable members to enter and exit the 5 sports centers indicated by the company.

The RAT consisted of several processing operations on a set of different personal data, including the facial pattern of the individuals who could be granted access (members/subscribers registered in the system).
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 44/93

This processing should have been reflected in the RAT, and since it was considered high risk, it should have been preceded by a rigorous analysis of the necessity, suitability, and proportionality of this new access method compared to other less intrusive alternatives, and a rigorous risk analysis. If the risk was considered acceptable and the processing necessary, suitable, and proportional, a single DPIA should have been prepared for the processing that includes and assesses all the access methods applicable in the centers. This DPIA should have met the requirements set forth in Article 35 of the GDPR, but all serve the same purpose and are part of a single processing operation. A prior and joint DPIA should have complied with the minimum content set forth in said article.

And since it includes personal biometric data, which are considered special categories and whose processing is generally prohibited by Article 9.1 of the GDPR, the implementation of this access method using facial recognition also required the company to ensure in advance that an exception existed, as provided for in Article 9.2 of the GDPR, which would allow this type of processing.

3.3.3. Regarding the data controller.

Regarding liability, Article 4.7 of the GDPR defines: “7)

"controller" or "controller": the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing; if Union or Member State law determines the purposes and means of processing, the controller or the specific criteria for its appointment may be laid down by Union or Member State law.”

Although it is stated that the development of the program was contracted to \*\*\*COMPANY.1,
no data processing contract is provided to prove that this

entity acted as the data processor, as can be deduced from the statements made by the respondent.

However, even if it were proven that \*\*\*COMPANY.1 acted as the data controller of the personal data obtained, in view of the privacy policy completed in this procedure and the company's general terms and conditions attached to the registration form submitted with one of the claims, there is no doubt that SIDECU acted at all times as the data controller, since it is the party that decided to contract this system, thereby determining the purposes and means of the processing.

All of this determines that SIDECU is the data controller for the purposes provided for in Article 4.7 of the GDPR, and, consequently, the alleged data controller

against whom this sanctioning procedure should be directed to determine whether the processing implemented by it breached any of the GDPR obligations classified as an infringement, in accordance with the provisions of

Article 70.1 a) of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the protection of personal data and the guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPPDD), which provides as follows:

"Article 70. Data controllers.

1. The following are subject to the sanctioning regime established in Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 and in this Organic Law: a) Data controllers.

b) Data processors. c) Representatives
of data controllers or data processors not established in the territory of the European Union. d) Certification bodies. e) The
accredited bodies supervising codes of conduct. (…)”.

IV. Breached obligation. Regarding the failure to have an exception to Article 9.2 of the GDPR that enables the processing of special category data.

4.1. Biometric data as special category data: general prohibition and processing exceptions.

Article 4.14 of the GDPR defines biometric data as “personal data obtained from specific technical processing, relating to the physical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that person, such as facial images or fingerprint data.”

According to the definition given in Article 4.14 of the GDPR, biometric data processed by these systems will be considered personal data provided that the purpose of the processing is the identification or authentication of a person, within the meaning of Article 4.1 of the GDPR.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 46/93

As previously stated, there is no doubt that both the minutiae (fingerprints) and the facial patterns extracted from the image of a person's face to uniquely identify those authorized to access a facility are personal biometric data, since the purpose of the implemented system is to determine the identity, directly or indirectly, of the persons authorized to access the facility, recording, where appropriate, the entry and exit times, as is the case here. Every time the process assigns a numerical identifier (the biometric template obtained by collecting data from the interested parties' faces), it allows an individual to be identified and distinguished from others through "elements specific to their physical, physiological, genetic, and psychological identity."

It should also be noted that—unlike under the regime prior to the GDPR—this type of biometric data is considered special category personal data in Article 9, the processing of which is generally prohibited, unless one of the exceptions provided for in Article 9.2 of the GDPR applies. This does not exempt the need to always have a legal basis provided for in Article 6 of the GDPR, among many other requirements and principles that must be met by anyone who decides to opt for this type of processing.

According to Article 9.1 of the GDPR, the processing of biometric data is prohibited when they are: "biometric data intended to uniquely identify a natural person."

In this context, since biometric data is a special category of data, the GDPR imposes an additional obligation on the data controller, who will also be required to verify and certify that one of the exceptions provided for in Article 9.2 of the GDPR or other specific legislation applies before initiating the processing of any biometric data. This applies to the present case, in which biometric timekeeping was provided for as a general timekeeping method based on facial recognition of employees.

It should be noted that, since the processing of biometric data is generally prohibited, any exception to this prohibition must be subject to a restrictive interpretation, as can be deduced from recitals 51 and 52 of the GDPR.
Thus, the exceptions that could possibly allow the lifting of the general prohibition on processing biometric data intended to identify or verify the identity of natural persons are those provided for in Article 9.2. of the GDPR, with the following wording, which should be interpreted restrictively, always in favor of protecting the rights and freedoms of citizens in case of doubt:

“2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply where one of the following circumstances applies:

a) the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of such personal data for one or more of the specified purposes, except where Union or Member State law provides that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 cannot be waived by the data subject;”
b) processing is necessary for the performance of obligations and the exercise of specific rights of the controller or the data subject in the field of labor law and social security and protection, to the extent that Union or Member State law so authorizes. (c) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, if the data subject is not physically or legally capable of giving consent;

(d) the processing is carried out, within the scope of its legitimate activities and with appropriate safeguards, by a foundation, association, or other non-profit organization whose purpose is political, philosophical, religious, or trade union, provided that the processing concerns exclusively current or former members of such organizations or persons who maintain regular contact with them in connection with their purposes, and provided that the personal data are not disclosed outside them without the consent of the data subjects;

(e) the processing concerns personal data that the data subject has manifestly made public;

(f) the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or when courts act in their judicial exercise;

(g) processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, based on Union or Member State law, which must be proportionate to the objective pursued, respect in substance the right to data protection, and lay down appropriate and specific measures to protect the fundamental interests and rights of the data subject;

(h) processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, assessment of an employee's ability to work, medical diagnosis, provision of healthcare or social care or treatment, or management of healthcare and social care systems and services, based on Union or Member State law or pursuant to a contract with a healthcare professional and without prejudice to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 3; (i) processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the field of public health, such as protection against serious cross-border threats to health, or to ensure high levels of quality and safety of healthcare and medicinal products or medical devices, on the basis of Union or Member State law which lays down appropriate and specific measures to protect the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in particular professional secrecy. (j) processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, in accordance with Article 89(1), on the basis of Union or Member State law, which must be proportionate to the objective pursued, respect in substance the right to data protection, and provide for appropriate and specific measures to protect the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject.

Therefore, if the controller does not prove that its processing falls within any of these exceptions, it will infringe Article 9 of the GDPR by initiating prohibited processing.

4.2. Analysis of the present case.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 48/93

In the present case, it is proven that SIDECU has processed special category personal biometric data, implementing a new access method as mandatory, at least between July and August 2023. to 5 of its sports centers
using facial recognition based on the software \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, which generates,
stores, and uses the facial biometric pattern of the samples obtained from the facial images of members who accessed the centers, a method that is still used today. Prior to this system, a fingerprint access system was implemented, which also involves the processing of special-category personal biometric data.

According to the above, in order to process data derived from the use of a biometric system used as a method of identifying individuals, the data controller
must ensure that, in addition to having a lawful basis under Article 6 of the GDPR, there is also an exception under Article 9.2 of the GDPR, which lifts the general prohibition on processing special-category data provided for in Article 9.1 of the GDPR. Furthermore, only if one of these exceptions exists that enables the controller to carry out the processing, the controller must then The data controller must consider the lawful basis for this, since, otherwise, the processing of this data would be prohibited by Article 9.1 of the GDPR.

It should be clarified that it is not a disputed issue that the respondent company has a lawful basis provided for in Article 6.1 of the GDPR that authorizes it to process personal data for the purpose of controlling access of individuals to its sports centers.

In the present case, the RAT provided by the respondent made no reference to processing consisting of access control for club members, so it does not state what lawful basis the respondent company relies on to carry out the processing of personal data that this involves. Nor has a DPIA been completed specifying this, as the respondent erroneously believed that it was under no obligation to do so.

The lack of accreditation of this will then be assessed. an exception that
enables the processing of this data in accordance with Article 9.2 of the GDPR. However, regarding the legal basis, the truth is that in this case, an administrative violation of Article 6.1 of the GDPR cannot be imputed, since although the responsible company has not stated in writing what legal basis authorizes it to process members' personal data to control access to its centers, in order to assess whether there is a violation of Article 6 of the GDPR, the main thing is to verify that a legal basis actually exists, even if the controller has not correctly determined it or included it in the DPIA.

And in this case, it can be established that, from the outset, there is a legal basis that authorizes the respondent to process personal data in general (not for biometric data, as this implies that an exception to Article 9 must also apply). Specifically, the one referred to in Article 6.1.b), which It states that: "the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the implementation, at the request of the data subject, of pre-contractual measures." Since the signing of the registration form and the acceptance of the general conditions and internal rules by the members, in the terms completed by the inspector, constitutes the creation of a contractual relationship between the member and the sports center, which is governed by these rules. Therefore, a violation of Article 6 of the GDPR cannot initially be attributed.

However, despite the existence of a legal basis, it must be made clear that this legal basis legitimized the respondent to process personal data other than biometric data, such as those commonly required for access by other means, such as identification cards or the presentation of a national identity document (personal data). However, it did not, under any circumstances, legitimize the initiation of biometric processing of the facial pattern or the details of the fingerprint, if there was also no exception to Article 9.2 that would allow it to lift the prohibition on processing biometric data.

Therefore, there is no doubt that the initiation of this processing was conditioned on the prior occurrence of an exception under Article 9.2 of the GDPR, although the defendant has not alleged any exception in its documentation and writings, since it denies processing special-category personal biometric data, mistakenly believing that the biometric template or facial pattern used to perform the identification is not personal data, but rather a numerical code through which the person's identity cannot be determined. Legal Basis III has indicated the reasons why this argument is considered to be inconsistent with the law.

It should be noted that the definition of special-category biometric data is contained in the GDPR and must be known to data controllers. Although there are no mandatory guidelines or guides interpreting the content of the rules provided in the GDPR for them to be considered mandatory for data controllers, various Guidelines and Guides of the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter, EDPB) have been approved that data controllers should be aware of. These guidelines specify that the biometric template used to uniquely identify individuals is a special category of biometric data.

However, unlike the legal basis of Article 6 of the GDPR, the documentation provided cannot infer the existence of an exception to Article 9.2 of the GDPR that may be appropriate for the purpose and type of processing at hand. Specifically, it should be noted that, a priori and without prejudice to what may be inferred during the investigation, the following exceptions can be ruled out in the present case:

 On the one hand, the application of the exception to consent provided for in Article 9.2.a) of the GDPR cannot be considered.

Article 4.11 of the GDPR refers to the consent of the data subject as "any
freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of his or her wishes by which the data subject, whether by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, agrees to the processing of personal data relating to him or her."

Therefore, to be considered a valid exception, consent to process special category biometric data must be free,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 50/93

specific, informed, and unequivocal, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 7
of the GDPR and 6 of the LOPDGDD.

- Specific because it expressly refers to the processing of special category biometric data.
- Unequivocal because it leaves no room for doubt and is understandable.
- Informed because it provides the data subject with prior information required by Article 13 of the GDPR, and any information that makes data subjects aware of the risks of such processing (Recital

39 of the GDPR), especially when it affects people in a vulnerable situation.
- And for consent to an access method that involves the processing of biometric data to be considered free, the data controller must establish an alternative method to perform access control, without any consequences for the person who does not wish to use access control through biometric data processing.

In the present case, the respondent acknowledges from its first response that it is not obtaining members' consent to collect their personal biometric data, in the following terms: "Although it is true that the user registration documentation does not include authorization for the collection of personal data related to the use of biometric data or special categories, this is because, given the characteristics of the operation of the access system, not only is the image of the users not saved by SIDECU, S.A. as the theoretical data controller,

but no personal data is retained, since the template generated by the system does not allow association with any specific person (...)".

Furthermore, this version is corroborated by the content of the registration form
signed by the members, which was provided by one of the complainants.

It constitutes a simple contractual document in which the member accepts the
conditions of membership, access, and permanence that must be signed in order to
acquire membership status. The content of the document was extracted and completed by the inspector of the procedure. By accepting the general conditions, the member agrees to a data protection clause that refers to the processing of personal data, in which there is no mention of consent to the
processing of special category biometric data for the purpose of controlling
members' access to the centers.

Thus, as stated in the second point of the preliminary investigation report dated June 21, 2024:

“The registration document (administration and reception procedure at the centers), the center registration form, contains the personal data of the new member (name and surname, ID number, date of birth, address, telephone numbers, email, bank details) and provides the following information:

“By signing this document, I affirm that I have read and accept the data protection conditions,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 51/93

□ You expressly consent and authorize SIDECU, S.A. process the data you have provided to conduct statistical studies in order to periodically offer you information about products, activities, services, and commercial promotional and/or marketing actions related to providers of transportation, sports, insurance, real estate, financial, and banking services, in order to provide information about their products or services and make commercial offers, including through electronic means.

This registration document contains several links, one of which is "Data Protection," which has been verified to provide the following information:

"PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING RESPONSIBILITY CLAUSE.

The data you provide in order to carry out the purpose of this contract will be incorporated into the databases owned by

SIDECU, S.A., which will act as the Data Controller.

The personal and medical data related to your health that you may provide, for the purpose of properly providing the services you request at any time, will be used solely and exclusively for the purposes of fulfilling the purpose of this contract and, in particular, for the following purposes: customer management, rewarding customer loyalty, keeping you informed (sending newsletters) by any means (electronic or otherwise) of offers for products and/or services and/or promotions related to the activities of this contract and the corporate purpose of SIDECU, S.A.

The data provided will be retained and processed by SIDECU, S.A.
for the duration of the contractual relationship, as long as its deletion is not requested, and, in any case, until the expiration of the legally required deadlines."

The "General Conditions" link does not contain data protection information. The Internal Regulations link, which varies for each center, contains the following data protection information:

"1.8. For the purposes of Organic Law 15/1999 of December 13, on official data protection, by registering at the facility, you authorize the use of your personal data and its computer processing for the management of the facility and, where applicable, the sending of commercial information related to the management of the Center."

Therefore, there is no doubt that the exception of Article 9.2.a) of the GDPR does not apply, since: (i) in addition to the fact that it has been acknowledged that specific, unequivocal, and informed consent was not being obtained for the processing of biometric data, (ii) there is evidence that the use of this access method using facial recognition was imposed on members as the sole and mandatory method between July and August 2023, not allowing the use of alternative means. This generated, according to the respondent, a total of 26 complaints at the Entrepuentes center alone, and the filing of a total of 9 complaints from members of 5 sports centers and 2 complaints before this Agency. Therefore, there is evidence that there was no free consent from members to the use of this method. This situation, which the respondent claims to have corrected at the Entrepuentes center after receiving several complaints from members, installing a new access method based on the presentation of ID. which, on the other hand, has not been proven.

 Furthermore, it should also be clarified in advance that, in view of the

evidence included in the procedure and the statements of the respondent, the exception of 9.2.g) of the GDPR, referring to the existence of an essential public interest, does not apply in this case.

The Guide approved by this Agency on presence control processing using biometric systems analyzes the application of some of the exceptions provided for in Article 9.2 for cases such as the present one, in which the processing is intended to control access of persons to public or private premises.
It is noted that in these cases, neither the need to execute a contract (the contractual relationship provided for is not an exception to Article 9.2 of the GDPR, but rather a basis for lawfulness) nor the legitimate interest exception of Article 9.2.g) of the GDPR may be claimed, as this is not "a processing" that it is necessary for reasons of essential public interest, based on Union or Member State law, which must be proportionate to the objective pursued, respect in essence the right to data protection, and establish appropriate and specific measures to protect the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject.”

Thus, the Guide expressly states that:

“The prohibition on processing special category data may only be exempted when one of the circumstances specified in Article 9.2 of the GDPR applies. The controller has the

obligation to seriously and diligently assess whether there is a compelling reason
to process special categories listed in Article 9.2 of the GDPR.

The listed circumstances do not include legitimate interest, the
performance of a contract, or pre-contractual measures.

In the second section of report 0036/2020 of May 8, 2020, issued by the Legal Department of this Agency (to which the respondent refers), some general considerations are made regarding when the exception of Article 9.2.g) of the GDPR applies in the case of processing special category biometric data.

It expressly states that in order to process special category biometric data under this provision, the following is required: (i) there is a public interest (and not the private interest of ensuring that only members who have paid their dues can access the premises), (ii) the public interest must also be essential, (iii) this essential public interest must be provided for in a law; That is, the law must also specify

the essential public interest that justifies restricting the right to protection of personal data and under what circumstances it may be limited. The imposition of a public interest is not sufficient for these purposes. Said law must also establish appropriate technical, organizational, and procedural guarantees.

Specifically, this report analyzes the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court and points out, among other aspects, the following:
 "However, in the case of special categories of data, the
assumption contemplated in letter g) of Article 9.2. does not refer only to the
existence of a public interest, as it does in many other provisions of the GDPR, but is the only provision of the GDPR that requires
that it be "essential," an adjective that qualifies said public interest, given the importance and need for greater protection of
the data processed. Regarding what should be understood by essential public interest, the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights must also be taken into account, which, under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, has considered that the processing of personal data constitutes a lawful interference with the right to respect for private life and may only be carried out if it is carried out in a compliance with the law, serves a legitimate purpose, respects the essence of fundamental rights and freedoms, and is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to achieve a legitimate aim (D.L. v. Bulgaria, no. 7472/14, May 19, 2016; Dragojević v. Croatia, no. 68955/11, January 15, 2015; Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, January 28, 2003; Leander v. Sweden, no. 9248/81, March 26, 1987, among others). (…)”

“According to consistent constitutional doctrine, the legal reservation is not limited

to requiring that a law enable the restrictive measure of fundamental rights,
but it is also necessary, in accordance with requirements sometimes called normative predetermination and sometimes the quality of the law, as well as respect for the essential content of the law, that in this regulation the legislator, who is primarily obliged to weigh the rights or interests in conflict, predetermine the circumstances, conditions, and guarantees under which the adoption of measures restricting fundamental rights is appropriate (...)".

 "Consequently, the processing of biometric data under Article 9.2.g) requires that it be provided for in a European or national law. In the latter case, said law must, according to the aforementioned constitutional doctrine and the provisions of Article 9.2 of the LOPDGDD, have the status of law. Said law must also specify the essential public interest that justifies the restriction of the right to personal data protection and under what circumstances it may be limited, establishing the precise rules that make the imposition of such a restriction and its consequences foreseeable to the data subject. A generic invocation of a public interest is not sufficient for these purposes. Said law must also establish appropriate technical, organizational, and procedural guarantees that prevent risks of varying probability and severity and mitigate their effects."

Since the respondent has not proven, therefore, that any of the exceptions provided for in Article 9.2 of the GDPR exist that would allow the general prohibition on the processing of facial recognition biometric data to be lifted, it is considered that by implementing a member identification system based on facial recognition as a mandatory and sole method of access to its five sports centers (and previously, according to the respondent, using a system based on fingerprint detection), the respondent company may have committed an administrative violation of Article 9 of the GDPR by engaging in prohibited processing of special category personal biometric data.

Therefore, based on the evidence currently available in the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, it is considered that the facts disclosed could constitute a violation of Article 9 of the GDPR, attributable to SIDECU, due to a violation of the aforementioned article.

V. Classification of the violation of Article 9 of the GDPR and classification for the purposes of limitation.

Article 83.5 of the GDPR classifies the violation of the following article as an administrative violation, which shall be punishable, in accordance with paragraph 2, by administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

"b) the rights of data subjects pursuant to Articles 12 to 22;"

For its part, the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data) in its Article 71, Infractions, states that:

“The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute infringements.”

For the sole purpose of the statute of limitations, Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD establishes the following:

"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:

h) Failure to comply with the obligation to inform the data subject about the processing of their personal data in accordance with the provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 12 of this Organic Law."

VI. Penalty for non-compliance with Article 9 of the GDPR.

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:

“1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 9, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

1. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, as an additional measure to or as a substitute for the measures referred to in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). When deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:

(a) the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the

nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the the level of damage suffered;
b) the intentionality or negligence in the breach;
c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects;

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 56/93

e) any previous breach committed by the controller or processor;
f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the breach and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the breach;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;
h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the breach and, if so, how measure;
(i) where the measures referred to in Article 58(2) have been previously ordered against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with those measures;
(j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or to certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42; and
(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.

For its part, Article 76 "Sanctions and Corrective Measures" of the LOPDGDD

provides:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria established in section 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account:

a) The continuous nature of the infringement.

b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.

c) The benefits obtained as a result of the infringement.

d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the infringement.

e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the entity. absorbent.

f) The impact on the rights of minors.
g) Having, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.
h) The voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in those

cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party."

In the present case, considering the seriousness of the potential violation committed,
paying special attention to the consequences that its commission has on those affected, a fine would be appropriate, in addition to the adoption of measures,
if appropriate.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 57/93

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate,
and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR. To guarantee
these principles, SIDECU's turnover, as recorded in the Diligence of 30-4-2024 (€16,154,950 in 2023), is considered as a preliminary matter.

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence available at the time of the decision to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following circumstances, contemplated in the aforementioned provisions.

 The nature, severity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the
nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as

the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered (Article 83.2(a) of the GDPR):

The conduct that constitutes the nature of the infringement attributed to the
defendant constitutes a violation of the prohibition on processing special category data,

without an exception, provided for in Article 9 of the GDPR, which is punishable, as stated above, by a fine of up to €20 million or 4% of the defendant's
turnover.

In this case, the severity of the sanction is assessed by taking into consideration, on the one hand, the number of affected individuals whose biometric personal data was processed at the five sports centers to which the complaints refer. The respondent has acknowledged having implemented this facial recognition system, based on the data provided by the respondent itself, without prejudice to what may be proven during the investigation phase. The respondent stated the following when responding to this Agency's request for information: "Currently, the aforementioned facial recognition system is installed in five sports centers, with a total number of users at said centers of 36,483. One of these centers is the Entrepuentes center in Seville, which currently has 8,978 users (as of January 4, 2024)."

The characteristics and technical operation of the facial recognition system that was implemented, as stated in the manufacturer's certificates for the \*\*\*COMPANY.1 system provided by the respondent, are also taken into consideration, as well as the security measures adopted, which were mentioned in the fifth point of the preliminary inspection report.

Regarding the duration of the violation, it is considered that we are in the presence of a continuing violation that began at least since the implementation of the facial recognition system between July and August 2023 and continues to this day, all without prejudice to the fact that the investigation may determine a different implementation date for biometric systems.

- Art. 83.2b) "intentionality or negligence in the infringement."

28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 58/93

As the controller of the personal data of members who have contracted its services and are entitled to access its sports centers in order to enjoy them, when the controller chooses to use an access method that uses a biometric identification system, it is obliged to act with the special diligence required for this type of processing, given the high risks its use generates.

In this regard, it is worth recalling the ruling of the National Court of

10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006), which, with respect to entities whose activity involves the continuous processing of customer data, states: "...the Supreme Court has held that negligence exists whenever a legal duty of care is disregarded, that is, when the offender does not behave with the required diligence. And in assessing the degree of diligence, the professionalism or lack thereof of the subject must be especially considered. There is no doubt that, in the case now under consideration, when the entity's activity involves constant and extensive handling of personal data, rigor and exquisite care must be emphasized to comply with the legal provisions in this regard."

The defendant alleges that it analyzed the different access methods and

determined, based on Report 0036/2020 from this Agency's legal department and the
information provided by the manufacturer, that the program did not process special-category biometric data, since it did not store the images from which the facial pattern was extracted.

The defendant company is considered to have acted without intent but with a level of gross negligence: (i) first, by interpreting that the program \*\*\*COMPANY.1 did not even process personal data, by interpreting the manufacturer's certificates that, since the image of the partners' faces was not stored and was converted
into a template (numeric code or mathematical model) that was encrypted, the identity of the individuals in it could not be deduced; (ii) was warned by several complainants that the facial template or pattern was actually special category biometric personal data, and in particular, it is evident that one of the complainants (C.C.C.) described in detail the concept and requirements for this type of processing, with the company simply responding with the same written statement and arguments it had provided for all its responses;

(iii) it is also evident that the respondent was aware of the existence of report No.
0036/2020 from this Agency, which also analyzed the concept of special category biometric data, since it mentions it among its arguments, although it misinterprets it; (iv) despite all of this, there is no evidence that the Agency (as provided for in Article 36 of the GDPR) was previously submitted or consulted with this Agency, nor did it request the opinion of a consultant or expert in the field, nor of the company in charge of developing the program, regarding these complaints that the partners had been raising since August 2023, which at the Entrepuentes center alone amounted to a total of 26, according to the Agency. (v) and, as a result of all of this, it did not exhaustively analyze whether any of the exceptions in Article 9.2 of the GDPR applied, and initiated processing that was prohibited.

- Article 76.2.f) of the LOPDGDD. The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.

In this regard, SIDECU, due to its business activities, continuously processes numerous personal data of members who register at its sports centers. The report, reflecting the basic information obtained from the Axesor tool dated April 30, 2024, states that SIDECU is a large company whose corporate purpose is the management of sports facilities and employs 267 people. In this case, it is processing a very large volume of personal data of members of the 33 sports centers it manages, according to the report issued on April 2, 2025, on its website. For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence currently available in the decision to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the results of the investigation, it is considered that the balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and Article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of Article 9 of the GDPR, allows for the initial imposition of an administrative fine of €80,000.00 (EIGHTY THOUSAND EUROS).

VI. Breached Obligation. Regarding the obligation to conduct a prior DPIA that meets the requirements set forth in Article 35 of the GDPR.

7.1. Regarding the need to conduct and complete a DPIA in the present case.

The personal data protection impact assessment, DPIA, appears as

the tool required by the GDPR to ensure compliance with this aspect
when the processing is considered "high risk," as established in
Article 35(1) of the GDPR (emphasis added):

"Where a type of processing, in particular where it uses new technologies, is likely, by reason of its nature, scope, context or purposes, to entail a high risk for

the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data controller
shall, prior to processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the processing operations on the protection of personal data..."

This assessment shall be carried out prior to the start of processing, but should

be understood as an ongoing or periodic assessment, within the meaning of
Article 35(11) of the GDPR, which provides: "Where necessary, the controller shall examine
whether the processing complies with the data protection impact assessment, at least where there is a change in risk." that represent the processing operations.”

As previously stated, a DPIA must comply with the requirements or minimum content listed in Article 35.7 of the GDPR, which provides:
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 60/93

“The assessment shall include at least:
a) a systematic description of the planned processing operations and the

purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interests pursued by the controller;
b) an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations with respect to their purpose;
c) an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1; and

d) the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data, and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other affected persons.”

Ultimately, passing a DPIA requires that the controller of a high-risk data processing operation document in writing all of the processing operations it carries out and their purposes; that the assessment of suitability, necessity, and proportionality of the processing be passed; and that the risks specific to the processing be managed from the outset, with the practical implementation of targeted measures to ensure an acceptable risk threshold throughout the entire processing lifecycle, as established in Article 35 of the GDPR. Furthermore, it requires prior consultation with the supervisory authority if the controller has not taken measures to mitigate the risk in accordance with Article 36 of the GDPR. As stated, the processing of biometric personal data in the context of access control for individuals to premises or facilities entails relevant and particularly significant risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the processing of which, in and of itself and separately, entails a high probability of risk to the rights and freedoms of employees, warranting a prior and valid DPIA.

Furthermore, it should be noted that biometric data intended for the identification and authentication of individuals—as is the case here—has been expressly included in the List of types of data processing that require a data protection impact assessment, published by the AEPD on May 6, 2019, in furtherance of the provision set forth in the fourth section of the aforementioned Article 35 of the GDPR, which requires supervisory authorities to establish and publish lists defining the processing operations that require a DPIA.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 61/93

In the case of Spain, the decision was made to publish a non-exhaustive list, which determines that "a DPIA will be necessary in most cases where the processing meets two or more criteria on the list" (criteria 4 and 5 in the case of biometric data for time or attendance monitoring). However, this does not exclude other processing operations that do not meet these criteria, but in light of their nature, scope, context, and purposes, there is a likelihood that they entail a high risk for the purposes set forth in Article 35.1 of the GDPR.

In the present case, there is evidence that the facial recognition software of \*\*\*COMPANY.1, which the respondent company implemented (at least in 5 of its sports centers), processed the facial patterns of members and stored them on the data controller's servers. Therefore, it is processing personal biometric data classified as a special category under Article 9 of the GDPR, as explained in detail in Legal Basis III, section 3.4.

Therefore, as also detailed in section 3.2, there is no doubt that the data controller should have been aware that it was about to initiate high-risk processing and that it was mandatory to carry out and pass a prior DPIA, in accordance with Article 35.1 of the GDPR.

The respondent company acknowledges that it did not prepare a prior DPIA—which in itself undoubtedly constitutes a breach of the obligation set forth in Article 35 of the GDPR—but maintains that it acted diligently in its duties since it conducted a risk analysis prior to the DPIA, in which it determined that since no personal data was processed by the facial recognition software used, according to the manufacturer's documentation, it was not necessary to prepare a prior DPIA or comply with other requirements set forth in the GDPR.

- In the first written response to the transfer made by this agency, SIDECU states that: "SIDECU, S.A. analyzed different types of access systems to its sports centers, which would, on the one hand, prevent access to the centers by people who were not members and, on the other hand, would comply with the condition of avoiding the processing of additional and unnecessary data for which the user's express consent would be required. (...)"; "Thus, various information was obtained about different biometric systems, with SIDECU opting for the system of the company \*\*\*COMPANY.1 and conducting a risk analysis prior to its acquisition." “According to the information provided to us by the manufacturer, a model is created with the NIR algorithm, patented by this manufacturer, which uses complex mathematical algorithms, generating a numerical model using information from any of the capture points. At no time can physical characteristics of the person be deduced from this model (…).

- In its letter of January 19, 2024, SIDECU responds to the request for information from the investigation phase regarding the risk analysis and DPIA of the processing, providing as document 5 a document entitled “RISK ANALYSIS PRIOR TO A DPIA” by SUPERA, dated September 2, 2022, consisting of two pages, stating that an analysis is being carried out on the initiative to implement facial recognition systems. \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 for access to GRUPO SUPERA's sports centers;
it states that no personal data will be processed, and subsequently issues

the following conclusion:

“According to the information provided by the manufacturer, the implementation of the
facial recognition system manufactured by \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 does not
entail any processing of personal data for users of the sports centers who access it.

The system generates a template from the user's image (the
first time they access it) that does not associate it with any particular person,
but simply analyzes whether or not the accessing user has the
right to do so.
In particular, the data extracted by \*\*\*EMPRESA.1's readers could not

be decrypted or disassembled under any circumstances; only the keys for the algorithm were in the possession of the manufacturer, and
no information about the user's image was stored.

The facial recognition system also does not connect to the sports centers' user database or list at any time.

The certificate issued by the manufacturer for this purpose is attached to this report.

In short, no Impact Assessment is necessary, as there is no data processing involved, as it is not possible, under any circumstances, to recover the user's personal image, nor even to deduce specific physical characteristics, nor can the person be identified.
It is agreed that informative posters will be made available to users informing them about the newly implemented system and its features.
Since there is no data processing involved, nor can it be considered special category processing, it is also not necessary to obtain the user's prior consent. In any case, alternative access options may be made available to users in cases where they refuse to use this system.

In short, it can be concluded that the proposed system is neither intrusive nor does it violate the rights of sports center users, as it does not process or store their personal image or any other data that could identify them.

However, this argument cannot be accepted as valid to avoid compliance

with the obligation to prepare a DPIA for the processing, nor with the other obligations that were required of the data controller, since in this case the "risk analysis prior to the DPIA" was not a risk analysis per se, and, furthermore, it reached conclusions contrary to the reality of the processing, since:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 63/93

- On the one hand, and as already stated, the document prepared by SUPERA
(SIDECU according to the aforementioned privacy policy) in September 2022 is based on an erroneous approach to the nature of the data processed by the facial recognition software, interpreting the documentation
provided by the manufacturer and understanding that it did not process special category biometric personal data, and even that the facial pattern or numeric identifier it created The program was not personal data either. Therefore, it reaches conclusions that are contrary to the applicable regulations, having failed to act with the due diligence required when analyzing the categories of personal data that required processing, for the reasons already indicated in Legal Basis III of this agreement.

- However, in addition to this, the document submitted cannot be considered, in any case, as a risk analysis of the processing, in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.

As already stated, a DPIA must contain, in accordance with Article 35.7. c) an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects referred to in paragraph 1.

The assessment of the concurrent risks and the level of risk of a processing operation has two objectives. The first is to optimize efforts to mitigate and manage the risks proportionally. The second is to determine whether the level of risk requires compliance with Articles 35 and 36 of the GDPR. (high-risk assumptions). Failure to do so, or doing so incompletely and without the required rigor, entails consequences that can lead to various regulatory breaches.

In this case, the respondent has not followed any of the many recommendations and tools offered by the "Guide on Risk Management and Impact Assessment in the Processing of Personal Data of June 2021" (hereinafter, the DPIA Guide) to prepare its risk analysis and determine whether a DPIA was necessary in this case.

As this Agency has pointed out in the aforementioned DPIA Guide, in section c), regarding the risk assessment process:

"The risk level assessment process is a discipline with a consolidated methodology common to any risk management process.

To assess the level of risk associated with a treatment, the following tasks must be performed:
• • Identify the risk factors or threats to rights and freedoms.
• • Analyze these factors, including their impact and probability, in order to carry out an assessment of the level of inherent risk derived from each of the risk factors.

• • Evaluate the overall level of risk of processing for the rights and freedoms of the processing."

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 64/93

The process of identifying these risks is part of the work of the data controller. It is not possible to transfer to the Supervisory Authority the analysis of those products, services, and systems existing on the market that could be used, as well as the risks associated with them based on the technologies they incorporate, which only the data controller that implements them can and should analyze. Despite this, the DPIA Guide is a useful instrument that contains the guidelines to follow to identify these risk factors and establishes the need to indicate the risks inherent to the processing and the residual or overall risk after applying the necessary risk mitigation measures.

Well, the company being sued, despite having at its disposal the regulations and instruments (guides and directives) that could have led to an adequate risk analysis, it prepared a "pre-DPIA analysis" document that did not describe the processing operations, nor did it identify the risk factors of the various operations included therein, nor did it analyze the concurrent risks, their impact or probability of individual occurrence, nor did it subsequently assess the overall risk level of the processing (residual risk).

Therefore, in this case, it is understood that the respondent did not base its decision not to prepare a DPIA on a risk analysis per se, for each of the activities subject to processing, which led it to the conclusion that a DPIA was not required, based on the assessment of the inherent or overall risk of the entire processing that had been carried out. Since it limited itself to documenting the reasons why it had reached the conclusion that it was not necessary to comply with the requirements for the processing of biometric personal data, and, in particular, why, in its opinion, it was not necessary to collect a consent of the partners or prepare a DPIA, based on a legal analysis of the legal nature of the data processed, which did not consider personal data, but not based on the concurrent risks, which should be included in the risk analysis.

This constitutes a clear breach of its obligations as data controller, especially in this case, where it is clear that the program designed by \*\*\*COMPANY.1 processes special category biometric personal data, and that the processing is high risk, making a DPIA mandatory in accordance with Article 35.1 of the GDPR.

Furthermore, it should be added that, in this case, in addition to not having prepared a DPIA or conducted an adequate risk analysis of the processing, the respondent company has also failed to demonstrate compliance with the other minimum requirements established in Article 35.7 of the GDPR, since:

- Firstly, there is no evidence that it has complied with the requirement of Article 35.7.a) of the GDPR. GDPR, since none of the documents provided by the respondent (neither the RAT nor this misnamed "pre-DPIA risk analysis") contains "a systematic description of the planned processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the data controller."

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 65/93

- In this case, there is also no evidence that the respondent conducted a prior analysis of the necessity, proportionality, and suitability of the new access method through facial recognition before deciding to implement it, in accordance with the requirements of Article 35.7.b), which refers to including: "an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations with respect to their purpose."

The only reference made to this is in the aforementioned "risk analysis" document. prior to the DPIA," when it states that "Ultimately, it is concluded that the proposed system is not intrusive nor does it violate the rights of sports center users, as it does not process or store their personal image or any other data that could identify them."

Given its relevance, it will be referred to in the following section.

- And the requirement set forth in Article 35.7. d) was also breached, regarding:
"the measures planned to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures, and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data, and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the rights

and legitimate interests of data subjects and other affected persons."

On this matter, and without going into detail about the possible measures that would have been necessary, since it is not the responsibility of this authority to identify them, but rather the responsibility of the controller, who is familiar with its organization and

systems and must determine what measures are appropriate in application of the Proactive Accountability Principle, it should be noted that the security measures applied to the processing indicated in the inspector's report (point five) do not comply with the requirement set forth in Article
35.7.d) of the GDPR, since they are not adequate to demonstrate the compliance of the processing with this GDPR, considering it completely

insufficient and inadequate to the concurrent risks that had not been
analyzed.

These measures, both the manufacturer claims to apply to its facial recognition software, and those reflected in the RAT regarding other

processing related to customer management that may have been
applied to this partner access control processing, are only
technical security measures, which also do not contemplate all the measures that would be possible in the current state of the art
to address the risks generated by this type of biometric data processing.

For this requirement of the DPIA to be met, it must contain all appropriate technical and organizational measures of all kinds,
to prevent the materialization of damages and to guarantee the rights and
freedoms of the natural persons affected by the processing.

7.2. In Special, regarding the requirement set forth in Article 35.7.b) regarding the processing being necessary, appropriate, and proportional.

The documentation provided also shows that the respondent company has not

conducted a prior assessment of the necessity, appropriateness, and proportionality of its new system for controlling member access to its sports centers, the exhaustive analysis and completion of which must be documented in the DPIA,
according to Article 35.7.b) of the GDPR.

It should be noted that the obligation to conduct this prior assessment applies to all processing and must always be carried out (even if the processing is not high-risk), in accordance with the provisions of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, which includes the so-called "Principle of Personal Data Minimization" and provides the following:

"1. Personal data shall be:
a) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes

for which they are processed ("data minimization").

Thus, compliance with this principle must be the starting point for the initiation of
any processing, with the controller having to consider whether this processing will be
truly necessary, appropriate, and proportional before initiating it. It is even advisable, according to this Agency's DPIA Guide, to conduct this assessment before
making decisions that lead to large investments in processing that
may be prohibited due to failure to comply with the essential requirement and principle.

Therefore, this prior analysis must be carried out before the start of any processing

of personal data, although when there is a likelihood that the processing entails
a high risk (as is the case with biometric data processed in biometric access control systems using facial recognition or fingerprint detection), there is an
obligation to document it within the DPIA, since it must contain "b) an
assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations with respect to their purpose," in accordance with Article 35.7. b) of the GDPR.

This is confirmed by Recital 39 of the GDPR, which emphasizes the importance of the processing being necessary, stating that "Personal data should only be processed if the purpose of the processing cannot reasonably be achieved by other means."

The Article 29 Working Party takes a similar view in its Opinion 3/2012 on the development of biometric technologies.

The obligation to process only "personal data that are adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed" provided for by the data minimization principle of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, and to assess the necessity and proportionality of the processing in the DPIA pursuant to Article 35.7.b) of the GDPR, must be interpreted in accordance with the established case law of our Constitutional Court regarding the need to verify that any measure restricting fundamental rights (processing operations that include biometric data in this case) exceeds what is known as the "triple proportionality test." This means that, first and foremost, it is necessary to determine whether it meets the following three requirements or conditions referred to by the Constitutional Court: "whether such a measure is capable of achieving the proposed objective (judgment of suitability); whether, in addition, it is necessary, in the sense that there is no other, more moderate measure that can achieve such a purpose with equal effectiveness (judgment of necessity); and, finally, whether it is balanced, as it results in more benefits or advantages for the general interest than harm to other goods or values in conflict (a judgment of proportionality in the strict sense)."

The requirement to carry out this triple judgment of proportionality prior to processing is specified with regard to biometric data in section 72 of the EDPB Guidelines 3/2019 on the processing of personal data using video devices, dated January 29, 2020, which states: "The use of biometric data, and in particular facial recognition, entails high risks for the rights of data subjects. It is essential that the use of such technologies be carried out in due respect for the principles of lawfulness, necessity, proportionality, and data minimization, as established by the GDPR. Although the use of these technologies may be perceived as particularly effective, data controllers must first assess the impact on fundamental rights and freedoms and consider less intrusive means of achieving their legitimate processing purpose. In other words, the question of whether this biometric application is truly essential and necessary, or merely "convenient," must be answered.

In the present case, the reasons why, in view of the documentation provided and statements made by the respondent and the complainants, it is understood that the processing carried out would not pass this triple test of proportionality, which, in accordance with the aforementioned Constitutional Court doctrine, requires meeting the following three requirements:

1. Whether the processing is likely to achieve the proposed objective (suitability test).

According to the Constitutional Court, the suitability requirement first determines "whether such a measure is likely to achieve the proposed objective (suitability test)." That is, it involves determining whether the processing (each of the operations that comprise it) is adequate to achieve the purposes pursued. That the processing is the response to certain shortcomings,

demands, requirements such as objective obligations or opportunities, and can
achieve the proposed objectives with sufficient effectiveness.

And this implies, according to the 2021 DPIA Guide (which the respondent claims to have

consulted), that the data controller must: (i) determine the ultimate purposes of the processing, which must be precise, specific, measurable, and limited,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 68/93

(ii) establish, in an objective, qualitative, and evidence-based manner, the
threshold of effectiveness that should be reached to fulfill the purposes of the processing; (iii) objectively, qualitatively, and evidence-basedly evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment as proposed, verifying whether it addresses the needs raised and to what extent.

What should be the subject of a suitability analysis is whether the treatment intended to be implemented is effective in fulfilling the objective, understood as the real purpose of the treatment.

As stated in the Agency's Guide on Risk Management and DPIA, the effectiveness analysis involves first defining the thresholds of effectiveness and error for each method analyzed to fulfill the same ultimate purpose of the treatment, and determining whether passenger identification can actually be performed more effectively compared to traditional methods that use human intervention, or whether this new method may generate a greater number of errors that lead to denying the registration of each employee's working hours.

For these purposes, it is true that the defendant company has not established or analyzed the
effectiveness thresholds or error rates of the various access systems to the centers it has been using over the years (identification cards,
fingerprints, facial recognition, and ID display), and specifically, it does not indicate why biometric time clocking with facial recognition is more effective in verifying members' identity than all other methods. It merely indicates that it decided to replace the fingerprint system with facial recognition due to the technical failures detected in its application, without specifying or justifying them. However, it also does not include any analysis of the effectiveness or suitability of the other access methods that do not use biometric systems, such as identification cards and ID display. However, in view of the rest of the documentation provided, it can be considered
initially that all the access methods that were allegedly

implemented could be suitable to serve as an effective method of identity verification (reliable unique identification) of members in order to allow their
entry/exit from the MIS, and deny access to those who do not have this status.

Therefore, the suitability of the access methods that have been implemented is not questioned in principle, provided that the processing is configured with the

appropriate measures and guarantees.

2. If, in addition, the processing of biometric data is necessary, in the sense that

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 69/93

there is no other more moderate measure to achieve this purpose with equal effectiveness (judgment of necessity).

When verifying whether the processing carried out is necessary, it is necessary to determine

whether the intended purpose cannot be achieved through another, less harmful or
invasive means, that is, whether there is no alternative processing that is less intrusive to the
rights and freedoms of the data subjects that is equally or more effective and

safe for achieving the intended purpose.

Regarding this issue, the respondent company simply states in the
aforementioned "risk analysis prior to the DPIA" that: "Ultimately, it is concluded that the

proposed system is not intrusive nor does it violate the rights of the
users of the sports centers, as it does not process or store their personal image or
any other data that could identify them."

However, this statement is not supported by valid arguments that justify the need to implement a biometric access method (such as facial recognition, or, previously, fingerprint recognition), when there are other access methods that are less intrusive to the rights and freedoms of members and are equally effective in serving as a means of identification and access control, such as those carried out using identification cards and the display of national identity cards. These methods do not involve the processing of special-category personal data, nor do they generate the risks referred to in Legal Basis III.

- Thus, most of the claims linked to this procedure indicate that prior to implementing the facial recognition system, access was via a turnstile controlled by a magnetic card and a biometric fingerprint recognition system.

- Furthermore, it expressly states in its letter of 1-4-24 that: "In any case, all Supera centers are equipped with alternative access systems, such as the classic in-person access system of presenting an identity document, which is compared with the data included in the Supera Centers' systems," and that after receiving 26 complaints at the Entrepuentes center, it enabled this access method.

In general, the defendant company confuses necessity with the usefulness of the facial recognition system, since it claims to have analyzed various access methods with the following purpose or objective: "SIDECU, S.A. analyzed different types of access systems to its sports centers, by virtue of which, on the one hand, access to the centers was prevented by people who were not members and, on the other hand, that met the condition of avoiding the processing of additional and unnecessary data for which the user's express consent would be required."
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 70/93

But necessity should not be confused with the usefulness of the system. Obviously, a facial recognition access control system can be useful and generate advantages or benefits for the company itself and its partners, such as those indicated by the respondent in this paragraph or in its informational posters, when it states:

"What advantages do biometric systems have?
- They guarantee user identification and verification in a fast,
easy, and reliable manner.

- It is a robust technology that has been extensively studied and tested.
- By using a non-transferable feature, fraudulent use of keys to replace the identity of others is not possible."

There is no doubt that these advantages may exist and that they provide benefits for everyone, but what this requirement is examining is whether these biometric identity verification systems—in addition to being useful and
suitable—are objectively necessary to fulfill the purpose of uniquely identifying the employee (the latter being what must truly be taken into account when analyzing the requirement of the necessity of processing). Or whether, on the contrary, there are other, less intrusive alternative means that fulfill

this same purpose.

As established in Opinion 3/2012 on the evolution of biometric technologies - from WG 29 - it must be examined "whether it is essential to satisfy that
need, and not just the most appropriate or cost-effective." The

options and alternatives must be analyzed before implementing a new system that represents a
significant intrusion into the rights of each user, when less invasive means may exist
on privacy, and not opt for what is practical, agile, and convenient,
when the rights of their data subjects are at stake.

In cases like the present one, the data controller who considers implementing high-risk
processing, such as that involving people's biometric data, must
be scrupulous in their work of exhaustively analyzing all available alternative
options that are equally suitable and effective, but less intrusive. Therefore, the study of the feasibility of other available alternative options that do not require the use of special data must be documented along with the DPIA, all options must be compared, and the conclusions must be documented.

In the present case, the respondent acknowledges that there are other alternatives that could be used for the same purpose, and that are undoubtedly less intrusive than biometric-based access methods such as fingerprints or facial recognition. However, there is no DPIA, nor is there evidence that an analysis of these other alternatives mentioned by the respondent has been prepared or documented.

This implies that the processing carried out through the facial recognition access system referred to in this case did not pass the prior judgment of necessity because it has not been justified why the biometric alternative was necessary to achieve the purpose of uniquely identifying the employees, despite the existence of at least two other non-biometric identification methods that were equally effective for identifying members and were less intrusive to citizens' rights and freedoms because they did not involve the processing of special category and high-risk biometric data (access through identification cards and by displaying the DNI).

2. Finally, it will be necessary to analyze whether processing using fingerprints as an access method is weighted or balanced, as it results in more benefits or advantages for the general interest than harm to other goods or values in conflict (judgment of proportionality in the strict sense).

This is established, among others, in "STC 66/1995, of May 8, F. 5; STC 55/1996, of March 28, F. 7, 8, and 9; STC 270/1996, of December 16, F. 4.e; STC 37/1998, of February 17, F. 8; STC 186/2000, of July 10, F. 6)."

In this regard, the severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the processing, and its interference with the fundamental right to the protection of personal data, must be appropriate to the objective pursued and proportionate to the urgency and seriousness of the risk. The benefit that the processing provides to society, from a data protection perspective, must be balanced against the impact it represents on other fundamental rights. However, although partial concessions may be granted, in no case can the right to Data Protection be completely denied and stripped of its essential content.

There must be a logical link between the measure and the legitimate objective pursued.
For the principle of proportionality to be respected, the advantages resulting from the measure must not be outweighed by the disadvantages it causes with respect to the exercise of fundamental rights. One of the factors that influence proportionality is the effectiveness of existing measures. If measures for a similar or identical purpose already exist in the same context, they must be considered. Otherwise, the proportionality assessment has not been properly carried out.

In view of these statements and the documentation provided, it can be determined without a doubt that the company has not proven that it has carried out this prior proportionality analysis, since it has not prepared a DPIA or a document weighing the advantages and disadvantages of using the biometric system as the "primary" system chosen to control and record access to the membership center. It only shows that it posted informational posters informing members of three advantages of the biometric system, without mentioning the disadvantages or risks associated with this type of processing. No mention is made or evidence provided that the defendant has evaluated or considered in this trial any of the disadvantages or limitations of the biometric system before us, which are neither mentioned nor considered in any case, nor is there a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of this system compared to the other alternatives it claims to have analyzed.

In short, there is no evidence that a prior proportionality analysis (advantage-disadvantage or risk-benefit balance) has been conducted either.

Therefore, given the existence of less intrusive means and the relationship between advantages and disadvantages, it does not seem necessary or proportional to use access control systems for individuals based on the processing of special-category biometric personal data when there are other equally effective alternative access control methods that would allow the purpose of the processing to be fulfilled, and which are currently used or have been used in the past by the respondent.

Therefore, there is evidence that the implemented processing also fails to pass the assessment or triple proportionality test referred to in Article 35.7.b) of the GDPR.

In conclusion, based on the evidence currently available, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered that the facts described could violate the provisions of Article 35 of the GDPR, as a DPIA for the processing has not been prepared nor has the processing complied with the minimum requirements provided for in said article.

VIII. Classification and qualification of the violation of Article 35 of the GDPR.

As explained in the previous Legal Basis, it is considered that the facts described could violate the provisions of Article 35 of the GDPR, which could entail the commission of an administrative offense classified as set forth in Article 83.4.a) of the GDPR, which states that:

"Violations of the following provisions shall be punishable, in accordance with paragraph 2, by administrative fines of up to EUR 10,000,000 or, in the case of an undertaking, by an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the total annual global turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:
a) The obligations of the controller and the processor under Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39, 42, and 43."

For the purposes of statute of limitations, the LOPDGDD establishes in Article 73.t) that: “In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, are considered serious and will be subject to a two-year statute of limitations:

t) The processing of personal data without having carried out an assessment of the impact of the processing operations on personal data protection in cases where such an assessment is required.”

IX. Penalty for infringement of Article 35 of the GDPR.

In this case, considering the seriousness of the violation found regarding Article 35 of the GDPR, in accordance with the regulatory provisions set forth in Legal Basis VI contained in Article 83 of the GDPR and Article 76 of the LOPDGDD, and taking into account in particular the consequences that its commission has on the data subjects, it is understood that a fine should be imposed.

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR. To guarantee

these principles, the defendant's status as a large company and its turnover in 2023 are considered as a preliminary matter.

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence available at the time of the decision to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following grading circumstances, contemplated in the aforementioned provisions:

 Art. 83.2.a) GDPR: "The nature, severity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered."

The conduct that constitutes the nature of the infringement attributed to the respondent affects an essential obligation regarding data protection, which is the preparation of a DPIA for the processing that complies with the requirements set forth in Article 35 of the GDPR. This is punishable, as stated, by a fine of up to €10 million or 2% of the respondent's turnover.

It is considered that SIDECU did not prepare a DPIA for the processing.
It is also considered that the processing implemented also violated the four minimum requirements set forth in Article 35.7 of the GDPR, to the extent indicated in Legal Basis VII of this agreement. And in
particular, it is considered that the processing using biometric systems has not been justified as necessary or proportional in this case, given
the existence of other access control methods available at the center

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 74/93

that would have allowed the same purpose to be fulfilled in a less intrusive manner for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

Likewise, the number of affected parties is considered,
which corresponds to the number of members whose personal data has been
processed through the facial recognition-based access system in the 5 sports centers identified by the defendant, without prejudice to the fact that a different number of affected parties may be established during the investigation.

Regarding the duration of the infringement, it is considered that it was committed continuously, during the period already indicated in Legal Basis VI regarding the infringement of Article 9 of the GDPR.

Art. 83.2b) "intentionality or negligence in the infringement."

As the party responsible for implementing a new member access system that includes the processing of a category of personal data whose processing involves a high risk (biometric data of individuals), the respondent company is obliged to act with the special diligence required for this type of processing, given the high risks generated by its use.

Regarding the level of diligence that the data controller is obliged to deploy, the judgment of the National Court, Administrative Litigation Chamber, of October 17, 2007, cited above, may be cited.

Applying this doctrine to the present case, the lack of concurrent due diligence
must be classified as "serious," given that it was concluded that a DPIA was not necessary, nor was compliance with the other requirements set forth in the GDPR, based on an erroneous analysis of the legal nature of the data processed by \*\*\*EMPRESA.1's software, which was not carried out with the necessary rigor, revealing its lack of due diligence, as it did not even know how to conduct a risk analysis prior to a DPIA and the requirements it must meet, as well as that the analysis of necessity, suitability, and proportionality should be the starting point before making any decision that would involve initiating processing.

Although a two-page document was prepared to demonstrate that, in their opinion, it was not necessary to prepare a prior DPIA, this demonstrates that the document was intended to comply with a formal requirement, but was not supported by a true risk analysis or regulatory compliance, revealing a pattern of systemic non-compliance that contradicts the principles and basic rules of risk management and impact assessment referred to in the new GDPR. The analysis performed lacks essential and basic elements that should have been examined as part of the mandatory prior risk analysis, even if a DPIA had not been mandatory. The absence of these essential elements hinders the controller's subsequent compliance with its obligations. Given that there is evidence of non-compliance with the four minimum requirements established in Article 35.7 of the GDPR.

• Article 83.2.g) of the GDPR: "The impact on one of the special categories of data": by processing biometric data (facial pattern extracted from the members' faces) whose need for protection is, to that extent, greater than that of other personal data, as stated by the Constitutional Court in ruling 76/2019, of 05/22/2019, appeal 1405/2019, which constitutes an aggravating circumstance, in accordance with Article 83.2.g) of the GDPR, "the categories of personal data affected by the infringement."

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of Article 35 of the GDPR,

allows for the initial imposition of an administrative fine of €50,000 (FIFTY THOUSAND EUROS).

X
Obligation breached under Article 13 of the GDPR. Information to be provided

when personal data is obtained from the data subject.

One of the obligations of the controller of any personal data processing is to comply with the obligations to inform data subjects as set forth in
Articles 12 to 14 of the GDPR.

In accordance with the provisions of Article 12.1 of the GDPR, the principle of "Transparency of information, communication, and methods for exercising the data subject's rights" is used (emphasis added):

"1. The data controller shall take appropriate measures to provide the data subject with all information indicated in Articles 13 and 14, as well as any communication pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to the processing, in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible manner, using clear and plain language, in particular any information specifically addressed to a child. The information shall be provided in writing or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means. Upon request by the data subject, the information may be provided verbally, provided that the identity of the data subject can be proven by other means."

These information obligations are specified in Articles 13 and 14, and those provided for in Article 15 to 22 and 34 shall apply to the present case. 13 of the GDPR on

“Information to be provided when personal data are collected from the data subject” (emphasis added):

1. When personal data relating to a data subject are collected from that data subject, the data controller shall, at the time of collection, provide the data subject with all of the following information:

a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, its representative;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 76/93

b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;
c) the purposes for which the personal data are processed and the legal basis for the processing;

d) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party;

(e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, where applicable;
(f) where applicable, the controller's intention to transfer personal data to a third country or international organization and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or, in the case of transfers referred to in Articles 46 or 47 or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), reference to the appropriate safeguards and the means of obtaining a copy of them or the place where they have been made available.

2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject, at the time the personal data are obtained, with the following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing:

a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or, where that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;

b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to, rectification or erasure of, or restriction of processing of, personal data concerning the data subject, or to object to processing, as well as the right to data portability;

c) where processing is based on Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent prior to its withdrawal;

d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

e) whether the provision of personal data is a legal or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, and whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and is informed of the possible consequences of not providing such data;
f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4), and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. 3. When the controller plans to further process personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, they shall provide the data subject, prior to such further processing, with information about that other purpose and any additional information relevant under paragraph 2.
4. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 shall not apply when and to the extent that the data subject already has the information.

In the present case, it is understood that the company decided to implement the new access method as the only mandatory means for members of these 5 sports centers, without having previously informed them that their special category biometric data would be processed with the transparency and conditions required by Article 12, and including all the aspects required by said

Article 13 of the GDPR.

This information must be provided, as provided for in Articles 12 and 13 of the GDPR, "at the time the personal data are obtained," which in the present case was the time the partners' biometric personal data were collected (facial sample to extract the facial pattern). This means that if the company provided information after this date, it would be deemed to have also breached the obligation set forth in these provisions.

This duty of prior information can be carried out through various means, with the respondent having the obligation to prove that this information has occurred in each case, with respect to each individual person, prior to the time their biometric data is collected. Therefore, in the case of general communications through informational posters, the data controller must establish procedures and guarantees to ensure that each of the partners who accessed their data biometric data were collected, they knew that their special category biometric data would be processed, for what purpose and risks, and all the aspects listed in Article 13 of the GDPR (data controller, how and before whom they could exercise their rights of access, rectification, etc.).

In the present case, there is no evidence that the partners signed any express document including the information in Article 13 of the GDPR regarding the processing of these biometric data that would be carried out using the facial recognition system. This document was submitted and signed at the time of collection, prior to the first access, which should have occurred between July and August 2023, as indicated. Nor did they receive an individual communication informing them of these aspects regarding biometric processing prior to the collection of these data (via email, letter, etc.).

Furthermore, there is evidence to the contrary, since It is noted that all the claims and complaints filed in this procedure submitted a prior complaint to the respondent, requesting consent for the processing of biometric data. The company responded that this was not necessary, in the following terms: "The implemented system did not store the image, nor did it pose a risk to the users' personal data, and it was not necessary to obtain prior consent since, given the characteristics of the system, neither the image nor any data that could identify the user was stored, nor did it perform any data processing."

Furthermore, as has been stated on several occasions throughout this agreement, the company acknowledges that it did not obtain express consent to process special category biometric data. Therefore, the possibility that prior information regarding this would be recorded in a hypothetical consent document for the processing of biometric data is also ruled out.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 78/93

Thus, the defendant company has acknowledged that it understood that the software used for facial recognition did not process personal data or special-category biometric data, and therefore did not obtain any express consent from the members by which they agreed to have their biometric data collected for the purpose of granting them access to the centers to which they were members. This was reflected in its "risk analysis prior to a DPIA," which has been analyzed in the Legal Basis regarding the breach of Article 35 of the GDPR.

Furthermore, it can be seen how not obtaining the members' express consent was one of the objectives pursued by the company when analyzing the different access control options, since in its letter of January 19, 2024, it expressly stated that:
"The company SIDECU, S.A. analyzed different types of access systems to its sports centers, which would, on the one hand, prevent access to the centers by people who were not members and, on the other hand, would comply with the condition of avoiding the processing of additional and unnecessary data for which the user's express consent would be required."

Nor is it recorded that the user registration documentation authorizes this processing of biometric data or that it reports on the aspects of Article 13 of the GDPR in relation to them. As was highlighted in the inspector's report and has been noted in Legal Basis IV when addressing the breach of Article 9 of the GDPR, it is clear that in order to register at the sports centers and access the contracted services, members signed a registration form, by which they accepted the general conditions and internal regulations that were completed by the inspector of the procedure.

This contractual documentation only includes a general personal data protection clause that makes no reference to biometric processing. Therefore, it is also ruled out that the members were informed of this type of biometric processing when signing the contract. This is expressly acknowledged by the respondent, when it states: "While it is true that the user registration documentation does not include authorization for the collection of personal data related to the use of biometric data or special categories, this is because, given the operating characteristics of the access system, not only is the image of the users not saved by SIDECU, S.A. as the theoretical data controller, but no personal data is retained, as the template generated by the system does not allow association with any specific person.

The respondent indicates that it provided information about the new access method using facial recognition to all members, ensuring that at each Informational posters were posted at the sports center, and the complaint provides a photograph of the posters that the respondent claims to have posted at each of the sports centers. It can be seen that each poster is headed by the name of each of these five sports centers.

Thus, in its response to the first three complaints, SIDECU indicates that: "Given that the three users are members of the Supera Entrepuentes sports center in Seville, an internal investigation has been conducted into the possible causes that led these three users to file the aforementioned complaint, and whether the center was providing its users with information by posting informational posters at the facilities and through the personnel working there due to the change in the access system. It has been verified that the sports center has posted information signs in a visible and accessible location for all users, providing users with the necessary information about the use of this system and informing them that this system does not process any personal data. And, in each of its three subsequent letters, SIDECU responds regarding this prior duty of information as follows: "In any case, SIDECU agreed that an information sign about these systems would be posted in a visible location in all sports centers to inform users about personal data protection, the operation of the readers, and their scope."

In the photographs of the five informational posters that SIDECU claims to have placed in a visible location, it is clear that, with the exception of the heading referring to the name of each center, the poster always has the following content:

"What is a biometric identification system?
These types of biometric systems use a physical and non-transferable characteristic of a person to perform identification or verification. \*\*\*EMPRESA.1's biometric systems extract facial data points from raw images and create a template from this data.

What are the advantages of biometric systems?

- They guarantee user identification and verification in a fast,
easy, and reliable manner.
- It is a robust technology that has been extensively studied and tested.
- By using a non-transferable characteristic, fraudulent use of keys by replacing the identity of another person is not possible.

User privacy and protection?
\*\*\*EMPRESA.1's biometric systems do not save the processed image; they create a template with the NIR algorithm patented by \*\*\*EMPRESA.1. Using complex mathematical algorithms, the numerical template is generated using information from certain points of the capture. Physical characteristics cannot be deduced from the template; the extraction algorithm is only known to the manufacturer.

How it Works
The face template is not a raw image. It is created using \*\*\*EMPRESA.1's patented NIR technology and algorithm, and the template is a dataset that is a fusion of 2D and 3D features of a user's face, acquired by a visual camera and a NIR camera. To protect this template, cryptographic tools and encryption methods, such as 256-bit AES encryption, are used.

However, this information sign does not prove that the respondent complied with this obligation to previously inform each of the members who accessed

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 80/93

through the facial recognition system of all aspects of the processing referred to in Article 13 of the GDPR, since:

1. There is no record of the date the sign was posted, and the respondent has not provided any documentation that could prove the date on which it was posted.
Therefore, there is no evidence that said signs
were posted prior to or at the same time as the collection of the first biometric data required to start the facial recognition system, as required by Articles

12 and 13 of the GDPR.

2. The location of the device is not visible, to ensure that it was visible and accessible to members prior to the collection of their biometric data.

3. In light of the content of the sign, it is evident that the company did not inform members that the new method of accessing the centers using facial recognition involved the processing of their personal biometric data, as it provided them with incorrect information about the operation of the system, based on their erroneous interpretation of the manufacturer's certificates, without properly consulting or analyzing the legal nature of the facial pattern generated, stored, and operated by \*\*\*COMPANY.1's software.

More seriously, not only was the obligation to inform members that the new method of access using facial recognition—which was unique and mandatory—required the collection of their personal biometric data and that this was high-risk and involved the processing of special-category personal data was not fulfilled. But the company went further, stating that no personal data would be processed using this new method.

Consequently, understanding that no personal data was being processed, no information was provided regarding the aspects required by Article 13 of the GDPR (identity and details of the data controller, the DPO, where applicable, legal basis and purpose of the processing, data recipients, data retention period, the possibility of exercising the rights of access, rectification, deletion, restriction, or objection, the right to file a complaint with this Agency, etc.).

In short, based on the documents in the file and without prejudice to those provided during the investigation, there is currently sufficient evidence that SIDECU has been collecting biometric personal data (facial pattern), storing it, and using it to control the access of members who accessed these five sports centers using this facial recognition system, without adequately informing them of all the required aspects for data protection purposes. Therefore, it could also be charged with an infringement of the obligation under Article 13 of the GDPR.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 81/93

Therefore, based on the evidence currently available, the decision to initiate sanctioning proceedings is considered to be that the known facts could constitute a violation of Article 13 of the GDPR, attributable to SIDECU, due to a violation of the article transcribed above.

X. Classification of the violation of Article 13 of the GDPR and classification for the purposes of statute of limitations.

Article 83.4 of the GDPR classifies the violation of the following articles as an administrative offense. In accordance with paragraph 2, the penalties shall be administrative fines of up to EUR 10,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the total annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

"a) the obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39, 42, and 43;
b) the obligations of certification bodies pursuant to Articles 42 and 43;
c) the obligations of the supervisory authority pursuant to Article 41(4).

For its part, the LOPDGDD, for the sole purposes of the statute of limitations in Article 72.1, establishes the following:

“Article 72. Infractions considered very serious.

1. Pursuant to the provisions of Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following are considered very serious and shall be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:

infractions that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular, the following: (...)
h) Failure to comply with the obligation to inform the data subject about the processing of their personal data in accordance with the provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 12 of this Organic Law.”

XI. Penalty for violation of Article 13 of the GDPR.

In this case, considering the seriousness of the violation found regarding Article 35 of the GDPR, in accordance with the regulatory provisions set forth in Legal Basis VI contained in Article 83 of the GDPR and Article 76 of the LOPDGDD, and taking into account in particular the consequences that its commission has on the interested parties, it is understood that a fine should be imposed.

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR. To guarantee
these principles, SIDECU's turnover, recorded in the eighth fact, of €16,154,950 in 2023, is considered as a preliminary matter.

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence currently available, C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 82/93

the decision to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following circumstances, contemplated in the aforementioned provisions:

 Art. 83.2.a) GDPR: "The nature, severity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered."

The conduct that defines the nature of the infringement attributed to the respondent affects an essential obligation in terms of data protection, which refers to the duty to inform the data subject about the aspects indicated in Article 13 of the GDPR. This is punishable, as stated, by a fine of up to 20 million euros or 4% of the respondent's turnover.

It is considered that SIDECU did not provide information on any of the aspects of Article 13 of the GDPR, and that it also posted informational posters and responded to complaints filed by members, stating that \*\*\*EMPRESA.1's new facial recognition system does not involve the processing of any personal data.

Likewise, the initial sanction is based on the number of affected members, which corresponds to the number of members whose personal data has been processed through the facial recognition-based access system at the five sports centers, starting from the number indicated by the respondent, without prejudice to a different number of affected members being established during the investigation.

Regarding the duration of the violation, it is considered that it has been committed continuously, during the period already indicated in Legal Basis VI regarding the violation of Article 9 of the GDPR.

 Art. 83.2b) "intentionality or negligence in the infringement."

As the party responsible for implementing a new member access system that includes the processing of a category of personal data whose processing involves high risk (biometric data of individuals), the respondent company is obliged to act with the special diligence required for this type of processing, given the high risks generated by its use, which includes the duty to duly inform the data controller at the time of collecting the personal data, in addition to the general aspects provided for in Article 13 of the GDPR.

Regarding the level of diligence that the data controller is obliged to display, the judgment of the National Court, Administrative Litigation Chamber, of October 17, 2007, cited above, may be cited.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 83/93

Applying this doctrine to the present case, the lack of concurrent due diligence must be classified as "serious," not only because informational signs were posted that did not disclose that biometric data or personal data of any kind were being processed, and the defendant could have been aware of this if it had acted with the due diligence required of a data controller to determine the legal nature of the processing before reaching the conclusion that there was no processing of personal data in this case, and consequently failing to comply with such essential obligations as informing the public about the processing, its purposes, categories of data, legal grounds for its legality, risks, as well as all the aspects provided for in Article 13 of the GDPR. All of this, despite the fact that the partners warned it that this involved the processing of special-category biometric data, there is no evidence that the responsible party acted with due diligence to thoroughly analyze the regulations, guides, and guidelines that were approved on this matter. Furthermore, it is clear that the partners raised doubts about whether the new method involved the processing of biometric personal data, and the respondent company persisted with its initial version. Despite this, it did not thoroughly analyze this issue, examining the guides and guidelines on the processing of biometric data that would have allowed it to easily deduce that a facial pattern is biometric data, nor did it seek the help of experts, nor did it conduct a prior consultation.

 Article 83.2 g) “the categories of personal data affected by the infringement.” In the present case, the processing carried out, for which the prior information obligations have not been fulfilled, affects one of the special categories of data, biometric data, whose need for protection is greater than that of other personal data, as indicated by the Constitutional Court in ruling 76/2019, of May 22, 2019, appeal 1405/2019.

Article 76.2.f) of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act). The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data. In this regard, as previously indicated, due to the activity carried out by SIDECU, it is understood that it continuously processes numerous personal data of the members registered in the 33 centers it manages. The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR, allows for the initial imposition of an administrative fine of €30,000 (THIRTY THOUSAND EUROS).
XII. Corrective measures.

If the violation is confirmed, the resolution issued may establish the corrective measures that the offending entity must adopt to end the non-compliance with personal data protection legislation, in this case Article 9 of the GDPR and Article 13 of the GDPR, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 58.2.d) of the GDPR, according to which each supervisory authority may "order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period..."

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 84/93

Thus, the responsible entity may be required to bring its actions into compliance with personal data protection regulations, within the scope expressed in the

previous Legal Basis.

This document establishes the alleged violations committed and the facts that could give rise to this potential violation of data protection regulations. From this, it is clear what measures to be adopted, without prejudice to the specific procedures, mechanisms, or instruments to implement them being the responsibility of the sanctioned party, as the data controller is fully familiar with their organization and must decide, based on proactive responsibility and a risk-based approach, how to comply with the GDPR and the LOPDGDD. However, in this case, regardless of the foregoing, in accordance with the evidence currently available regarding the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, the resolution adopted may require SIDECU to adopt the following measures:

- Within 7 months, provide evidence of having completed and passed a DPIA for the access control processing of its members to the centers managed by the SIDECU, which includes a prior risk analysis and an assessment of the triple judgment of suitability, necessity, and proportionality of the processing carried out, determining whether any of the exceptions in Article 9.2 of the GDPR apply, as well as the appropriate protection measures, and the remaining obligations required by personal data protection regulations.

If any of the processing operations specified in the access methods intended to be implemented do not pass the aforementioned triple standard, and/or the exception that allows the processing of biometric data does not apply, or if it is not possible to comply with any of the obligations set forth in the data protection regulations, SIDECU will not be able to carry out the processing operation(s) in question and must provide proof of this circumstance to this Agency.

- Within one month from the date of the executive order of the resolution finalizing this procedure, provide proof of having made available to the data subjects the information referred to in Article 13 of the GDPR regarding the processing of personal biometric data carried out prior to their implementation, provided that the above requirements are met.

The imposition of these measures is compatible with the sanction of an administrative fine, as provided for in Article 83.2 of the GDPR.

Please note that failure to comply with the possible order to adopt measures imposed by this body in the resolution of this sanctioning procedure may be considered an administrative infraction pursuant to the provisions of the GDPR, classified as an infraction in Articles 83.5 and 83.6. Such conduct may lead to the opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 85/93

Furthermore, please remember that neither the acknowledgment of the infraction committed nor, where applicable, the voluntary payment of the proposed amounts exempts you from the obligation to adopt the relevant measures to cease the conduct or correct the effects of the infraction committed, nor from the obligation to prove compliance with this obligation to this AEPD.

XIII. Provisional Suspension of Processing

Article 58.2 of the GDPR provides as follows:

“Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following corrective powers:

(d) to order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period;”
(f) to impose a temporary or permanent restriction on processing, including a prohibition; \[…\]”
(i) to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of each case;”

The imposition of these measures is compatible with each other.

In particular, Article 69.1 and 2 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act) provides the following:

“1. During the conduct of preliminary investigations or the initiation of a procedure for the exercise of sanctioning powers, the Spanish Data Protection Agency may, with reasons, agree on the necessary and proportionate provisional measures to safeguard the fundamental right to data protection, and in particular, those provided for in Article 66.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the precautionary blocking of data, and the immediate obligation to comply with the requested right.

2. In cases where the Spanish Data Protection Agency considers that the continued processing of personal data, its communication, or its international transfer will seriously impair the right to personal data protection, it may order the data controllers or processors to block the data and cease processing, and, if these orders are not complied with, proceed with their immobilization.”

In the present case, as indicated, the processing of access control (entry and exit) for members implemented by SIDECU can be considered a single processing of personal data at at least 5 of its 33 sports centers. This has been carried out since at least July-August 2023 using a facial recognition identification system. Previously, an access system using magnetic cards or biometric identification using fingerprints was used. Currently, following the complaints filed, a new access method has been enabled by displaying ID at the Entrepuentes center.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 86/93

In principle, there is no evidence that the access method using magnetic cards or the method involving the presentation of the DNI violates personal data protection regulations. However, this is not the case with biometric access methods, since the investigations conducted reveal evidence that, if confirmed during the investigation phase, could lead to the commission of three administrative violations for non-compliance with Articles 9, 35, and 13 of the GDPR, as set forth in this Initiation Agreement.

As of the date of this Initiation Agreement, there is no evidence that the respondent company has

ceased processing special category biometric data, and neither it nor the complainants have notified this Agency that the access methods
through biometric systems currently used at these sports centers (facial recognition) have been disabled. Nor has it been proven that the access method through display of the DNI has been enabled at the Entrepuentes center. And despite

it having been indicated that the facial recognition-based method has replaced the previous fingerprint method, it has not been specified or proven that the fingerprint system has been disabled at all of the centers managed by the respondent (33 according to the diligence of April 2, 2025).

As explained throughout this initial agreement, there are indications and verified evidence that recommend not continuing the processing of biometric personal data that involve special categories of personal data and entail a very significant risk.

Continuing to process the processing operations corresponding to both biometric systems mentioned above could lead to a very serious and irreparable harm to the rights of these users. Therefore, the temporary suspension of these operations is the only measure that can be adopted to safeguard the Fundamental Right to Data Protection, and is also the least harmful, onerous, proportional, and effective measure, as well as the most proportional and effective measure for the respondent. Based on these premises and in order to guarantee the rights and freedoms of those affected, it is deemed appropriate to impose a provisional measure to prevent, as soon as possible, the continued processing of personal data through the processing operations carried out by the respondent. Therefore, the company must prove that it has temporarily suspended the use of biometric access systems at all its centers. This measure may be lifted or confirmed, issuing the corresponding measure to suspend or permanently terminate these time clock systems. This measure would not prevent the respondent company from continuing to control access to its centers by authorized persons correctly and legally using the other systems it is already using, such as the ID card display system it claims to have implemented after receiving 26 complaints at the Entrepuentes center, or the one it has used in the past, according to the complainants, such as access through turnstiles with magnetic cards. Therefore, the suspension of the biometric access systems does not entail a disproportionate cost or effort, nor does it prevent it from continuing to fulfill its legal obligation to monitor and control its partners' access to its centers. C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 87/93

Consequently, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2 of the GDPR and Article 76.3 of the LOPDGDD transcribed above, it is possible to impose, through this Agreement to Initiate Sanctioning Proceedings, the provisional measure of ordering, in accordance with the provisions of Article 69 of the LOPDGDD, the temporary suspension of all processing of biometric personal data—and especially those related to the facial recognition system, and, if applicable, fingerprint detection—as a method of controlling entry and exit to its centers. The provisional suspension of processing is considered necessary, proportionate, and effective to guarantee the rights and freedoms of those affected, and less burdensome for the accused.

The provisional measure must be implemented from the notification of this agreement initiating the sanctioning procedure until its final resolution, at which point it must be confirmed, modified, or lifted.

Therefore, in light of the foregoing, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency
HAS AGREED:

FIRST: TO INITIATE SANCTIONING PROCEEDINGS against SIDECU, S.A., with NIF A15435092, for the alleged commission of three administrative offenses:

- For the alleged violation of Article 9 of the GDPR, classified in Article 83.5.a) of the GDPR.

- For the alleged violation of Article 13 of the GDPR, classified in Article 83.5.b) of the GDPR.

SECOND: ORDER as a provisional measure that SIDECU, S.A., with Tax Identification Number (NIF) A15435092, in accordance with the provisions of Article 69 of the LOPDGDD, temporarily suspend all processing of special category biometric personal data as a method of access control (entry and exit) to its sports centers. This provisional measure must be implemented within ten business days from the notification of this agreement to open the procedure and will remain in place until its final resolution, at which point it must be confirmed, modified, or lifted. To this end, it must justify its compliance with this request before the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

THIRD: APPOINT S.S.S. as instructor. and, as secretary, R.R.R.,
indicating that they may be challenged, if applicable, in accordance with the provisions of
Articles 23 and 24 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector (LRJSP).

FOURTH: INCORPORATE into the file, for evidentiary purposes, the claim filed by the complaining party and its documentation, as well as the documents obtained and generated by the Subdirectorate General of Data Inspection in the actions prior to the initiation of this sanctioning procedure.

FIFTH: THAT for the purposes provided for in art. 64.2 b) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations, the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 88/93

The sanction that may be imposed would be an administrative fine of the following amounts, without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation:
- For the alleged violation of Article 9 of the GDPR, a fine of

80,000 euros.
- For the alleged violation of Article 35 of the GDPR, a fine of
50,000 euros.
- For the alleged violation of Article 13 of the GDPR, a fine of
30,000 euros.

All of which amounts to a total of 160,000 euros (ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND EUROS).

SIXTH: NOTIFY this agreement to SIDECU, S.A., with Tax Identification Number (NIF) A15435092,
granting it a hearing period of ten business days to formulate any allegations and present any evidence it deems appropriate. In your written allegations, you must provide your Tax Identification Number (NIF) and the procedure number shown in the heading of this document.

In accordance with the provisions of Article 85 of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Code), you may acknowledge your liability within the period granted for submitting allegations to this initiation agreement; this will result in a 20% reduction in the sanction to be imposed in this proceeding. With the application of this reduction, the sanction would be set at €128,000, and the procedure would be resolved with the imposition of this sanction.

Likewise, you may, at any time prior to the resolution of this proceeding, voluntarily pay the proposed sanction, which will result in a 20% reduction in its amount. With the application of this reduction, the sanction would be set at €128,000, and its payment would imply the termination of the procedure, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding measures.

The reduction for voluntary payment of the fine is cumulative with the reduction applicable for acknowledgment of liability, provided that this acknowledgment of liability is made clear within the period granted for submitting allegations upon opening the procedure. Voluntary payment of the amount referred to in the preceding paragraph may be made at any time prior to the resolution. In this case, if both reductions were to be applied, the amount of the fine would be set at €96,000.

In any case, the effectiveness of either of the aforementioned reductions will be conditional upon the express withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the fine.

For these purposes, if the applicant chooses either of them, the applicant must send to the Subdirectorate General for Data Inspection express notification of the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the fine, indicating which of the two reductions is being applied, or whether both are being applied.

If you choose to voluntarily pay any of the amounts indicated above (€128,000 or €96,000), you must do so by paying it into account number: C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

SECOND: On May 20, 2025, SIDECU proceeded to pay the fine in the amount of €96,000.00, making use of the two reductions provided for in the initiation agreement transcribed above, for prompt payment and for acknowledgment of liability in relation to the events referred to in the initiation agreement and their legal classification.

THIRD: The initiation agreement transcribed above indicated that, if the infringement was confirmed, it could be agreed that the controller would be required to adopt appropriate measures to bring its actions into compliance with the regulations mentioned in this act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 58.2 d) of the GDPR, according to which each supervisory authority may "order the controller or processor to ensure that processing operations comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specific manner and within a specified period...".

Having acknowledged responsibility for the infringement, the measures included in the initiation agreement may be imposed.

FOURTH: Likewise, in the transcribed initiation agreement, SIDECU was ordered, as a provisional measure, to temporarily suspend all processing of special category biometric personal data as a method of access control (entry and exit) to its sports centers, in accordance with the provisions of Article 69 of the LOPDGDD.

FIFTH: In the letter of May 20, 2025, SIDECU acknowledges liability, waives the right to take legal action, and requests "a postponement and extension of the deadline to prove and justify to the Agency the cessation of the use of the access method that gave rise to this case and its replacement with the new access method, until July 1, 2025, in order to have all appropriate means for its use."

LEGAL BASIS

I
Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR) and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 91/93

the matter. Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II
Termination of the Procedure

Article 85 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), under the heading

"Termination of Sanctioning Procedures" provides the following:

"1. Once a sanctioning procedure has been initiated, if the offender acknowledges responsibility, the procedure may be terminated with the imposition of the appropriate sanction.

2. When the sanction is solely monetary in nature, or when one monetary sanction and another non-monetary sanction may be imposed, but the inadmissibility of the latter has been justified, voluntary payment by the alleged offender, at any time prior to the resolution, will entail the termination of the procedure, except with regard to restoring the altered situation or determining compensation for damages caused by the commission of the violation.

3. In both cases, when the sanction is solely monetary in nature, the competent body responsible for resolving the procedure will apply reductions of at least 20% on the amount of the proposed sanction, which may be combined.
These reductions must be specified in the notification of initiation of the procedure, and their effectiveness will be conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the sanction.

The percentage reduction provided for in this section may be increased by regulation.

III
Voluntary Payment and Acknowledgment of Responsibility

In accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 85 of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Protection Act), the notified initiation agreement provided information on the possibility of acknowledging responsibility and voluntarily paying the proposed penalty, which would entail two cumulative reductions of 20% each. With the application of these two reductions, the penalty would be set at €96,000.00, and its payment would imply the termination of the procedure, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding measures.

Following notification of the aforementioned initiation agreement, SIDECU has proceeded to acknowledge responsibility and voluntarily pay the penalty, availing itself of the two reductions provided. In accordance with section 3 of Article 85

28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 92/93

LPACAP, the effectiveness The payment of the aforementioned reductions will be conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the sanction.

It should be noted that, in accordance with the provisions of the LPACAP, as well as the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on this matter, the exercise of voluntary payment by the alleged offender does not exempt the administration from the obligation to resolve and notify all proceedings, regardless of their initiation. Similarly, Article 88 of the aforementioned law establishes that the resolution that concludes the procedure will decide all issues raised by the interested parties and any other issues arising from it.

Therefore, in accordance with applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for graduating the sanctions, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: TO DECLARE the commission of the violations and CONFIRM the sanctions determined in the operative section of the transcribed initiation agreement. in this

resolution.

The sum of the aforementioned amounts amounts to a total of 160,000.00 euros.

After SIDECU, S.A. made prompt payment and acknowledged liability, pursuant to Article 85 of the LPACAP, a 40% reduction is made to the aforementioned total, resulting in the final amount of 96,000.00 euros.

The effectiveness of the aforementioned reductions is subject, in all cases, to the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal.
