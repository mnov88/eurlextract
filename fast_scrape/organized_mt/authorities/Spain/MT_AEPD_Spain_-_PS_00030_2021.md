## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against Vodafone as they received a phone call with commercial purposes from the company after signing up for the Robinson list.

The AEPD launched an investigation and discovered that the call had been made from Xfera Móviles, who acted on behalf of Vodafone on marketing activities (as a processor, as determined by the DPA). Xfera alleged that there had been an error when filtering the phone numbers of the Robinson list.

Additionally, it was proven that the agreements carried out between Vodafone and Xfera, there was no indication on how to process the data so it was in line with the Robinson list and included phone numbers were not used for commercial purposes.

### Holding

Firstly, the AEPD concluded that, according to Article 23(4) of the [Spanish Data Protection Act](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673), controllers have the obligation to consult exclusion lists, such as the Robinson list, before carrying out any commercial communications, to ensure that they are effective for their purposes.

Secondly, the AEPD concluded that Vodafone is undoubtedly a controller, as they determine the purposes and means of the data processing that Xfera carries out on their behalf.

In this regard, the AEPD remarked that the data controller must have absolute control over the data processing operations carried out by the processor, and must not only previously check the organisational and technical means that they have implemented, but also carry out the necessary subsequent audits in order to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of data subjects in the processing operations carried out in the name and on behalf of the data controller are respected. Thus, it is a continuous obligation, that is alive during the whole duration of the agreement and data processing.

Vodafone is therefore, as a controller, responsible of ensuring that the processing activities carried out by Xfera, the processor, comply with the GDPR. In this regard, the AEPD also noted the accountability and proactive responsibility from Article 5(2) that the GDPR entails. And such accountability applies to any data processing that is carried out in the interest of the controller, regardless whether it is materially carried out by the controller or by a processor.

Hence, the DPA concluded that there had been a violation of Article 28 GDPR due to the lack of diligence of Vodafone in ensuring that the processor they contracted with had implemented and continued to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure compliance with the GDPR.

Because of this, the AEPD fined Vodafone €100,000.

In order to assess the amount of the fine, the DPA took into account:

*   The relation between the controller's business activities and the processing of the data.
*   The size of the company: over 4000 employees and €1600 billion turnover.
*   The lack of adequate measures.
*   The existence of more than 50 previous sanctioning proceedings against the same controller.

                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                           I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director
of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and to
solve this procedure.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/24

In relation to the allegations made by the person in charge after the initiation agreement,
are answered in the following terms:

1R) It should be noted that the object of the claim is not due directly to the
receiving an unwanted call, but a call to a line registered in the
advertising exclusion list since 08/03/2018, violating the provisions of art
23 of the LOPDGDD.

As developed in the Fundamentals of Law, the person in charge must have

absolute control over the data processing that is the object of the order, not only
previously check the organizational and technical means available to the
entity in charge, but to carry out the necessary subsequent audits in order to guarantee
the rights and freedoms of those affected in the treatments carried out in
name and on behalf of the person in charge.

2R) As indicated in the Fundamentals of Law, the imputation to VDF in the
This sanctioning procedure does not exonerate other entities from liability
involved in the processing of data of responsibility VDF and object of order
to other entities as those in charge, although each one must be responsible for its
conduct contrary to the RGPD, where appropriate, in separate procedures.

3R) In the present case, VDF is responsible for the treatments carried out
by the entities in charge of them. The publicity call received by the
claimant being included in Adigital's Robinson advertising exclusion list
should have been avoided by applying effective organizational and technical means in hiring

of the person in charge (s), that there is no evidence that they were implanted.

4R) VDF alleges that managers must present themselves to potential clients
in her name. Without prejudice to the internal rules of courtesy in the face of a potential
client, it should be noted that the treatment object of analysis is carried out on behalf of and

on behalf of VDF at all times, regardless of the databases that
are used.

5R) Regarding the call routing system through the VDF trunk,
It should be noted that its efficacy is not established since in the present case it has not been
made or verified the correct filtering of calls with the exclusion list

Adigital advertising.

5, 6 and 7R) In addition, as stated by VDF in other proceedings, said system
routing was supposed to be activated in February 2020 and now VDF claims that it did not
will be effective until February 2021, which denotes a serious lack of diligence on the

commercial activity carried out by those in charge of the treatment in the name and by
VDF account.

8.1R) As has already been reiterated, regarding the application of the aggravating factor of art 76.1.b)
of the LOPDGDD in relation to art 83.2.k) of the RGPD, its application is evident

since VDF is one of the largest telecommunications operators in the country and
acts as responsible for the data being processed in its campaigns
advertising to attract customers and, in the present case, acting without the diligence
due in the hiring and monitoring of entities in charge.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/24

8.2R) It should be emphasized that VDF is responsible for the treatments object of
analysis in this proceeding, as proven by the proven facts and

It is developed in the Fundamentals of Law.

8.3R) It should be noted that article 83.2.e) of the RGPD indicates as an aggravating factor: “all
infringement… ”, that is, the repetition of conduct contrary to the regulations of
competition the AEPD.

                                            III

In relation to the allegations made by the person in charge after the initiation agreement,
are answered in the following terms:

   1R) VDF is not responsible for the treatments carried out by its "collaborators
   … That use their own databases in the development of their own activity ”.

From the definition of data controller in art. 4.7 of RGPD, it is established that VDF
It is the one that determines the purposes and means of the treatment. In the present case, it consists
that Vamavi materializes the call to the claimant in the name and on behalf of VDF

as stated in the contract signed between both entities in September 2019.
In the following Fundamentals of Law, the concept of responsible person is specified.
of the treatment, in charge of the treatment and the obligations of one and the other according to
provides art. 28 of the GDPR. Consequently, the claim must be rejected.

   2R) The AEPD has investigated the calling numbering and has concluded that the
   It is owned by the Vamavi entity, an entity that has acknowledged having
   made the call to the claimant to promote VDF services. Is
   entity has identified before the Agency as a subagent of Solivesa.

As stated in the proven facts of this resolution, the allegation must
be rejected since it is proven that VDF and Vamavi signed a contract
direct and independent (in September 2019) of the previously subscribed with
Solivesa, for which reason in the present case Vamavi acted as the person in charge of the
treatment on behalf of and on behalf of VDF in making the call to
claimant on January 31, 2020. Consequently, making the call

commercial by Vamavi in the name and on behalf of VDF (responsible) on the date
01/31/2020 when the claimant was included in the advertising exclusion list
Róbinson de Adigital since 08/03/2018, it is the total responsibility of VDF by not
have had due diligence in ordering and insuring previously and throughout
the period of execution of the contract that your manager (Vamavi) deleted the records

included in Adigital's Róbinson advertising exclusion list, as provided
art 28 of the RGPD and art. 23 of the LOPDGDD.

                                            IV
Article 24 of the RGPD establishes the following:

<Responsibility of the person responsible for the treatment

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/24

1. Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing
as well as risks of varying probability and severity to the rights and
freedoms of natural persons, the data controller will apply measures

appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee and be able to demonstrate that the
treatment is in accordance with this Regulation. These measures will be reviewed and
will update when necessary.

2. When they are provided in relation to the treatment activities, between
the measures mentioned in section 1 shall include the application, by the

responsible for the treatment, of the appropriate data protection policies.

3. Adherence to codes of conduct approved pursuant to article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may be used
as elements to demonstrate compliance with the obligations by the

responsible for the treatment.>

Report 0064/2020 of the Legal Office of the AEPD has emphatically expressed
that “The RGPD has meant a paradigm shift when addressing the regulation of the
right to the protection of personal data, which is based on the
principle of "accountability" or "proactive responsibility" as stated

repeatedly the AEPD (Report 17/2019, among many others) and is included in the
Statement of reasons for Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of
Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (LOPDGDD) ”.

The aforementioned report continues that “… the criteria on how to attribute the different

roles remain the same (section 11), reiterates that these are concepts
functional, which aim to assign responsibilities according to the roles
of the parties (section 12), which implies that in most cases
should be addressed to the circumstances of the specific case (case by case) according to
their actual activities rather than the formal designation of an actor as

"responsible" or "manager" (for example, in a contract), as well as concepts
self-employed, whose interpretation must be carried out under the protection of European regulations
on the protection of personal data (section 13), and taking into account (section
24) that the need for a factual assessment also means that the role of a
responsible for the treatment does not derive from the nature of an entity that is
processing data but of their specific activities in a specific context… ”.

The concepts of controller and processor are not formal, but
functional and must attend to the specific case. The designation by VDF of
"Responsible for the treatment" to its collaborators, does not automatically grant them
such condition.

The person responsible for the treatment is so from the moment he decides the purposes and
means of treatment, not losing this condition the fact of leaving a certain margin of
action to the person in charge of the treatment or for not having access to the databases of the
in charge.

This is undoubtedly expressed in the Guidelines 07/2020 of the European Committee on
Data Protection (CEPD) on the concepts of data controller and
in charge of the RGPD -the translation is ours-, “A data controller is
who determines the purposes and means of the treatment, that is, the why and the

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/24

how of the treatment. The controller must decide on both
purposes and means. However, some more practical aspects of the
implementation ("nonessential media") can be left to the manager

treatment. It is not necessary for the controller to actually have access to the
data that is being processed to qualify as responsible ".

In the present case, it is established that VDF is the data controller now
analyzed (call to the claimant on date \*\*\* DATE.1 made by Vamavi in
quality of data controller in the name and on behalf of VDF) since,

As defined in article 4.7 of the RGPD, it is the entity that determines the purpose and means
of the treatments carried out in direct marketing actions of the person in charge.
Therefore, in its capacity as data controller, it is obliged to comply with
the provisions of the transcribed article 24 of the RGPD and, especially, regarding the control
effective and continued “appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to

guarantee and be able to demonstrate that the treatment is in accordance with the present
Regulation ”among which are those provided in article 28 of the RGPD in
relationship with those in charge of the treatments who act in the name and on behalf of
VDF.

In this sense, and in relation to the allegation made by VDF in its brief of

allegations that those responsible for the treatments that the entities
those in charge carry out on behalf of VDF and, therefore, those that have
of their own files, they do not act as managers but rather as managers.
responsible for these treatments, it should be noted that in the Guidelines 07/2020
of the European Data Protection Committee (CEPD) on the concepts of

data controller and person in charge of the RGPD - the translation is ours -, “42.
It is not necessary for the controller to actually have access to the
data being processed. Whoever outsources a treatment activity and, at the
to do so, has a determining influence on the purpose and (essential) means of the
treatment (for example, adjusting the parameters of a service in such a way that

influences whose personal data will be processed), should be considered as
responsible although he will never have real access to the data ”. Remember that VDF
determines who the calls can be made to, as they cannot be made to
who are already clients of the company, as well as filtering regarding lists of
advertising exclusion (Robinson ADigital) or whatever corresponds with respect to the exercise
opposition (internal Robinson).

Likewise, following the legal report of the AEPD dated 11/20/2019, with
internal reference 0007/2019 and STS 1562/2020 (for all), we must point out that
analyzes the legal figure of the data controller from the perspective of the RGPD
that regulates it exclusively.

Article 28 of the RGPD establishes the following:

protection of the rights of the interested party.

2. The person in charge of the treatment will not resort to another person in charge without prior authorization
in writing, specific or general, of the person in charge. In the latter case, the person in charge

to such changes.

3. The treatment by the person in charge will be governed by a contract or other legal act with
according to the law of the Union or of the Member States, that binds the person in charge

The definition of 'processor' includes a wide range of actors, since
be they natural or legal persons, public authorities, agencies or other bodies.

The existence of a data processor depends on a decision taken by the
data controller (VDF), who may decide to carry out certain
treatment operations or contract all or part of the treatment with a
in charge.

The essence of the role of "processor" is that personal data

are processed in the name and on behalf of the person responsible for the treatment. In practice,
It is the person in charge who determines the purpose and the means, at least the essential ones,
while the processor has a function of providing services to the
Responsible for the Treatment. In other words, "acting in the name and on behalf of
of the person responsible for the treatment »means that the person in charge of the treatment

service of the interest of the controller in carrying out a task
specific and that, therefore, follows the instructions established by the person responsible for the
treatment, at least with regard to the purpose and essential means of the
entrusted treatment.

Article 28, section 1, of the RGPD establishes that “When a

treatment on behalf of a data controller, he will choose only a
manager that offers sufficient guarantees to apply technical measures and
appropriate organizational, so that the treatment is in accordance with the
requirements of this Regulation and guarantee the protection of the rights of the
interested".

The obligation provided for in article 28.1 of the RGPD -to select a person in charge of the
treatment that offers sufficient guarantees to guarantee the application of the
Regulation and the rights and freedoms of the interested party - it is not exhausted in the action
prior to the selection and hiring of the treatment manager. This forces the
responsible for the treatment to be evaluated at all times during the entire execution

of the contract if the guarantees (technical or organizational) offered by the person in charge of the
treatment are sufficient to guarantee the rights and freedoms of the
interested.

The 07/2020 Guidelines of the European Data Protection Committee (CEPD) on the
concepts of data controller and processor in the RGPD -translation is

ours- have, without a doubt, that “97. The obligation to use only the
processors "who provide sufficient guarantees" contained in the
Article 28 (1) of the GDPR is a continuous obligation. It does not end in the
moment in which the controller and the person in charge of the treatment conclude a contract or
another legal act. Instead, the controller should, at appropriate intervals, verify the

assurances from the manager, including through audits and inspections when
corresponds ”.

And this, because the person responsible for the treatment is the one who has the obligation to guarantee
the application of data protection regulations and the protection of the rights of

interested parties, as well as being able to prove it (articles 5.2, 24, 28 and 32 of the
GDPR). The control of compliance with the law extends throughout the
treatment, from start to finish. The person responsible for the treatment must
Act, in any case, diligently, consciously, committed and actively.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 15/24

This mandate of the legislator is independent of whether the treatment is carried out
directly the person in charge of the treatment or that it carries out using a

in charge of the treatment. Where the Law does not distinguish, we cannot distinguish ourselves.

In addition, the treatment carried out materially by a person in charge of treatment by
account of the data controller belongs to the sphere of action of this
Lastly, in the same way as if he did it directly himself. The person in charge of
Treatment, in the case examined, is an extension of the person responsible for the

treatment.

The data controller has the obligation to integrate and deploy the protection
of data within everything that constitutes your organization, in all its areas. I know
must bear in mind that, ultimately, the determining purpose is to

guarantee the protection of the interested party.

Interpret it in the opposite sense - the obligations that article 28 of the RGPD imposes
to the data controller are limited to verifying the capabilities of the processor ab
initio and to sign the contract of the data controller - not only would they contravene the
current legislation constituting a clearly fraudulent action, but rather

would violate the spirit and purpose of the GDPR.

In light of the principle of proactive responsibility (art 5.2 RGPD), the person responsible for the
treatment must be able to demonstrate that it has taken into account all the elements
provided for in the RGPD. In the present case, VDF has disregarded the

hiring by the entity in charge of the initially entrusted treatments.

The data controller must take into account whether the data controller
provides adequate documentation that demonstrates such compliance,
privacy protection, file management policies, privacy policies

information security, external audit reports, certifications,
management of the exercise of rights ... etc.

The controller must also take into account the knowledge
specialized technicians of the person in charge of the treatment, the reliability and its resources.
Only if the controller can demonstrate (principle of responsibility

proactive of article 5.2 of the RGPD) that the person in charge of the treatment is adequate during
the entire treatment phase (at all times) to carry out the order
entrusted may enter into a binding agreement that meets the requirements of the
Article 28 of the RGPD, without prejudice to the fact that the controller must follow
complying with the principle of accountability and periodically checking the

compliance of the manager and the measures in use. Before outsourcing a treatment
and in order to avoid possible violations of rights and freedoms of those affected, the
data controller must enter into a contract, another legal act or an agreement
binding with the other entity that establishes clear and precise obligations regarding
of data protection (in this case there is a contract of September 2019

with Vamavi).

The person in charge of the treatment can only carry out treatments on the instructions
documented data of the person in charge, unless he is obliged to do so by the Law

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 16/24

of the Union or a Member State, which is not the case. The person in charge of the treatment
It also has the obligation to collaborate with the person in charge in guaranteeing the rights
of the interested parties and comply with the obligations of the person responsible for the treatment of

in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 28 of the RGPD (and related).

Therefore, it is insisted that the person responsible for the treatment must establish
clear modalities for such assistance and give precise instructions to the person in charge of the
treatment on how to comply with them properly and document it prior to
through a contract or another (binding) agreement and check all

moment of the development of the contract, its fulfillment in the manner established in the
same.

However, despite the obligations of the person in charge, article 28 of the RGPD
seems to suggest that the responsibility of the processor remains

limited compared to the responsibility of the controller. On
In other words, although controllers may, in principle, be
responsible for the damages derived from any infraction related to the
processing of personal data (including those that have been committed by the
processor) or breach of contract or other agreement (binding)
Managers may be held liable when they have acted upon

margin of the mandate granted by the controller, or have not complied
your own contractual obligations or under the GDPR. In these cases, the
data controller can be considered fully or partially responsible for
the "part" of the processing operation in which you participate. You will only be in charge
fully responsible when fully responsible for the damages

caused in terms of the rights and freedoms of the affected parties; everything
This, without avoiding the responsibility in which the person responsible for the treatment has
incurred in order to avoid them.

In the present case, and in accordance with the content of the signed contract, the investigated # 2

acts in a manager capacity whenever, according to the definition, they act
fully in the name and on behalf of the person in charge (VDF) for all purposes in
data protection matters. It is enough to bring up the content of the already
mentioned STS 1562/2020 (by all), which states the following:

<< In this sense, and the Judgment of the Supreme Court of June 5, 2004, which

confirms, on appeal for Uni ﬁ cation of Doctrine, that of this AN of October 16,
2003, echoing what was argued by this Chamber, refers to the differentiation of two
responsible depending on whether the decision-making power is directed to the file or to the
data treatment. Thus, the person responsible for the file is the one who decides the creation of the file.
file and its application, and also its purpose, content and use, that is, who has

decision-making capacity on all the data registered in said file.

The person responsible for the treatment, however, is the subject to whom the
decisions about the specific activities of a certain data processing,
that is, on a specific application. It would be all those assumptions in

those that the power of decision must be differentiated from the material realization of the
activity that integrates the treatment.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 17/24

With this, as the STS of April 26, 2005 also argues (appeal for
uni ﬁ cation of doctrine 217/2004), the Spanish legislator intends to adapt to the
requirements of Directive 95/46 / EC, which aims to provide a legal response to the

The phenomenon, which is becoming more and more frequent, of the so-called externalization of
IT services, where multiple operators operate, many of them
insolvent, created with the aim of seeking impunity or irresponsibility of the
that follow him in the next links of the chain.

Currently, the new Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the

Council of April 27, 2016, regarding the protection of natural persons in the
regarding the processing of personal data (repealing the Directive
95/46 / CE, and directly applicable as of May 25, 2018) also distinguishes
between the figures of the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment. The first is defined
in paragraph 7) of article 4 as "natural or legal person (...) that determines the

purposes and means of the treatment ". And the person in charge of treatment in section 8) of the
same article 4 as the one that "processes personal data on behalf of the person in charge
treatment ".

This in relation to Articles 24 and 28 of the same European Regulation of
Data Protection. Responsible for and in charge of the data processing that, without place

doubtless, they are also responsible for infractions in terms of protection
of data, in such a new regulatory framework, in accordance with the provisions of article
82.2 of the repeated Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in which: «Any person responsible
who participates in the treatment operation will be liable for damages
caused in the event that said operation does not comply with the provisions of the present

Regulation. A manager will only be liable for damages.
caused by the treatment when it has not complied with the obligations of the
these Regulations specifically addressed to those in charge or has acted at the
margin or against the legal instructions of the person in charge ".

It follows from all the above that the concurrence, in the present case, of a
ZZZZ processor in no way exempts the entity from liability
XXXX now recurring, and this despite the forcefulness of the clauses that appear
in the contract and annex thereto signed by both companies (proven facts 9 and
10) insofar as the personal data processed was for the purpose of carrying out

(XXXX), ultimately for the benefit of said XXXX, such plaintiff being the one that, in
last term, determines the purposes and means of repeated data processing, therefore
that it cannot be exonerated of responsibility. >>
The STS continues, in relation to the possible exoneration of alleged responsibility
Regarding what is subscribed in the contract of "person in charge of the treatment", the following:

<< The sanctioned conduct of obstruction or impediment by XXXX of the exercise
by his client of the right of opposition to the treatment of his data, is manifested in
that said company did not adopt any kind of measure or precaution to avoid the
sending advertising to your client's email addresses by

starting with the data of your own files, but with databases of other
companies hired by XXXX, and in this case it was proven that the appellant

did not communicate to the companies with which it contracted the performance of
publicity the opposition of the complainant to receive publicity from the Mutual, nor in short
made any provision to ensure the exclusion of its customer from shipments
advertising contracted with third parties >> and as in the present case,
resulting in the called line included in the advertising exclusion lists from the
08/03/2018.

Consequently, it must be concluded that the treatment analyzed in the antecedents
in its various forms by the person in charge, the person responsible for the treatment is
Vodafone Spain, S.A.U. (VDF) and acting as manager that other
entity that acts in the name and on behalf of and for the benefit of VDF (Vamavi).

Of the documentation in the file that is mentioned in the
present resolution from the information collected by the Inspection of this
AEPD and VDF's own acts and manifestations, the breach is accredited by
VDF as responsible for the treatments entrusted to the effective control and
continued in time of the measures provided in the above transcribed art 28 of the

GDPR.

In this regard, add that the obligation provided in article 28.3.h) RGPD, using in the
at the beginning, the imperative term "will put" referring to the person in charge of the treatment,
Obligation to "demand" from the person in charge "compliance with the obligations

established in this article, as well as to allow and contribute to the realization
of audits, including inspections, by the manager or another auditor
authorized by said person in charge. "

Thus, it is established that those in charge of the treatment (and in its case successive

sub-processors) acting in the name and on behalf of VDF do not offer the guarantees
sufficient to apply the appropriate technical and organizational measures to the treatment
commissioned by VDF. Nor are the VDF duly documented
entrusted tasks that carry out the treatments in the name and on behalf of the
responsible (VDF).

VDF, as the data controller, does not know under what conditions it hires a
commissioned to act on his own behalf and under his specific specifications
-that do not exist in terms of the crossing and exclusion of lines called included
previously in robinson Adigital- and accept in these conditions and without qualms this
conduct even having knowledge of this anomaly.

Nothing appears in the relationship between VDF and managers regarding the requirements
listed in the aforementioned art 28.3 which, in summary, are specified in defining
previously by the person responsible for the treatment (VDF) the object, duration, nature,
purpose, types of data, categories, obligations and rights of the interested parties, and

mandatory powers of continuous control ... etc. Only on specific occasions
cites having informally communicated one or other specific guidelines for action without
that this implies any effective control of VDF with the entrusted treatments
on your own and in your name.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 19/24

Therefore, non-compliance with data protection regulations must be
also imputed, and in the first place, to the person responsible for the treatment (VDF) by not acting

clearly, actively and effectively in stipulating and enforcing the specifications
timely to carry out the treatment adequately in time
entrusted in his name.

The foregoing, without prejudice to the responsibilities incurred by the
entities in charge and sub-entrusted of the treatments that must be settled in

other procedures, which to date have already been resolved.

Consequently, there is no evidence that VDF has carried out continuous monitoring during
the entire cycle of execution of the treatments ordered despite the numerous
known claims and ongoing investigations carried out by AEPD and

which VDF has full knowledge of
