With the above-mentioned conduct of the respondent, the power of investigation that the
Article 58(1) of the RGPD confers on the supervisory authorities, in this case, the AEPD,
has been hampered.
Therefore, the facts described in the "Facts" section are deemed
constitute an infringement, attributable to the defendant, for violation of Article
58.1 of the RGPD, which provides that each supervisory authority shall have, among its
investigative powers:
"(a) to order the controller and the processor and, where appropriate, the

This infraction is typified in Article 83.5.e) of the RGPD, which considers
such as: 'failure to provide access in breach of Article 58(1)'.
The same Article states that this infringement may be penalised
with a fine of twenty million euros (20,000,000 euros) maximum or, in the case of
a company, for an amount equivalent to a maximum of four percent (4%) of
total annual turnover for the previous financial year, opting for the
of higher value.
For the purposes of the limitation period of the infringements, the alleged infringement
prescribes after three years, in accordance with Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which qualifies as
very serious the following behavior:
"(ñ) Failure to provide access by staff of the data protection authority
competent to personal data, information, premises, equipment and means of
processing required by the data protection authority to
the exercise of their powers of investigation.
(o) Resistance to or obstruction of the exercise of the inspection function by

In the event that the proceedings are opened, it is considered that the defendant should be charged with
the violation of Article 58.1 of the RGPD typified in Article 83.5 e) of the RGPD. The
The sanction that should be imposed is an administrative fine.
The fine to be imposed must, in each individual case, be effective,
proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with Article 83.1 of the RGPD.
Consequently, the sanction to be imposed should be graduated according to the criteria
established by Article 83.2 of the RGPD, and with the provisions of Article 76 of the
LOPDGDD, with respect to paragraph k) of the aforementioned Article 83.2 RGPD.

established by Article 83.2 of the RGPD, and with the provisions of Article 76 of the
LOPDGDD, with respect to paragraph k) of the aforementioned Article 83.2 RGPD.
The initial assessment shows that no
The following facts have been considered to be aggravating
- Art. 83.2(b) RGPD: the intentionality or negligence in the infringement. These are
of a company that is not newly created and should have
procedures established for the fulfilment of the obligations that
provides for the data protection regulations, among them, to respond to
the requirements of the supervisory authority.
- Art. 83.2(k) RGPD: any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the
circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits obtained or
losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement. The
complaint refers to a person's particular case, but the
data processing to which it refers, can potentially affect a
very high number of customers of the responsible entity or users of the
service provided by the responsible entity.
Therefore, on the basis of the above,
By the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
