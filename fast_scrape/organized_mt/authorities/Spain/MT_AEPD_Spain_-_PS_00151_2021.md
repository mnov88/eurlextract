## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a data subject with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) stating that, after being a guest in a hotel, they they were warned about their ID card having been found, along with their personal information, on an adults website.

Also, the data subject addressed an access request access to the hotel, that informed them that the day the data subject checked in, the reception desk was closed and the person who scanned their ID card was an employee of the building's owners association, that managed the entry/exit of the guests outside opening hours.

Additionally, the DPA, while verifying the controller's website, found that its cookie banner did not have a link to the cookie policy, nor sufficient information, and used unnecessary cookies before obtaining consent, as well as did not allow to reject consent only for the unwanted cookies.

### Holding

The AEPD concluded that the defendant had infringed Article 28(3) of the GDPR, since the controller did not have a data processing agreement with the processor (building's owners association) to govern the processing of personal data. Consequently, the AEPD fined the controller €5000 for the infringement of Article 28(3) GDPR.

Besides that, AEPD fined the controller €2000 for infringing Article 22 of the Spanish Law implementing the e-Privacy Directive (LSSI), for not properly informing the users about the use of cookies and for placing unnecessary cookies without consent, without the possibility of individually rejecting them.

In total, the AEPD fined the controller €7000, that were reduced to €4200 due to early and voluntary payment and recognizing its responsibility.

In the present case, this Agency has been able to verify, regarding the policy of
privacy of the reported website that, through the link in the part

top of the main page, <<contact>>, the web redirects the user to a form
where you can enter personal data, such as name, email.
Before being able to send the form, the user must check the box that they have read and
Accepted the privacy policy and the legal notice.

For its part, on the "Privacy Policy" page of the web, it is provided

information on the identification of the data controller; the
purpose of data collection and the legal basis for it; the possible recipients
of the data; the rights of users with regard to the treatment of their
personal data and how to exercise them and on the security measures of the web, toto
this based on the legislation in force at this time.

Therefore, according to the evidence available at this time, according to

    - About the "Cookies Policy" of the website of your ownership:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

    a) .- On the installation of cookies on the terminal equipment prior to consent:

Article 22.2 of the LSSI establishes that information must be provided to users

clear and complete information on the use of storage devices and
data recovery and, in particular, on the purposes of data processing.
This information must be provided in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR. Therefore,
When the use of a cookie involves a treatment that enables the
identification of the user, those responsible for the treatment must ensure the
compliance with the requirements established by the regulations on the protection of

data.

However, it is necessary to point out that they are exempt from compliance with the
Obligations established in article 22.2 of the LSSI those necessary cookies
for the intercommunication of the terminals and the network and those that provide a service

expressly requested by the user.

In this sense, the GT29, in its Opinion 4/201210, interpreted that among cookies
excepted would be the User's input Cookies ”(those used to
fill in forms, or as a management of a shopping cart); cookies from
authentication or user identification (session); user security cookies

(those used to detect erroneous and repeated attempts to connect to a site
Web); media player session cookies; session cookies to balance
load; cookies for customization of the user interface and some of
complement (plug-in) to exchange social content. These cookies would remain
excluded from the scope of application of article 22.2 of the LSSI, and, therefore, it would not be

necessary to inform or obtain consent on its use.

On the contrary, it will be necessary to inform and obtain the prior consent of the user
before the use of any other type of cookies, both first and
third party, session or persistent.

In the verification carried out by this Agency on the claimed website, it was possible to
verify that, when entering the main page and without taking any action on the
itself and without accepting cookies, unnecessary cookies were used, both own
as third parties.

       b) .- On the cookie information banner existing in the first layer
       (Homepage):

The first layer cookie banner must include information regarding the
identification of the editor responsible for the website, in the event that your data

identifiers do not appear in other sections of the page or that your identity cannot
detach in an obvious way from the site itself. It should also include a
Generic identification of the purposes of the cookies that will be used and if they are
own or also from third parties, without it being necessary to identify them in this first
cap. In addition, it must include generic information about the type of data to be

collect and use in the event that user profiles are drawn up and must include
information and the way in which the user can accept, configure and reject the
use of cookies, with the warning, where appropriate, that, if a
certain action, it will be understood that the user accepts the use of cookies.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/18

Apart from the generic information about cookies, in this banner there must be a
clearly visible link directed to a second informational layer on the use of the

cookies "Cookies Policy". This same link may be used to lead to the
user to the "Configuration Panel" of cookies, provided that access to the panel of
configuration is direct, that is, the user does not have to navigate within the
second layer to locate it.

In the case that concerns us, the banner of information on cookies existing in the

first layer of the web does not inform that they will use their own cookies and
third parties.

       c) .- On consent to the use of unnecessary cookies:

For the use of non-necessary cookies, it will be necessary to obtain the
express consent of the user. This consent can be obtained
by clicking on, "accept" or inferring it from an unequivocal action performed by the
user that denotes that the consent has been unequivocally produced.

Therefore, the mere inactivity of the user, scrolling or browsing the website, is not

will consider for these purposes, a clear affirmative action in any circumstance and not
will imply the provision of consent by itself. Similarly, access to
control panel, if the information is presented in layers, as well as the navigation
necessary for the user to manage their preferences in relation to cookies in
the control panel, it is not considered an active behavior that can

derive the acceptance of cookies.

If the option is to go to the cookie control panel (second layer) for management
of cookies in granular form, there should be two more buttons, one for
<<accept>> all cookies or, where appropriate, save the chosen cookie selection and

another to <<reject>> all cookies.

If the user saves their choice without having selected any group of cookies, the
you will understand that you have rejected all cookies. In relation to this possibility, in
In no case are the boxes pre-marked in favor of accepting cookies admissible.

If for the configuration of cookies, the web refers to the configuration of the browser
installed in the terminal equipment, this option is considered complementary to
obtain consent, but not as the only mechanism. Therefore, if the publisher
opts for this option, it must also offer and in any case, a mechanism that
allow you to reject the use of cookies and / or do it in a granular way.

The withdrawal of the consent previously given by the user must be able to be
done at any time. To this end, the publisher must offer a mechanism that
allow permanent access to the management or configuration system of cookies.

If the management system or configuration of the publisher's cookies does not allow to avoid the
use of third-party cookies once accepted by the user, it will be facilitated
information about the tools provided by the browser and third parties,
It should be noted that, if the user accepts third-party cookies and subsequently wishes to

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/18

delete them, you must do it from your own browser or the system enabled by the
third parties for it.

In the present case, the banner on the main page redirects the user to the
"Cookie policy" (second layer), for more information, but in this
second layer, the web refers to the user when configuring the browser installed on their
terminal equipment to manage cookies, there being no, on this page, any
mechanism that allows rejecting all cookies or managing them in a granular way.

       d) .- On the information provided in the second layer (Policy of
Cookies):

The web pages that use unnecessary cookies must have a page of
"Cookies Policy", where more detailed information about the

characteristics of cookies, including information on, definition and function
generic cookies (what are cookies); about the type of cookies used
and its purpose (what types of cookies are used on the website); the identification of
who uses cookies, that is, if the information obtained by cookies is processed
only by the publisher and / or also by third parties with identification of the latter; the
period of conservation of cookies in the terminal equipment; and if it is the case,

information on data transfers to third countries and the preparation of
profiles that involve automated decision making.

In the present case, the privacy policy of the website does not provide
information or identification of the cookies that will be used.

                                          IV-bis
