## English Summary

### Facts

The claimant complained to the Spanish DPA (AEPD) that he/she was still receiving invoicing emails from Vodafone España, S.A.U. despite no longer being a client. The claimant had previously complained about receiving email communications from Vodafone and the DPA had also previously sanctioned Vodafone twice for breaches of Article 6(1) GDPR regarding these same facts ([PS/00278/2019](https://lopdcumplimiento.es/biblioteca/RGPD/resoluciones/AEPD%202020-01-13%20PS-00278-2019%20sancion%20a%20Vodafone%20por%20incumplimiento%20licitud%20del%20tratamiento%20al%20enviar%20emails%20tras%20solicitar%20supresion%20datos.pdf) and [PS/00186/2020](https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/ps-00186-2020.pdf)).

Vodafone claimed that there was an error in the system that "hooked" the claimant's email address, however, this was supposedly fixed subsequent to the first two sanctions imposed by the Spanish DPA.

After receiving yet another communications from Vodafone (despite claims that the error was fixed), the claimant asked Vodafone to delete all the information it had concerning him/her from their system and to stop sending email communications to him/her. The claimant also complained to the DPA a final time.

### Dispute

Does the continuous sending of communications to a data subject that has already complained about these communications twice constitute a violation of Article 6(1) GDPR that requires a fine to be imposed?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) held that Vodafone was sending the data subject email communications without his/her consent. The DPA first outlined Article 6(1)(a) and (b) GDPR, Articles 4(11) GDPR on consent, as well as Article 6 of the Spanish Data Protection Law (LOPDGDD) on consent.

The DPA therefore held that there was a clear violation of Article 6 GDPR as Vodafone processed the data subject's personal data without a legal basis. The data subject continued to receive email communications despite no longer being a client and despite having complained twice to the Spanish DPA on these same facts.

As this was the third complaint on the same facts and the error clearly had not been solved, the Spanish DPA decided to impose a fine for a third violation of Article 6(1) GDPR. The DPA considered this a "very serious" offense due to the repetitive nature and therefore imposed a fine of €200,000. However, as Vodafone made a voluntary, early and guilty payment, this was reduced to €120,000 in accordance with Spanish national law on administrative fines.

## Comment

Interesting to note that the Spanish DPA (AEPD) had already imposed a fine of €100,000, reduced to €80,000 for voluntary, early and guilty payment, Vodafone in [PS/00186/2020](https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/ps-00186-2020.pdf).

                                 FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                                  I

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

                                                  II

        The claimed facts are specified in the treatment of the data of the
claimant by the claimed without their consent, or any other cause
legitimizing said treatment, by sending emails to your

personal account.

        Said treatment could be constitutive of an infringement of article 6, Lawfulness

of the treatment, of the RGPD that establishes that:

        "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

        a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/14

        b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the

interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
pre-contractual;

        (…) "

        In article 4 of the RGPD, Definitions, in its section 11, it states that:

        "11)" consent of the interested party ": any manifestation of free will,

specific, informed and unequivocal by which the interested party accepts, either through
a statement or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that
they concern him ”.

        Also article 6, Treatment based on the consent of the affected,
of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection

Personal and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), states
what:

        "1. In accordance with the provisions of article 4.11 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679, the consent of the affected party is understood to be any manifestation of will

free, specific, informed and unequivocal for which it accepts, either through a
declaration or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that

concern.

        2. When the data processing is intended to be based on consent

of the affected party for a plurality of purposes, it will be necessary to record in a
specific and unequivocal that said consent is granted for all of them.

        3. The execution of the contract may not be subject to the consent of the affected party
processing of personal data for purposes that are not related to the

maintenance, development or control of the contractual relationship ”.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/14

        Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the principles
basic for the treatment, including the conditions for consent in accordance with

of articles 5, 6, 7 and 9 ”is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the
mentioned Article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, “with administrative fines of

€ 20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, of an equivalent amount
at a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover of the financial year
above, opting for the highest amount ”.

        On the other hand, the LOPDGDD for the purposes of prescription states in its article 72:
“Violations considered very serious:

        1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that

suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
in particular, the following:

        (…)

        b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.

        (…) "

                                                III

        The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the

claimed violated article 6 of the RGPD, since it processed the
personal data of the claimant without having any legitimacy for it,
materialized in the referral to your email address communications with

origin in "vodafone@corp.vodafone.es" and whose subject is "you already have your
Electronic bill".

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/14

       Likewise, after the evidence obtained, it appears that at first the
claimant denounced the processing of their data after a request for

suppression. The claimant provided a response from the claimed, within the framework of a
claim before SESIAD, in which they stated that the claimant ceased to be a client

of the company (does not maintain any active service in Vodafone, or amounts
pending payment) and the last invoice issued in your name was dated May 15
2017. However, the claimant continued to receive invoice notices in the

last months of 2018, 2019 and 2020, exactly the same as those claimed in this
instead of dates September 8, 28 and October 28, 2020.

       In the sanctioning procedure PS / 00278/2019, the claimed said said
error, claiming that it was due to a computer error in their systems, the mail

The claimant's electronic mail was “hooked” and continued to be recorded in the
sending of informative communications regarding electronic invoices issued by
Vodafone, but stated that the error had already been solved and due to these facts

sanctioned the defendant. It is clear that the date of signature of the Resolution by the
Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection was on January 13, 2020 and
The date of notification to the party of the respondent took place on January 16,

2020.

    On March 11, 2020, the claimant filed a new claim against the

claimed since he had received a notice of
availability of electronic invoice from the claimed company, which

constitutes a recurrence of the facts sanctioned in the procedure
sanctioner PS / 00186/20, processed by this Agency against the claimed party.

       Based on the above, the sanctioning procedure was opened by this Agency
PS / 00186/2020, and the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, issued the
August 31, 2020, resolution of said procedure, its notification being the

same day, same month and year, for violation of article 6.1. of the RGPD typified in the
Article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned RGPD.

       Well, the claimant has once again stated that he continues to receive emails
electronic, despite resolutions PS / 00278/2019 and PS / 00186/2020.

       It is clear that the claimant has again received on September 8, 28 and 28
October 2020 in your email address a notice of availability of

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/14

electronic invoice from the claimed company, which constitutes a
recidivism of the sanctioned acts in the sanctioning procedures

PS / 00278/2019 and PS / 00186/2020, processed in this Agency against said company.

       Consequently, it has carried out a processing of personal data without
has proven that it has the legal authorization to do so.

                                                IV

       In order to establish the administrative fine to be imposed, they must

previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge in

regarding the same matter, compliance with said measures;

        j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or to mechanisms
certification approved in accordance with Article 42, and

        k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct or
indirectly, through the infringement.

        In relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, in its

Article 76, “Sanctions and corrective measures”, establishes that:

        "two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU)

2016/679 may also be taken into account:

        a) The continuing nature of the offense.

        c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the offense.

        d) The possibility that the affected person's conduct could have led to the
commission of the offense.

        e) The existence of a merger process by absorption after the commission

of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.

        f) Affecting the rights of minors.

      In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the

instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the fine sanction to
impose in the present case on the entity claimed for the offense typified in the
Article 83.5.a) of the RGPD for which the claimed person is responsible, in an assessment
initial, the following factors are considered concurrent:

    - In the present case we are facing an unintentional negligent action, but

        significant (article 83.2 b)

    - Basic personal identifiers are affected (name, surname,
        address) (article 83.2 g)

    -The evident link between the business activity of the claimed and the

        processing of personal data of clients or third parties (art. 83.2 k in
        relationship with art. 76. 2 b) of the LOPDGDD.

- Any previously committed offense (article 83.2 e).

     - The serious lack of diligence demonstrated then, after having notified the
claimant who attended to his right to object to the processing of his data, proceeded
again to send you commercial communications.

        In accordance with the indicated precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the

instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the sanction to be imposed in
In the present case, it is considered that the sanction to be imposed should be adjusted according to

with the following criteria established in article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD:

    The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with
regarding the offense committed by violating the provisions of article 6.1 of the

RGPD allows setting a penalty of 200,000 euros (two hundred thousand euros), considered
as “very serious”, for the purposes of prescription thereof, in 72.1. of the
