## English Summary

### Facts

The AEPD received a letter filed by the interested party against the respondent stating that on 20 March 2019, he addressed requesting information on the fingerprint clocking control in accordance with the provisions of the regulations on the protection of personal data, without having received a response to this request.

The AEPD initiated an investigation procedure, to which the City Council responded with a Security Document in which it reports in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR and points out, among other things, that the body used a fingerprint detection system to control presence and access to its facilities, which does not perform a biometric analysis at any time, but rather produces an identification algorithm based on a reading of several points of the personal fingerprint and that the algorithm data cannot be decrypted or disassembled by any unauthorized entity.

And in response to a new request for information, the Council sent a report including the impact assessment on the processing of fingerprint data for the control of employee presence.

### Dispute

Is the use of biometric data to monitor working time without informing data subjects a breach of Article 13 GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD held that the facts complained of involving the violation by the City Council of the provisions of Article 13 of the RGPD, by not informing of the processing provided for in relation to the fingerprint clocking control.

As the investigated party is a public administration, the AEPD applies Article 77 LOPDGDD, according to which a warning sanction must be applied when the offence is committed by a public administration.

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/13

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate

and to solve this procedure.

                                             II
        Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of
the Public Administrations, in its article 64 “Agreement of initiation in the
procedures of a sanctioning nature ”, provides:

        "1. The initiation agreement will be communicated to the instructor of the procedure, with
transfer of how many actions exist in this regard, and the interested parties will be notified,
understanding in any case the accused as such.
        Likewise, the initiation will be communicated to the complainant when the regulations

                                            III
        The legitimacy for the treatment of the fingerprint for the control of the
workers by the employer we must look for it in article 9 and 6 of the RGPD.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/13

       Article 9 of the RGPD establishes in its sections 1 and 2.b) the following:

       "1. The processing of personal data that reveal the origin is prohibited
ethnic or racial, political opinions, religious or philosophical convictions, or
union membership, and the treatment of genetic data, biometric data directed to
uniquely identify a natural person, data related to health or data
relating to the sexual life or sexual orientations of a natural person.

       2. Section 1 shall not apply when one of the
following circumstances:

       b) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of obligations and the
exercise of specific rights of the person responsible for the treatment or of the interested party

the field of labor law and social security and protection, insofar as
authorized by the law of the Union of the Member States or a convention
collective agreement in accordance with the law of the Member States that establishes guarantees
adequate respect for fundamental rights and the interests of the
interested."

       Article 6.1.b) of the RGPD indicates:

       "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

       b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
pre-contractual. "

       The defendant has legitimacy, based on the indicated regulations, to

carry out labor control of its workers, provided that it meets the requirements
indicated in the sixth Law Foundation.

       The facts claimed imply the violation by the City Council of
what is indicated in article 13 of the RGPD, by not informing about the treatment provided in
regarding the fingerprint check-in control, in accordance with the

pronouncements established in the aforementioned article.

       This article determines the information that must be provided to the interested party.
at the time of data collection, establishing the following:

       Article 13. Information that must be provided when personal data is
obtained from the interested party.

       1. When personal data relating to him are obtained from an interested party, the
responsible for the treatment, at the time these are obtained, will provide

all the information indicated below:

       a) the identity and contact details of the person in charge and, where appropriate, of their

        reference to adequate or appropriate guarantees and means of obtaining
        a copy of these or the fact that they have been loaned.

        2. In addition to the information mentioned in section 1, the person responsible for the
treatment will facilitate the interested party, at the time the data is obtained
personal information, the following information necessary to guarantee data processing
loyal and transparent:

        a) the period during which the personal data will be kept or, when not

        where possible, the criteria used to determine this deadline;
        b) the existence of the right to request the data controller for access

        4. The provisions of sections 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply when and in
the extent to which the interested party already has the information ”.

                                            IV
        In the present case, the claimant wrote to the defendant
requesting information on fingerprint control,

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/13

Considering that the regulations regarding the protection of
data without obtaining a response to said request.

       The documentation provided to the file does not contain the answer offered to the
claimant and, as stated in the second precedent in response to the
informative request sent by the AEPD the claimed provides Document is
Security in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD, noting that the body
local used this system of presence and access control to its facilities that
does not involve a biometric analysis at any time, but rather a

identification algorithm as a result of a reading of several points of the personal fingerprint and
that the algorithm data cannot be decrypted or disassembled by any
unauthorized entity. The report on Impact Assessment was also provided
in the treatment of the fingerprint data to control the presence of the
employees.

       In relation to the issues raised in this case, first of all
It should be noted that the implementation and integration of a time control system
based on the employer's fingerprint, must be informed to the
employees in a complete, clear, concise manner and, in addition, the aforementioned information must
be completed with reference to both the legal bases that cover said type

access control, as well as the basic information referred to in the
Article 13 of the RGPD.

       In the case examined, it is true that the respondent's response to the
writing submitted by the claimant in which he requested to be informed of the moment in

that the information was provided to the workers of the fingerprint check-in system
fingerprint and reiterate such information.

       Second, the installation of a control system based on the collection
and treatment of the fingerprint of the employees implies the treatment of their data

personal since personal data is all that information about a person
physical identified or identifiable in accordance with article 4.1 of the RGPD.

       As for the fingerprint, it is also data that must be qualified.
two as biometric data and in accordance with article 4.14 of the RGPD have this
consideration when they have been “obtained from a technical treatment

specific, relating to the physical, physiological or behavioral characteristics of a
natural person that allow or confirm the unique identification of said person,
such as facial images or fingerprint data ”.

       This means that, in accordance with article 9.1 of the RGPD, in the case

present, the specific regime provided for special categories is applied to them
of data provided for in article 9 of the RGPD.

       In this sense, recital 51 of the RGPD highlights the nature of
restrictive with which the processing of these data can be admitted:

       “(51) ... Such personal data should not be processed, unless it is allowed
its treatment in specific situations contemplated in this Regulation,
given that Member States may lay down provisions

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/13

specific data protection in order to adapt the application of the
rules of this Regulation to the fulfillment of a legal obligation or to the
fulfillment of a mission carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of powers

public conferred to the person in charge of the treatment. In addition to the requirements
specific to that treatment, the general principles and other
rules of this Regulation, especially with regard to the conditions of
legality of the treatment. Exceptions to the
general prohibition of treatment of these special categories of personal data,
among other things when the interested party gives their explicit consent or in the case of

specific needs, in particular when the treatment is carried out in the
framework of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations whose
The objective is to allow the exercise of fundamental freedoms.

       And recital 52 indicates that

       “(52) Likewise, exceptions to the prohibition to treat
special categories of personal data when established by the Law of the
Union or Member States and provided that appropriate guarantees are given, in order to
to protect personal data and other fundamental rights, when it is in the interest
public, in particular the processing of personal data in the field of legislation

labor law, legislation on social protection, including pensions and for the purposes of
safety, supervision and health alert, prevention or control of diseases
communicable and other serious threats to health ... "

       In accordance with these considerations, the processing of biometric data from

special categories will require, in addition to the concurrence of one of the bases
legal provisions established in article 6 of the RGPD, any of the exceptions provided
in article 9.2 of the RGPD.

       The analysis of the legal basis of legitimacy to carry out this treatment comes

of article 6 of the RGPD, regarding the legality of the treatment, which in its section 1, letter
b) states: “The treatment will be lawful if at least one of the following is met
conditions: (…) b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in the
that the interested party is part of or for the application at his request of measures
pre-contractual (…) ”.

       By virtue of this precept, the treatment would be lawful and would not require the
consent, when the data processing is carried out for the fulfillment of
contractual relationships of a labor nature.

       This precept would also cover the data processing of the

public employees, even if their relationship is not strictly contractual. There are
It should be noted that on occasions, in order to fulfill its obligations in relation to
with public employees, the Administration has to carry out treatment of
certain data referred to in the RGPD, in its article 9, as "categories
special data ”.

       On the other hand, and as highlighted in recital 51 of the same RGPD,
insofar as biometric data is of a special category in the cases
of biometric identification (art. 9.1 RGPD), it will be necessary for one of the

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/13

the exceptions provided in article 9.2 of the RGPD that would allow lifting the
general prohibition of the treatment of these types of data established in the article
9.1.

       At this point, special mention must be made of letter b) of article 9.2 of the
RGPD, according to which the general prohibition of biometric data processing does not
it will be applied when “the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of
obligations and the exercise of specific rights of the person responsible for the treatment or
of the interested party in the field of labor law and social security and protection,

to the extent authorized by the Union law of the Member States or
a collective agreement in accordance with the law of the Member States that establishes
adequate guarantees of respect for fundamental rights and the interests of the
interested".

       In Spanish law, article 20 of the Consolidated Text of the Statute of
workers (TE), approved by Royal Legislative Decree 2/2015, of 23
October, foresees the possibility for the employer to adopt surveillance measures and
control to verify compliance with the labor obligations of their
workers:

       "3. The employer may adopt the measures he deems most appropriate in
surveillance and control to verify compliance by the worker with his obligations
and labor duties, keeping in their adoption and application the consideration due to
their dignity and taking into account, where appropriate, the actual capacity of the workers
with disabilities ”.

       And in the Basic Statute of the Public Employee, approved by Royal Decree
Legislative 5/2015, of October 30, in its article 54 in relation to the principles of
conduct of public employees indicates: “The unemployment of the tasks
corresponding to your job will be diligently enhanced and complying with the

established day and schedule "

       It should also be noted that the basic legislation of the local government attributes the
Mayor President of the Corporation the direction of the government and administration
municipal as well as to exercise the superior direction of the personnel at the service of the
Municipal administration.

       The possibility of using data-based systems is undeniable
biometric to carry out access and time control, although it does not seem
that is or should be the only system that can be used: thus the use of cards
personal codes, the use of personal codes, the direct visualization of the

marking, etc., which may constitute, by themselves or in combination with any of the
the other systems available, equally effective measures to carry out the
control.

       In any case, prior to the decision on the start-up

of such a control system and taking into account its implications,
processing of biometric data aimed at uniquely identifying a
natural person, it would be mandatory to carry out an impact assessment regarding the
protection of personal data to evaluate both the legitimacy of the

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/13

treatment and its proportionality as the determination of the existing risks and
the measures to mitigate them in accordance with the provisions of article 35 RGPD.

       In the present case, it must be stated that the entity has accredited the
mandatory impact assessment related to data protection regulated in the
Article 35 of the RGPD providing the corresponding document.

                                            SAW

       Biometric data is closely linked to a person, given
who can use a certain unique property of an individual for their
identification or authentication.

       According to Opinion 3/2012 on the evolution of biometric technologies,

“Biometric data irrevocably changes the relationship between the body and the
identity, as they make the characteristics of the human body legible
by machines and are subject to further use. "

       In relation to them, the Opinion specifies that it is possible to distinguish different types of
treatments by stating that “Biometric data can be processed and stored in

different ways. Sometimes the biometric information captured from a person is
stored and treated raw, allowing the source from which it came to be recognized without
special knowledge; for example, a photograph of a face, a photograph of a
fingerprint or voice recording. Other times, raw biometric information
captured is treated in such a way that only certain characteristics or traits are extracted and

they are saved as a biometric template. "

       The processing of these data is expressly permitted by the RGPD
when the employer has a legal basis, which is usually his own
Work contract. In this regard, the STS of July 2, 2007 (Rec. 5017/2003), has

legitimately understood the treatment of biometric data carried out by the Administration
for the time control of its public employees, without requiring the
prior consent of workers.

       However, the following should be noted:

       O The worker must be informed about these treatments.

       O The principles of limitation of the purpose, necessity,
proportionality and data minimization.

       In any case, the treatment must also be adequate, pertinent and not
excessive in relation to that purpose. Therefore, biometric data other than
necessary for that purpose should be suppressed and creation will not always be justified.
of a biometric database (Opinion 3/2012 of the Art. 29 Working Group).

       O Use of biometric templates: Biometric data must be stored
as biometric templates whenever possible. The template should be taken from
a way that is specific to the biometric system in question and not used
by other data controllers of similar systems in order to ensure that

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/13

a person can only be identified in biometric systems that have
a legal basis for this operation.

       O The biometric system used and the security measures chosen must
ensure that reuse of the biometric data in question is not possible
for another purpose.

       O Mechanisms based on encryption technologies should be used, in order to
prevent unauthorized reading, copying, modification or deletion of biometric data.

       O Biometric systems should be designed so that they can be revoked
the identity bond.

       O You must choose to use data formats or specific technologies that

make it impossible to interconnect biometric databases and disclose data
not verified.

       O Biometric data should be deleted when they are not linked to the
purpose that motivated their treatment and, if possible, they should be implemented
automated data deletion mechanisms.

paragraph 5 of the aforementioned article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, “with fines

administrative fees of € 20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, a
