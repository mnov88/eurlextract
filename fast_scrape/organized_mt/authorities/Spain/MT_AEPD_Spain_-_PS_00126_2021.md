## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against an energy services provider. The controller had used the complainant's personal data to contract gas and electricity supplies, as well as a maintenance service called Servielectric Xpress, which were not requested by the complainant. The respondent entered into these contracts without the consent or knowledge of the data subject.

### Holding

The AEDP held that the controller had used the data subject's personal data to make them party to a contract without any legitimacy, as the data subject had not requested such services. Therefore, the contract was not valid, what implied that the controller had processed the data without any legal basis.

The AEPD therefore argued that for the legal basis for the processing set forth in Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to be legitimate, the data must be provided by the data subject. The controller has the obligation to verify with due diligence that the data subject had actually provided their data, setting identification requirements, for example, as part of their accountability and proactive responsibility obligation.

The DPA concluded that the controller had violated Article 6(1) GDPR for processing data without a legal basis, and thus fined the controller €6000.

In the present case, the following were taken into account as aggravating circumstances:

*   the intentionality or negligence of the infringement (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR)
*   the impact on basic personal identifiers (Article 83(2)(g) GDPR)

                                          FACTS

                              FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                               I

       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority
of control, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of
the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure.

                                              II

           Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

           "1. The treatment will only be lawful if it complies with at least one of the following
terms:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/8

      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their personal data
      for one or more specific purposes;
      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the

      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
      pre-contractual;
      (…) "

      The infringement for which the claimed entity is responsible is found
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading "General conditions for the

imposition of administrative fines ”, it states:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or, in the case of
of a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the business volume

Global annual total for the previous financial year, opting for the highest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

      Organic Law 3/2018, on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of

Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious ”provides:

      "1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (E.U.) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose a

substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

       (…)
       b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions

       of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation
       (EU) 2016/679. "

                                              III

       In the present case, it is important to point out that if the contracting takes place

fraudulent of a product and the consent to perfect said contract has been
provided by a person other than the owner of the data (identity theft), not
we can understand that there is contractual consent on the part of the latter, that
is harmed.

       In legal terms, we can consider that in this fraud situation there is no

would have perfected the legal business, which would determine the non-existence of legitimation
to process the personal data of the interested party. And this because, once the contract is signed,
the legal basis of the treatment that legitimizes the contractor as responsible for the treatment
to process the personal data of the owner of these in a product contracting

would be the one provided for in art. 6.1.b) of the RGPD.

       For this legal basis of art. 6.1.b) of the RGPD exists and legitimizes the treatment
of data of the owner necessary for the execution of a contract, it is required that the data
are supplied by the owner, which does not happen when identity is spoofed. Yes
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/8

no, there would be a processing of personal data regarding a contract or
service that has not been requested.

       Therefore, to avoid fraud, it must be verified that indeed the
contractual consent is provided by the true owner of the data, and must

deploy the contractor due diligence in the process of identification and verification of
identity of the contracting person. The SAN of April 29, 2010 considers that "the
question (…) it is not so much to elucidate whether the appellant processed the personal data of the
whistleblower without their consent, such as whether or not they employed reasonable diligence when
to try to identify the person with whom he signed the financing contract ”.

       Identity theft is a risk specifically considered by the
legislator, according to recital 75 of the RGPD and art. 28 of the LOPDGDD, which imposes
those responsible for the treatment the deployment of all due diligence to eradicate it
or minimize it, within the framework of its proactive responsibility. This risk involves important
risks, consequently greater diligence, greater reinforcement of the measures of

security (recital 94 of the RGPD in relation to the mitigation of damages) to
obtain a valid contractual consent from its true owner, especially if you can
involve minors or vulnerable people.

       The correct identification of clients and the adoption of diligent measures to

verifying your identity then falls squarely within the scope of data protection
personal, because, if not, the risk of identity theft would materialize, which
It can probably materialize in this type of hiring.

       Therefore, we can consider due diligence to be the attention of duty.
legal care.

       Being duly diligent implies, in terms of this legal duty of care, preventing
the materialization of the risk (identity theft) establishing with character
in advance of the treatment an effective system of adequate measures to avoid it; such
system must be constantly evaluated. As stated by jurisprudence, the

Responsibility derives from the actions of the person who is responsible for being diligent and
“It cannot be considered excluded or attenuated by the fact that the possible
fraudulent action of a third party, since the responsibility of the plaintiff does not derive
of his performance, but of his own ”.

       Consequently, due diligence is made up of four elements: identifying
(evaluation of the real and potential impact of data processing activities);
prevent, mitigate (through follow-up and monitoring) and, ultimately, be accountable
(communicating the way in which the negative consequences of the
improper data processing). And all this, within a continuous process.

       Due diligence, which must be adapted to the business environments in which
the data controller moves, includes not only the adoption of measures
technical and organizational appropriate to the treatment in question, but the ability to
prove its compliance.

       Therefore, the controller must “be obliged to apply measures
timely and effective and must be able to demonstrate compliance of the
treatment with this Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. Said
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/8

Measures should take into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the
treatment, as well as the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons ”,
Recital 74 of the RGPD.

       Demonstrating due diligence is essential, and it is not enough to allege the
absence of guilt, since as affirmed by the National High Court, for all the Judgment
278/2015 of June 30, 2015 (Rec. 163/2014), “To the foregoing must be added, following
the judgment of January 23, 1998, partially transcribed in the SSTS of October 9
of 2009, Rec 5285/2005, and of October 23, 2010, Rec 1067/2006, that "although the

culpability for the conduct must also be proven, must be considered in
order to the assumption of the corresponding load, that ordinarily the elements
volitional and cognitive skills necessary to appreciate it are part of the behavior
proven typical, and that their exclusion requires that the absence of such elements be accredited,
or in its normative aspect, that the diligence that was required by whoever

alleges its non-existence; it is not enough, in short, for the exculpation of a behavior
typically unlawful the invocation of the absence of guilt ".

      In conclusion, to act with due diligence, the data controller
must comply with the RGPD and the LOPDGDD and establish mechanisms in advance
adequate to verify the identity of the people whose personal data is going to process or

treats (if it is later detected, during the treatment, an impersonation of
identity), to ensure, ultimately, that it has legitimacy to deal with such
personal information.

                                             IV

      The documentation in the file shows that the defendant violated the
Article 6.1 of the RGPD, every time you processed and communicated your data
personnel without legitimacy to do so in order to register supply contracts
of energy not requested by the claimant, without having proven that there was

legitimately hired, had legal coverage for the collection and treatment
later of your personal data, or there is any other cause that makes the
treatment carried out.

      Consequently, it has carried out a processing of personal data without having
accredited that has the legal authorization to do so.

      Article 6.1 RGPD says that the treatment “will be lawful if it is necessary for the
execution of a contract in which the interested party is a party ”.

      It was therefore essential that the defendant accredited to this Agency that the

claimant had contracted with her the supplies of gas, electricity, as well as a
maintenance service called Servielectric Xpress.

      The defendant did not reply to this Agency, after the requirements made on 18
September and October 6, 2020, nor did it make any allegations to the start-up agreement

of the present sanctioning procedure.

        c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to

        e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
        treatment;
        f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy

        the infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement;
        g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
        h) the way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement, in
        particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infraction and, in such case, in
        what measure;

        i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
        previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge in
        regarding the same matter, compliance with said measures;

        k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the

        indirectly, through the offense. "

      Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76,
"Sanctions and corrective measures", provides:

        "two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

       h) The submission by the person in charge or in charge, on a voluntary basis,

      In accordance with the transcribed precepts, in order to set the amount of the penalty
of fine to impose on the claimed person, as responsible for an offense typified in the
Article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, the following factors are considered concurrent:
