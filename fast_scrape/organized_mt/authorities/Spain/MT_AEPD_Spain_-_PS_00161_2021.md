2. The provisions of the preceding section shall not apply when there is a relationship

contact details of the recipient and will use them to send communications with
related to products or services of your own company that are similar

In any case, the provider must offer the recipient the possibility of opposing the
processing of your data for promotional purposes through a simple procedure

and free of charge, both at the time of data collection and in each of the
commercial communications to direct you.

When the communications have been sent by email, said me-
The diode must necessarily consist of the inclusion of an email address

address or other valid electronic address where this right can be exercised, remain-
It is prohibited to send communications that do not include said address. "

        saw commercial advertising on the claimant's phone, through emails
        advertising only, without the consent of the interested party.

                                              IV
The balance of the circumstances contemplated in the present case, with respect to the
infractions committed by the claimed entity allows setting a total sanction of

15,000 euros, (fifteen thousand euros): 10,000 euros for violation of article 17.1 of the
