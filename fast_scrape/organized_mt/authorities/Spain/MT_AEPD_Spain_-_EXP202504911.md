## English Summary

### Facts

On 8 August 2023 a data subject filed a complaint with the DPA regarding a call from their energy provider. According to the data subject, they received a call from a company posing as their energy provider, stating there was an error in their bills and that their contract needed to be updated. The other company sent several e-mails to the data subject asking them to sign a new contract. After calling their energy provider, it confirmed that the company posing as them was a separate company. The data subject decided not to sign the contract.

The DPA began investigating on 8 November 2023, and requested information to ALBOR ENERGÍA S.L. (an energy consultant, the processor) regarding the companies involved in the case. The companies involved are the following:

\- The company posing as the data subject's energy provider has a contract with a company to sell electricity under its brand. The latter is the controller in this case.

\- The controller has a contract with the processor to request potential clients to contact and offer services to.

\- The processor has an agreement with a marketing company (the sub-processor). This is the company that contacted the data subject according to the processor.

\- This sub-processor has a contract with a call center for the use of its database. This is the company that contacted the data subject according to the DPA's investigations.

It is important to note that the contract between the controller and the processor explicitly prohibits the processor from subcontracting without prior authorisation.

The processor argued that it was not responsible for processing the personal data of the data subject, as it did not have a legal relationship with the data subject at any moment. Furthermore, the processor stated that it had stopped working with the sub-processor (and by extension the call center). This was due to concerns over their processing of personal data and whether they verified if the data subject was included in an advertising exclusion system.

### Holding

The DPA found that the processor had not complied with its obligations under [Article 28 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR "Article 28 GDPR"). While the DPA analysed a violation of Article 28 as a whole, it should be noted that [Article 28(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR#2 "Article 28 GDPR") prohibits the processor from engaging with another processor without prior authorisation of the controller. Furthermore, Article 28(4) places liability on the processor if the other processor does not fulfill its data protection obligations, meaning the processor would be liable despite not having a legal relationship with the data subject.

The DPA found a violation of [Article 28 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR "Article 28 GDPR") based on the lack of authorisation by the controller. The DPA considered the large amount of personal data processed as an aggravating factor. The DPA also took into account the severe nature of the violation, the negligence of the processor and the large revenue of the processor as factors.

The fine was initially set at €20,000 but pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the DPA informed the controller that it may make a voluntary payment of the proposed fine and waive their right to appeal. This action reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The fine can be reduced by a further 20% if the controller acknowledges its liability. The controller opted for both and reduced the fine by 40%, paying the reduced sanction amount of €12,000.

“Annex I. Background and relationships between the parties involved

In order to clarify the documentation presented above for this Agency, we list the parties involved in the commercial call that is the subject of this request for information:
1. \*\*\*COMPANY.3: a company dedicated to the sale of electricity under the brand \*\*\*COMPANY.2.

4. \*\*\*COMPANY.5: Company specialized in call center services and database creation. This is the company that \*\*\*COMPANY.4 contracts with for the use of its database and guarantees that it has obtained the claimant's free and voluntary consent, issuing a certification to that effect.
To prove the relationships between the parties involved in the commercial process, the following Annexes are provided:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 4/20

- Annex I: Collaboration agreement between ALBOR ENERGÍA and \*\*\*COMPANY.2 signed on January 3, 2023.
- Annex II: Collaboration or agency agreement between ALBOR ENERGÍA and \*\*\*COMPANY.4 signed on May 19, 2023.
- Annex III: Certificate of collection of personal data issued by \*\*\*COMPANY.5.

"

"Annex II: Responses to questions raised by this Agency."

“1. Reason for the advertising call to the complainant on 08/04/2023.

The call was made by the subcontracted company \*\*\*COMPANY.4, with which a contractual relationship was established for the telemarketing service in the marketing of energy sector products and services offered by ALBOR
ENERGIA S.L., pursuant to the collaboration agreement signed with \*\*\*COMPANY.3.
Therefore, the reason for the call was the offer of products and services related to the energy sector.”

In the investigations carried out by this Agency regarding the reported events, it was found that the telephone operator \*\*\*OPERATOR.1
reported that the calling line, \*\*\*TELEPHONE.1, was registered as the entity \*\*\*COMPANY.5, with CIF (...) (hereinafter, \*\*\*COMPANY.5) and address (...) on the date of the call, 08/04/2023.

That is, the call was made by \*\*\*COMPANY.5 and not \*\*\*COMPANY.4 (hereinafter, \*\*\*COMPANY.4).

"2. Origin of the complainant's data for making the commercial call along with the sending of emails.

The data was obtained by subcontractor \*\*\*COMPANY.4 from a third party specialized in database creation: \*\*\*COMPANY.5.

A certificate issued by \*\*\*COMPANY.5 is also attached, indicating that they are responsible for the processing of said data and obtained it in compliance with the GDPR and the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act), as the complainant has expressly agreed to receive such communications. See Annex III."

“3. Recording of the call made to the complainant on 4/08/2023.

The subcontractor in charge of the telemarketing service does NOT store the recordings of those clients who did NOT ultimately contract the service. In compliance with Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter, GDPR), the data will be kept in a manner that allows the identification of the data subjects for no longer than necessary for the purposes of processing the personal data (principle of limitation of the retention period). Therefore, since voice is personal data (according to Resolution No. R/00728/2022, among others, of this Agency), no contract has been formalized with the complainant and

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 5/20

The processing of said data is not necessary; the recording is not available because it has been deleted."

"4. Printed copy of the data contained in its systems relating to the complainant.

ALBOR ENERGIA S.L. has never stored the complainant's data in its systems, as no contract has ever been formalized with the complainant and, therefore, has not been responsible for said data at any time in the commercial communication."

“5. Copy of the documentation that can prove the procedure for obtaining the claimant's data, which was used in the aforementioned sales call and emails.

As indicated in previous points, subcontractor \*\*\*COMPANY.4 was responsible for acquiring the database. Specifically, a relationship was established with company \*\*\*COMPANY.5., with the latter issuing a certification of personal data collection, which reflects that the claimant gave his unequivocal, free, and express consent for the processing of his personal data for marketing purposes on July 30, 2023, through the data controller's own website: (…). See Annex III. “

It is verified that this Annex III contains the same certificate from \*\*\*COMPANY.5
provided by \*\*\*COMPANY.3 (hereinafter, \*\*\*COMPANY.3).

“6. Copy of the contract signed with the third-party customer acquisition service provider (sales force) that made the aforementioned calls.

Attached is the agency or collaboration agreement signed by ALBOR ENERGIA S.L.

as Agent and \*\*\*COMPANY.4. as SUBAGENT, dated May 19, 2023.
See Annex II.

This document reflects the conditions stipulated by the parties for the correct processing of personal data and the obligation to obtain valid and unrestricted consent for commercial communications.”

The Agency Agreement of May 19, 2023 between ALBOR ENERGÍA S.L. and \*\*\*COMPANY.4
signed by both parties, as company and collaborator, respectively, establishes:

“I.- That THE COMPANY is engaged in the sale, distribution, and marketing of electricity.

II.- That THE COLLABORATOR is interested in marketing said products and services on behalf of THE COMPANY. THE COLLABORATOR will carry out in-person marketing to customers and will duly explain the content of the products it sells, as well as their economic conditions, complying at all times with Royal Decree 15/2018.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 6/20

III.- In view of the foregoing, the parties sign this AGENCY contract, which will be governed by the following clauses.

CLAUSES
First. - THE COMPANY appoints \*\*\*COMPANY.4, COLLABORATOR of the same, so that with the diligence and good faith with which it acts in said capacity, it may represent the COMPANY in the promotion and sale of commercial promotion services related to the campaigns that THE COMPANY maintains in the electricity sector nationwide without exclusivity.

\[…\]
Third. - THE COLLABORATOR undertakes to act loyally and diligently safeguard the interests of THE COMPANY and to promote or complete acts and/or transactions on behalf of its principal, notifying the entrepreneur and informing them when necessary for proper management. THE COLLABORATOR may appoint any sub-agents it deems appropriate to perform its duties, with the sole requirement that it inform THE COMPANY of such appointments.

This agency contract does not include any obligation to obtain valid consent.

“7. Copy of the contract signed with the company that commissioned the company to carry out the customer acquisition campaign.

The collaboration agreement between \*\*\*COMPANY.3 and ALBOR ENERGIA
S.L., dated December 29, 2022 (signed on January 3, 2023), is attached, as well as the non-termination amendment to the collaboration agreement dated June 29, 2023. See Annex IV.

It is verified that the collaboration agreement signed between A.E. and \*\*\*COMPANY.3, dated December 29, 2022, was handwritten by the person responsible for \*\*\*COMPANY.3

and by the person in charge of A.E. electronically on January 3, 2023, establishes:

In Clause THREE of the aforementioned contract, "Obligations of the Data Processor," it states:

"The data processor may not subcontract the services provided to the data controller without prior written authorization from the data controller. In the event of authorization, the details of the subprocessors will be specified in ANNEX IV of this contract. (underlined by the AEPD)

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 7/20

In the event of non-compliance by the subprocessor, the data processor will remain fully responsible for compliance with the obligations assumed in this contract.
ANNEX IV list of subprocessors (...)
The data controller authorizes the data processor to subcontract the following entity:"

It is verified that said ANNEX IV contains an unfilled list of three
subprocessors, with the sections: "Name, address, service to be provided, DPO contact email, contact person details." All of them are uncompleted, i.e., empty of content.

ANNEX II provides a document entitled "NON-TERMINATING MODIFICATION NOVATION OF THE COLLABORATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN \*\*\*COMPANY.3. AND ALBOR ENERGIA S.L.," dated 2023, without specifying the day or month of its signature and containing only the signature of \*\*\*COMPANY.3. This document

intends to incorporate new terms and conditions into the collaboration agreement dated 12/29/2022, such as considering it malpractice in commercial interaction if the collaborator processes the contract without obtaining the data directly from the potential client and/or without obtaining their express consent.

“8. Detailed specification of the identifying parameters of the campaign recipients, indicating whether they were set by the third party (sales force) or by the company that commissioned the campaign, the total number of recipients and their profiles, providing a copy of all supporting documentation.

In the collaboration agreement signed with \*\*\*COMPANY.2, the possibility of establishing monthly objectives in this relationship can be seen in Clause Two – Obligations of the collaborator, Section III, without specifying at any time either specific recipients, the total number of recipients, or the profile being targeted.”

"9. Copy of the exclusion files used during the execution of the campaign within which the aforementioned calls are framed.

This documentation is not available, as the subcontractor (\*\*\*COMPANY.4) is in charge of collecting the database, and the provider of said database is directly responsible for reviewing the exclusion systems (and the data controller of the complainant): \*\*\*COMPANY.5."

ALBOR ENERGÍA S.L. wishes to inform this Agency of its commitment to complying with data protection regulations, both the provisions of the GDPR and Organic Law 3/2018, of December 3, on the protection of personal data and the guarantee of digital rights.

This commitment can be seen in the documentation provided, assuming its responsibilities as data processor and requiring its suppliers or service providers to comply with the same by binding the data processing order.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 8/20

ALBOR ENERGÍA S.L. wishes to declare that at no time has it been responsible for the processing of the complainant's data, as no legal relationship has ever been established with the complainant, and therefore, it could not have improperly processed his personal data.

Likewise, in its concern for regulatory compliance with the provisions of the
new telecommunications regulations (General Telecommunications Law 11/2022, of June 28) and verifying that users were not included in the advertising exclusion system (Robinson list), ALBOR ENERGÍA S.L. stopped working with \*\*\*COMPANY.4 and, consequently, with \*\*\*COMPANY.5, as they were not considered reliable providers regarding the processing of personal data.

FOURTH: According to the report collected from the AXESOR tool, the entity
A.E. is a company incorporated in 2021 and with a turnover of €6,257,181 in 2023.

If you do not submit objections to this initial resolution within the stipulated period, it may be considered a proposed resolution, as established in Article 64.2.f) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP).

III
Preliminary Questions

Article 4.1) of the GDPR defines "personal data" as: "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("the data subject"); An identifiable natural person is any person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person.

Article 4(2) of the GDPR defines "processing" as: "any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction."

Article 4.7 of the GDPR defines the "controller" or "data controller" as: "the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing; If Union or Member State law determines the purposes and means of processing, the controller or the specific criteria for its appointment may be laid down by Union or Member State law. In turn, Article 4.8 of the GDPR defines the "processor" or "processor" as the natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the controller.

In the present case, \*\*\*COMPANY.3 is the controller, insofar as it determines the purposes and means of the activity in accordance with Article 4.7 of the GDPR, while A.E. acts as a data processor, since it processes personal data on behalf of the controller, pursuant to Article 4.8 of the GDPR.

In the present case, the legal relationship between \*\*\*COMPANY.3 and A.E. as the controller and data processor, respectively, is specified in a contract signed between the two parties dated December 16, 2022, which authorizes the data processor (A.E.) to process, on behalf of the data controller (\*\*\*COMPANY.3), the personal data necessary to provide the customer acquisition service.

IV
Breached obligation in relation to Article 28 of the GDPR

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 10/20

The provisions regarding the data processor are set forth in Article 28 of the GDPR, which stipulates the following:

"1. Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall only choose a processor that offers sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the processing complies with the requirements of this Regulation and ensures the protection of the data subject's rights.

2. The processor shall not use another processor without the prior written consent of the controller, whether specific or general. In the latter case, the processor shall inform the controller of any planned changes to the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the controller the opportunity to object to such changes.

3. Processing by the processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal instrument, in accordance with Union or Member State law, which binds the processor to the controller and sets out the subject matter, duration, nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects, and the obligations and rights of the controller. Such contract or legal act shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor: a) shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, including with respect to transfers of personal data to a third country or international organization, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller of this legal requirement prior to processing, unless such law prohibits this for important reasons of public interest; b) shall ensure that persons authorized to process personal data have undertaken to respect confidentiality or are subject to a statutory obligation of confidentiality; c) shall take all necessary measures in accordance with Article 32; d) shall respect the conditions set out in paragraphs 2 and 4 for using another processor; (e) shall assist the controller, taking into account the nature of the processing, through appropriate technical and organizational measures, where possible, to enable the controller to fulfill its obligation to respond to requests that exercise the data subject's rights set out in Chapter III;

(f) shall assist the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations set out in Articles 32 to 36, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to the processor;

(g) shall, at the controller's discretion, delete or return all personal data once the provision of the processing services has ended, and shall delete existing copies unless the retention of the personal data is required by Union or Member State law;

h) shall make available to the controller all necessary information to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set forth in this article, as well as to enable and contribute to the performance of audits, including inspections, by the controller or another auditor authorized by the controller.

With regard to the provisions of point (h) of the first paragraph, the processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes this Regulation or other Union or Member State data protection provisions.

4. Where a processor uses another processor to carry out certain processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data protection obligations shall be imposed on that other processor, by means of a contract or other legal act established under Union or Member State law, as those stipulated in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor referred to in paragraph 3, in particular the provision of sufficient guarantees for the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the processing complies with the provisions of this Regulation. If that other processor fails to comply with its data protection obligations, the original processor shall remain fully responsible to the controller for compliance with the other processor's obligations.

5. The processor's adherence to a code of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or a certification mechanism approved pursuant to Article 42 may be used as evidence of the existence of sufficient safeguards referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article.

6. Without prejudice to the conclusion by the controller and the processor of an individual contract, the contract or other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article may be based, in whole or in part, on the standard contractual clauses referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, including when they form part of a certification granted to the controller or processor in accordance with Articles 42 and 43.

7. The Commission may establish standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article, in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2).

8. A supervisory authority may adopt standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article, in accordance with the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63.

9. The contract or other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article may be based on the standard contractual clauses referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, including when they form part of a certification granted to the controller or processor in accordance with Articles 42 and 43. The information referred to in sections 3 and 4 shall be recorded in writing, including electronic format. C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 12/20

10. Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 82, 83, and 84, if a data processor infringes this Regulation by determining the purposes and means of processing, it shall be considered the data controller with respect to that processing.

In the present case, the contracting process identified in the documentation in the file would be:

\*\*\*COMPANY.3, a company dedicated to the sale of electricity under the brand \*\*\*COMPANY.2, is the company requesting A.E. to attract potential clients so that \*\*\*COMPANY.3 can contact them and offer them the contracting of its services.

A.E., a company dedicated to the sale of products and services in the field of energy activity (an energy consultant, as stated on its website), acts under a collaboration agreement signed with \*\*\*COMPANY.3, subcontracting the services of \*\*\*COMPANY.4.

In turn, \*\*\*COMPANY.4, a company dedicated to the marketing of products and services, is one of the companies that A.E. subcontracts to provide the services agreed upon with \*\*\*COMPANY.3.

As already stated, clause three, section 5 of the data processor agreement signed between \*\*\*COMPANY.3 and A.E., expressly states that: "The data processor may not subcontract the services provided to the data controller without prior written authorization from the data controller. In the event of authorization, the details of the subprocessors will be specified in Annex IV of this agreement."

The documentation in this file does not contain any express written authorization from \*\*\*COMPANY.3 to A.E., authorizing A.E. to subcontract \*\*\*COMPANY.4. Furthermore, said contract includes, as detailed, an empty list of subcontractors.

Finally, A.E. states that it stopped working with \*\*\*COMPANY.4 because it did not consider it a reliable provider for the processing of personal data.

Therefore, based on the evidence available at this time regarding the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, it is considered that the known facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to A.E., for violation of the article transcribed above.

V
Classification of the infringement of Article 28 of the GDPR and qualification for the purposes of statute of limitations

Article 83.4 of the GDPR classifies the violation of the following article as an administrative infringement: In accordance with section 2, the LOPDGDD shall impose administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the total annual global turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher:

"a) the obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39, 42, and 43;"

For its part, the LOPDGDD, in its Article 71, Infractions, states that:

"Infractions constitute the acts and conduct referred to in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those are contrary to this Organic Law."

For the sole purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 73 of the LOPDGDD establishes the following:

"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, are considered serious and will be subject to a two-year statute of limitations:
l) The contracting of other data processors by a data processor without prior authorization from the controller, or without informing the controller of changes in the subcontracting process when legally required."

VI
Proposed Penalty

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:

"1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 9, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures referred to in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:
(a) the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them;
(b) the intentionality or negligence of the infringement; c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects;
d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;
e) any previous breach committed by the controller or processor;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 14/20

f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the breach and, if so, to what extent; (i) where the measures indicated in Article 58(2) have been previously ordered against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with such measures;

(j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or to certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42; and
(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.

For its part, Article 76 "Sanctions and corrective measures" of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data) provides:

"1. The sanctions provided for in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria established in paragraph 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. Pursuant to Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account:
a) The ongoing nature of the infringement.

b) The connection between the infringer's activity and the processing of personal data.
c) The benefits obtained as a result of committing the infringement.
d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the commission of the infringement.

e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the acquiring entity.
f) The impact on the rights of minors.
g) The availability of a data protection officer, where not mandatory.
h) Voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.

In the present case, considering the seriousness of the potential violation, especially considering the consequences its commission has on the affected party, a fine should be imposed.

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR. To guarantee these principles, A.E.'s turnover of €6,257,181 for 2023 is considered as a preliminary matter.

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence currently available, the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to any results of the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 15/20

Instruction, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following circumstances, contemplated in the aforementioned provisions.

Considering the information available at this stage of the initiation agreement, in relation to each of the GDPR violations attributed to the respondent, the following circumstances are noted that affect the determination of the amount of the sanction:

Preliminary, the following circumstances are considered to be present:

 The nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question,

as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages and losses they have suffered (Article 83.2, letter a) of the GDPR): the violation must be considered of high severity, to the extent that it prevents the data controller from controlling the processing of personal data that third-party entities are carrying out on their behalf and, consequently, the establishment of all necessary measures to guarantee compliance with personal data protection regulations.

 The intentionality or negligence in the violation (Article 83.2. b) of the GDPR).

In this case, we are dealing with negligent conduct, since the defendant not only violates the regulation, but also the express stipulations agreed upon with \*\*\*COMPANY.3.

Furthermore, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following criteria established in section 2 of Article 76 "Sanctions and corrective measures" of the LOPDGDD:

As aggravating factors:

• The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data (Article 76.2, letter b) of the LOPDGDD: the defendant as a company dedicated to the marketing of products and services in the field of The energy industry processes a large amount of personal data of potential customers, such as name, surname, telephone number, postal address, email address, among others.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and Article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of Article 28 of the GDPR, allows for the initial imposition of an administrative fine of €20,000.

Therefore, in light of the foregoing, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,

IT IS AGREED:

LEGAL BASIS

I
Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR) and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of the

28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 18/20

Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II
Termination of the Procedure

Article 85 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), under the heading "Termination of Sanctioning Procedures," provides the following:

"1. Once a sanctioning procedure has been initiated, if the offender acknowledges responsibility, the procedure may be terminated with the imposition of the appropriate sanction.

2. When the sanction is solely monetary in nature, or when one monetary sanction and another non-monetary sanction may be imposed, but the inadmissibility of the second sanction has been justified, voluntary payment by the alleged offender, at any time prior to the resolution, will entail the termination of the procedure, except with regard to restoring the altered situation or determining compensation for damages caused by the commission of the offense.

3. In both cases, when the sanction is solely monetary in nature, the competent body to resolve the procedure shall apply reductions of at least 20% on the amount of the proposed sanction, which may be combined.

These reductions must be determined in the notification of initiation of the procedure, and their effectiveness shall be conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the sanction.

The percentage reduction provided for in this section may be increased by regulation.

III
Voluntary payment and acknowledgment of liability

In accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 85 of the LPACAP, the notified initiation agreement provided for the possibility of acknowledging liability and voluntarily paying the proposed sanction, which would entail two cumulative reductions of 20% each.
