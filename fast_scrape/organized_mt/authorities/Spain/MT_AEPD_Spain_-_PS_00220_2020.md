## English Summary

### Facts

A former IBERDROLA client complained to the Spanish DPA (AEPD) that the electricity supply company did not respond to his requests to delete his personal data.

The claimant moved house and informed the company of the change of address for notification purposes. Even so, the company continued to send letters to the previous address.

The claimant, in the same letter notifying the change of address, requested the withdrawal of his details due to the cancellation of the service, which was not answered due to the error in updating the claimant's details mentioned above.

### Dispute

Is the lack of updating personal data a breach of Article 5(1)(d)?

Can this failure to update data result in a refusal to comply with Article 17 GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD held that IBERDROLA had failed to update the customer's data and that this resulted in the inclusion of the complainant's data in a creditworthiness file and in a failure to comply with its obligations regarding the request for deletion of personal data.

The application of the GDPR is determined because the maintenance of the incorrect address constitutes a continuous infringement that continues over time as long as the data quality problem, which caused the infringement in question, has not been remedied.

Therefore, in the present case, there is an infringement of Article 5(1)(d) of the GDPR because no payment order was issued due to a data quality problem.

The AEPD took into account the fact that it was a non-intentional, but significant negligent action (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR) and that basic personal identifiers were affected (Article 83(2)(g) GDPR).

The economic volume of the company is also taken into account in the penalty scale.

## Comment

The Resolution refers to the former Organic Law on Data Protection (LOPD) because the events occurred before the entry into force of the Organic Law on Personal Data Protection and Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDPGDD).

                                             III

In the case analyzed here, it has been proven that the claimant exercised her
right of cancellation before the claimed on November 11, 2016, and their request
did not receive a response, despite the right recognized in article 16 of the LOPD, in force
at the time of the events, a right currently recognized in Article 17
of the RGPD, called the right to erasure ("the right to be forgotten") in which
precept the right of deletion of the claimant is governed, stating that he will have

right to obtain without undue delay from the controller the deletion
of the personal data that concerns you.

In addition to the evidence available in the present
moment, the notifications sent to the claimant made between July 22 and

November 23, 2016 by IBERDROLA requesting the debt, they were sent to

Therefore, these communications were returned on two occasions for being "absent."

and the third for "unknown".

On the other hand, the claimed entity states that it had no knowledge of the
change of address of the claimant until November 21, 2016, although the
The complainant states that she communicated it on November 11, 2016.

Despite this, to indicate to the claimant the impossibility of proceeding with the cancellation
of the data included in the ASNEF file as a consequence of the non-payment of the
service, the claimed entity continued to address the claimant at the address of the
supply contract, instead of the new one indicated by the claimant, in its
communications dated November 22 and December 22, 2016, that is, with

communications.

Article 26 of Law 40/2015 on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector, establishes that

Thus, it is considered that the claimant was improperly included in the
patrimonial solvency files, since the notifications of the prior requirement of
payment, they were all returned by absentee or unknown recipient, for being
addressed to an incorrect address, when the claimant ceases to reside at said address

since May 2016 and despite having been notified of the change of
address to which communications should be directed, continue to go to the
address of the supply contract, so it did not receive any of the
prior payment requirements, which implies the violation of articles 38.1 a),
and 43 of the RLOPD that state that "Personal data will be accurate and

updated in such a way that they respond truthfully to the current situation of the
affected ”, regulations in force at the time of the offense.

The application of the RGPD is determined because the maintenance of the address

This data quality problem, which is the cause of the infraction in question, is not
corrective.

Therefore, in the present case there is an infringement of article 5.1 d) of the RGPD
because the due payment request was not made due to a quality problem of
the data.

                                           IV

Article 72.1.a) of the LOPDGDD states that “depending on what the
