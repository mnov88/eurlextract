## English Summary

### Facts

On 5 June 2024, a data subject filed a complaint with the DPA against OCI CINE, S.L. (controller), concerning data cross-referencing during the purchase of movie tickets through its app. The controller is a large company, active since 1983, and with a wide business volume (€5,216,496 in 2023).

Between 7 April 2024 and 6 August 2024, eight users of the controller's app (data subjects) experienced data cross-referencing stemming from the coincidence of identifiers assigned to customers. This occurs because the decentralized system of assigning identifiers to customers could coincide with the identifiers. One solution may be the assignment of a different identifier to the customer who registered later. As a consequence of data cross-referencing, data subjects could visualize personal data of other customers on the app, such as name, surname, email address, telephone number, and Fidelity card number. According to the controller, just 0,01% of the Fidelity users were affected by the data cross-referencing.

On 12 August 2024, the controller responded to the DPA's request, presenting the measures taken to ensure compliance with data protection laws. Among those measures, the controller consulted two companies to identify the issues. One recommended that the data subjects terminate their sessions and restart them. The controller accepted it. The other suggested that data subjects log in and out on the app automatically, or the controller notifies them by a “push” notification to do it manually. However, the controller rejected such a suggestion. Besides, the controller informed that it has implemented measures to enhance data security and accuracy, allowing only validated token users to complete financial transactions on the app. Furthermore, the controller used the Asesora Brecha resource to assess if it should notify the DPA about data cross-referencing on its app. The tool exempted the controller from the notification.

On 5 September 2024, the complaint was allowed to proceed.

### Holding

First, eight users experienced data cross-referencing on the controller’s app, which means that their personal data was not accurate. Therefore, the controller did not maintain accurate data subjects’ personal data nor implement any technical or organizational measures to ensure accuracy or mitigate inaccurate factors. Consequently, the DPA found a breach of the data accuracy principle, envisaged in Recital 71 and [Article 5(1)(d)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1d "Article 5 GDPR").

Hence, the controller was condemned to an administrative fine of €4,000, envisaged in [Article 83(5)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#5a "Article 83 GDPR") in conjunction with Article 71 Organic Law on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights 3/2018 (LOPDGDD). Pursuant to Article 76(2)(b) LOPDGDD, the DPI has deemed as an aggravating factor that the controller has been selling movie tickets since 1983, hence it should constantly carry out processing its customers' personal data. Additionally, the DPA emphasized the controller’s lack of technical and organizational methods for processing personal data on its app, exposing their name, surname, email address, telephone number, and Fidelity card number from 7 April 2024 until 6 August 2024. For four months, the security of processing data subjects' personal data has been threatened. Hence, the DPA held that the controller had violated the security of processing, enshrined in [Article 32)](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") and imposed on it an administrative fine of €26,000, pursuant to [Article 83(4)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#4a "Article 83 GDPR") in conjunction with Article 71 LOPDGDD.

Regarding the establishment of such a fine amount, two circumstances should be highlighted. First, the DPA deemed the high risk regarding data security to data subjects as a variety of their data was exposed by the controller’s app, grounded on [Article 83(2)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2a "Article 83 GDPR"). Second, based on [Article 83(2)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2b "Article 83 GDPR"), the DPA considered the controller's grave negligence after assessing the four cases of unduly data processing and failing to properly identify the potential risks to data subjects' rights and interests.

Lastly, the fine’s sum was initially set at €30,000, but pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the DPA informed the controller that it may make a voluntary payment of the proposed fine and waive its right to appeal. This action reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The fine can be reduced by a further 20% if the controller acknowledges its liability. The controller opted for both and reduced the fine by 40%, paying the reduced sanction amount of €18,000, based on Article 85(3) Law 39/2015.

 File No.: EXP202409828

RESOLUTION TERMINATING THE PROCEDURE FOR RECOGNITION OF LIABILITY AND VOLUNTARY PAYMENT

From the procedure initiated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: On May 23, 2025, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against OCI CINE, S.L. (hereinafter, OCINE), through the agreement transcribed below:

<<
File No.: EXP202409828

AGREEMENT TO INITIATE SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

Regarding the actions taken by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following

FACTS

FIRST: On June 5, 2024, A.A.A. (hereinafter, A.A.A.) filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency for a possible infringement
attributable to OCI CINE, S.L. with NIF B17070707 (hereinafter, OCINE).

The facts brought to the attention of this authority were:

A.A.A. She states that on 6/1/24, she opened the Ocine app on her mobile phone and that her account was automatically logged in because her Fidelity card (No.: \*\*\*CARD.1) was listed in the user information. She states that she knew it was hers because the

last digits are those of her ID. She selected the movie, the time, and chose her seats at the theater. In the next step of the purchase, there was a field to enter her Fidelity card or email address. In her case, that field appeared automatically; she didn't pay attention to the number, assuming it was her membership card. On the next screen (after skipping the step to select food), a summary of the purchase and contact information appeared,

but filled in with the name, surname, email, and phone number of another person.

Along with the written request, she provides, among other information:

- Screenshot with the details of her Fidelity account No. \*\*\*CARD.1.

28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 3/31

On August 12, 2024, this Agency received a response letter stating:

1. Detailed and chronological description of the events

The most relevant events listed by OCINE are summarized below:

- 03/19/2024: \*\*\*COMPANY.1 with NIF \*\*\*NIF.2 (\*\*\*COMPANY.1) reported to
OCINE that Google was reporting an error in the account deletion configuration, preventing the publication of new versions of the application and
warning of possible sanctions, such as the removal of the APP from the

platform. Initially, OCINE did not consider there to be a data security issue. \*\*\*COMPANY.1 urgently requested this Fidelity Plus account deletion form from \*\*\*COMPANY.2 with NIF \*\*\*NIF.3 (\*\*\*COMPANY.2). On March 20 and 28, 2024, OCI CINE again requested the aforementioned form from
\*\*\*COMPANY.2.

- April 3, 2024: \*\*\*COMPANY.2 sent the aforementioned form to OCINE only for Ocine Girona (proof) and requested OCINE's approval to implement it in the same way for the rest of the theaters.
- April 4, 2024: OCINE requested a series of explanations from \*\*\*COMPANY.2 and did not receive a response until April 17, 2024, when the matter was again requested.

- 04/07/2024: OCINE received the first reported incident due to data cross-referencing (C.C.C. case). On 04/08/2024, OCINE responded.
- 04/08/2024: \*\*\*EMPRESA.2 diagnosed and located the problem, which occurred during the synchronization of databases between theaters: customers who had registered on the same day at different theaters with the same registration number could view data that was not theirs, only from the app.

Only first name, last name, phone number, and email were displayed. The incident was a one-to-one incident. It was determined that the potential scope of the incident was not very large, therefore, the need to inform the AEPD
and the Fidelity Plus database of new registrations was ruled out. The AEPD website's "Assessor's Breach" resource was used. The outcome at the time was that it was not necessary to report the security breach since the rights and freedoms of individuals were not affected.
- 04/10/2024: OCINE received a new incident identical to the one on April 8 (case D.D.D.). That same day, OCINE responded to the client. The consequences for the processing of personal data were analyzed, and it was determined that the risk level had not changed. \*\*\*COMPANY.2 implemented a system that invalidated the token in cases where data was cross-referenced and requested that company \*\*\*COMPANY.1 request a new login request every time a 401 error was received to invalidate the token, as was the solution proposed after the diagnosis.
- 04/17/2024: OCINE received the third incident (case E.E.E.), in which the client
stated that a person from Mallorca had contacted her saying that all of her user data had been lost.
Therefore, this is an incident reported not by the person who viewed another person's data,
but by the person who saw their data compromised. That
same day, OCINE responded to the client. The consequences were analyzed at the
level of personal data processing, and it was considered that the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 4/31

risk level had not changed. \*\*\*COMPANY.2 responded to OCINE that: the error has been corrected
(referring to the data cross-referencing), but without error management by the app
(i.e., \*\*\*COMPANY.1), customers cannot be forced to log in again. If the app doesn't manage this, all customers will be unable
to use the app. This can't happen to all new logins, but not all

existing logins. Currently, the app doesn't
handle user authentication errors; it displays an error message, and the user doesn't know what's going on. That same day, OCINE reported to
\*\*\*EMPRESA.2 a new case of a customer who didn't indicate anything regarding
viewing another customer's data, but instead indicated that his
points from a recent purchase weren't properly reflected in his customer account

from the app, while the correct information was displayed on the website.\*\*\*EMPRESA.2 responded that: The APP does not manage authentication errors, therefore, the first thing all customers
who experience an issue with their data should do is log out and log back in.
OCINE informed the customer service department that, if any

complaints related to the display of data from the APP were received from
another customer, they should inform them that they needed to log out and
log back in. \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 informed OCINE that the
most plausible solution was to force all Fidelity users who were
logged into the APP to automatically log out and log in. By doing this, the
problem resulting from the cross-referencing of incorrect data would not

occur again. As an alternative, since the automatic login and logout procedure could not be
performed because updates could not be applied to the Play Store, the possibility of informing APP users via a
PUSH notification that they needed to log in and log out manually was discussed. It wasn't an idea OCINE liked, and it was discarded, given that there was no guarantee that everyone would do it and that the display of other customers' data wouldn't happen again, given that many people ignored the PUSH rules. That same day, \*\*\*EMPRESA.2 asked OCINE for information and texts to remove itself from the Fidelity Plus customer database.
- 04/18/2024: OCINE sent the text specifications to be implemented on the page to remove itself from the Fidelity Plus customer database. \*\*\*EMPRESA.2 reported that all the changes had been applied to the websites and that the form to unsubscribe from the Fidelity Plus database for any cinema was also implemented on ocinegirona.es. OCINE detected some errors and
informed \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 that it was only applied to Ocine Girona and that
perhaps it should be applied to the ocine.es page. The policies were not linked in the footer of
ocine.es, and that when they changed the language to ESP on the form page itself, it redirected to the home page.

- 04/24/2024: \*\*\*EMPRESA.2 responded to OCINE indicating that it was applied to
Ocine Girona because it was the website linked to the Play Store listing, and that, for
Google, it was sufficient. It couldn't be included on ocine.es because, like
registrations, cancellations were done at the theater. The policies had never been included on ocine.es because it had always been treated as a landing page to direct

users to one theater or another. The point of the language change is how it had
always worked on all pages: changing the language takes you to the home page
in the chosen language.
- 05/07/24: OCINE sent \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 the links to unsubscribe from the
Fidelity Plus customer database to implement in the Play Store and apply the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 5/31

agreed solution (logout + automatic login) and resolve the issue so that
no customer could see another customer's data again
arising from the previous cross-referencing (since no new cross-referencing was
occurring, all cross-referencing data displays were already generated by the previous cross-referencing).

- 05/09/24: OCINE requested a response from \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, but never received a response, and OCINE assumed this was a given, given that it stopped receiving complaints from
customers for the entire month.
- 06/01/24: OCINE receives the fourth incident (case A.A.A.). Complainant's case. On 06/03/24, OCINE responded to the client via several emails. The consequences for the processing of personal data were analyzed, and the risk level was deemed unchanged. The fourth case was reported to \*\*\*COMPANY.2 and \*\*\*COMPANY.1, as it should not have happened again. OCINE believed that either the data cross-referencing had occurred again (which, according to \*\*\*COMPANY.2, was already resolved on the first day the first case was reported) or that the login and logout solution for Android users had not been implemented when \*\*\*COMPANY.1 was requested. \*\*\*EMPRESA.2 reported to OCINE that: 'Given that
it's not showing your data, the app is unable to authenticate with
the server. Therefore, you must be using an old version of the app.
The ticket purchase section doesn't have additional validation,
therefore, if you have an old token, you log in with another user's data. For this

reason, it was so important to force a repeat login. If you haven't updated the app,
the same thing will happen indefinitely.'
- 07/17/2024: OCINE received the request from the AEPD (Spanish Data Protection Agency), and OCINE Management
requested a report on the status of the incident. \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 reported
that the update rate was good, but not all users had
updated to the latest version of the app. Management insisted that

a definitive solution must be found.
- 08/06/2024: \*\*\*COMPANY.2, in coordination with \*\*\*COMPANY.1, intervened at the software level in the components of the web service that supplied data to the app, blocking the ability to view data for outdated apps.

As a general conclusion, OCINE indicates that on 03/19/2024, it detected a technical problem in the implementation of its app. This problem has been definitively resolved. It also concludes that, taking into account the analysis carried out at the level of the rights and freedoms of the individuals involved, there was no violation.

2. Detailed specification of the causes that led to the incident

OCINE indicates that the cause of the problem was technical in origin:

- When a user registers, they are assigned an identifier assigned by the cinema
where they register.

- Every 24 hours, registration data (including any data changes) is replicated to a central server and subsequently replicated to the other theaters, with the aim of allowing users to enjoy the benefits of Fidelity at all of them.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 6/31

- This system of assigning identifiers to customers in a decentralized manner sometimes causes identifier coincidences, which are resolved at the time of replication by assigning a different identifier to the customer who has registered later.

- In the case of identifier reassignment, the user faces a temporary situation in which:
o If the registration process was completed through the website, there is no impact.

o If you completed the registration process through the app, there is a time window marked by the initial login you entered upon registration until a new login.
During this time, this user has the initial user number in the app by default, not the one that has been reassigned. Therefore, when they connect to the app, they see the data related to the other customer assigned this identifier.

▪ The data displayed for the other customer is:
• First and last name
• Email
• Telephone
• Card number
▪ The rest of the data we have about the customer is not visible:

• Address
• Date of birth
• Commercial usage data

A document entitled "Detailed specification of the

causes that led to the incident" is provided as ANNEX: 1.

3. Number of people affected by the personal data breach

OCINE provides a table indicating that "There is no way to know specifically the reassigned identifiers. Therefore, we will have to make estimates."

The total number of Fidelity users is 390,090. The total number of app users (which represents the maximum number of affected users without the restriction on cross-indicators): 26,397.

OCINE indicates that at most, there were 34 affected users at the time of the incident (customers registered since that date, who must have logged in to the app and had not logged in again since the incident was detected), which

represents 0.01% of the total Fidelity users.

4. Category of personal data involved

OCINE indicates that the categories of data and the specific personal data

affected were the following: First and last name, telephone number, and email address.

5. Possible consequences for affected individuals

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 7/31

OCINE indicates that on April 7, 2024, it received the first case and on April 8, 2024, an analysis was conducted on the consequences for the affected individuals, concluding that the incident did not impact their rights and freedoms. It indicates that the incident caused concern and some inconvenience to users, which the customer service department has attempted to mitigate by maintaining fluid communication with those involved and providing feedback as quickly as possible.

Attached is an image of a table showing the results of a

possible impact on the rights and freedoms of individuals, stating that "There is no risk
to rights and freedoms." Regarding the scope and extent of the processing, it states: "The impacted group is very small, and there is no impact on their rights and freedoms; it only impacts data that are not of a special nature." Regarding the "side effects of the processing," it states: "Data about the individual may be displayed that may allow the contact information of a person who has accessed this data (telephone number and email address), which may cause some inconvenience."

In the "Security of Processing" section, it can be seen that: "The events are not related to the materialization of threats or failures in the security measures applied."

APPENDIX 2 includes a document entitled "Details of the risk analysis on the possible impact on the rights and freedoms of individuals."

6. Detailed description of the actions taken to resolve the incident and

minimize its impact on those affected.

OCINE reiterates what was stated in the chronology of events regarding the actions taken by \*\*\*COMPANY.1 at the APP level and concludes:

"Therefore, in summary, the final action that resolved the problem is the following:

In the latest versions of the application, when an invalid token is detected, user identification is forced. Additionally, additional checks are added to the purchasing process to prevent users of outdated versions from identifying themselves as

other customers. These measures ensure that only users with valid and updated tokens can complete transactions, thus improving the security and accuracy of the system."

7. Security measures for personal data processing adopted prior to the incident, as well as documentation supporting the risk analysis that led to the implementation of said security measures and, where applicable, a copy of the impact assessments for the processing where the personal data security breach occurred.

OCINE indicates that it has two levels of security measures in place:
- Governance measures
- Security measures

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 8/31

Regarding governance measures, it highlights that it has a data protection policy, that data subjects are provided with information about the processing of their personal data, that all staff sign confidentiality clauses (the documentation signed by staff is provided as Annex 3-1) and that all organizational measures are communicated to them, that it has data processor contracts with the companies that manage data on behalf of OCINE (data processor contracts are provided as Annex 3-2), and indicates that it has a procedure for exercising rights and a procedure for managing incidents and notifying security breaches.

It also indicates that it has conducted a risk analysis, which is provided as ANNEX 4. It also indicates that it has conducted an analysis of the need for an impact analysis, which concluded that it was not necessary.

Regarding security measures, it indicates that it has measures in place to protect itself from natural and industrial disasters, measures to prevent unintentional errors and failures, and measures to protect against intentional attacks.

8. Copy of the processing activity log where the incident occurred.

The processing site where the incident occurred is Fidelity's. Information is provided on the processing activity log, which indicates that the following data is processed:

- Identification data: Name and surname, telephone number, postal address, ID number, and email address.
- Personal characteristics: Sex and date of birth
- Commercial information: Tickets purchased and cafeteria service consumed

9. If the security breach has been communicated to the affected individuals, please indicate

the channel used, date of communication, and details of the message sent. If not, please indicate the reasons.

OCINE states that it has considered from the outset that the incidents were
caused by a technical problem in the app that managed Fidelity customers, and
therefore, all communications with them have been

managed as such by the customer service department.

10. Indicate whether the security breach has been reported to this supervisory authority.
If not, please indicate the reasons why the security breach has not been reported within 72 hours.

OCINE indicates that at the time the first incident was received on April 7, 2024, an analysis was conducted from various perspectives and it was concluded

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 11/31

"that we were not facing a security breach; rather, a technical software problem."

A screenshot of a risk analysis regarding the Fidelity processing is provided, which concluded that there were no risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals or that these risks had been mitigated.

OCINE indicates that on April 8, 2024, it used the Breach Advisory resource on the AEPD website and that the result at the time was "IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO NOTIFY THE PERSONAL DATA BREACH TO THE AEPD." The query to this tool is provided as ANNEX 5.

OCINE indicates that it also conducted an analysis of the impact on the rights and freedoms of those affected, concluding that there was no impact.

11. Measures it intends to take to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.

MEASURE 1:
OCINE states that, because the root cause of the problem lay in the software development and its hasty implementation in production, the Directorate decided to implement additional software development best practices, inspired by the ISO 27002:2022 standard, Information security, cybersecurity, and privacy protection. Specifically, controls 8.30 related to the outsourcing of development and 8.31 separation of development, testing, and production environments.

Among other recommendations in the standard for these controls, it mentions:

- 8.30 related to the outsourcing of development
When system development is outsourced, the organization should communicate and

agree on requirements and expectations, and continuously monitor and review whether the
delivery of the outsourced work meets these expectations. It indicates that the following should be considered throughout the organization's external supply chain:
the provision of evidence that minimum acceptable levels of security and privacy have been established (e.g., assurance reports),
the provision of evidence that sufficient testing has been performed to protect

against the presence of known vulnerabilities, takes into consideration applicable legislation (e.g., on personal data protection).

- 8.31 Separation of development, testing, and production environments
The necessary level of separation between the production, testing, and development environments should be identified and implemented to avoid problems in production.
It indicates that consideration should include, among other things, appropriately separating development and production systems and operating them in different domains (e.g., in separate physical or virtual environments), testing changes to production systems and applications in a test or staging environment before applying them to production systems (see 8.29), not performing testing in production environments except under defined and approved circumstances,

MEASURE 2:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 12/31

The Management also decided that during 2024 a Data Protection Officer would be appointed for all the OCINE Group with the aim of improving compliance with data protection regulations and coordinating all actions among the different companies in the group.

MEASURE 3:
Conduct an extraordinary internal audit to review the level of compliance and identify improvements that would form the basis of the work plan for subsequent dates.

THIRD: On September 5, 2024, in accordance with Article 65 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act), the claim was admitted for processing.

FOURTH: According to the report collected from the AXESOR tool on May 8, 2025, the OCINE entity is a company incorporated in 1983, with a turnover of €5,216,496 in 2023.

LEGAL BASIS

I

Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each supervisory authority, and in accordance with the provisions of Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of

Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

II
Procedure

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions

of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules. on administrative procedures.”

In accordance with Article 64 of the LOPDGDD, and taking into account the

characteristics of the alleged violations committed, a sanctioning procedure is initiated.

The procedure will last a maximum of twelve months from the date
of the initiation agreement. After this period, it will expire and, consequently, the proceedings will be closed, in accordance with the provisions of
Article 64 of the LOPDGDD.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 13/31

If no objections are made to this initiation agreement within the stipulated period, it
may be considered a proposed resolution, as established in Article
64.2.f) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of

Public Administrations (in relation to (hereinafter, LPACAP).

III
Preliminary Questions

Article 4.1) of the GDPR defines “personal data” as: “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); An identifiable natural person is any person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person.

Article 4(2) of the GDPR defines "processing" as: "any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization,

structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation,
use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction."

Article 4.7 of the GDPR defines the "controller" or "data controller"

as: "the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing; If Union or Member State law determines the purposes and means of processing, the controller or the specific criteria for its appointment may be laid down by Union or Member State law.” In turn, Article

4.8) of the GDPR defines the “processor” or “processor” as the natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the controller.

In the present case, in accordance with Articles 4.1 and 4.2 of the GDPR,
the processing of personal data is established, since OCINE

carries out, among other processing, the collection and storage of personal data of natural persons: name and surname, telephone number, postal address, ID number, and email address.

OCINE carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller, given

that it is the party that determines the purposes and means of such activity, pursuant to Article 4.7 of the GDPR.

IV

Unfulfilled Obligation. Accuracy

Article 5.1(d) of the GDPR provides:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 14/31

"1. Personal data shall be:
(…)
d) accurate and, if necessary, kept up to date; all reasonable measures shall be taken

to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are processed are erased or rectified without delay ("accuracy");"

Regarding this principle, Recital 39 of the GDPR, among other things, states that: "(39) (…) to ensure that personal data are not retained longer than necessary, the controller must establish deadlines for their deletion or periodic review. All reasonable measures must be taken to ensure that inaccurate personal data are rectified or erased."

And Recital 71 of the GDPR: “(...) in order to ensure fair and transparent processing with respect to the data subject, taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed, the controller shall use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for profiling, implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure, in particular, that factors that introduce inaccuracies into the personal data are corrected and the risk of error is minimized, secure the personal data in a manner that takes into account potential risks to the interests and rights of the data subject and prevent, inter alia, discriminatory effects on natural persons based on race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or belief, trade union membership, genetic condition or health status, or sexual orientation, or processing that gives rise to measures producing such effects.”

Therefore, these precepts enshrine the principle of "accuracy," which requires the
data controller to verify the accuracy of the data subject's data through the implementation of appropriate measures.

In the present case, a technical problem occurred in the OCINE app for ticket purchases, which caused personal data to be exchanged between two Fidelity customers on at least four occasions.

OCINE itself acknowledged in its letter of August 12, 2024, that:

 On April 7, 2024, OCINE received the first reported incident due to

data cross-referencing (C.C.C.), in which it stated, "Good morning, I created
a new account, and when I logged in today, the data of another client of yours appeared."

 On April 10, 2024, OCINE received the second reported incident due to
data cross-referencing (D.D.D.), in which it stated: "Good morning, As I
mentioned, I was able to log in to the app. To my surprise, I logged in today
to my personal data out of curiosity and it didn't match mine... I also tried to log in to the website with my data and got an error.

I'm attaching screenshots of the app with data other than mine and the
error when trying to log in."

 On April 17, 2024, OCINE received the third incident reported for data cross-referencing (E.E.E.), which indicated, "Hello, good evening.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 15/31

Let's see, someone from Mallorca just sent me a screenshot of your card with my name, surname, ID, address (...)"

 On June 1, 2024, OCINE received the fourth incident (A.A.A.), which indicated, "Hello, good evening. Let's see, someone from Mallorca just sent me a screenshot of your card with my name, surname, ID, address" and "the problem is on the screen where the Fidelity card autofill appears. Instead of mine, someone else's card appeared. Later in the purchase process, their data appeared. As you can see, In my account,
my data has also been deleted. Mine ends in \*\*\*CARD.1
(which is my ID, so this is also sensitive data that has been shared by B.B.B.) and the one that was automatically filled in during the purchase ends
in \*\*\*CARD.2."

In its letter of August 12, 2024, OCINE indicated that the categories of data and
specific personal data affected were the following: First and last name,
phone number, and email. However, the Fidelity card number of those affected was also affected by the incident, since that OCINE customer number contains the
ID number of those affected.

That is, at least the data shown by OCINE affected by the incident in question, of at least 8 affected people (two people per reported crossing), was not
accurate.

Therefore, based on the evidence currently available,
the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings is considered that the known facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to OCINE, for violating Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR.

V
Classification of the violation of Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR and classification for the purposes of limitation

Article 83.5 of the GDPR classifies as an administrative violation the violation of the

following articles, which shall be punishable, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

"a) the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9;"

For its part, the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data) in its Article 71, "Infractions," states that:

"Infractions constitute the acts and conduct referred to in sections 4,

5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law."

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 16/31

For the sole purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on Personal Data Protection) establishes the following:

"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:
a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees established in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679."

VI
Proposed sanction for the violation of Art. 5.1.d) of the GDPR

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:

“1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 9, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures provided for in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:
a) the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the operation. of the processing concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them;

b) the intentionality or negligence of the breach;
c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects;
d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;

e) any previous breaches committed by the controller or processor;
f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate any adverse effects of the breach;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;
h) how the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the breach and, if so, to what extent;
i) where the measures referred to in Article 58(2) have been previously ordered against the controller or processor in question in relation to the same matter, compliance with such measures;

j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42, and

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 17/31

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,
such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement."

For its part, Article 76 "Sanctions and Corrective Measures" of the LOPDGDD
provides:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria

established in section 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
the following may also be taken into account:

a) The continuous nature of the infringement.

b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.
c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the infringement.
d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the commission of the infringement.
e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the offender. to the acquiring entity.
f) The impact on the rights of minors.
g) Having a data protection officer, when not mandatory.
h) The voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in cases where

there are disputes between them and any interested party."

In the present case, considering the seriousness of the potential violations,
with special attention to the consequences that their commission has on those affected, a fine would be appropriate.

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate,
and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR. To guarantee
these principles, OCINE's turnover (€5,216,496 in 2023) is considered as a preliminary consideration.

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence currently available to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following circumstances, as contemplated in the aforementioned provisions.

Prior to this, it is considered that the following circumstances exist:

• The nature, severity, and duration of the breach, taking into account the
nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as

the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered (Article 83.2, letter a) of the GDPR): due to the inaccuracy of the personal data
of name, surname, ID number, telephone number, and email address of its Fidelity customers, which affected eight data subjects, at least from April 7, 2024, to August 6, 2024. The combined factor of all these different types of personal data makes the possible consequences, the impact of the materialization of the risk for the data subjects, of greater consideration, which

is also taken into account when to determine the possible sanction.
• Intentionality/Negligence in the violation (Article 83.2, letter b) of the GDPR): OCINE's actions were grossly negligent, as it received
four incident reports, and it was not until this Agency sent it a
request for information on this matter that it took the necessary measures
to resolve the underlying technical problem.

• The categories of personal data affected by the
violation (Article 83.2, letter g) of the GDPR): in the present case, the DNI number, among other data, was improperly disseminated.

The numerical identifier of the DNI, together with the verification character

corresponding to the tax identification number, unequivocally identifies a natural person. This quality makes it particularly sensitive data because, if its processing is not accompanied by the necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure that the person identified with it is actually its owner, a third party can easily impersonate a natural person, or, in other words, can commit identity fraud, with the risks this entails for the privacy, honor, and assets of the person impersonated.

Therefore, these circumstances are taken into account when graduating the sanction to be imposed.

The following gradation factors are also considered as aggravating factors:

• The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data (Article 76.2, letter b) of the LOPDGDD):
OCINE is a company founded in 1983 that sells movie tickets, for which it continuously processes the personal data of its customers.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR, allows for the initial imposition of an administrative fine of €4,000.00.

VII
Breach of obligation. Security of processing

Article 32 of the GDPR stipulates the following:

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 19/31

organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, which, where appropriate, includes, among others:
a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;

b) the ability to guarantee the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services;
c) the ability to restore availability of and access to personal data promptly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
d) a process of regular verification, evaluation, and assessment the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing.

2. When assessing the adequacy of the level of security, particular account shall be taken of the risks posed by the processing of data, in particular as a result of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.

3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or a certification mechanism approved pursuant to Article 42 may serve as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.

4. The controller and the processor shall take measures to ensure that any person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to personal data only processes those data on instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law.

Article 32 of the GDPR requires data controllers to adopt the necessary technical and organizational security measures to ensure that processing complies with current regulations, as well as to ensure that any person acting under the authority of the controller or processor who has access to personal data may only process them following the controller's instructions.

It should be noted that the aforementioned provision does not establish a list of specific security measures according to the data being processed, but rather establishes the obligation for the controller and processor to implement technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk posed by the processing, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, and the risks of likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

Likewise, security measures must be appropriate and proportionate to the risk detected, determining the appropriate technical and organizational measures, taking into account pseudonymization and encryption, the ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience, the ability to restore the availability and access to data after an incident, a verification process (not an audit), and an evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the measures.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 20/31

In any case, when assessing the adequacy of the security level, the risks posed by data processing must be particularly taken into account, such as the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration of personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed, or the unauthorized communication or access to such data, which could cause physical, material, or immaterial damage.

Furthermore, Recital 74 of the GDPR states that: "The controller's liability for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller or on its own behalf should be established. In particular, the controller should be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures and must be able to demonstrate the compliance of the processing activities with this Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. Those measures should take into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons."

Therefore, this principle, applied to the processing of a customer's data that is necessary for the business activity, requires that such processing be carried out using technical and organizational methods that guarantee the security and confidentiality of the personal data.

In the present case, as OCINE acknowledged in its letter of August 12, 2024, at least from April 7, 2024, to August 6, 2024, when a user registered, they were assigned an identifier assigned by the theater where they registered. Every 24 hours, the registration data (and any data changes) were replicated to a central server and subsequently replicated to the other theaters, so that the user could enjoy the benefits of Fidelity at all of them.

This system of assigning identifiers to customers in a decentralized manner sometimes caused identifier matches, which were resolved at the time of replication by assigning a different identifier to the customer who registered later.

However, in the case of ID reassignment, the user had a
temporary situation in which, if they had completed the registration process through the app,

they had a time window determined by the initial login they had entered upon registration until a new login. This time, this user had the app's default
user ID, not the one that had been reassigned. Therefore, when they
connected to the app, they saw the data relating to the other client assigned this ID: first and last name, email address, phone number, and Fidelity card number.

OCINE had contracted suppliers: \*\*\*COMPANY.1 with NIF \*\*\*NIF.2
(\*\*\*COMPANY.1) and \*\*\*COMPANY.2 with NIF \*\*\*NIF.3 (\*\*\*COMPANY.2).

On March 19, 2024, \*\*\*COMPANY.1 reported to OCINE that Google had reported an
error in the account deletion configuration. That same day, \*\*\*COMPANY.1 urgently requested a Fidelity Plus account deletion form from \*\*\*COMPANY.2 and requested it again on March 20 and 28, 2023.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 21/31

On April 3, 2024, \*\*\*COMPANY.2 sent OCINE proof of the aforementioned form.
On April 4, 2024, OCINE requested a series of explanations from \*\*\*COMPANY.2, but received no response.

On April 7, 2024, OCINE received the first reported incident of data cross-referencing (D.C.C.).

On April 8, 2024, \*\*\*EMPRESA.2 diagnosed and localized the problem. OCINE

analyzed the incident and concluded that there were no risks to the rights and freedoms
of those affected.

On April 10, 2024, OCINE received the second reported incident of data cross-referencing (D.D.D.). The consequences for the processing of personal data were analyzed, and the risk level was deemed unchanged.
\*\*\*EMPRESA.2 implemented a system that invalidated the token in cases where data cross-referencing occurred and requested that \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 request the login request again every time a 401 error was received to invalidate the token.

On April 17, 2024, OCINE received the third reported incident involving data cross-referencing (E.E.E.). The consequences for the processing of personal data were analyzed, and the risk level was deemed unchanged. \*\*\*EMPRESA.2 responded to OCINE that the error regarding data cross-referencing had been corrected, but that they needed \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 to manage the error on the app's part to force customers to log in again. They indicated that at that time, if there was a user authentication error, an error message was displayed, and the user did not know what was happening. That same day, OCINE reported to \*\*\*EMPRESA.2 a new case of a customer who did not indicate anything regarding the display of another customer's data, but rather indicated that their points from a recent purchase were not properly reflected in their customer account via the app, and that the correct information was displayed on the website. \*\*\*EMPRESA.2 responded that the first thing all customers who experience an issue with their data should do is log out and log back in. Therefore, OCINE informed the customer service department that if any complaints were received regarding the viewing of data from the APP from any other customer, they should inform them that they needed to log out and log back in. \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 informed OCINE that the most plausible solution was to force all Fidelity users logged into the APP to automatically log out and log in. That same day, \*\*\*EMPRESA.2 requested information and texts from OCINE to delete itself from the Fidelity Plus customer database.

On April 18, 2024, OCINE sent the specifications for the texts to be implemented on the page for deleting itself from the Fidelity Plus customer database. \*\*\*EMPRESA.2 reported that all the changes had been applied to the websites and that the form to unsubscribe from the Fidelity Plus database for any cinema had also been implemented.

On May 7, 2025, OCINE sent \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 the links to unsubscribe from the Fidelity Plus customer database to implement in the Play Store and apply the agreed-upon solution (logout + automatic login) and resolve the issue so that no customer could see another customer's data derived from the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 22/31

cross-referencing that had previously occurred (since no new cross-referencing was occurring, all cross-referencing data displays were already generated by the previous cross-referencing).

On May 9, 2024, OCINE requested a response from \*\*\*COMPANY.1, but no response was ever received, and OCINE assumed this was a given, given that it had stopped receiving customer complaints throughout the month.

On June 1, 2024, OCINE received the fourth incident (A.A.A.). The consequences of the processing of personal data were analyzed, and the risk level was deemed unchanged. OCINE reported the fourth incident to \*\*\*COMPANY.2 and
\*\*\*COMPANY.1, given that it should not have happened again. \*\*\*COMPANY.2
reported to OCINE that: "Given that the data is not being displayed, the app is unable to authenticate with the server. Therefore, you must be using an

old version of the app." The ticket purchase section does not have additional validation,
so if you have an old token, you log in with another user's data.
For this reason, it was so important to force a repeat login. If you haven't updated the app,
the same thing will happen indefinitely.

On July 17, 2024, OCINE received the AEPD request and requested a report

on the status of the incident. \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 reported that the update pace was good, but not all users had updated to the
latest version of the app. Management insisted that a definitive solution must be found.

On August 6, 2024, \*\*\*EMPRESA.2, in coordination with \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, intervened
at the software level in the components of the web service that supplied data to the app,
blocking the ability to view data for non-updated apps.

That is, on March 19, 2024, OCINE was aware of a problem with the app and requested a specific form from its provider, which was sent to it on April 3, 2024. It requested an explanation the following day, but received no response.

On April 7, 2024, OCINE received the first reported incident, and was aware that there had been a breach of confidentiality regarding the personal data of one of its clients. However, it considered that there was no risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

On April 8, 2024, the problem had been diagnosed and localized, and OCINE concluded that there were no risks to the rights and freedoms of those affected.

On April 10, 2024, OCINE received the second reported incident, but still considered that there was no risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

On April 17, 2024, OCINE received the third reported incident, which specified that the confidentiality of a customer's data had been violated:
name, surname, ID number, address. However, it still considered that there was no risk to the rights and freedoms of those affected. That same day, OCINE was

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 23/31

informed that the most plausible solution was to force all Fidelity users who were logged in to the APP to automatically log out and log in.

On May 7, 2025, OCINE sent \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 the links to unsubscribe from the Fidelity Plus customer database to implement in the Play Store and apply the agreed-upon solution (logout + automatic login) and resolve the incident so that it would not occur again.

On May 9, 2024, OCINE requested a response from \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, but never received a response, and OCINE assumed this was a given, given that it had stopped receiving customer complaints throughout the month. However, it did not confirm at any time with its provider

or on its own that such a solution had been implemented.

On June 1, 2024, OCINE received the fourth reported incident (A.A.A.). The consequences for the processing of personal data were analyzed, and the risk level was deemed unchanged. OCINE reported the fourth case to

\*\*\*EMPRESA.2 and \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, and OCINE is aware (through
\*\*\*EMPRESA.2) that users were not forced to update the app and log in again.

On July 17, 2024, OCINE received the request from the AEPD (Spanish Data Protection Agency) and requested a report
on the status of the incident. \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 reported that the pace of updates was good, but not all users had updated to the
latest version of the app.

It wasn't until August 6, 2024, that \*\*\*EMPRESA.2, in coordination with
\*\*\*EMPRESA.1, intervened at the software level in the components of the web service that
supplied data to the app, blocking the ability to view data for non-updated

apps.

Therefore, four months passed from the first reported incident (on April 7, 2024), in which
OCINE was already aware that the confidentiality of its clients' personal data had not been guaranteed, until the incident was definitively resolved (August 6, 2024). These were four months in which

it is known that the security of the personal data of the 26,397 clients of the OCINE app was not guaranteed.

Furthermore, in the present case, the security of the following
data was not guaranteed: name, surname, ID number, telephone number, and email address of its Fidelity clients. Not only is the ID number particularly sensitive,

but the combined factor of all these different types of personal data makes
the potential consequences, the impact of the risk materializing for the data subjects, even more significant.

Therefore, based on the evidence currently available

in the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, it is considered that the known facts
could constitute an infringement, attributable to OCINE, for violating
Article 32 of the GDPR.

VIII
Classification of the violation of Article 32 of the GDPR and classification for the purposes of limitation

Article 83.4 of the GDPR classifies the violation of the following articles as an administrative offense. The following shall be punishable, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 10,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the total annual global turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

"a) the obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39, 42, and 43;"

For its part, the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data) in its Article 71, "Infractions," states that:

"Infractions constitute the acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law."

For the sole purpose of the statute of limitations, Article 73 of the LOPDGDD establishes

the following:

"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the

following, are considered serious and will be subject to a two-year statute of limitations:
f) Failure to adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing,
in the terms required by Article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679."

IX
Proposed sanction for infringement of Article 32 of the GDPR

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:

“1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 9, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures provided for in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). When deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:

a) the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the
nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 25/31

b) the intentionality or negligence of the infringement;
c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects;

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;
e) any previous infringements committed by the controller or processor;
f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the infringement and mitigate its potential adverse effects;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
h) the manner in which the supervisory authority knowledge of the infringement, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the infringement and, if so, to what extent;
(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have been previously ordered against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with those measures;
(j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42; and
(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.

For its part, Article 76 "Sanctions and Corrective Measures" of the LOPDGDD
provides:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria
established in section 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

the following may also be taken into account:

a) The continuous nature of the infringement.

b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.

c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the infringement.

d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the commission

of the infringement.

e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the acquiring entity.
f) The impact on the rights of minors.
g) Having, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.

h) The voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.

In the present case, considering the seriousness of the potential violations,

paying special attention to the consequences that their commission has on those affected, a fine would be appropriate.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 26/31

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate,
and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR. To guarantee
these principles, OCINE's turnover is considered as a preliminary matter

(€5,216,496 in 2023).

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence available at the time of the decision to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered appropriate to scale the sanction to be imposed according to

the following circumstances, contemplated in the aforementioned provisions.

Prior to this, the following circumstances are deemed to exist:

• The nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the

nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered (Article 83.2, letter a) of the GDPR): for failing to guarantee the
security of the first name, last name, ID number, telephone number, and email address of its 26,397 OCINE app customers, at least from April 7, 2024, to August 6, 2024. The combined factor of all these
different types of personal data makes the potential consequences, the
impact of the materialization of the risk for the data subjects, of greater consideration, which is also taken into account when assessing the possible
sanction.

• Intentionality/Negligence in the violation (Article 83.2, letter b) of the GDPR): OCINE's actions were grossly negligent, as it conducted four analyses (one for each incident report) on the impact of personal data in the present case, and in none of these was it able to adequately identify the risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

• The categories of personal data affected by the violation (Article 83.2, letter g) of the GDPR): in the present case, the DNI number, among other data, was improperly disseminated.

The numerical identifier of the DNI, together with the verification character corresponding to the tax identification number, unequivocally identifies a natural person. This quality makes it particularly sensitive data because, if its processing is not accompanied by the necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure that the person identified with it is truly its owner, a third party can easily impersonate a natural person, or, in other words, can commit identity fraud, with the associated risks to the privacy, honor, and assets of the person impersonated.

Therefore, these circumstances are taken into account when determining the sanction to be imposed.

Likewise, the following grading factors are considered aggravating factors:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 27/31

• The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data (Article 76.2, letter b) of the LOPDGDD):

OCINE is a company founded in 1983 dedicated to the sale of cinema tickets, for which it continuously processes the personal data of its customers.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of

Article 32 of the GDPR, allows for the initial imposition of an administrative fine of
€26,000.00.

Therefore, in light of the above, the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
HAS RESOLVED:

FIRST: TO INITIATE SANCTIONING PROCEEDINGS against OCI CINE, S.L., with NIF B17070707, for the alleged violation of Article 5.1.d) and Article 32 of the GDPR, defined, respectively, in Articles 83.5 and 83.4 of the GDPR.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 28/31

reduction, the penalty would be set at €24,000.00, and the procedure would be resolved with the imposition of this penalty.

Likewise, the defendant may, at any time prior to the resolution of this
proceeding, voluntarily pay the proposed penalty, which
will result in a 20% reduction in its amount. With the application of this reduction,
the penalty would be set at €24,000.00, and its payment would terminate

the procedure, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding measures.

The reduction for voluntary payment of the fine is cumulative with the reduction applicable for acknowledgment of liability, provided that this acknowledgment of liability is made clear within the period granted for submitting allegations at the opening of the procedure. Voluntary payment of the amount referred to in the preceding paragraph may be made at any time prior to the resolution. In this case, if both reductions were to be applied, the amount of the fine would be set at €18,000.00.

In any case, the effectiveness of either of the two aforementioned reductions will be conditioned upon the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the fine.

If you choose to voluntarily pay any of the amounts

mentioned above (€24,000.00 or €18,000.00), you must do so by depositing it into account IBAN: ES00-0000-0000-0000-0000-0000
(BIC/SWIFT Code: CAIXESBBXXX) opened in the name of the Spanish Data Protection Agency at the bank CAIXABANK, S.A., indicating in the
title the reference number of the procedure shown in the heading

of this document and the reason for the reduction in the amount you are applying for.

You must also send proof of payment to the Subdirectorate General of Inspection so that the procedure can continue in accordance with the amount
deposited.

Finally, it is noted that, pursuant to Article 112.1 of the LPACAP,

there is no administrative appeal against this act.

the procedure may be terminated with the imposition of the appropriate sanction.

2. When the sanction is solely pecuniary in nature, or when a pecuniary sanction and a non-pecuniary sanction may be imposed, but the inadmissibility of the second sanction has been justified, voluntary payment by the alleged responsible party, at any time prior to the resolution, will entail the termination of the procedure,
except with regard to the restoration of the altered situation or the determination of compensation for damages caused by the commission of the offense. Infraction.
