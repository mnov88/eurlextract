## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant lodged a complaint with the AEPD about the installation of video surveillance cameras in the neighbours' doorway, from which several entrances to homes could be monitored, and believed that excessive and disproportionate use was being made of the video surveillance system in relation to data protection regulations.

The defendant responded that the installation of the video surveillance system was necessary to protect himself and his family from neighbourhood disputes caused by non-payment by his tenants.

### Dispute

Is the installation of a video surveillance system in a community of neighbours, without the authorization of the rest of the neighbours, a breach of Article 13 GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD held that the video surveillance system was excessive in relation to the purposes alleged by the defendant. It imposed a warning sanction and ordered that the system should only be operational when the defendant or his family were living at the address where the camera was located.

Given that the defendant is a natural person, that there is no evidence of recidivism and that, furthermore, he has shown cooperation with the AEPD in repairing the possible damage caused, it was decided to impose a warning sanction.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                             I

The Director of the Spanish Agency is competent to resolve this procedure

of Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of art. 58.2 of the GDPR and
in art. 47 and 48.1 of LOPDGDD.

                                             II

loyal and transparent:

a) the period during which the personal data will be kept or, when it is not

4.The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply when and in the
to the extent that the interested party already has the information. "

The aforementioned infractions are classified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, which
provides the following:

"Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,

the highest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the treatment

b) the rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22 \[…\] "

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/14

For the purposes of the statute of limitations for offenses, both offenses are
considered very serious and prescribe after three years, in accordance with article 72.1 of the
LOPDGDD, which establishes that:

"Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. \[…\]

h) The omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the processing of their data
personal in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU)

2016/679 and 12 of this Organic Law. \[…\] "

                                           III

Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the cases in which the
processing of personal data, providing within them - article 6.1.e) - the

that refers to the legality "the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of
a mission carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of public powers
conferred on the person responsible for the treatment ”.

In the specific field of data processing for video surveillance purposes, the

Article 22.1 of the LOPDGDD provides that “people may carry out the
Image processing through camera or video camera systems with the
purpose of preserving the safety of people and property, as well as their
facilities ”dedicating the rest of the sections of this article to the
specificities to which this data processing must be submitted.

In this sense, and with regard to the specific case that is the object of this present
sanctioning procedure, it can be affirmed, taking into account the declarations
made by the defendant about the purpose pursued with the chamber of
video surveillance installed on the portal of the property of which it is the owner and in which
maintains a home for his personal use, that said treatment responds to the

objective of guaranteeing the safety of people (the claimed person and the
family members) in the face of the problematic relationships maintained with
tenants who reside in the rented dwelling within the property owned by the
reclaimed. We would, therefore, be faced with a case in the person responsible for the treatment
performs a mission in the public interest.

Now, to consider the concurrence of the public interest, this must be
proportionate with respect to the purpose pursued, inasmuch as its exercise is
susceptible to affect the physical image as personal data and therefore represents a
interference in the field of fundamental rights of people. What

Consequently, it will be necessary to make a weighting between the mission of
public interest to ensure the safety of people carried out by the
responsible for the treatment and the rights of the tenants, who in the present
Of course, their privacy and freedom of movement may be affected by the fact that the

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/14

The area captured by the camera affects the common area that serves as access to both
households.

In order to carry out this weighting and evaluate the proportionality of the
measure, it is necessary to take into consideration the Judgment of the Constitutional Court
207/1996, in which the High Court determines that “to verify whether a measure
restriction of a fundamental right exceeds the judgment of proportionality, it is
It is necessary to verify if it meets the following three requirements or conditions: if such
measure is capable of achieving the proposed objective (suitability judgment); Yes,

Furthermore, it is necessary, in the sense that there is no other more moderate measure to
the achievement of such purpose with equal effectiveness (judgment of necessity); and finally yes
it is weighted or balanced, as more benefits or advantages derive from it
for the general interest that damages to other goods or values in conflict (judgment
of proportionality in the strict sense) ”.

Applying, therefore, this judgment of proportionality to the specific assumption proceeds
note the following:

● The installation of a video surveillance system can be considered an ideal means
to achieve in order to guarantee the safety of the claimed and their family, for

how much it is capable of fulfilling both a preventive objective and proving
documentary evidence of the occurrence of certain events that suppose an attack on said
security.

● It can be considered that the treatment complies with the principle of minimizing

data and is moderate with respect to the area captured by the camera since it is
limits to areas only to areas common to both houses where they can
coincide the claimed and the tenants, without affecting the area in any way
exclusive of use and enjoyment of these.

● It can also be considered that the treatment complies with the principle of
minimization of data and is moderate in relation to the conservation period of
the images, for the aforementioned term, in accordance with what was stated by the
claimed, it is only 1 day.

● However, given that the purpose alleged by the defendant is

ensure the safety of your person and your family members during the
time in which any of them makes use of their home in the property and therefore
both can coincide spatially and temporally with the tenants (without there being any
alleged at no time the need to preserve the safety of one's own
property), the processing of data would be excessive when those circumstances

they do not take place, since they would exceed the purpose for which they respond.

In conclusion, it cannot be said that it is proportionate that the system of
installed video surveillance is operational at all times as the purpose
pursued by the person in charge is not reached when the defendant or a member of

your family is not using the home in the property; in this
In this circumstance, it could not be concluded that the mission of public interest prevails over
fundamental rights of those affected.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/14

In accordance, therefore, with the foregoing, the video surveillance system, to the extent
that was operational all the time (it was disconnected on February 2),
violated the provisions of article 5.1.c) of the RGPD.

                                            IV

Regarding the duty of information provided for in article 12 of the RGPD (with
the content provided in the subsequent article 13, article 22.4 of the LOPDGDD
determines that

“\[…\] It will be understood that it has been fulfilled by placing an information device in
sufficiently visible place identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment, the
identity of the person in charge and the possibility to exercise the rights provided in the
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the

informational device a connection code or internet address to this
information.

In any case, the data controller must keep at the disposal of the
affected the information referred to in the aforementioned regulation ”.

According to the report and the photographic images provided by the report of the
Commander of the Acctal Post. of the Civil Guard of \*\*\* LOCALIDAD.1, the system
video surveillance has two informative posters that comply with the provisions
in the previously transcribed precept as it identifies the existence of
treatment and offers information about the person in charge, the possibility and direction to

Where to go to exercise the rights contained in articles 15 to 22 of the
RGPD, as well as an email address and a telephone number where to request more
information.

Regarding the possible breach of this duty at the time of filing

the claim, it is noted that the defendant declares that, even when the cameras are
installed in August 2019, the video surveillance system did not go into operation
until September 21. Therefore, since it has not been proven that the
camera will be in operation at the time of filing the claim
(the claimant indicates that the person in charge has shown images of their tickets and
exits from the building, but does not provide an indication in this regard), it is not possible to determine that

there would have been on that date an effective data processing and, therefore, a
omission of the duty of information.

The principle of the right to the presumption of innocence, recognized as a right
subjective fundamental in article 24 of the Spanish Constitution, prevents imposing

an administrative sanction when a proof of
charge accrediting the facts that motivate the imputation or the intervention in the
the alleged offender and applying the principle "in dubio pro reo" in case of
doubt regarding a concrete and determined fact, which in any case obliges
resolve said doubt in the most favorable way to the interested party.

The aforementioned right to the presumption of innocence is also included in a
expressed in article 53.2.b) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Procedure

administrative procedures of a sanctioning nature, the alleged
Responsible parties will have the following rights:

the contrary is proven. "

In relation to this principle, the Constitutional Court in its Sentence 76/1990, of 26
April, considers that the right to the presumption of innocence entails: “that the
sanction is based on acts or probative means of charge or incriminating of the
reproached conduct; that the burden of proof rests with the accuser, without

no one is obliged to prove their own innocence; and that any insufficiency in the
result of the tests carried out, freely assessed by the sanctioning body,
it must be translated into an acquittal. "

                                           V

However, what is established in article 83.5, sections a) and b), of the RGPD, its art.
58.2 b) provides the possibility of sanctioning with warning, in relation to the
indicated in Recital 148:

"In the event of a minor offense, or if the fine that is likely to be imposed

would constitute a disproportionate burden for an individual, rather than
sanction by fine may be imposed a warning. It must however
pay special attention to the nature, severity and duration of the offense, to its
intentional nature, to the measures taken to alleviate the damages suffered,
the degree of responsibility or any relevant prior infringement, the way in which

that the supervisory authority has had knowledge of the infringement, to the fulfillment
of measures ordered against the person in charge or in charge, to the adherence to codes of
conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance. "

In the present case, when deciding the sanction to impose, they have taken into account
count the following items,

 That the person responsible is a natural person.

 That there is no recidivism or repetition due to the fact that the commission of

previous infractions.

● That it has shown collaboration in this organization within the present
sanctioning procedure

Therefore, it is considered that the sanction that would correspond to impose is
warning, in accordance with the provisions of article 58.2 b) of the RGPD, in
relation to what is stated in Considering 148, cited above.
