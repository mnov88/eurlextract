## English Summary

### Facts

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) received a complaint regarding a website that was sending spam to them, and that additionally placed cookies without consent (or possibility of opposing) when visiting their site. This website (pulpower.com/es/) is owned by a British marketing company, Aldaniti International Network LTD.

Given that the mentioned company doesn't have any premises or establishments in Spain, and therefore has no Spanish Tax number or any related information, the AEPD submitted a request to the [Internal Market Information System](https://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/imi-net/index_en.htm) (IMI), following the [Regulation 1024/2012](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32012R1024) (IMI Regulation). In August 2019, the ICO accepted the case, and subsequently the AEPD provisionally archived their own case.

However, the Spanish DPA did not receive any update on the case within the IMI request upon the entry into effect of Brexit, that implies that the United Kingdom is not any more a Member State of the European Union and is therefore nor affected by or part of European regulations.

### Holding

The AEPD concluded that, given the fact Brexit, that implies that the United Kingdom is not any more a Member State of the European Union and is therefore nor affected by or part of European regulations, the authority will not be able to identify the controller, which is required by Spanish law for sanction procedures.

The Spanish Tax authority did not hold any data on the controller either and therefore it was not possible to launch a sanction procedure against it.

For this reason, the AEPD decided to archive the case.

In accordance with the investigative and corrective powers that article 58 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter
RGPD) grants each control authority, and according to the provisions of article 47 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), is competent to

Data Protection.

                                             II

Prior to the initiation of sanctioning actions, it is necessary to identify the

presumed responsible for the administrative offense.

Article 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on Administrative Procedure
Common of Public Administrations, referring to the Initiation Agreement in the
procedures of a sanctioning nature, establishes the following:

        "1. The initiation agreement will be communicated to the instructor of the procedure, with
transfer of how many actions exist in this regard, and the interested parties will be notified,
understanding in any case the accused as such. Likewise, the initiation will be communicated
to the complainant when the rules governing the procedure so provide.

        2. The initiation agreement must contain at least:
        a) Identification of the person or persons allegedly responsible.
        ... "

In order to be able to initiate sanctioning actions, the Agency has been requested
State Tax Administration if there was any NIF associated with the entity
claimed, for identification.

The State Tax Administration Agency has responded to the Spanish Agency
of Data Protection that has not been able to locate any NIF related to the

claimed entity.
Therefore, although the claim presented, if detrimental to the possible prescription
of the infringements claimed, could constitute an infringement of the regulations of

data protection, it is not possible to initiate sanctioning actions due to not having
Tax identification of the alleged person responsible.

Therefore, in accordance with the provisions, by the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, IT IS AGREED:

FIRST: PROCEED WITH THE FILING of these actions.
