## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject submitted a claim against an insurance company (the controller) for allowing changes to their health insurance policy. The insurance policy was initially signed in 2016 and linked to the data subject as policyholder as well as the owner of the bank account from which the insurance premiums were paid. However, the insured person was their former partner.

In June 2021, the data subject’s former partner submitted a request to change the health insurance policy data, which was done by the bank (the processor). The data changed were the policyholder name and the bank account to which the insurance premiums were associated, allowing the data subject’s former partner to pay the insurance fees themselves. These changes were made without the consent of the data subject.

After a first complaint by the data subject to the processor, the data subject was included as the insurance holder again. After a further complaint, their bank account number was restored.

In August 2022, the Spanish DPA started a sanctioning proceeding against the controller, which allowed to hear the claims from the involved parties. Both the controller and the processor claimed to have obtained implicit consent from the data subject since their initial wish was to cover their partner and that, by losing their status as insurance holder, their obligations were lifted, which was considered a presumed benefit for the data subject.

### Holding

The DPA started by noting that changes to the insurance policy were not authorised by the data subject and none of the legal basis under [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") could be observed. Meanwhile, the principle of legal processing of data required an accreditation of the consent for the processing as well as a reasonable diligence to prove it. Simply implying that a data subject would consent to a change in the policy cannot in any way be regarded as a valid legal basis. The Spanish DPA found a violation of [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") for illegal processing of personal data by the controller.

The DPA decided on appropriate measures against the controller. Based on [Article 72(1)(b) of the national data protection law](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673), and [Articles 83(1) and 83(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR "Article 83 GDPR"), the DPA considered aggravating circumstances. Firstly, there was a lack of legal basis for the processing affecting the fundamental right to data protection. Secondly, the controller was one of the main insurance companies in the country whose activity was directly linked to the processing of personal data from clients and from third parties. Finally, the controller showed grievous lack of due care and diligence. The two latter factors were associated with the Supreme Court’s case law regarding the higher due care attributed to companies whose activity involves abundant processing of personal data.

Therefore, the Spanish DPA proposed a fine of €40,000 which was reduced to €24,000 with the application of two reductions: the acceptance of guilt, and the voluntary payment of the fine.

with the unilateral modification of the policy linked to your loan contract,
receiving a response on 07/27/2021, indicating that the modifications were requested
from your management office by the insured person (your ex-partner) and that, however,
the loan discounts have been maintained. The claimant states that the

brother of her ex-partner works in the office from which the
Non-consensual modifications in the contractual data.
Provides admission for processing of the divorce application, copy of the claims
made and the responses received, as well as a claim addressed to the Management
General Insurance and Pension Funds, of 10/20/2021.

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, of Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
hereinafter LOPDGDD), said claim was transferred to the claimed party/, to
to proceed with its analysis and inform this Agency within a month of the
actions carried out to adapt to the requirements set forth in the regulations of

Data Protection.

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of
October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Administrations
Public (hereinafter, LPACAP), was collected on 12/20/2021 as recorded in the

acknowledgment of receipt that works in the file.

On 01/14/2022, the respondent responded to the request made, indicating that the
05/31/2016 the claimant formalized a guaranteed loan with IBERCAJA
mortgage agreement at a fixed interest rate of 3.25% (interest rate not met

bonuses), unless it was actually verified that the requirements were met.
Bonus conditions as indicated in the section of the deed
mortgage "LINKS AND OTHER COSTS", in which case it would apply
referred to therein with a minimum applicable interest rate of 1.750% in the event that
all the agreed bonuses are fulfilled, among which is the
contracting with CASER of the "Ibercaja Salud" insurance. The interest rate agreed in the

deed is the interest rate agreed in the mortgage loan operation and that
the agreed bonuses are optional and voluntary for the borrower, not
being mandatory, so, if you wish, you can cancel and not
maintain the indicated health insurance or contract another of those mentioned in the annex to
bonus conditions.

On the effective date of 01/01/2017, the claimant signs the policy with CASER
group "Caser Salud Integral" in which he appears as policyholder and includes as
only insured to Ms. B.B.B., contracting made in the offices of IBERCAJA,
in its capacity as the distribution network of the banking insurance operator of the Ibercaja Group
(the entity IBERCAJA MEDIACION DE SEGUROS, S.A.U. (hereinafter IBERCAJA

MEDIATION) and that maintains an agency contract with CASER. insurance premiums
were debited from the IBERCAJA account owned by the claimant.
On 06/08/2021, IBERCAJA MEDIACION, in its capacity as mediator of the insurance policy
insurance and, therefore, in charge of processing the data responsibility of

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/16

CASER, processes a request formulated in the offices of IBERCAJA, in which
requests the modification of the account associated with said policy to proceed itself
to premium payments, since it is the only insured, and in turn, modify its
contractual position of insured by the policy holder and insured by the
same policy, not making any changes to the policy, limited to

transfer the request of the insured to the insurance company.
On 06/09/2021 CASER proceeds, with effect from June 8, to replace the
policyholder (claimant) for which until then was the insured of the
policy (Mrs. B.B.B.), presupposing by the principle of commercial good faith that
said substitution was known to the claimant, who would have granted his
consent, at least tacitly. The fact that by losing the condition of

policyholder, the claimant was released from the obligations and duties that
derived from the insurance contract, led to think that the policyholder knew and
accepted its substitution in the policy.
Following communications from the claimant to the Customer Relations Center of
CASER in which it stated that it had not accepted or consented to the change of policyholder

of the insurance, once it was verified that there was no document in the files
signed by the policyholder (claimant) requesting or authorizing said
change, dated 06/16/2021, the policy was reverted to the previous situation,
reinstating the claimant as the policy holder and, on June 17, it was returned to
include your account number for purposes of paying premium receipts.
As for the mortgage loan contract formalized by the claimant with

IBERCAJA, the changes made to the health insurance policy by the entity
insurer, object of this claim, did not modify the interest rate that came
being applied to it.

Likewise, the respondent in his response of 01/14/2022 stated, among other things,
aspects, the following:

legitimized by the content of article 6.1.b) of the RGPD that establishes that the

of July, of Management, Supervision and Solvency of the Insurance Entities and
Reinsurers, which empowers insurance companies to process the data of the
policyholders, without the need to obtain their consent, for the
development of the insurance contract; It must be taken into consideration that, as
As soon as Caser learned of the absence of consent granted by the

claimant rectified the policyholder change.
With regard to access to data that is the responsibility of Caser by Ibercaja Mediación,
this is legitimized by assuming this last society the condition of
in charge of the treatment in accordance with the provisions of article 203.1.a) of the
Royal Decree-Law 3/2020, as well as the fact that both parties have signed a

comprehensive contract of the obligations established in article 28 of the RGPD.

       In accordance with \[Insert the text corresponding to \[Basic text I

3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of the
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

       Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The
procedures processed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed

by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the
regulatory provisions issued in its development and, insofar as they are not
contradict, in the alternative, by the general rules on the
administrative procedures."

                                           II
       The facts denounced materialize in the fact that the defendant carried out
various changes in the data of the health policy, linked to the loan
contracted with a financial institution, without their consent, specifically, the
policyholder and the premium charge account, appearing in his place his ex-partner both
as a policyholder and as your personal account; it was later re-modified to include

the claimant as policyholder, although the charge account continued to be that of his former partner
and, finally, after the claims made by the claimant, the
charge account, becoming the claimant's account, which could lead to the
Violation of the regulations on the protection of personal data.

       Article 58 of the RGPD, Powers, states:

       "two. Each supervisory authority will have all of the following powers
corrections listed below:

       (…)
       i) impose an administrative fine under article 83, in addition to or in

       Instead of the measures mentioned in this section, according to the
       circumstances of each particular case;
       (…)”

       Article 6, Legality of the treatment, of the RGPD in its section 1, establishes
that:

       1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
conditions:

       a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data

       personal for one or more specific purposes;
       b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
       interested party is a party or for the application at the request of the latter of measures
       pre-contractual;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/16

       c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation
       applicable to the data controller;
       d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or
       of another natural person;
       e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in

       public interest or in the exercise of public powers vested in the controller
       of the treatment;
       f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests
       pursued by the data controller or by a third party, provided that
       over said interests do not prevail the interests or the rights and freedoms
       fundamental data of the interested party that require the protection of personal data,

       in particular when the interested party is a child.

       The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to
treatment carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions”.

       On the other hand, article 4 of the RGPD, Definitions, in its sections 1, 2 and 11,
notes that:

       “1) «personal data»: any information about an identified natural person
or identifiable ("the interested party"); An identifiable natural person shall be considered any
person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular

by means of an identifier, such as a name, an identification number,
location data, an online identifier or one or more elements of the
physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of said
person;

       “2) «processing»: any operation or set of operations carried out

about personal data or sets of personal data, either by procedures
automated or not, such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring,
conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use,
communication by transmission, broadcast or any other form of enabling of
access, collation or interconnection, limitation, suppression or destruction;

       “11) «consent of the interested party»: any manifestation of free will,
specific, informed and unequivocal by which the interested party accepts, either through
a statement or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that
concern him”.

                                            III

       Data processing requires the existence of a legal basis that legitimizes it,
as the consent of the interested party for the processing of personal data
for one or more specific purposes.

       In accordance with article 6.1 of the RGPD, in addition to the consent,

There are other possible bases that legitimize the processing of data without the need for
have the authorization of its owner, in particular, when it is necessary for the
execution of a contract in which the affected party is a party or for the application, at the request
of this, of pre-contractual measures, or when necessary for the satisfaction of
legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by a third party,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/16

provided that said interests do not prevail the interests or rights and
fundamental freedoms of the affected party that require the protection of such data. The
treatment is also considered lawful when it is necessary for the fulfillment of

a legal obligation applicable to the controller, to protect interests
vital data of the affected party or of another natural person or for the fulfillment of a mission
carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of public powers vested in the
responsible for the treatment.

       In the present case, the defendant is charged with the violation of article 6.1 of the

RGPD when evidencing the illegality of the treatment carried out, because as
pointed out in the previous foundation, it allows various modifications in the data of
the health policy, linked to the mortgage loan contracted with a financial entity,
without your consent or authorization without your consent or authorization or any
another cause of legitimation of those provided for in art. 6.1 of the GDPR.

       .

       The infraction that is attributed to the claimed one is typified in the

Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to the

       And in its article 72, it considers for prescription purposes, which are: "Infringements
considered very serious:

       1. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)

2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that

       (…)”

                                           v
       In order to establish the administrative fine to be imposed,
observe the provisions contained in articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, which

point out:

       "1. Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines

Regulation indicated in sections 4, 5 and 6 are in each individual case

effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

       2. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances
of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated
in article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine

       a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
       nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
       as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and
       damages they have suffered;

       b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;
       c) any measure taken by the controller or processor
       to alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties;
       d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge or of the person in charge of the
       treatment, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have

       applied under articles 25 and 32;
       e) any previous infraction committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
       treatment;
       f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put

       g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

       h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in
       particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such case,
       what extent;
       i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
       previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge in question

       in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;
       j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or mechanisms
       certificates approved in accordance with article 42, and
       k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
       case, such as financial benefits realized or losses avoided, direct

       or indirectly, through infringement.

       In relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, in its
Article 76, “Sanctions and corrective measures”, establishes that:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/16

       "two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 may also be taken into account:

       a) The continuing nature of the offence.

       b) The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of treatments
       of personal data.
       c) The profits obtained as a result of committing the offence.
       d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have induced the
       commission of the offence.
       e) The existence of a merger by absorption process after the commission

       of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.
       f) Affectation of the rights of minors.
       g) Have, when it is not mandatory, a delegate for the protection of

       h) The submission by the person in charge or person in charge, with

       voluntary, to alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those
       assumptions in which there are controversies between those and any
       interested."

       In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the sanction of fine to

impose in the present case for the infringement typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD
for which the defendant is held responsible, in an initial assessment, it is estimated
concurrent the following factors:

       Aggravating circumstances are considered:

       - The nature, seriousness and duration of the infraction: the facts affect
seriously to a basic principle relating to the processing of personal data
personal, such as legitimacy, whose violation is considered very serious; the damages
and damages caused as a result of the interference in the sphere of privacy
of the claimant because we must not forget that we are facing the infraction of a
fundamental right to the protection of personal data; the claimant was seen

obliged to address both the financial institution and the claimed entity as
consequence of the modifications produced in the policy, as well as the presentation
d claim before the DGSFP and before this body for the same facts (article
83.2, a) of the GDPR). .

       - The activity of the claimed party is linked to data processing

both clients and third parties. In its activity the claimed entity is
The processing of personal data is essential, therefore, given the volume
of business of the same (one of the important insurance entities of the country), the
significance of the conduct object of this claim is undeniable
(article 76.2.b) of the LOPDGDD in relation to article 83.2.k).

       - Although it cannot be argued that the defendant has acted
intentionally, there is no doubt that there is a serious lack of diligence in
his performance. Connected to the degree of diligence that the data controller
is obliged to deploy in the fulfillment of the obligations imposed by the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/16

data protection regulations, the SAN of 10/17/2007 can be cited. Although it was
dictated before the validity of the RGPD, its pronouncement is perfectly
extrapolated to the case we are analyzing. The ruling, after alluding to the fact that the

entities in which the development of their activity entails a continuous treatment of
customer data and third parties must observe an adequate level of diligence,
specified that “(...) the Supreme Court has understood that there is imprudence
whenever a legal duty of care is disregarded, that is, when the offender fails to
behaves with due diligence. And in assessing the degree of diligence,
especially weigh the professionalism or not of the subject, and there is no doubt that,

in the case now examined, when the appellant's activity is constant and
abundant handling of personal data, it must be insisted on the rigor and
exquisite care to comply with the legal provisions in this regard” (article 83.2,
b) of the RGPD).

       Extenuating circumstances are considered:

       - Only one person has been affected by the offending conduct.

       Therefore, as stated,

       By the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
