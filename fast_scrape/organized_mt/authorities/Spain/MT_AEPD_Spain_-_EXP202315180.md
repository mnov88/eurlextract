## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is a school named "COLEGIO VIRGEN DE EUROPA, S.L."; the data subject is a parent of an underage student of this school.

On 29 June 2022, the data subject's parents learned from law enforcement that a pedestrian found a camera in a backpack on the street, which contained footage of their underage daughter. Law enforcement also found footage of the data subject in the house of a teacher from the school. Several of the pictures depicted the data subject's daughter in swimwear.

On 27 September, the data subject filed a complaint with the DPA. According to the complaint, the pictures were taken without the awareness or consent of the data subject and with no regard for basic file custody protocols. Furthermore, the controller had violated the principle of transparency by taking pictures without informing the affected parties; this prevented them from exercising their rights regarding their personal data.

During its investigations, the DPA asked the school and the teachers whether they can photograph students during school and when teachers may do so. The controller responded to the DPA's requests on 27 February 2024 by supplying their consent form, which was incorporated in the enrollment form and collected annually. The form stated that the purpose of taking photos and/or audiovisual recordings was for promotional reasons (e.g. including them in the school's website, social media or yearbooks), and for archiving purposes. The form, however, did not include further information such as the retention period of the footage, or the possibility of withdrawing consent.

The controller claimed that educational centres can take pictures of students during school activities with an educational function and that consent is lawfully obtained in the remaining activities. Teachers were allowed to take pictures of students in the context of the subjects and programs assigned to them; the recording of images did not grant them unlimited access, and the school specified that it is the controller for these situations.

An activity log outlined the processing purposes and implemented measures for advertising and social media, although they did not include technical or security details, or mention the processing of classroom images. The controller also reported that staff had received data protection training. Furthermore, one of the functions of the teacher involved was to carry out the promotion of the school. The general data protection policy signed by the teacher mentions their duty of confidentiality and their role as a party involved in data processing, however, it does not expressly mention the processing of students' images.

Furthermore, the controller submitted an authorisation form indicating that the teacher had permission to move devices with student recordings outside the school, which did not indicate an expiration date. Nonetheless, they alleged no authorization had been given to the teacher to remove physical media or devices from school premises. Finally, the teacher claimed it could take pictures of students within their teaching programme, whilst ensuring recordings were only be accessible to the teacher, the students, and parents concerned.

### Holding

The DPA found a breach of integrity and confidentiality under [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") since the controller failed to adopt technical and organisational measures in personal data processing. There was a data breach to the extent that at least one unauthorised third party accessed the images of minors. Additionally, the data controller could not demonstrate proactive training on processing personal data since the controller only implemented these classes after this incident was reported. The authorisation form did not establish the purpose for which a teacher is authorized to take a device, nor did it impose a time limit. The controller also failed to implement a system registering the entry and exit of recording devices from the school. Therefore, the controller did not demonstrate proactive responsibility mandated by [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR") since they did not have security measures in place to maintain control over the personal data of affected minors.

Furthermore, he DPA found no legal basis under [Article 6(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") because the controller could not demonstrate that the data subject's parents had consented to the processing in the enrollment document of that academic year; the controller provided the signed consent forms for several academic years, but not for the relevant academic year (or the six academic years preceding the case). The DPA stated that the controller had a responsibility to demonstrate that its actions complied with the GDPR, in accordance with the principle of proactive accountability in [Article 24 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR "Article 24 GDPR").

Finally, the DPA found a violation of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") since no communications to the data subject referred to obtaining images through audiovisual recordings. The text did not mention data retention periods, the possibility of withdrawing consent at any time, the possibility of filing a complaint with a supervisory authority, or the recipients of processing.

As corrective measures, the DPA ordered the controller to: (1) Prove the effective implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures per [Article 5(1)GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"), aimed at preventing, mitigating, and preventing possible unauthorized third-party access to students' personal data. (2) To stop processing related to the recording of audiovisual images of minors without any of the legal grounds required by [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). (3) Prove communications to data subjects contain the information required by [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

The DPA considered the violations serious in its calculation of administrative sanctions; the violations were ongoing for a long time, affected numerous underage data subjects, and related to images.

The fine was initially set at €40,000 but pursuant to law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the DPA informed the controller that it may make a voluntary payment of the proposed fine and waive their right to appeal. This action reduced the imposed fine by 20%. The fine can be reduced by a further 20% if the controller acknowledges its liability. The controller opted for both and reduced the fine by 40%, paying the reduced sanction amount of €24,000.

File No.: EXP202315180
AGREEMENT TO INITIATE SANCTIONING PROCEDURE
Regarding the actions taken by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following
FACTS
FIRST: On September 27, 2023, a complaint was filed with the Spanish Data Protection Agency for a possible violation attributable to COLEGIO VIRGEN DE EUROPA, S.L. with NIF B28773794 (hereinafter, the SCHOOL).
The complainant indicates that on June 29, 2022, he learned, through the Civil Guard, that his minor daughter had been recorded “(…)”. According to the complaint, some of the files in the possession of the Civil Guard were found on a road, in a camera that was found by a passerby and handed over to the Civil Guard, and some were found at the personal residence of A.A.A. (hereinafter, A.A.A.), a teacher at the school. Therefore, the principle of integrity and confidentiality in the processing of this data was violated. As of the date of the complaint, a judicial proceeding was being conducted for these events, with preliminary proceedings number \*\*\*PROCEEDINGS.1, before the Court of First Instance \*\*\*COURT.1.
According to the complaint, the images were captured without the knowledge or consent of the parents and without observing the most basic protocol for the safekeeping of the files. The court also considers that the principle of transparency in processing has been violated because the images were captured without prior notice to the affected parties, and due to this lack of knowledge, the court has also been unable to exercise its rights regarding personal data.

Regarding the information on the processing of personal data provided to parents and teachers, several documents are attached (Annexes I, II, and III) and reference is made to additional information on the website:
"(...) As we have previously indicated, the information provided to the parents and guardians of minors complies with the provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR. In this regard, any communication made or data collected, the School provides, through a clause, the minimum information it must provide.
Likewise, the School, in relation to the duty to provide information (...) takes into consideration the following issues:

o Firstly, the obligation to inform the interested parties
about the circumstances relating to the processing of their data falls on
the School, as the data controller.
o The information must be provided available to interested parties at the time the data is requested, prior to collection or registration, if the data is obtained directly from the interested party.

for this reason, in the various communications, recurring contacts, data collection, among other actions carried out, we reiterate the minimum information
regulated by the legislator."
After reviewing the attached documents provided, it is noted that:--
Annex I corresponds to a generic "Student Registration and Place Reservation" form that includes a section titled "Photo and Video Authorization" that provides two options, as previously explained.
The alleged Classroom information document refers to an uncomplemented consent request template for the creation and management of a "Google Workspace For Education Plus" user account "with the School's domain and for exclusively educational purposes."
Regarding Annex III, a text is included, taken out of context, stating:
"Both this message and any documents attached to it
are confidential and are addressed to the recipients. Please,
if you are not one of the recipients, notify us of this fact and delete the
message. (…) You may freely exercise your rights of access, objection,
rectification, cancellation or deletion, revocation of consent,
portability, and restriction of data processing by contacting Colegio
Virgen de Europa S.L. (…)"Regarding the purpose of the recordings and reasons for their retention, it provides a report entitled "DATA PROTECTION REGULATIONS COMPLIANCE REPORT," which it states is its current management procedure. The document is undated and states, in summary:
"This report is related to the processing of personal data by the Data Controller, Colegio Virgen de Europa S.L., in relation to image data, both for teaching purposes and for the promotion of the school's activities. In this regard, this document provides basic instructions and recommendations on the aforementioned data processing.
(...)
Regarding the issue of capturing images during school activities, the following scenarios must be taken into account:
A) The taking of images as part of the educational function, in which case, the schools are authorized to do so.
C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid
www.aepd.es
sedaepd.gob.es
6/41
B) Recordings that do not respond to the educational function, for example, the dissemination of information about the school and its activities, for which the consent of the school's representatives must be obtained. interested parties or their parents or guardians.
Likewise, images of students may be taken at certain events held in the school environment for the sole purpose of providing parents with access to them. This access to the images should always be carried out in a secure environment.
A)
School events or events at the school:

In this sense, on the occasion of school events or events at schools where students and teachers are the protagonists, both parents and the school itself take photographs and record videos that capture their images. These events, common at school events, raise many questions about who and how the images can be captured, what requirements must be met, for what purpose, and to whom they can be communicated.
Depending on who will be recording the images and the purpose for which they are being recorded, certain requirements must be observed.
If the images are recorded by the school for educational purposes, such as school assignments or assessments, The school or the educational administration would be entitled to such processing without the need for the consent of the students or their parents or guardians.
When the recording of images does not correspond to this educational function, but rather involves images of events or happenings that are routinely recorded for dissemination in the school magazine or on the school's website, the consent of the data subjects will be required. They must be informed in advance of the purpose of the recording, especially whether the images will be accessible indiscriminately or limitedly to the school community.
(…)
A)
Recording of images of activities carried out outside the school:
The recording of images outside school grounds by schools requires the consent of the data subjects, or their parents or guardians, provided that it is not carried out in the exercise of educational functions. If the recording is made by third parties, for example, by the managers of the company, museum, exhibition, or sports club being visited, or where a sports activity is taking place, these third parties will be obligated to do so. Obtain the consent of the interested parties, which may have been collected through the center.

28001 – Madrid
www.aepd.es
sedeaepd.gob.es
7/41
B)
Publication of data on social networks.
The publication of personal data on social networks by educational centers
requires the consent of the interested parties, who must be clearly informed in advance of the data to be
published, on which social networks, for what purpose, who can access the data, as well as the possibility of exercising their rights of access, rectification, objection, and deletion. Consent will be understood as a
manifestation of free, specific, informed, and unequivocal will, through a
declaration or clear affirmative action. The regulations include the obligation to inform about the period during which the images will be retained or, if not possible, the criteria for determining it.
III. ESSENTIAL ISSUES RELATING TO THE PROCESSING OF DATA IMAGE.
Below, we provide answers to questions resolved by the supervisory authority, the Spanish Data Protection Agency, in its guide for Educational Centers.
(…)
Can educational centers capture images of students during school activities?
A distinction should be made between taking images as part of an educational function, in which case schools would be authorized to do so, and recordings that do not fulfill that function, for example, disseminating information about the school and its activities, for which the consent of the interested parties or their parents or guardians must be obtained. It would also be possible to take images of students at certain events held within the school environment for the sole purpose of allowing parents to access them.
This access to images should always be carried out in a secure environment that requires prior identification and authentication of students, parents, or guardians (for example, in a restricted area of the school's intranet), and should be limited to images corresponding to events in which the specific student had participated. In any case, it would be necessary to remind those who access the images that they cannot, in turn, publicly disseminate them. Can a teacher record images of students for a school activity?
Teachers, in the development of programming and teaching of the areas, subjects, and modules assigned to them, may arrange for exercises that involve recording images, usually of the students themselves, which should only be accessible to the students involved in said activity, their parents or guardians, and the corresponding teacher.

That is, in no case does the mere fact of making the recording mean that it can be openly disseminated on the internet and accessed indiscriminately. In these cases, the data controller is the school itself or the educational administration (…)”
The SCHOOL states that an exhaustive review was conducted and that They documented and
transferred instructions to the person in charge at the center of managing the
images used through social media or the corporate website, providing as
evidence an email address that appears as Annex VI to the document. The document is
dated 09/12/2022. Much of the content is not visible because the document is
anonymized, and the recipient, context, or purpose for which it was sent, nor
the means of sending or proof of receipt are indicated. In the non-anonymized section, the following can be read:
"Additionally, and consistently, the school has been reminded of the criteria that images published on social media and the website must maintain, such as: - Images depicting group activities at the school and that convey the educational project, but never children in the foreground without the activity being carried out. - Images of properly dressed children that respect the dignity of the minor. - A limited number of images per publication (never more than 15). - Good quality images that convey the corporate image of the institution.
Regarding the technical and organizational measures for the safekeeping of images of minors in the school, the SCHOOL indicates, in summary, that clauses and documents have been prepared regarding the obligations of its staff for their signature, specifically:
"- Informative clauses prepared for the various documents that are used for the entity's regular activities. - Procedure implemented for the exercise of rights by owners. - Procedure for security breaches or incidents. - Similarly, the Data Protection Officer was appointed and notified to this supervisory authority within the legally established timeframe.
Likewise, despite the above, our priority is the protection of minors. Therefore, the instructions given to the persons in charge of taking photographs and subsequently sending them are to ensure that the orientation of the images is as non-identifiable as possible, prioritizing back shots, images from a distance, etc. Furthermore, the data is captured using devices owned by the School, which have the following technical measures: password access and restriction of use by unauthorized users. C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid
www.aepd.es
sedeaepd.gob.es
9/41
Regarding the storage of the aforementioned images, they are stored
through a server (...) connected to the network, which only allows access with
usernames and passwords to the profiles enabled for this purpose.
Furthermore, we must emphasize the fact that, on all occasions, when
we encounter a student whose parent or guardian has not given
consent for the capture and sending of these images, this fact is taken into account from the beginning, choosing to take advantage of moments
when the minor is not with the group to take the images.
Regarding the communication to parents and guardians of minors about the limitations on the use of images, it should be noted that, in our policy and management processes, we contemplate this constant communication to guardians, so that they are aware of the limits on the use of these images and, in addition, the potential responsibilities in the event of misuse of them. Despite the above, given that continuous improvement and progress in risk management is essential, a mandatory formal communication has been established for each transmission. 
(…)
Regarding other measures adopted, the following actions have been carried out: - Firstly, being aware that an effective adaptation and compliance process entails the necessary awareness of users involved in data processing, during the year 2022, a face-to-face training session was held with all of the entity's staff to promote a culture of data protection. - In addition to the above, to make this training more effective, on October 31, 2022, 9 training activities were initiated. The activities were called "New European Data Protection Regulation," lasting 30 hours and carried out by a total of 9 employees. In this case, we provide the employees' certificates, certifying the above (Annex VII). Regarding the impact of the training provided, we attach it (Annex VIII).
Similarly, the training plan on this matter, planned by the entity,
includes training for all users involved in the processing of data, which is ongoing and constantly updated, to promote a culture of data protection. Furthermore, as previously indicated, clear, written instructions have been issued regarding the minimum requirements for users involved in the capture and dissemination of images, including: the need for prior verification of consent, the minimum information to be provided if required, image orientation (no close-ups, distant images, etc.), among others.

In response to the AEPD's request for information regarding the reasons that led to the recordings leaving the center, the SCHOOL states:
"(...) the entity responsible for the processing does not understand the information requested regarding the possible reasons that led to the recordings leaving the center, given that the entity has control over them." (...).
The SCHOOL also provides "the Activity Log document with the identified processing and the measures implemented for this purpose (Annex IX)." This document refers exclusively to the processing of "ADVERTISING AND SOCIAL NETWORKS" and general security measures. It classifies the security level of this processing as basic. The data controller, the data protection officer, the expected period for deleting the data, or a general description are not listed. of the security measures with which the data will be processed. There is no record of image processing for any other purpose (archives, newspaper archives, etc.).
Regarding the security measures taken by the center, the aforementioned Annex IX, which includes the security measures to be applied for basic and high-level processing, indicated by the entity acting as DPO and which should be implemented, such as, for example, "Preparation of an updated list of users and user profiles \[…\]", "Mechanisms must be established \[…\]", "The removal of media and documents containing personal data \[…\] outside the premises under the control of the Data Controller must be authorized by the Data Controller or duly authorized in the Registry of Processing Activities", "When transferring documentation, measures will be taken to prevent the theft, loss, or unauthorized access to the information during its transport", "Establish procedures for data recovery \[…\]", etc.
This document is part of the legal report prepared by the entity acting as DPO (Chapter 7 "Determination of the security measures to be applied after the initial data protection risk analysis"). The documentation sent by the SCHOOL does not indicate whether these measures have been implemented or not, nor the procedure or resources for their implementation.
In its letter of July 12, 2024, in response to a request from this Agency, A.A.A.
reports that since (...) it is no longer employed. Regarding the purpose of the recordings and their preservation, it indicates that
"The recordings made in the exercise of my work (...) were intended to comply with the teaching program, as well as to promote the school's activities.
The subject (...) was intended to teach students the following skills: - Learning to learn skills. - Linguistic communication skills. - Information processing and digital skills. - Personal autonomy and initiative. - Artistic and cultural skills.

documentation and information:
1. Copy of the signed enrollment document corresponding to B.B.B.'s daughter.
2. Copy of the complete Processing Activities Record.
3. Given that the document submitted to this Agency on February 27, 2024, states that the school "has control of the recordings" made at the school, it is required to explain the reasons that may have occurred for the images of the minors to have left the custody of the school and to have been found in a backpack on a road and at the home of Mr. A.A.A.
4. Copy of the authorization, if any, allowing Mr. A.A.A.
to remove recordings of the students from the school and store them at his home. In its response of July 12, 2024, the school provided documents entitled "Registration and Place Reservation" for the claimant's daughter, signed by both parents, corresponding to the 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2015/2016 academic years, as well as communications with the minor's mother regarding the management and changes to her file, dated June 20, 2023, stating that she "would need a transcript and transfer certificate (...)".
These registration and place reservation forms contain the following text for the authorization regarding images:

"Regardless of whether or not there is a legal obligation to conduct an Impact Assessment, and in application of the principle of Proactive Responsibility incumbent upon the Controller, the technical and organizational measures considered necessary to adopt have been determined, following the initial risk analysis, with the aim of eliminating or minimizing the risks involved in the Processing of Personal Data for the security of the information (integrity, confidentiality-privacy, and availability thereof)."
Regarding the removal of images from the school, the SCHOOL states the following:
"As we provide in Annex III, the school has maintained control of the recordings and data contained on the devices, with the appropriate limitation on the removal of devices under authorization granted to the person responsible for these procedures at the school, Mr. A.A.A.."
Thus, in addition to submitting the aforementioned Annex III, they state regarding the authorization to the teacher regarding the removal of devices from the school:
"In the authorization document, the school maintains control of the information and data contained on the devices, given that a record of their removal and return is required."
The aforementioned Annex III consists of an authorization document in favor of the teacher, dated April 30, 2018, signed by Mr. A.A.A. as an employee and by the COLLEGE, in which the following can be read:
"AUTHORIZATION FOR THE OUTPUT OF MEDIA AND REMOTE ACCESS TO
SERVERS
COLEGIO VIRGEN DE EUROPA S.L., authorizes Mr./Ms. A.A.A., with NIF (...) to
output media, both on computerized equipment (computers, external memory, etc.), and in paper format, from the entity's facilities."Such output of information on electronic or paper media, as well as its return, must be recorded.
This authorization shall be extended until expressly communicated otherwise." (The emphasis is from the AEPD).
Furthermore, on July 11, 2024, the AEPD sent the SCHOOL a new request for information, requesting information on the following aspects:
1. Teaching duties of the AEPD teacher. Accreditation of the school director or human resources department.
2. Document with the instructions provided by the school to teachers who have access to audiovisual media and recording media.
3. Basis of legitimacy for recording images of minors in swimsuits by AEPD.

4. Measures to review the school's proper use of media and media (custody, access, preservation).
5. Retention periods for audiovisual material recorded and preserved at the school.
In its response Of July 26, 2024, the SCHOOL, in relation to the duties of Professor A.A.A., for which accreditation was requested from the center director or the human resources department, merely reported the following:
"The teacher's duties were those of (...), in addition to promoting the center, under various projects developed throughout his employment."
Regarding the instructions provided by the SCHOOL to teachers regarding audiovisual media and recording media, they attach a "confidentiality agreement document," as well as a "legal report with the instructions provided regarding their responsibilities regarding the management of images of minors to the persons responsible for these functions and the internal procedure for managing the processing."
The attached confidentiality agreement document is entitled "GENERAL POLICY FOR THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA," dated April 30, 2018, and signed by Professor A.A.A. Among other matters, it mentions the duty of confidentiality as a SCHOOL employee regarding personal data to which they have access in the performance of their duties, as well as their obligations as a party involved in data processing. No express mention is made of the processing of student images.
The legal report indicated is the one already submitted in their response of February 27, 2024, with the title “DATA PROTECTION REGULATIONS COMPLIANCE REPORT.”
Regarding the legal basis for recording images of minors in swimsuits by teacher A.A.A., the SCHOOL states the following:
“The instructions given by the school for this purpose are in accordance with current regulations, indicating at all times the need to avoid close-ups and images that respect the minor's privacy, among others.”
Regarding the measures to review the proper use of the media and supports carried out by the school (custody, access, preservation), it states that
“As provided in the previous information request, the security measures implemented are contained in the Record of Processing Activities. As proof of the above, we provide the reference document (ANNEX II). In addition to the above, these proper use measures and instructions are detailed in the legal report and the consent management procedure.”
Finally, regarding the legitimate basis and retention periods for the audiovisual material recorded and stored at the center, it indicates the following:

Detailed information on this matter is provided in the Activity Registry document.
" Finally, it provides an undated document entitled "Internal Procedure for the Management of Audiovisual Recordings," which states the following:
"The purpose of this procedure is to provide information on the rules of conduct that any user of the COLEGIO VIRGEN DE EUROPA data processing system who, in their activities, collects authorizations for recording images of students, or who creates or uses them."
The document contains a description of a procedure for collecting and controlling authorizations on enrollment registration forms and "camp and activity registration forms for external students."
On July 29, 2024, the AEPD issued a new request for information within the framework of the preliminary investigation, requesting:

Procedure
Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures."
In accordance with Article 64 of the LOPDGDD, and taking into account the characteristics of the alleged violations committed, a sanctioning procedure is initiated.
The procedure will last a maximum of twelve months from the date of the initiation agreement. After this period, the procedure will be terminated. expiration and, consequently, the archiving of proceedings, in accordance with the provisions of Article 64 of the LOPDGDD.If no objections are made to this initial agreement within the stipulated period, it may be considered a proposed resolution, as established in Article 64.2.f) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP).

Preliminary Questions
Article 4.1) of the GDPR defines "personal data" as: "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("the data subject"); an identifiable natural person shall be considered to be any person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that person."
Thus, the image of a natural person is personal data. Article 4(2) of the GDPR defines “processing” as: “any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.”
Article 4(7) of the GDPR defines “controller” or “controller” as: “the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing; where the purposes and means of processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.” In turn, Article
C/ Jorge Juan, 6
28001 – Madrid
www.aepd.es
sedeaepd.gob.es
18/41
4.8) of the GDPR defines the "data processor" or "processor" as the
natural or legal person, public authority, service, or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the data controller.
In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 4.1 and 4.2 of the GDPR,
personal data processing is established, since the SCHOOL
carries out, among other processing operations, the taking of photographs and video recordings
of its students, as well as their storage and, where appropriate, their publication.
The SCHOOL carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller,
given that it is the party that determines the purposes and means of such activity, pursuant to Article
4.7 of the GDPR.
IV
Breached obligation. Integrity and Confidentiality
Article 5.1(f) of the GDPR states:
"1. Personal data shall be:
(…)
(f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, by applying appropriate technical or organizational measures ("integrity and confidentiality")."
In this regard, data controllers must guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of the personal data being processed through technical and organizational measures of all kinds. Compliance with this provision would therefore be verified by the adoption and implementation of technical and organizational measures of all kinds aimed at ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the personal data being processed and, on the other hand, by the absence of situations of loss of confidentiality or integrity of the personal data being processed. Its
non-compliance, on the contrary, would result from the absence of measures or
non-compliance with those adopted and a loss of confidentiality of the data being processed.
In short, pursuant to Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, the controller of any
personal data processing is obliged to guarantee adequate security
of the data through technical and organizational measures of all kinds, which includes
protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and, consequently, implies the
absence of leaks or breaches of confidentiality.
Recital 39 of the GDPR confirms this when it states: "Personal data
must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality
of the personal data, including to prevent unauthorized access to or use of
such data and of the equipment used in the processing."

For its part, Constitutional Court Judgment (STC) 292/2000, when analyzing the content of the fundamental right to the protection of personal data, states in its Legal Basis 7:
“\[…\] it follows that the content of the fundamental right to data protection consists of a power of disposition and control over personal data, which empowers the individual to decide which of those data to provide to a third party, be it the State or an individual, or which that third party may collect, and which also allows the individual to know who possesses that personal data and for what purpose, and to be able to oppose such possession or use. These powers of disposition and control over personal data, which constitute part of the content of the fundamental right to data protection, are legally expressed in the right to consent to the collection, obtaining, and accessing of personal data, its subsequent storage and processing, as well as its
possible use or uses, by a third party, whether the State or a private individual." (Emphasis added)
In the present case, the evidence in the file indicates that a personal data breach occurred, insofar as at least one unauthorized third party accessed images of minors, including those of the complainant, contained in an audiovisual recording device. Specifically, a device containing these images was lost and found inside a backpack by a pedestrian on a road, who, after viewing it and in view of its contents, went to the Civil Guard to hand it over. In this regard, it is noted that the SCHOOL, in response to the requests for information made by the AEPD regarding the reasons that led to the recordings being removed from the center and, specifically, the reasons that could have occurred for the images of the minors to have left the center's custody and to be found in a backpack on a road, has stated, in its responses of February 27 and July 12, 2024, that "the entity has control over them \[the recordings\]."
Furthermore, in its response of February 27, it lists a series of measures that it claims to have in place: training and awareness sessions for teachers on personal data, the existence of security measures in accordance with Articles 32 and 25 of the GDPR, as well as those set out in the RAT.
In relation to the above, it is emphasized that the training took place after the security breach became known and the Civil Guard investigation and judicial proceedings began. Therefore, it is not proven that the SCHOOL had these training measures in place at the time the events on which the claim is based occurred.
Furthermore, upon reviewing the RAT, it is noted that it states that "the removal of media and documents containing personal data, including those contained in and/or attached to an email, outside the premises under the control of the Data Controller must be authorized by the Data Controller or duly authorized in the Register of Processing Activities."
In its response of July 12, 2024, it insists that "the school has maintained control of the recordings and data contained on the devices, with the appropriate limitation on the removal of devices under authorization granted to the person responsible for these procedures at the school, Mr. A.A.A. (...) In the authorization document, the school maintains control of the information and data contained on the devices, since a record of their departure and return is required."
It is noted that the authorization referred to, which appears in the file, dates from 2018 and does not indicate the purpose or reasons for which the owner is authorized, nor does it establish a time limit on its effects (it is granted until further notice), nor does it specify the content of the documentation or its characteristics. Furthermore, although the authorization itself indicates that the exit and return of the devices must be recorded, the SCHOOL has been required to provide documentation
on the record of the exit and return of devices between (...), the SCHOOL, in contradiction to the above, asserts that "there is no authorization that has been granted for the exit and subsequent return to the teacher, that is, no authorization has been given to remove devices or media in these exercises." It is emphasized, however, that the authorization granted in 2018 established that it would remain in effect as long as it was not revoked. Consequently, the SCHOOL has not proven that it had a system for recording
the entry and exit of devices, as it claims, that would allow it to know at all times which devices had been removed from the school, their contents, the person who removed them, or their location. It should not be forgotten that the removal of devices containing audiovisual recordings with images of minors entails the removal of personal data from the center, so this event entailed a risk that required the adoption of measures by the responsible party regarding its safekeeping, possible loss, and use for unauthorized purposes. Therefore, it cannot be understood that an authorization granted without any limitations could be considered a measure that ensures the protection of personal data against loss and unauthorized processing, in the terms required by Article 5.1 f).
On the contrary, the authorization recorded in the file allowing the removal of
any device or document containing any type of data from the school for an unlimited period of time, without indicating the purpose or mentioning any security measures to be adopted, cannot be considered proof that the SCHOOL had security measures in place and maintained control over the personal data of the affected minors. On the contrary, it would demonstrate a lack of diligence in monitoring the students' images, as well as a lack of the measures required by Article 5.1 f), which facilitated the personal data breach resulting from a passerby (unauthorized third party) accessing the images. Finally, it should be noted that Article 5.2 of the GDPR establishes that the data controller is not only responsible for ensuring the provisions of Section 5.1 (among other principles, adequate security of personal data), but also "capable of demonstrating <<proactive responsibility>>."
Therefore, based on the evidence currently available, in accordance with the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, it is considered that the known facts could constitute an infraction, attributable to the BAR Association, for violation of Article 5.1 f) transcribed above.
V
Classification of the violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR and classification for the purposes of limitation

Article 83.5 of the GDPR classifies the violation of the following article as an administrative offense, which shall be punishable, in accordance with paragraph 2, by administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, by an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:
"a) the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9;"
For its part, the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on Personal Data Protection) in its Article 71, "Infractions" states that:
"The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute infringements."
For the sole purpose of the statute of limitations, Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD establishes the following:
"Based on the provisions of Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular, the following, are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:
b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions for the lawfulness of the processing established in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679."
VI
Proposed sanction for non-compliance with Article 5.1 f) of the GDPR.
In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:
"1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 9, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures referred to in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). When deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:

a) the nature, The seriousness and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered; b) the intentionality or negligence of the breach; c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects; d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32; e) any previous breaches committed by the controller or processor; f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate any adverse effects of the breach; g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach; h) how the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the breach and, if so, to what extent; i) when the measures (j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42; and (k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.” For its part, Article 76 "Sanctions and Corrective Measures" of the LOPDGDD
provides:
"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria established in section 2 of the aforementioned article.
2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account:

a) The continuous nature of the infringement.

b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.

c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the infringement.

d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the commission of the infringement.

e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the acquiring entity.
f) The violation of the rights of minors.

g) Having a data protection officer, when not mandatory.
h) The voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in those
cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.
In the present case, considering the seriousness of the potential violation, paying special attention to the consequences that its commission has on those affected, a fine would be imposed, in addition to the adoption of measures, if appropriate.
The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR. To guarantee
these principles, it is considered, as a preliminary matter, that the SCHOOL's turnover was €11,181,007 in 2023, according to the report
compiled from the AXESOR tool included in the file.
For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence currently available, in accordance with the decision to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following circumstances, contemplated in the aforementioned provisions.
As a preliminary matter, the following circumstances are deemed to be present:
The nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account
the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages and losses they have suffered (Article 83.2(a) of the GDPR). In the present case, the violation is considered serious. Firstly, because it affects several underage students, notwithstanding the fact that the procedure was initiated as a result of a single complaint. Thus, in the words of the Civil Guard, it is referred to as a "(...)". Secondly, because the events represent a loss of control over the personal data of those affected, this being one of the essential elements of the GDPR. Finally, it is emphasized that some of the images found showed, according to the Civil Guard report, scantily clad minors, which directly affects the dignity of these minors and makes some of the images considered particularly sensitive. Likewise, the following grading factors are considered aggravating factors:
The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data (Article 83.2 k) of the GDPR in conjunction with Article 76.2, letter b, of the LOPDGDD): the SCHOOL, as a result of its activity as a school, routinely and continuously processes the personal data of a large number of interested parties (mainly minors), which is essential for the development of its activity. The educational function, which is its main activity, necessarily involves processing personal data, for the registration of students or the evaluation of exams, among others. Thus,
the facts occurred within the framework of personal data processing that
the accused party routinely carries out in the exercise of its main activity
and is linked to it. - The violation of the rights of minors (Article 76.2, letter f) of the LOPDGDD),
taking into account that the object of the violation is related to the processing of images of minors.
The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of Article 5.1 f) of the GDPR, allows for the initial imposition of an administrative fine of €15,000.00.
VII
Breach of obligation. Article 6 of the GDPR. Lawfulness of Processing
The first paragraph of Article 6 of the GDPR states the following:
"1. Processing shall only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:
a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
d) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, provided that such interests are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data,
in particular when the data subject is a child.
The provisions of letter (f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions."
In accordance with Article 6.1 of the GDPR, in addition to consent, there are other possible grounds that legitimize data processing without the need for the data subject's authorization, in particular when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the implementation, at the request of the data subject, of pre-contractual measures, or when it is necessary for the pursuit of legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, provided that such interests are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of such data. Processing is also considered lawful when it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the controller, to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. Article 7 of the GDPR provides that: "1. Where processing is based on the data subject's consent, the controller must be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to the processing of his or her personal data. 2. Where the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also covers other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a form that is clearly distinguishable from other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form and using clear and plain language. No part of the declaration that constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall be binding." Regarding consent, Recital 32 of the GDPR establishes that: "Consent must be given by a clear affirmative act reflecting a freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous expression of the data subject's wishes to agree to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as a written declaration, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include checking a box on a website, choosing technical parameters for the use of information society services, or any other statement or conduct that clearly indicates in this context that the data subject accepts the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Therefore, silence, pre-checked boxes, or inaction should not constitute consent. Consent must be given for all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. Where processing serves multiple purposes, consent must be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic means, the request must be clear, concise, and not unnecessarily disrupt the use of the service." for which the data is provided.”
In turn, Article 4 of the GDPR, regarding definitions, establishes in section 11:
“11) “consent of the data subject” means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she agrees, whether by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, to the processing of personal data relating to him or her;”
Furthermore, Article 24 of the GDPR develops the principle of proactive accountability of the data controller, requiring that its actions not only comply with the GDPR but also be capable of demonstrating this: "Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data controller shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that the processing complies with this Regulation. These measures shall be reviewed and updated as necessary." In short, the processing of personal data requires a legal basis. The choice of the most appropriate processing basis, if there are several, is the responsibility of the data controller, just as it is their responsibility to prove that the processing is carried out in accordance with a legitimate basis.
In the present case, the SCHOOL, in its response to the AEPD (Spanish Data Protection Agency) of February 27, 2024, indicated consent as the legitimate basis for recording images of students. Thus, it determined: "with regard to the procedure for obtaining the express consent of the parents or legal guardians of minors regarding the processing of data derived from the recording, we must indicate that it is carried out at the time of the student's enrollment." For these purposes, she provided a blank document called "Registration and Place Reservation" containing the following text preceded by two blank boxes before the YES and NO: "YES, I authorize "Colegio Virgen de Europa S.L." to take photos and/or audiovisual recordings of my son/daughter during the activities planned by the school, for the sole purpose of including them on the school's website and/or yearbooks, brochures and/or various advertising materials, and their possible dissemination through any other means of communication of the school, including social media, for the sole purpose of publicizing and promoting the school's activities, as well as making said images part of the school's archive. These images will be processed by the school in accordance with current legislation on Personal Data Protection. However, this authorization may be revoked at any time. I DO NOT authorize the processing of said images."
In her letter of 29 In August 2024, the SCHOOL, in response to this Agency's request
to provide the express consent of the minor's parent for the
recording of her images, the SCHOOL states: "The legitimate basis for the
processing of images contained in the systems, inherent to the teaching function, is based on Article 6.1.e of the GDPR, given that the processing is
necessary for the fulfillment of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller, therefore consent would not be
necessary." In addition to the above, it insists, however, that
"for the management of images intended for the promotion of the center (...), consent was given for this purpose by the minor's guardian."
In short, the school insists that it had the consent of the minor's parents to undergo the treatment, this being the basis of legitimacy applicable to the case and that this consent is obtained during the enrollment process and is updated annually.
In this regard, it should be noted that the school has sent the documents entitled "Registration and Reservation of Place" for the affected minor, signed by both parents, corresponding to the 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2015/2016 academic years.

However, despite repeated requests from this Agency, the school has not accredited the enrollments, with the corresponding consents, for the 2014/2015 academic years; 2016/2017; 2018/2019; 2019/2020; 2020/2021,
2021/2022 or 2022/2023, which means that consent has not been demonstrated
by the data controller.
Ultimately, in this specific case, there is no legal basis that supports the processing of the minor's personal data by capturing images with recording equipment under the terms indicated above.
Therefore, based on the evidence currently available
regarding the agreement to initiate disciplinary proceedings, it is considered that the known facts
could constitute an infraction, attributable to the SCHOOL, for
violating Article 6 of the GDPR, as transcribed above.
VIII
Classification of the violation of Article 6.1 of the GDPR and classification for the purposes of limitation

Article 83.5 of the GDPR classifies the violation of the following article as an administrative offense, which shall be punishable, in accordance with paragraph 2, by administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, by an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:
"a) the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9;"
For its part, the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data) in its Article 71, Infractions, states that:
"The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute infringements."
For the sole purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD establishes the following:
"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, violations that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:
b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions for the lawfulness of processing established in Article 6 of
Regulation (EU) 2016/679."

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR, as well as Article 76.2 of the LOPDGDGG, reproduced above, must be observed.
In the present case, considering the seriousness of the potential violation, paying special attention to the consequences its commission has on those affected, a fine should be imposed, in addition to the adoption of measures, if appropriate.
The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR. To guarantee
these principles, it is considered, as a preliminary matter, that the SCHOOL's turnover was €11,181,007 in 2023, according to the report
compiled from the AXESOR tool included in the file.
For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence currently available, in accordance with the decision to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following circumstances, contemplated in the aforementioned provisions.
As a preliminary matter, the following circumstances are deemed to be present:
The nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account
the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages and losses they have suffered (Article 83.2(a) of the GDPR). In the present case, the violation is considered to be serious. The known facts directly impact the affected party's control over their personal data, and specifically, their image. 
Finally, it is noted that the failure to prove the existence of a legitimate basis for processing constitutes a violation of the principle of proactive accountability provided for in Article 5.2 of the GDPR, an essential principle of data protection regulations.
Likewise, the following grading factors are considered aggravating factors:
Any previous violation committed by the data controller or processor (Article 83.2, letter e) of the GDPR), since there is a previous sanction imposed on the SCHOOL by this Agency, with a resolution date of July 7, 2023, in file No. EXP202209078, for violation of Article 6.1 of the GDPR. The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data (Article 83.2 k) of the GDPR in conjunction with Article 76.2, letter b) of the LOPDGDD): the SCHOOL, as a result of its activity as a school, routinely and continuously processes the personal data of a large number of interested parties (mainly minors), which is essential for the development of its activity. The educational function, which is its main activity, necessarily involves personal data processing, for the registration of students or the evaluation of exams, among others. Thus, the events occur within the framework of personal data processing that the accused party routinely carries out in the exercise of its main activity and is linked to it. The violation of the rights of minors (Article 76.2, letter f) of the LOPDGDD), taking into account that the object of the violation is related to the processing of images of minors.
The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the violation committed by violating the provisions of Article 6.1 of the GDPR, allows for the initial imposition of an administrative fine of €20,000.

Breach of obligation. Violation of Article 13 of the GDPR
Article 13 of the GDPR states the following:
“Article 13. Information to be provided when personal data are collected from the data subject

1. Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from a data subject, the controller shall, at the time of collection, provide the data subject with all of the following information:

a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of its representative;

b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;

c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended and the legal basis for the processing;

d) where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party;

e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data,
where applicable;

f) where applicable, the intention of the controller to transfer personal data to a third country or international organization and the existence or absence of of a Commission adequacy decision, or, in the case of transfers referred to in Articles 46 or 47 or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), reference to the appropriate safeguards and the means of obtaining a copy of them or the fact that they have been provided. 2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time the personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with the following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing: a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or where that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to, and rectification or erasure of, personal data concerning the data subject, or restriction of their processing; object to processing, as well as the right to data portability;
c) where processing is based on Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent prior to its withdrawal;
d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
e) where the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, and where the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and is informed of the possible consequences of not providing such data;
f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4), and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.
3. Where the controller plans further processing of personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, shall, prior to such further processing, provide the data subject with information about that other purpose and any additional information relevant under paragraph 2.
4. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 shall not apply where and to the extent that the data subject already has the information.
This provision, in paragraphs 1 and 2, determines the information that the data controller must provide at the time of data collection. However, the provision of Article 13, paragraphs 1 and 2, must be read in conjunction with Article 13.4, which exempts the data subject from the obligation referred to in both provisions "where and to the extent that the data subject already has the information."
The recitals of the GDPR reiterate the same idea. Thus, Recital 61 states that "Data subjects must be provided with information about the processing of their personal data at the time it is obtained from them or, if obtained from another source, within a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances of the case (...)" And Recital 62 states that "However, it is not necessary to impose an obligation to provide information where the data subject already has the information, (...)"
In any case, it should be noted that, pursuant to Recital 60, the controller is obliged to "provide the data subject with all necessary additional information to ensure fair and transparent processing, taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed."

The data controller must provide the data subject with all necessary information to ensure fair and transparent processing, taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed. Recital 39 of the GDPR states that: “The principle of transparency requires that all information and communication relating to the processing of such data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that simple and clear language be used. This principle refers in particular to information provided to data subjects about the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing, as well as to additional information to ensure fair and transparent processing with regard to the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of the personal data concerning them that are being processed. Natural persons must be aware of the risks, rules, safeguards, and rights relating to the processing of personal data, as well as how to assert their rights in relation to the processing. In particular, the specific purposes for the processing of personal data must be explicit and legitimate, and must be determined at the time of collection (…).” Therefore, data subjects must be provided with information about the processing of their personal data at the time it is obtained from them. When personal data relating to the data subject is obtained, the data controller, at the time it is obtained, must provide the data subject with all information about the processing of his or her data, as indicated in Article 13 of the GDPR.
Furthermore, it is worth highlighting that the obligation to inform contained in Article 13 of the GDPR must be understood within the framework of the rights of data subjects in relation to transparency, a principle that must govern data processing in accordance with Article 5.1 a) of the GDPR. In this regard, Article 12.1 of the GDPR establishes that:
"The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide the data subject with all the information indicated in Articles 13 and 14 (...) in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible manner, using clear and simple language (...)".
In this regard, it is essential to refer to Recital 39 of the GDPR, which states that: “(39) All processing of personal data must be lawful and fair. It must be absolutely clear to natural persons that personal data concerning them are being collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed, and the extent to which such data are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that all information and communication relating to the processing of such data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that simple and clear language be used. This principle refers in particular to information to data subjects about the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing, and to additional information to ensure fair and transparent processing with respect to the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of the personal data concerning them that are the subject of processing. Processing.
Natural persons must be aware of the risks, rules, safeguards, and rights relating to the processing of personal data, as well as how to assert their rights in relation to the processing. In particular, the specific purposes for processing personal data must be explicit and legitimate and must be determined at the time of collection.
Personal data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that their retention period is limited to a strict minimum.
Personal data should only be processed if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be achieved by other means. To ensure that personal data are not retained longer than necessary, the controller must establish deadlines for their deletion or periodic review.
All reasonable measures must be taken to ensure that inaccurate personal data are rectified or erased. Personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate data security and confidentiality. personal data, including to prevent unauthorized access to or use of said data and the equipment used in the processing."
In the present case, according to the response provided by the SCHOOL on February 27, 2024, the duty of information provided in Article 13 of the GDPR is fulfilled by the information contained in the registration, as well as by the information provided regarding Classroom, the various communications made via email, and the content on the school's corporate website. 
However, as noted in the factual background, neither the notice regarding Classroom nor the alleged information provided at the bottom of the emails refers to obtaining images of natural persons through audiovisual recordings. Regarding the information contained in the student registration form, the updated model includes the following, as already noted:
“□ YES I authorize "Colegio Virgen de Europa S.L." to take photos and/or audiovisual recordings of my child during the activities it has scheduled, for the sole purpose of including them on the school's website and/or yearbooks, brochures, and/or various advertising materials, and their possible dissemination through any other means of communication of the school, including social media, for the sole purpose of publicizing and promoting the school's activities, as well as making said images part of the school's archives. 
These images will be processed by the school in accordance with current legislation on Personal Data Protection. However, this authorization may be revoked at any time.
□ I DO NOT authorize the processing of said images.
You may exercise your rights free of charge. access, rectification, cancellation, objection, portability, and restriction of processing, by writing to "Colegio Virgen de Europa S.L.", C/ \*\*\*ADDRESS.1, or by email to (...).”

The registration forms for the affected minor read as follows:
“I authorize “Colegio Virgen de Europa S.L.” to take photos of my child
in the Center's facilities and on field trips and activities
planned by the Center, for the sole purpose of including them on the Center's website and/or yearbooks, brochures, and/or various advertising materials.
These images will be processed by the Center in accordance with current legislation
regarding the protection of personal data. However, authorization may be revoked at any time. To exercise the rights of
access, challenge, rectification, erasure, or objection to your data,
you must contact "Colegio Virgen de Europa S.L.", C/ \*\*\*ADDRESS.1,
in writing.
If you do not authorize the processing of these images for the purposes described above, please mark with a cross.
□ I DO NOT authorize the processing of these images."
Neither text mentions the data retention period or the criteria for determining said period, or the possibility of withdrawing consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent prior to withdrawal. The absence of a retention period is especially relevant in the present case, considering that the images would have been stored for an extended period. There is also no reference to the possibility of filing a complaint with a supervisory authority or the recipients of the processing. Therefore, based on the evidence currently available regarding the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, it is considered that the known facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to COLEGIO, for violating Article 13 of the GDPR, as transcribed above. XI
Classification of the violation of Article 13 of the GDPR and classification for the purposes of limitation
Article 83.5 of the GDPR classifies the violation of the following article as an administrative offense, which shall be punishable, in accordance with paragraph 2, by administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of an undertaking, by an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:
"b) the rights of data subjects pursuant to Articles 12 to 22;"
For its part, the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data) in its Article 71, Infractions, states that:
"The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute infringements."

For the sole purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on Personal Data Protection) establishes the following:
"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:

XII
Proposed sanction for non-compliance with Article 13 of the GDPR.
In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR and Article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, as reproduced above, must be observed.
In the present case, considering the seriousness of the potential violation, especially considering the consequences its commission has on those affected, a fine should be imposed, in addition to the adoption of measures, if applicable.
The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR. To guarantee these principles, the following is considered: the SCHOOL's turnover was €11,181,007 in 2023, according to the report collected from the AXESOR tool included in the file. For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence currently available in the decision to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following circumstances, contemplated in the aforementioned provisions. Prior to this, the following circumstances are deemed to be present: The nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages and losses they have suffered (Article 83.2(a) of the GDPR). In the present case, the violation is considered to be serious, taking into account the high number of those affected, even though this sanctioning procedure is initiated by a single complaint. Likewise, the absence of information, incomplete information, or erroneous information prevents the ultimate objective of the GDPR from being achieved: that the data subject has sufficient information to object or deny consent to processing.

Furthermore, the duration of the infringement is emphasized, existing at least since 2012, according to one of the registration forms provided to the AEPD.
Furthermore, the following grading factors are considered aggravating factors:
The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data (Article 83.2 k) of the GDPR in conjunction with Article 76.2, letter b) of the LOPDGDD): the SCHOOL, as a result of its activity as a school, routinely and continuously processes the personal data of a large number of data subjects (mainly minors), which is essential for the development of its activity.

The violation of the rights of minors (Article 76.2, letter f) of the LOPDGDD), taking into account that the object of the violation is related to the processing of images of minors.
The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the violation committed by violating the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR, allows for the initial imposition of an administrative fine of €5,000.00. XIII
Corrective Measures
If the violation is confirmed, the resolution issued may establish the corrective measures that the offending entity must adopt to put an end to the breaches of personal data protection legislation, in this case, Articles 5.1 f), 6.1, and 30 of the GDPR, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 58.2.d) of the GDPR, according to which each supervisory authority may "order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period..."
Thus, the responsible entity may be required to bring its actions into compliance with personal data protection regulations, within the scope expressed in the previous Legal Basis.
This document establishes the alleged violation committed and the facts that could give rise to this potential breach of data protection regulations. From this, it is clear what measures to be adopted, without prejudice to the sanctioned party's responsibility to implement the specific procedures, mechanisms, or instruments. The data controller is the one who fully understands their organization and must decide, based on proactive responsibility and a risk-based approach, how to comply with the GDPR and the LOPDGDD. However, in this case, regardless of the foregoing, in accordance with the evidence currently available regarding the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, the resolution adopted may require the SCHOOL to adopt the following measures within three months from the date of execution of the resolution finalizing this procedure:--
Prove the effective implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with Article 5.1 f) of the GDPR, aimed at preventing, mitigating, and preventing possible unauthorized third-party access to students' personal data.
Cessation of processing related to the recording of audiovisual images of minors without any of the legal grounds required by Article 6 of the GDPR.
Prove the availability of the information required by Article 13 of the GDPR to the interested parties.
The imposition of these measures is compatible with the sanction of an administrative fine, as provided in Article 83.2 of the GDPR.
Please note that failure to comply with the possible order to adopt measures imposed by this body in the resolution of this sanctioning procedure may be considered an administrative infraction pursuant to the provisions of the GDPR, classified as an infraction in Articles 83.5 and 83.6 thereof, and such conduct may lead to the opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.
Please also remember that neither the acknowledgment of the infraction committed nor, where applicable, the voluntary payment of the proposed amounts exempts you from the obligation to adopt the relevant measures to cease the conduct or correct the effects of the infraction committed, nor from the obligation to prove compliance with this obligation to this AEPD. Therefore, in light of the above, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
IT IS AGREED:

LEGAL BASIS
I
Jurisdiction
In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR) and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure. Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures." II
Termination of the Procedure
Article 85 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), under the heading "Termination of Sanctioning Procedures" provides the following:
"1. Once a sanctioning procedure has been initiated, if the offender acknowledges responsibility, the procedure may be terminated with the imposition of the appropriate sanction.
2. When the sanction is solely pecuniary or a pecuniary sanction and a non-pecuniary sanction may be imposed, but the inadmissibility of the second sanction has been justified, voluntary payment by the alleged offender, at any time prior to the resolution, will entail the termination of the procedure, except with regard to restoring the altered situation or determining compensation for damages caused by the commission of the violation.
3. In both cases, when the If the sanction is solely monetary in nature, the competent body resolving the procedure will apply reductions of at least 20% on the amount of the proposed sanction, which may be cumulative. These reductions must be determined in the notification of initiation of the procedure, and their effectiveness will be conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the sanction.

The percentage reduction provided for in this section may be increased by regulation."
III
Voluntary payment and acknowledgment of liability
In accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 85 of the LPACAP, the notified initiation agreement provided for the possibility of acknowledging liability and voluntarily paying the proposed sanction, which would entail two cumulative reductions of 20% each. With the application of these two reductions, the penalty would be set at €24,000.00, and its payment would imply the termination of the procedure, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding measures. Following notification of the aforementioned initiation agreement, the BAR Association has proceeded to acknowledge liability and voluntarily pay the penalty, availing itself of the two planned reductions. In accordance with Section 3 of Article 85 of the LPACAP, the effectiveness of the aforementioned reductions will be conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the penalty. It should be noted that, in accordance with the provisions of the LPACAP, as well as the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on this matter, the exercise of voluntary payment by the alleged responsible party does not exempt the administration from the obligation to resolve and notify all proceedings, regardless of their form of initiation. Likewise, Article 88 of the aforementioned law establishes that the resolution
concluding the procedure will decide all issues raised by the interested parties and any other issues arising therefrom.
Therefore, in accordance with applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for graduating sanctions, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
FIRST: TO DECLARE the commission of the violations and CONFIRM the sanctions
determined in the operative section of the initiation agreement transcribed in this
resolution.
The sum of the aforementioned amounts results in a total of €40,000.00.
After COLEGIO VIRGEN DE EUROPA, S.L. has made prompt payment and
acknowledged liability, pursuant to Article 85 of the LPACAP,
the aforementioned total is reduced by 40%, resulting in a final amount of €24,000.00.
The effectiveness of the aforementioned reductions is conditioned, in all cases, on the withdrawal or waiver of any action or appeal through administrative channels.
SECOND: DECLARE the termination of procedure EXP202315180, in accordance with the provisions of Article 85 of the LPACAP.

THIRD: ORDER COLEGIO VIRGEN DE EUROPA, S.L. to notify the Agency within 3 months of this resolution becoming final and enforceable of the adoption of the measures described in the legal grounds of the initiation agreement transcribed in this resolution.
FOURTH: NOTIFY this resolution to COLEGIO VIRGEN DE EUROPA, S.L.
FIFTH: In accordance with the provisions of Article 85 of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Code), which conditions the reduction for voluntary payment and acknowledgment of liability on the withdrawal or waiver of any action or appeal in administrative proceedings, this resolution will be final in administrative proceedings and fully enforceable upon notification.
In accordance with the provisions of Article 50 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Civil Code), this resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.
Against this resolution, which terminates the administrative process as provided for in
Art. 114.1.c) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations, interested parties may file an administrative appeal before the Administrative Litigation Division of the National Court, in accordance with the provisions of Article 25 and Section 5 of the Fourth Additional Provision of Law 29/1998, of July 13, regulating the Administrative Litigation Jurisdiction, within two months from the day following notification of this act, as provided for in Article 46.1 of the aforementioned Law. However, pursuant to the provisions of Article 90.3.a) of the LPACAP, the final administrative decision may be provisionally suspended if the interested party expresses their intention to file an administrative appeal. If this is the case, the interested party must formally notify this fact in writing to the Spanish Data Protection Agency, submitting it through the Agency's Electronic Registry \[https://sedeaepd.gob.es/sede-electronica-web/\], or through one of the other registries provided for in Article 16.4 of the aforementioned Law 39/2015, of October 1. They must also forward to the Agency the documentation proving the effective filing of the administrative appeal. If the Agency does not become aware of the filing of the administrative appeal within two months from the day following notification of this resolution, it will terminate the precautionary suspension.
