## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA because a courier, United Parcel Service (UPS) (the controller) had delivered a parcel addressed to them to a neighbour without any prior consent.

The courier firstly tried to exclude its responsibility in subjective terms. The controller submitted that there was a [contract](https://www.ups.com/assets/resources/webcontent/es_ES/terms_carriage_es.pdf) in place with Media Markt and that they were acting as service providers, following their instructions and acting according to the contract. They also alleged that clause 10 of the contract specified that parcels may be left with neighbours when the addressee cannot be found; and clause 11 specified that it was Media Markt who should inform their customer about the processing of their data.

In its decision, the DPA had to determine who the controller was and what GDPR provisions might have been breached by the incident.

### Holding

According to the Spanish DPA, with reference to EDPB's [Guidelines 07/2020](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-07/eppb_guidelines_202007_controllerprocessor_final_en.pdf), in order to determine the roles of controllers and processors, what must be taken into account is the actual activity of both of them (i.e., the factual elements or circumstances of the case).

In this case, there was merely a services contract in place between the retailer and the controller. A contract that sets out precise instructions for the processing (i.e., 'the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller'), as per [Article 28(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR#3 "Article 28 GDPR"), was lacking.

Additionally, the DPA highlighted that such contract should also define the obligation to respect the confidentiality of the data and the measures laid out in [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). Therefore, as the obligations were not clearly defined, the controller could not qualify as a processor and was responsible for the incident due to actual control over the means of processing the personal data.

The DPA found a breach of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") since the personal data of the data subject were disclosed to a third person without their consent. For this violation, the DPA fined the controller €50,000. The DPA also found a violation of [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") since the controller did not implement the measures necessary to prevent such disclosure. For this violation, the DPA fined the controller €20,000.

## Comment

_Fun fact: this decision is directly contradicted by a recent decision by the Belgian DPA that considered the delivery of a parcel was not a processing of personal data.

of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Public Administrations (in

a service provider that has to fulfill the services agreed with MEDIA

In this sense, it should be noted that it acts and proceeds as agreed with MEDIA
MARKT, and in order to guarantee the delivery of the order within the time and form
agreed with MEDIA MARKT, always in favor and in the interest of the complainant.

Clause 10 and 11 of the terms and conditions of the contract that governs them are referred:

( https://www.ups.com/assets/resources/webcontent/es\_ES/terms\_carriage\_es.pdf )

where, on the one hand, the possibility of delivering the package to the neighbor in
absence of the addressee; and on the other, the obligation of the sender of the shipment, in our

MEDIA MARKT case, to duly inform the recipient about the treatment of
your data within the framework of the services offered by the claimed entity.

“10. Delivery

recipient that UPS may use the personal data of the recipient of
in accordance with the link above for the UPS Privacy Notice in effect at the time of
shipment regarding uses other than those specified in the previous subsection.”

The entity claimed as a supplier of MEDIA MARKT has no proof that

in the specific shipment to the complainant, it would have had to proceed in a way
specific or different from what was agreed with MEDIA MARKT.

Therefore, if the Agency decided not to admit the initial claim filed by the
complainant against MEDIA MARKT in which the complainant expressly referred

to the communication of your data to a third party without your consent, understand this part
which should proceed equally in the case at hand, since the entity
claimed has acted as agreed with its client MEDIA MARKT.

If the Agency agreed not to admit the claim against MEDIA MARKT,
then there can be no reason why this should not happen equally to the entity

claimed.

NINTH: On August 9, 2022, the instructor of the procedure agreed to give
by reproduced for evidentiary purposes the claim filed by A.A.A. and his
documentation, the documents obtained and generated during the admission phase to

MARKT was aware of and had contractually agreed that UPS could leave
your packages to the care of a neighbor, as stated in clauses 10 and 11 of
the Terms and Conditions of the contract signed between the claimed entity and MEDIA

MARKT.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/10

In this way, it is MEDIA MARKT itself, as the sender of the product, which
should have excluded the possibility of delivery to a neighbor of the delivery, since UPS
expressly informed him that in the absence of this exclusion this was possible.

Therefore, the respondent entity considers that it has acted in accordance with the
contract signed with MEDIA MARKT, being MEDIA MARKT itself as
data controller who had the obligation to inform the
claimed entity that could not deliver through a neighbor.

In view of everything that has been done, by the Spanish Data Protection Agency
In this proceeding, the following are considered proven facts:

In this sense, it should be noted that article 28.3 b) and c) of the RGPD, regarding the
responsible for the processing of personal data establishes the following:

“The treatment by the person in charge will be governed by a contract (…) that binds the
manager with respect to the person in charge.
