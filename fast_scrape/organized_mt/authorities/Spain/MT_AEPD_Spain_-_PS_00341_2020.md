## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant filed a complaint to the Spanish DPA in May 2019 because Vodafone requested from the complainant a payment of a bill for a contract performed without the complainant's consent. This request was done via SMS. The complainant subsequently visited the Vodafone store to get the receipt of this debt even though the address and bank account on the bill were not his.

The Vodafone made the Spanish DPA aware of the fact that it had sent a letter to the claimant indicating that it taken action to resolve the issue and apologised. This letter outlined that it had now classified the service concerned in the SMS as fraudulent and erased any outstanding debt from the complainant's patrimonial solvency folder. It also outlined that after internal investigations by Vodafone, it became clear that although the contract was in fact correct, it has not been made by the complainant. The contracted service seemed correct since it passed Vodafone's security procedure. All services made in the name of the claimant that he did not recognise as valid were classified as fraud.

Vodafone outlined to the Spanish DPA that the fraudulent contract was made through Vodafone's Online Shop in accordance to the security policy. All access details were correctly inputted to create and access an online profile in the client section. Therefore, Vodafone notified the agency to state that it was difficult to determine whether the third party was authorised to access the account from which the bill was sent and whether access to the personal data was done legally or not. Vodafone outlined that it was not made aware of the fraudulent action until the complainant filed a complaint.

### Dispute

Did Vodafone violate Article 6(1) GDPR by sending an SMS asking for the payment of a fraudulent contract to the complainant?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA held that it was proven that Vodafone has processed the claimant's personal data. Vodafone did not take necessary precautions to authenticate the contracting party. Vodafone also did not have a legal basis for processing the claimant's personal data as there was no valid contract between Vodafone and the claimant. Therefore, Vodafone was in breach of Article 6(1) GDPR.

Similarly, the Spanish DPA held that Vodafone failed to fulfill its obligation to respect the principle of lawfulness and the principle of responsibility \[although not mentioned directly by the Spanish DPA, these principles are found under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 5(2) GDPR respectively\]. The Spanish DPA even made reference to Recital 40 GDPR on the legality of processing.

The Spanish DPA then reminded that a sanction for violating Article 6(1) GDPR was imposed on Vodafone. The fine to be imposed was to be at a level of €50000. This fine was reduced as Vodafone recognised its responsibility and made an early and voluntary payment of to €30000 (as authorised legally and provided by the Spanish DPA). The reduced fine was paid in October 2020 putting a close to the procedure.

                             FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                              I

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate

and to solve this procedure.

                                              II

      The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the

treatment of personal data and mentions among them that of "legality, loyalty and
transparency". The precept provides:

      "1. The personal data will be:

         a) Treaties in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner with the interested party; "

        Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

         "1. The treatment will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following
terms:

      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
      personal for one or more specific purposes;

      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
      pre-contractual;

      (…) "

      The infringement for which the claimed entity is responsible is found
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading "General conditions for
the imposition of administrative fines ”, it states:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/14

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of maximum 20,000,000 Eur or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

       Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions

considered very serious ”provides:

      "1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)

2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
in particular, the following:

        (…)

        a) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
           conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the

           Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

       On the one hand, it is proven that the defendant processed the personal data
of the claimant (name, surname and NIF). Thus, the claimed, when hiring did not have
the necessary precautions to prove the legitimacy of the contractor.

        On the other hand, the claimed person lacked legitimacy for the treatment of the data
claimant's personal.

       They also confirm the absence of legitimacy for the treatment, as
they show that there was no contract between the two.

       It must be taken into account that the documentation in the file
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/14

provides evidence that the defendant violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since
processed the personal data of the claimant without standing.

        The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the
Obligations imposed by the regulations for the protection of personal data
It is thus obvious. A diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the treatment
of third-party data requires that the person responsible for the treatment is in conditions
to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).

      In accordance with the evidence available at this time
procedural, and without prejudice to what results from the instruction of the procedure, it is estimated
that the defendant's conduct could violate article 6.1 of the RGPD and may be

constitutive of the offense typified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned Regulation
2016/679.

      In this sense, Recital 40 of the RGPD states:

       "(40) For the treatment to be lawful, personal data must be processed
with the consent of the interested party or on some other legitimate basis established
in accordance with Law, either in this Regulation or by virtue of another Law

of the Union or the Member States referred to in this Regulation,
including the need to comply with the legal obligation applicable to the person responsible for the
treatment or the need to perform a contract to which the interested party or

in order to take measures at the request of the interested party prior to the
conclusion of a contract. "

                                               III

      In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions
visions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, precepts that indicate:

      "Each supervisory authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines

administrative under this article for the infractions of this
Regulations indicated in paragraphs 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive. "

      "Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of

        b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

        c) any measure taken by the controller or processor
        to mitigate the damages suffered by the interested parties;

        d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge of the
        treatment, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have
        applied by virtue of articles 25 and 32;

        e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
        treatment;

         f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to

        remedy the violation and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the violation;

        g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

        h) the way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement,
        in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infraction and, in such
        case, to what extent;

        i) when the measures indicated in Article 58 (2) have been
        previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge

        in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;

        j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or to mechanisms
        certification approved in accordance with Article 42, and

        k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
        case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct
        or indirectly, through the infringement. "

              Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD,

        Article 76, "Sanctions and corrective measures", provides:

      "2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
         The following may also be taken into account:

        a) The continuing nature of the offense.

      h) The submission by the person in charge or in charge, with character

      In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
      instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the fine sanction to
      impose the claimed entity as responsible for an offense typified in

      Article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, in an initial assessment, they are considered concurrent in

      diligence of the claimed (article 83.2.b, RGPD).

        As mitigating:

      -The measures that the defendant adopted to alleviate the damages suffered
      by the claimant (article 83.2.c).
