## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) against Blu Management Spain, S.L., a recruitment agency, alleging the unauthorized disclosure of her personal information. According to the complaint, the data subject had contacted the agency in May 2023 and participated in a phone interview. Subsequently, on July 27, 2021, she received several WhatsApp messages from a third party who claimed the interviewer at Blu Management had shared her name and phone number.

The data subject contacted the agency to inquire about the unauthorized disclosure and submitted both a data deletion request and a data access request. In response, the controller claimed to only possess the personal data included in her resume, such as identification details, academic history, and professional experience, and provided her with a copy. The controller also stated that it had deleted all personal data related to the data subject, including emails, messages, and other communications.

The data subject requested compensation, citing the controller's failure to adequately protect her personal information. The controller countered that the disclosure was made by an exchange student who had obtained the data during the interview conducted by one of the controller's employees, asserting that there had been no breach of its systems.

### Holding

This incident was deemed a personal data breach under [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR"), as defined by [Article 4(12) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#12 "Article 4 GDPR"). Consequently, the Spanish DPA imposed a fine of €2,000, calculated based on Blu Management Spain's annual turnover. On February 29, 2024, the controller acknowledged responsibility and opted to take advantage of a 20% reduction by voluntarily paying the fine within the established timeframe and admitting responsibility, resulting in a reduced penalty of €1,200.

AGREEMENT TO START SANCTIONING PROCEEDINGS

From the actions carried out by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the
following

FACTS

FIRST: A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complaining party) filed a claim with the
French data protection authority. The claim is directed against BLU
MANAGEMENT SPAIN, S.L. with NIF B66500661 (hereinafter, BLU MANAGEMENT).
The reasons for the claim are as follows:

The complainant contacted BLU MANAGEMENT, which is a recruitment agency, to apply for a job around May 2021, and had a telephone interview with B.B.B. (hereinafter, the BLU MANAGEMENT consultant).

Subsequently, on July 26, 2021, the complainant received a series of messages via WhatsApp (…), where the complainant had worked.

The person who sent these WhatsApp messages indicated to the complainant that the person who had provided him with his contact details was the BLU MANAGEMENT consultant.

The complainant indicates that he had not given permission to BLU MANAGEMENT to share his data with third parties. For this reason, she contacted BLU MANAGEMENT
on July 26, 27 and 30, 2021, having obtained a response from them, but
she considers that what they have done is not enough to deal with these facts

      compensated.
      Failing to respond to my requests within 30 days from today will result in a

“Dear Data Protection Officer,
Thank you for your email.

I appreciate you fulfilled most of my requests within a short period of time.
The content of your email is an admission of liability on your part (especially
      paragraph 3). In fact, your employee at that time (up until June 30th 2021) was
      able to circumvent your systems to extract my data without your knowledge and

      such critical situation happened to prevent it from occurring, I appreciate you are
      now willing to assess your company.
      Nevertheless, as the employer of B.B.B. you failed to store my data safely. As a
      victim of a prejudice I ask for a reasonable compensation for your failure.
      If I do not hear from you before August, 27th 2021 or if your final answer stands
      where it is at t(...) point, I will have to contact the AEPD to make them aware of

      t(...) situation and ask for their guidance to find an amicable solution.

2016/679 (Reglamento General de Protección de Datos, en adelante RGPD), y de

conformidad con lo establecido en el Título VII, Capítulo I, Sección segunda, de la
LOPDGDD, teniendo conocimiento de los siguientes extremos:

El día 30 de junio de 2023, se presenta un escrito ante la AEPD en nombre y
representación de BLU MANAGEMENT como respuesta a un requerimiento de
información, en el que se aporta, entre otra, la siguiente información:

- Copia del correo electrónico enviado por \*\*\*EMAIL.2 a la parte reclamante, fechado
   el 30 de julio de 2021, que ya había sido aportado por la CNIL junto con la
   reclamación. Junto a él, se aporta un certificado de que este correo fue enviado el
   30 de julio de 2021.

On September 4, 2023, a letter was submitted to the AEPD on behalf of and representing BLU MANAGEMENT in response to a request for information, in which the following information was provided, among others:

- It is indicated that a Data Protection Impact Assessment (hereinafter, EIPD) was carried out after receiving the request from the complainant. A copy of the EIPD for the data processing that "consists of conducting interviews with candidates for positions offered by third-party clients of Blu Management Spain, S.L." is provided. From this EIPD, the conclusion is drawn that it is not necessary to carry out a prior consultation with the competent authority.

- Copy of the analysis of the risks related to this processing activity and the applicable security measures, including whether or not they are already implemented and the date of implementation of the measure.

- Regarding the causes of this incident, the following is indicated:

“During the interview with the complainant, Mr.
B.B.B. was present in his capacity as an intern together with the Recruitment Consultant and, we understand that during the interview he was able to see the mobile phone number of (…) and provide this information to a friend, who was the one who

contacted the complainant on July 26, 2021, date on which
B.B.B. no longer belonged to Blu as an Erasmus+ intern, since
he voluntarily withdrew from his internship on June 16, 2021, as evidenced by the email sent by the Recruitment Manager,
C.C.C. to E.E.E. responsible for Erasmus+ of \*\*\*UNIVERSITY.1.

Upon learning of the claimant's email, we made the appropriate inquiries, contacting B.B.B. to
find out first-hand what had happened, who confirmed to us that
during the interview in which he was present, he noted down the claimant's mobile phone
number to provide it to "(...)".
For all the above, this party understands that it is not appropriate to provide any contract

on the maintenance of the Information Systems, since they have not been involved."

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/18

- Regarding the measures adopted to modify security incidents such as the one that
occurred, the following is indicated:

“it was internally agreed that in all selection processes attended by
students on internships, they would be prevented from accessing them with tablets or
mobile phones and, always accompanied by a Selection Consultant who would
be the one to have access to the candidates' data, once they have
given their consent for the selection processes. Additionally,
all Blu \*\*\*POSITION.1s sign an NDA regarding all data that they
handle in the exercise of their functions. Finally, the employment contracts were modified
to include a clause relating to the “Use of information and technology
equipment and devices.”

-Regarding the lack of notification of this security incident to the AEPD, the following is indicated:

“In accordance with the reasons for exception in article 34 of the GDPR, where
a series of cases are stated in which this communication will not be mandatory, this company chose not to proceed with the notification of the security breach, since, after the breach, Blu Selection took

technical and organizational measures to ensure that there is no possibility of the high risk materializing and, above all, taking into account that it has only occurred on one subject and all actions were directed to prevent the events that occurred from being repeated.”

FIFTH: Volume of business or activity: According to the query made on September 8, 2023 in the Axesor Monitoriza service (https://monitoriza.axesor.es/),
BLU MANAGEMENT SPAIN SL is a "Self-employed" type company with a sales volume, in the fiscal year 2020, of \*\*\*AMOUNT.1 euros.

SIXTH: On January 8, 2024, the Director of the AEPD adopted a draft agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings. Following the process established
in article 60 of the GDPR, on January 18, 2024, the aforementioned draft was transmitted through the IMI system and the interested authorities were informed that they had
four weeks from that moment to formulate pertinent and reasoned objections. The processing period for the proceedings was automatically suspended

for these four weeks, in accordance with the provisions of
Article 64 of the LOPDGDD.

Within the period for this purpose, the interested supervisory authorities did not submit
relevant and reasoned objections in this regard, so it is considered that all the

authorities agree with said project and are bound by it, in accordance with the provisions of
Article 60 of the GDPR.

FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

I
Competence

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/18

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by article 58.2 and 60 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD) and according to the provisions of articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures

processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the regulatory
provisions issued in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them,
on a subsidiary basis, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II
Preliminary questions

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of article 4.1 and 4.2 of the RGPD,
the processing of personal data is recorded, since BLU
MANAGEMENT collects and stores, among others, the following personal

data of natural persons: name, and telephone number, among other
processing.

BLU MANAGEMENT carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller, since it determines the purposes and means of such activity, pursuant to

Article 4.7 of the GDPR. Furthermore, this is cross-border processing, since BLU MANAGEMENT is established in Spain, although it provides services to other
countries in the European Union.

Article 4, paragraph 12 of the GDPR broadly defines “personal data security breaches” (hereinafter, security breach) as “any
security breach leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or
alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or unauthorized disclosure or access to such data.”

In the present case, there is a breach of security of personal data in the

circumstances indicated above, categorized as a breach of confidentiality, insofar as a friend of BLU MANAGEMENT would have used his position to
take the complainant's phone and communicate it to a third party, who contacted the complainant via WhatsApp.

Within the principles of treatment provided for in article 5 of the GDPR, the
integrity and confidentiality of personal data is guaranteed in section 1.f)
of article 5 of the GDPR.

III

Principle of integrity and confidentiality

Article 5.1.f) “Principles relating to treatment” of the GDPR establishes:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/18

“1. Personal data shall be:
(…)

f) processed in such a way as to ensure appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or

unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, by applying appropriate

technical or organisational measures ("integrity and confidentiality").

In the present case, it is clear that the personal data of the affected parties, contained in the
BLU MANAGEMENT database, were unduly disclosed to a third party,

insofar as the complainant has stated that he received a
communication via WhatsApp from a third party, in which he informed him that his
data (name and telephone number) had been obtained by a person working at BLU
MANAGEMENT. Furthermore, BLU MANAGEMENT has stated that, when contacting the
person who allegedly shared the telephone number, he has

confirmed that he had accessed the complainant's telephone number and communicated it to
the third party.

For its part, BLU MANAGEMENT has informed the complainant that the
person who leaked the data has certified the destruction of their contact information.

Therefore, in accordance with the evidence available at this time
in order to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to what may result from
the investigation, it is considered that the known facts could constitute an
infringement, attributable to BLU MANAGEMENT, for violation of article 5.1.f) of the
RGPD.

IV
Classification of the infringement of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR

If confirmed, the aforementioned infringement of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR could entail the
commission of the infringements classified in Article 83.5 of the GDPR, which under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines" provides:

"Infringements of the following provisions shall be punishable, in accordance with
paragraph 2, by administrative fines of not more than EUR 20 000 000 or,
in the case of an undertaking, not more than 4 % of the total annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher:

a) the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; (…)”

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 “Infringements considered very

serious” of the LOPDGDD indicates:
“1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that constitute a

substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/18

a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and
guarantees established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)”

V
Proposal for a sanction for the infringement of article 5.1.f) of the GDPR

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence available at the time of the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered that the balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the GDPR and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, allows for an initial fine of €2,000 (two thousand euros).

VI
Imposition of measures

If the infringement is confirmed, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d)
of the GDPR, according to which each supervisory authority may “order the controller or

processor to comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain manner
and within a specified period…” in the resolution adopted, BLU MANAGEMENT may be required to notify this Agency
within SIX MONTHS that it has adopted the appropriate measures to adapt its actions to the regulations

mentioned in this act, without prejudice to other measures that may arise from the
instruction of the procedure.

The imposition of these measures is compatible with the sanction consisting of an administrative
fine, as provided for in article 83.2 of the GDPR.

It is noted that failure to comply with the possible order to adopt measures imposed by
this body in the resolution that ends this procedure may be
considered as an administrative infringement in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD,
classified as an infringement in its article 83.5 and 83.6, and such conduct may motivate the

opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioned procedure.

Therefore, in accordance with the above, by the Director of the Spanish Data Protection

Agency,
IT IS AGREED:

FIRST: TO INITIATE SANCTIONING PROCEDURE against BLU MANAGEMENT
SPAIN, S.L., with NIF B66500661, for the alleged infringement of article 5.1.f) of the
RGPD, classified in article 83.5 of the RGPD.

SECOND: TO APPOINT R.R.R. as instructor. and, as secretary, to S.S.S.,
indicating that they may be challenged, if applicable, in accordance with the provisions of
articles 23 and 24 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector
(LRJSP).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 15/18

THIRD: INCORPORATE into the file, for evidentiary purposes, the documentation
from the IMI that has given rise to the prior investigation actions, as well as

the documents obtained and generated by the General Subdirectorate of Data Inspection
in the actions prior to the start of this procedure and
the documentation from the IMI on the draft decision.

FOURTH: THAT for the purposes provided for in art. 64.2 b) of Law 39/2015, of 1 October, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations, the

penalty that may apply would be 2,000 euros, without prejudice to the outcome of
the investigation.

FIFTH: NOTIFY this agreement to BLU MANAGEMENT SPAIN, S.L., with
NIF B66500661, granting it a hearing period of ten working days to

formulate the allegations and present the evidence it considers appropriate. In its
written allegations, it must provide its NIF and the file number that appears in
the heading of this document.

If you do not make any objections to this initiation agreement within the stipulated period, it may be considered a resolution proposal, as established in article

64.2.f) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of

Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP).

In accordance with the provisions of article 85 of the LPACAP, you may acknowledge your
responsibility within the period granted for the formulation of objections to

this initiation agreement; which will entail a 20% reduction of the
sanction to be imposed in this procedure. With the application of this
reduction, the sanction would be set at 1,600 euros, and the procedure will be resolved with the imposition of this sanction.

Likewise, the applicant may, at any time prior to the resolution of this procedure, make voluntary payment of the proposed fine, which will
involve a 20% reduction in its amount. With the application of this reduction,
the fine would be set at 1,600 euros and its payment will imply the termination of the
procedure, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding measures.

The reduction for voluntary payment of the fine can be added to the one that must be applied
for the recognition of responsibility, provided that this recognition of responsibility is made clear within the period granted to formulate
allegations at the opening of the procedure. The voluntary payment of the amount referred to
in the previous paragraph may be made at any time prior to the resolution. In

this case, if both reductions were to be applied, the amount of the fine would be
established at 1,200 euros.

In any case, the effectiveness of any of the two reductions mentioned will be
conditioned to the withdrawal or waiver of any action or appeal through administrative

course against the sanction.

If you choose to proceed with the voluntary payment of any of the amounts
indicated above (1,600 or 1,200 euros), you must make the payment

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 16/18

into the account number IBAN: ES00-0000-0000-0000-0000-0000 opened in the name of
the Spanish Data Protection Agency at the bank CAIXABANK, S.A.,

adhering.

Likewise, proof of payment must be sent to the Subdirectorate General of

Inspection to continue with the procedure in accordance with the amount paid.

The procedure will have a maximum duration of twelve months from the date
of the start agreement. After this period, it will expire and, consequently, the proceedings will be filed; in accordance with the provisions of
article 64 of the LOPDGDD.

Finally, it is noted that in accordance with the provisions of article 112.1 of the LPACAP,
there is no administrative appeal against this act.

SECOND: On February 29, 2024, the respondent party has proceeded to pay
the penalty in the amount of 1,200 euros using the two reductions
provided for in the Initiation Agreement transcribed above, which implies the
recognition of responsibility.

THIRD: The payment made, within the period granted to formulate allegations at
the opening of the procedure, entails the waiver of any action or appeal in administrative
course against the penalty and the recognition of responsibility in relation to
the facts referred to in the Initiation Agreement and its legal qualification.

FOURTH: In the initiation agreement transcribed above it was indicated that, if the infringement is confirmed, it could be agreed to impose on the person responsible the adoption of
appropriate measures to adjust its performance to the regulations mentioned in this act, in accordance with the provisions of the cited article 58.2 d) of the RGPD, according to which

each control authority may "order the person responsible or in charge of the treatment that the treatment operations comply with the provisions of

control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to

II
Termination of the procedure

the procedure may be resolved with the imposition of the appropriate sanction.

2. When the sanction is of a purely monetary nature or when it is possible to impose a
monetary sanction and another of a non-monetary nature but the
inappropriateness of the second has been justified, the voluntary payment by the presumed responsible party, at
any time prior to the resolution, will imply the termination of the procedure,

except in relation to the restoration of the altered situation or the determination of
compensation for the damages and losses caused by the commission of the infringement.

3. In both cases, when the sanction is of a purely monetary nature, the
body competent to resolve the procedure will apply reductions of at least
20% on the amount of the proposed sanction, these being cumulative with each other.
