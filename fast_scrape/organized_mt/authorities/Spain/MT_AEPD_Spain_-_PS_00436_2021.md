## English Summary

### Facts

The controller was a local pub with surveillance cameras on its exterior. The complainant alleged that the controller had these cameras installed for "many months" without putting up signs that warned passersby and disclosed the contact details of the controller. The controller had been the subject of previous claims for the same alleged violation.

The controller responded that the complaint was filed by the same neighbor who had filed the first complaint, and it was filed the same day their GDPR-compliant signs had been stolen. The signs had been stolen three times. Because of the minimal value of the signs (roughly €7), the controller had not filed a police report, but they provided invoices from the copy shop where they had replacements printed.

### Holding

The DPA noted that, in cases of video surveillance, Article 22.4 LOPDGDD provides that the duty of disclosure in [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") may be fulfilled by placing a sign near surveillance cameras that identifies the existence of data processing, the identity of the controller, and the possibility of exercising the rights forseen in Articles 15 to 22 GDPR. Failure to provide this information constitutes a "serious infraction" per Article 83.5 GDPR.

However, the DPA held that the controller could not be sanctioned per Article 28.1 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Regime Legal of the Public Sector (Responsibility), which requires that only parties responsible for an adiminstrative infraction by way of fraud or negligence be subject to sanction. The DPA reasoned that because the controller had failed to comply only as a result of repeated acts of vandalism and had quickly acted to remedy the infraction after each incident, there was no fraud or negligence on the part of the controller.

## Comment

This case is the result of either a series of improbable coincidences or a very creative and motivated vandal.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW
Yo
In accordance with article 58.2 of the RGPD and as established in articles 47 and
48.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
Personal and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is
competent to initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection.
Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: “The procedures
processed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations issued in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”
II
In the present case, it is appropriate to examine the claim dated 04/21/2021 filed
in this Agency in which the absence of an informative poster of
video-surveillance area on the facade of the PUB \*\*\*PUB.1 located on CALLE \*\*\*ADDRESS.1,
when there are two video surveillance cameras installed in it.
Article 13 of the RGPD, sections 1 and 2, establishes the information that must be provided
to the interested party at the time of collecting their data. In the case of treatments
of personal data for surveillance purposes through camera systems or
video cameras, the duty of information can be fulfilled by placing, in the
video-monitored areas, an informative badge located in a sufficiently
visible, both in open and closed spaces, and using forms in the
that the planned information is detailed, which the person in charge must make available
of those interested.
In this sense, article 22.4 of the LOPDGDD provides that:
“The duty of information provided for in article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is
understood fulfilled by placing an informative device instead
sufficiently visible identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment, the
identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights foreseen in the
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the
informative device a connection code or internet address to this
information."
This infringement is typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD:
“The infractions of the following dispositions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% of the turnover
global annual total of the previous financial year, choosing the highest amount:
a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;
(...)
For the purposes of the limitation period of the infraction, it is considered very serious
and prescribes after three years, in accordance with article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which establishes
that:
a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;
(...)
III
On 02/09/2022, a written statement of allegations to the proposed resolution was received by
the party claimed providing photographs dated 02/08/2022 in which two
Informative posters of the video-monitored area on the facade of the PUB “\*\*\*PUB.1”.
Although it is true that at the time of the start of this sanctioning procedure
there were no signs indicating the video surveillance system installed on the facade of the
establishment, we are faced with an assumption of exemption from liability,
in accordance with article 28 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Regime
Legal of the Public Sector. This precept enshrines one of the principles of
sanctioning power, the “Responsibility”, by virtue of which “1. They can only be
sanctioned for acts constituting an administrative infraction, natural persons
and legal, as well as, when a Law recognizes them capacity to act, the groups
affected, unions and entities without legal personality and assets
independent or autonomous, who are responsible for them by way of
fraud or guilt”.
Analyzing the file as a whole, it can be seen that there is no fraud or negligence in the
conduct of the defendant since it has been sufficiently proven (invoices,
denounces, among others) that every time the informative posters of the zone
under video surveillance, puts them back.
Therefore, according to the above,
The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
FIRST: ORDER the FILE of this procedure due to the absence of
culpability in the defendant's conduct.
SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to the claimant and the respondent.
