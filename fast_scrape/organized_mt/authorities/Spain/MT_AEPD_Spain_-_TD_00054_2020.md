File No: TD/00054/2020
1037-100919
RESOLUTION Nº: R/00319/2020
Having regard to the complaint made to this Agency by Ms. A.A.A., (from
now the complainant), against CAIXABANK, S.A. (now the
claimed), because their right of access has not been duly attended to.
The procedural actions provided for in Title VIII of the Law have been carried out
Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 December, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter referred to as LOPDGDD), the following have been found
FACTS
FIRST: The complainant exercised her right of access against the respondent with a tax identification number (NIF)
A08663619, without having received the legally established response to your request.
The claimant provides various documentation relating to the claim
raised before this Agency and on the exercise of the right exercised.
 On 3 April 2018, in view of the claim for the right of access, this
Agency resolved:
"In relation to your claim for protection of rights submitted to this
Agency referring to CAIXABANK, S.A., from the analysis of the documentation provided
It follows that it does not concern the exercise of the right recognised in Article
15.1 of Organic Law 15/1999, of 13 December, on the Protection of Personal Data
Personal Data Protection Act (LOPD), and developed in the Regulations implementing the LOPD,
approved by Royal Decree 1720/2007 of 21 December.
The right of access, as specified in Article 27.1 of the
Regulation, is the right of the person concerned to obtain information on whether his
personal data are being processed, the purpose of which is to
treatment being carried out, as well as the information available
on the origin of such data and the communications made or planned by the
themselves.
Paragraph 3 of that Article specifies that this right is independent
which grant those concerned special laws and, in particular, laws which
regulate the administrative procedure.
Furthermore, Article 29(3) makes it clear that the information
must be provided by the data controller shall comprise all the basic data of the
those resulting from any computer processing, as well as the
information available on the origin of the data, the assignees of the data and the
specification of the specific uses and purposes for which the
data is stored.
Thus, access to copies of certain documents or other information
associated with a business, employment or administrative relationship is not part of the
content of the access right regulated in the data protection regulations,
This question is therefore outside the competence of this Agency.
This is notwithstanding the fact that other legislation covers the obtaining of such
documentation, and the person concerned must apply to the competent authorities,
particularly the organs of consumption.
Consequently, in accordance with Articles 18 and 37(1)(d) of the
LOPD, it is agreed to INADMIT your claim.
SECOND: As a consequence of the Inadmission, you claim before the Audiencia Nacional
that fails:
"...That by dismissing the cause of inadmissibility raised by the party
co-defendant, the action in the main proceedings brought by
the Procurator of the Courts doña (...) in the name and on behalf of DOÑA
A.A.A., against the resolution of 7 May 2018 of the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection Authority, by which the claim of the claimant is rejected
against CaixaBank, S.A., which was involved in the procedure for the protection of rights
TD/01002/2018, and declare the above-mentioned resolution null and void on the grounds that it does not conform to
right, agreeing instead that by the Spanish Data Protection Agency
and in respect of the appellant, initiate proceedings for the protection of
rights against CaixaBank S.A. with express imposition of the procedural costs to
the defendants..."
 This ruling opens a procedure for the processing of this claim and
gives transfer to the respondent to attend the right.
THIRD: In accordance with the tasks laid down in Regulation (EU)
2016/679, of 27 April 2016, General Data Protection (RGPD), proactive
by the data controller, you are required to inform the
Agency of the actions that have been taken to address the complaint
raised. In summary, the following allegations were made:
- The representative/Data Protection Officer of the respondent
in the allegations made during the processing of the
These proceedings, which have already dealt with the right of access
requested both now and earlier in 2017. They provide two letters
sent to the complainant for this purpose, i.e. to comply with the right to
access, one on 5 December 2017 and the current one on 7 April
2020.
- The complainant, who is aware of the allegations of the
transfer made by this Agency and, after having received the right
In summary, the information received is
insufficient, unrealistic and that data are hidden.
 "...That I do NOT agree with the information provided by CaixaBank in exercise my right to access personal data contained in your
files. It provides data on a sheet of paper that does not match reality,
so, they make it up, and the data, with the documents that support that
alleged express authorisation, and that commercial contracting, which has been
repeatedly requested, they hide it. I imagine they do because they don't
have. They do not have any documents to prove the false claims
which reflect in the sheet I received (...) that to date they have not
fulfilled its obligation to provide me with my right of access. It does not provide
the documents that were required, and the scarce data without documents
to confirm their reality that they contribute to a non
correspond to reality (...) CaixaBank SA invented the dates of
products are invented, the numbering of those products is invented
fictitious products, and do not provide any documents proving that the
contracted such products with them and do not provide the authorisations and
consents to be able to dispose of and give away my data which you must have of
each of these alleged products that are said to have
hired..."
- From this Agency, the complainant's allegations were sent to
claimed without, at the date of resolution of this claim, having
Nothing has been said about this.

SEVENTH: Before going into the substance of the issues raised, it should be noted
that these proceedings are being conducted following the refusal to
any of the rights regulated by data protection regulations (access,
correction, deletion, limitation, portability and opposition) and aims to
take appropriate measures to ensure that the guarantees and rights of the person concerned
are properly restored. Therefore, in the present case, only
and assessed those issues raised by the complainant that remain
included in the subject matter of the above-mentioned complaints procedure in respect of
data protection.
 The exercise of the right of access, like all other rights, is a
The very personal right consists of the citizen's right to obtain
information on the processing of your data, the possibility of
obtain a copy of the personal data concerning you that is being
object of processing, as well as information, in particular, on the purposes of the
processing, the categories of data, the recipients, any transfers, the time
the possibility of exercising other rights, the information
available on the origin of the data (if not obtained directly from
holder) or the existence of automated decisions, including profiling,
without affecting the data of third parties.
 In the case analysed here, the complainant has exercised its right to
access and the response received is considered to be incomplete and lacking in reality.
This Agency informs the complainant of this fact so that he can complete
your reply or clarify the points raised by the complainant. On the date of the resolution of this
no contribution has been made by the party complained of to the effect that the
right of access requested has been fully met.
On the basis of the foregoing, considering that the present proceedings have
to ensure that the guarantees and rights of those concerned are duly
restored, combining the information in the file with the regulations
referred to in the preceding paragraphs, this complaint must be upheld, as
an incomplete response has been issued.
Finally, if there is a dispute with the controller
on matters arising from the contractual relationship, they should be aware that the Spanish Data Protection Agency is not competent to resolve civil matters,
such as those relating to the civil or commercial validity of the contract, the accuracy of
the amount of the debt, the proper provision of the services contracted or the
interpretation of contractual clauses. The determination of the conditions of the
contractual or commercial service, based on an interpretation of the contract signed
between the parties and their correct application, should be brought before the
administrative or judicial authorities, as it exceeds the scope of the
Agency.
The bodies that issue binding decisions to this effect include
Consumer Arbitration Boards (provided that the creditor voluntarily submits
them), the Telecommunications User Assistance Office
(www.usuariosteleco.gob.es) or the judicial bodies. They are not binding, between
other, the decisions of consumer organisations and offices
municipal consumer goods.
It is therefore appropriate to uphold the claim which gave rise to this
procedure.
Having regard to the above-mentioned and other generally applicable provisions,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: ESTIMATE the claim made by Ms. A.A.A. and urge CAIXABANK,
S.A. with NIF A08663619, so that, within ten working days of

resolution could lead to the commission of the offence referred to in Article
72.1.m) of the LOPDGDD, which will be sanctioned in accordance with Article 58.2 of the RGPD.
SECOND: TO NOTIFY this resolution to Ms. A.A.A. and CAIXABANK, S.A.
