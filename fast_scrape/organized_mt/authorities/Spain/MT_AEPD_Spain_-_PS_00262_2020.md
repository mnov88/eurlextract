## English Summary

### Facts

The personal data of the claimants were used illegitimately to contract two telephone lines with the company XFERA MÓVILES, S.A. The decision does not provide a clear description of the facts. However, on the basis of the available information it seems that when the complainants learned what had happened, they reported it to the Guardia Civil (Spanish military police) and the AEPD.

### Dispute

The key to this case was to determine whether or not the defendant applied adequate measures to verify the identity of the clients. The company claimed that when they learned that it was a fraudulent contract, they suspended the services and cancelled the debt generated. Likewise, they blocked the data of the data subjects and classified the contract as fraudulent.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA concludes that the defendant has not been able to demonstrate that it adopted sufficient diligence measures to verify the identity of the clients before signing the contracts. Therefore, it breached Article 6(1) GDPR by processing personal data without a legitimate basis.

Of the actions carried out in this procedure and of the documentation
Obrante in the file, the following have been accredited:

                                 PROVEN FACTS

FIRST: Two telephone lines and internet are registered in the name of the
claimants. The usurpation of identity in the contracting of services
telecommunications, took place on February 26, 2019.

SECOND: The defendant acknowledges said error and thus in his allegations he manifests
that the reported lines have been classified as fraudulent hires, and
the debts associated with them have been forgiven.

                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                            I

       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.
                                            II

       The defendant is accused of committing an offense for violation of the

Article 6.1 of the RGPD.

       Article 6, Legality of treatment, of the RGPD establishes that:
       "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

       a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;
       b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
pre-contractual;
       (…) "

       Article 4 of the RGPD, Definitions, in section 11, states that:
       "11)" consent of the interested party ": any manifestation of free will,
specific, informed and unequivocal by which the interested party accepts, either through
a statement or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that
they concern him ”.

       Also article 6, Treatment based on the consent of the affected,
of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
Personal and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), states
what:

       "1. In accordance with the provisions of article 4.11 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679, the consent of the affected party is understood to be any manifestation of will
free, specific, informed and unequivocal for which it accepts, either through a

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/7

declaration or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that
concern.
       2. When the data processing is intended to be based on consent

of the affected party for a plurality of purposes, it will be necessary to record in a
specific and unequivocal that said consent is granted for all of them.
       3. The execution of the contract may not be subject to the consent of the affected party
processing of personal data for purposes that are not related to the
maintenance, development or control of the contractual relationship ”.
       Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the principles

basic for the treatment, including the conditions for consent in accordance with
of articles 5, 6, 7 and 9 ”is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the
mentioned Article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, “with administrative fines of
€ 20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, of an equivalent amount
at a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover of the financial year

above, opting for the highest amount ”.
       On the other hand, the LOPDGDD in its article 72 indicates for the purposes of prescription:
“Violations considered very serious:
       1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in

in particular, the following:
       (…)
       b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.

       (…) "
                                               III

       The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since he processed the personal data

without having any legitimacy for it. The personal data were
incorporated into the company's information systems, without having accredited
that he had legitimately hired, had his consent for the
collection and subsequent processing of your personal data, or there is any other
causes the treatment carried out to be legal.

       Well, with respect to the facts that are the subject of this claim,
we must emphasize that the defendant has recognized this error and thus both in his writing
dated January 16, 2019, as in the allegations to the Agreement to initiate the
This sanctioning procedure has stated that the lines denounced have
been classified as fraudulent contracts, and the debts associated with them have

been forgiven.

       The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the
Obligations imposed by the regulations for the protection of personal data
It is thus obvious. A diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the treatment

of third-party data requires that the person responsible for the treatment is in conditions
to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).

                                               IV

        Article 76, “Sanctions and corrective measures”, establishes that: “2. According to
