## English Summary

### Facts

The Spanish DPA received a complaint about the installation of a video surveillance camera on the private property of a local residence, oriented towards public space and a neighbouring school area, disrupting citizen coexistence without just cause. The complaint was filed by the State Security Forces and Corps (Fuerzas y Cuerpos de Seguridad del Estado) in November 2019.

In addition, the system does not have an informational poster indicating the responsible person for data processing, contravening Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. The defendant was identified as a local resident who failed to comply with the recommendations made by the State Security Forces and Corps.

### Dispute

Does the installation of a surveillance camera in private property, oriented towards public spaces, violate Article 5 (1)(c) GDPR?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA found the defendant has a video surveillance camera oriented towards public spaces, affecting the right to privacy and treating personal data without consent of third parties, in violation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

The DPA found the installation of the surveillance camera to lack an informational poster and to be oriented towards a nearby public school, causing distress to the local neighbours. This justified imposing a fine pursuant to Article 83(2)(a). The defendant also ignored the recommendations of the State Security Forces and Corps, proving his intentionality. This justified imposing a fine pursuant to Article 83(2)(b).

The DPA clarified surveillance cameras should be oriented preferably towards private space to avoid intimidation of local neighbours and to control public transit areas without just cause. Also, the obtaining of image(s) from public spaces is an exclusive competence of the State Security Forces and Corps.

Therefore, in light of the violations, the Spanish DPA imposed a €3000 fine on the defendant and stated he has to comply with Article 5(1)(c) and Article 83(2)(a)(b) GDPR.
