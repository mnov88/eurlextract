## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a complaint against an individual that had been publishing for some time their personal information on a blog. The individual had published their name, a video of them (recorded when the data subject was still a minor) and some other implicit mentions to the data subject. The data subject asked the individual to delete the publications without success. The individual also requested a Court to intervene. Within this legal proceeding, the individual also received a cease and delete order from the Court that was not complied with. Therefore, the data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD).

### Holding

The AEPD held that the individual had processed personal data of the data subject without consent or any other legal basis. Therefore, the AEPD concluded that the individual had breached [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") and fined the individual 10,000€. In order to determine the amount of the fine, the AEPD took into account the nature and gravity of the infringement, the level of damage suffered by the data subject, since the data subject was libeled, being accused of immoral and illegal behavior, and the intentional character of the infringement.

FIRST AND ONLY: The respondent has been making publications in the
that uses personal data of the complaining party for defamatory purposes and without
no cause that legitimizes its treatment.

                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                            Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each
control authority and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.
Spanish Data Protection.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: “The procedures
processed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations issued in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

                                            II

The physical image of a person, in accordance with article 4.1 of the RGPD, is a personal data.
nal and its protection, therefore, is the subject of said regulation. In article 4.2 of the
GDPR defines the concept of "treatment" of personal data.

It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data carried out
through the reported publications is in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD.

In the first place and referring to the publications indicated in the background by

of the claimed, article 6.1 of the RGPD, establishes the assumptions that allow
consider the processing of personal data lawful:

"1. The treatment will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following
conditions:
a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their personal data

for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;
c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation applicable to the
data controller;

d) the treatment is necessary to protect the vital interests of the interested party or another
Physical person.
e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers vested in the data controller;
f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued

by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said
interests do not override the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/7

The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the processing
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.

On this issue of the legality of the treatment, Recital 40 also affects
of the aforementioned RGPD, when it states that “In order for the treatment to be lawful, the
personal data must be processed with the consent of the interested party or
any other legitimate basis established in accordance with Law, either in the present
Regulation or by virtue of another Law of the Union or of the Member States to which
referred to in this Regulation, including the need to comply with the legal obligation

applicable to the data controller or the need to perform a contract with
which the interested party is a party or in order to take measures at the request of the
concerned prior to the conclusion of a contract.

In relation to the above, it is considered that there is evidence that the treatment

of data of the people who appear in the publications object of this
claim has been made without legitimizing cause of those included in article 6
of the GDPR.

The GDPR applies to personal data. Said regulation defines as «data
personal” means any information about an identified or identifiable natural person (“the

interested"); An identifiable natural person shall be deemed to be any person whose identity
can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier,
such as a name, an identification number, location data, a
online identifier or one or more elements of physical identity,
physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social of said person.

                                            III

claimed has committed an infringement of the regulations applicable to the protection of

personal data by publishing various entries on your blog in which data is collected
of the claimed (image, name and surnames) without their
consent, or any other legitimizing cause of data processing
personal.

The known facts constitute an infraction, attributable to the claimed party, for

violation of article 6.1 of the RGPD.

Said infringement is typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, which provides the following:

"Infractions of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the

paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:
a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9.”

For the purposes of the limitation period of the infraction, the infraction indicated in paragraph
above is considered very serious and prescribes after three years, in accordance with article 72.1

g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in
particular whether the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, if so, in what
measure;

previously against the person in charge or the person in charge in question in relation to the
