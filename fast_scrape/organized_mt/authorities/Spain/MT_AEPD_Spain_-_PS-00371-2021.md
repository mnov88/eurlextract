The Spanish DPA held that sending someone notifications regarding monetary fines directed at another person constitutes a violation of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#\(f\)_Integrity_and_confidentiality "Article 5 GDPR"). As the respective data was not rectified in time after receiving a complaint, it also resulted in a breach of [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

## English Summary

### Facts

On 5 July 2019 the data subject received an e-mail from Hertz España, a rental vehicle provider (the controller), containing information about monetary fines. These fines were directed at a third party, but sent to the data subject's e-mail address. Consequently, the data subject complained to the controller about this on the same day.

In turn, the controller assured them on the 9 July 2019 that a rectification of the data had happened. However, the data subject received another e-mail directed at the third party on 29 July 2019. On the same day, the data subject submitted a complaint to the German data protection authority, which relayed it to the AEPD, the Spanish data protection authority. The complete deleting of the data subject's data from the third party's file was only achieved on 30 July 2023. The AEPD started an investigation and later initiated penalty proceedings.

In its defense, the controller argued that the third party indicated the e-mail address of the data subject as their own themselves and that the error was most likely not made by an employee of the controller. Furthermore, the controller highlighted the uniqueness of the case and stated that it was a minor error with no lasting damage that was rectified as soon as possible. The controller also added that the data subject themselves only put the respective e-mail address into the controller's database on 7 February 2020, meaning the controller could not have confused the e-mail addresses of the data subject and the third party in 2019.

### Holding

The AEPD held that the controller violated [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#\(f\)_Integrity_and_confidentiality "Article 5 GDPR") by giving the data subject access to personal data of the third party, thus giving way to sanctions according to [Article 83(5)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR "Article 83 GDPR").

Furthermore, the AEPD held that the controller also breached [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") as the technical and organisational measures taken by the controller were considered insufficient. The AEPD assumed that with appropriate measures a timely rectification of the data during the three weeks between the complaint of the data subject to the controller and the sending of the second e-mail should have been possible. This violation gave way to sanctions according to [Article 83(4)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR "Article 83 GDPR").

However, the AEPD imposed no fines in either of the two violations. Instead, according to [Article 58(2)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR"), the AEPD reprimanded the controller and ordered them to take measures within 30 days to ensure that a situation similar to the one in question will not happen again.

                                   BACKGROUND

FIRST: Through the “Internal Market Information System” (hereinafter

The aforementioned claim is made against HERTZ DE ESPAÑA, S.L. (hereinafter HER-
TZ), with registered office and sole establishment in Spain, in relation to the rental of
Firefly Car Rental cars, of which he was a customer in Malaga, which repeatedly sent him
mindly notifications about traffic fines, speed limit violations,
etc., caused by third parties, to your email address \*\*\*USER.1.

this procedure, in addition to the supervisory authority of Berlin (Germany), the self-

control authorities of: Denmark, Norway, Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany), Lower Sa-
Ionia (Germany), Sweden, Portugal, France and Italy.

SECOND: In view of the facts presented, the Subdirectorate General of Inspection
of Data proceeded to carry out actions to clarify it, under the protection of the

investigative powers granted to supervisory authorities in article 58.1 of the
RGPD, being aware of the following extremes:

This email belongs to the complaining party, D. B.B.B. and not to Ms. A.A.A..

Consequently, there was an error in the database, where the person holding the

which belonged to a third party, the complaining party, D. B.B.B..

D.B.B.B. contacted the customer service of the brand

group of informative emails with a traffic fine, receiving a response to your

rectification request on July 9, 2019, at 1:09 p.m.

In the response sent from the email fireflycus-
tomercarespain@fireflycarrentl.com, they apologized to D. B.B.B. and was informed
that the email address had been deleted from Ms.'s file.
A.A.A.

The deletion of email from the sanctions file and the management program
of Car+ contracts did not occur until July 30, which meant that, on July 29,
July, a second email was sent to the address \*\*\*USER.1, with a
second sanction linked to Ms. A.A.A.'s contract.

According to the representatives of the entity, in the spirit of not incurring delays
improper actions, Customer Service informed D. B.B.B. of
that the data corresponding to the email had been rectified, as was the case
in the file managed directly by this Service, although, and in parallel, the Service

Customer Service department, following the established procedure, had requested the
rectification of the data to the appropriate departments (sanctions file and program
of Car+ contract management), which did not implement the change until July 30

The measures adopted by the entity for the complete deletion of the data object of

THIRD: On August 21, 2020, the Director of the AEPD adopted a
draft decision to archive the proceedings. Following the established process
in article 60 of the GDPR, on 08/31/2020 this
draft decision and the authorities concerned were made aware that they had

four weeks from that moment to formulate relevant objections and
motivated. Within the period granted for this purpose, the Berlin supervisory authority
presented its pertinent and motivated objections for the purposes of the provisions of the
article 60 of the RGPD, in the sense that it considered that an archive of
the actions but that the case was analyzed and a warning was issued given that

a violation of the GDPR had occurred.

FOURTH: On July 19, 2021, the Director of the AEPD adopted a project
revised agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings. Following the process is-
established in article 60 of the RGPD, that same day this document was shared on

the IMI system and the supervisory authorities concerned were made aware that they had
two weeks from that moment to formulate relevant and reasoned objections.
Once the period for this purpose has elapsed, the interested control authorities do not present

the supervisory authorities agreed with the revised draft decision
and were bound by it, in accordance with the provisions of section 6 of the
Article 60 of the GDPR.

FIFTH: On August 16, 2021, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against HERTZ DE ESPAÑA,
S.L., in accordance with the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1-
tuber, of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (in
hereinafter, LPACAP), for the alleged violation of article 32 of the RGPD and article

5.1.f) of the RGPD, typified, respectively, in article 83.4 and 83.5 of the RGPD.

SIXTH: On January 14, 2022, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection issued a resolution to rectify errors in the aforementioned agreement.
initiation of sanctioning proceedings and granted HERTZ DE ESPAÑA, S.L a new

deadline for him to formulate the allegations and propose the evidence he considers appropriate.
dents, in accordance with the provisions of section f) of article 64.2 of the LPA-
CHAP.

SEVENTH: The aforementioned resolution to rectify errors in the agreement was notified.
At the beginning, HERTZ presented a written statement of allegations in which, in summary, it stated that:

FIRST.- ABOUT THE SUPPOSED ERROR IN THE DATABASE OF
CONTRACTS

After an exhaustive internal investigation to delve into what happened, HERTZ has

you doubt the existence of the error because of the following:

       - Contract number (...) with Ms. A.A.A., whose postal address, as indicated
       This is \*\*\*ADDRESS.1, dated May 21, 2019, having been
       this person who provided the email address motu proprio

       \*\*\*USER.1.

       - Subsequently, the email address \*\*\*USER.1 appears in
       the HERTZ contract database at a much later date, 7
       February 2020, but this time associated with D. C.C.C. in the contract (...), whose
       postal address, as indicated by this one, is \*\*\*ADDRESS.2, having been

       provided by D.B.B.B. and that he appeared as an additional driver (he
       attached screen print of the contract record in the database
       as Document 2).

       - The fact of the uniqueness of this email address, which

       combines letters and numbers, the letters corresponding to the initials of the
       complaining party, leads us to conclude that it is very unlikely that the error was
       given at the time of entering them into the database by the personnel of
       HERTZ, but was provided by the person who signed contract number (...), of
       date May 21, 2019.

       - How is it feasible to issue traffic fines for violations that
       occur in 2019 to an email address provided in 2020? It is from
       every point impossible.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/15

Based on the above, it should be noted that any communication that had to be carried out
carried out, as is the case of notifications of traffic fines by the corresponding

outstanding infractions committed by Ms. A.A.A., was sent to the email address
electronic provided at the time of contracting the car rental (year 2019), without
that an error was possible given the uniqueness of the email address
mentioned.

This implies that the error in assigning the email address could be ruled out.

email \*\*\*USER.1 to the contract (...) with Ms. A.A.A..

SECOND.- ABOUT THE SINGULARITY OF THE CASE. NON-EXISTENCE OF REITERA-
TION OF CONDUCT BY HERTZ ESPAÑA. ISOLATED FACT, SUB-
HEALED AND COMMUNICATED TO THE CUSTOMER.

As the Agency points out in the Initiation Agreement (p. 10, paragraph): “it was a
specific case (of which there is no similar history in this Agency” and which is
would explain the fact that Mrs. A.A.A. provide the email address
unique already mentioned.

Furthermore, as the Agency knows, HERTZ proceeded to act immediately with the
purpose of trying to provide a solution as soon as possible to the claim made by the
complaining party. Specifically, the chronology of actions carried out by HER-
TZ was the following:

    - On July 5, 2019, the complaining party sent an email to attention
        to the client indicating that the email address \*\*\*USER.1 is in-
        correct since it is not for A.A.A..

    - On July 9, 2019 (i) your email was responded to indicating that
        has deleted the email address and we apologize and (ii)

        calls for the deletion of the email in the fines management file and
        in its Car+ rental contract management program.

Even though the complaining party has received two emails, it understands
We believe that it is also relevant that this situation has not occurred in

no other case, nor that the complaining party has raised any other claim
against HERTZ in relation to this matter.

Therefore, no harm has occurred to the complaining party whose email address
email appeared linked to Ms. A.A.A., who would have provided it in 2019,
before the complaining party provided that same address in another con-

vehicle rental deal that is in no way related to the first one.

It is difficult to maintain with this new data, that it was a mistake in the introduction of the di-
email address in the contract (...), but the email address
electronic was provided to HERTZ, which would explain the uniqueness of the case.

Even admitting that it was (which is not done), we agree with the Agency that
This is a very minor case, which has not caused any damage and which

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/15

It was solved practically immediately.

THIRD.- ABOUT WHAT IS REQUESTED BY THE BER- CONTROL AUTHORITY

LÍN IN HIS OBJECTIONS.

We understand that there is a disparity between what the Berlin Authority requests and what
that the Agency agrees to.

The Agency itself expresses in its Resolution what the control authority requested

of Berlin in its pertinent and motivated objections is that: (sic) “the case will be analyzed
and a warning was issued” (Third Fact, page 5), not that a procedure was initiated.
sanctioning action against HERTZ.

The Berlin authority has filed an objection in a case that, as is known to

the Agency itself, would not be serious, and it is also necessary to remember that initially,
The Agency had proposed archiving the proceedings.

If the Berlin supervisory authority did not request the opening of sanction proceedings
dor, it could be considered that, with the investigative powers attributed to the
Agency, and having previously obtained from HERTZ “all the necessary information

for the exercise of its functions” (article 58.2.1) of the RGPD), could direct a warning
authorization to HERTZ in accordance with the corrective power attributed to it by the article
58.2.b) of the RGPD. However, we fully understand that the Agency has to
act through the mechanisms available in our legal system and
We also appreciate the fact that you consider issuing a warning in the terms

indicated in the Startup Agreement.

EIGHTH: On February 16, 2022, the instructor of the procedure formulated
proposed resolution, in which he proposed that the Director of the AEPD address
a warning to HERTZ DE ESPAÑA, S.L., with NIF B28121549, for an infringement

of article 32 of the RGPD and article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, typified, respectively,
in article 83.4 and 83.5 of the GDPR. And that HERTZ DE ESPAÑA, S.L. be ordered, with
NIF B28121549, to adopt, within a period of thirty days, the measures aimed at guaranteeing
ensure that situations such as the one that is the subject of this complaint do not occur again.
mation. Likewise, HERTZ was granted a period of TEN DAYS for allegations to
that he could allege whatever he considered in his defense and present the documents and

information that you consider relevant.

Once the aforementioned proposed resolution has been notified and the deadline for this purpose has elapsed, it has been
verified that no allegation has been received from HERTZ.

In view of everything that has been done, by the Spanish Data Protection Agency
In this procedure, the following are considered proven facts:

FIRST.- ABOUT THE SUPPOSED ERROR IN THE DATABASE OF

CONTRACTS

HERTZ claims that he doubts that there was an error on his part when recording the
email address of the complaining party in Ms.'s contract. A.A.A.,
given that this contract is dated May 21, 2019 and that the claiming party
appears as an additional driver in the contract (...), dated February 7, 2020. AND

that, therefore, Ms. A.A.A. would have provided the email of the complaining party

TION OF CONDUCT BY HERTZ ESPAÑA. ISOLATED FACT, SUB-
HEALED AND COMMUNICATED TO THE CUSTOMER

HERTZ alleges that this was a specific case and that it would be explained by the fact that
that Ms. A.A.A. Provide the email address already mentioned. No
However, this Agency wishes to highlight that this point has not been proven and that it
is irrelevant for the purposes of determining the existence or not of the infringements in
question.

Furthermore, HERTZ alleges that it proceeded to act immediately in order to try
provide a solution as soon as possible to the claim made by the complaining party. AND
that it is relevant that this situation would not have occurred in any other case,
nor that the complaining party has raised any other claim against HERTZ in
relation to this matter.

It states that no harm has been caused to the complaining party. And that it is difficult to maintain
ner that it was an error in entering the email address in the con-
deal (...), but the email address was provided to HERTZ, which
which would explain the uniqueness of the case.

In this regard, this Agency wishes to point out again that the reasons why the di-
email address of the complaining party was associated with the contract (...),
has not been proven and that is irrelevant for the purposes of determining the existence
of the infringements in question.

HERTZ also alleges that, even admitting that it was (which is not done), he agrees
with this Agency that it is a very minor case, which has not
caused any damage and which was resolved practically immediately.

In this regard, this Agency has nothing more to add.

THIRD.- ABOUT WHAT IS REQUESTED BY THE BER- CONTROL AUTHORITY

HERTZ understands that there is a disparity between what the Berlin Authority requests
and what this Agency agrees to, given that the Berlin supervisory authority in its objec-

pertinent and motivated requests that: (sic) “the case be analyzed and a
warning” (Third Fact, page 5), not that a sanctioning procedure was initiated.

And he alleges that, if the Berlin supervisory authority did not request the opening of proceedings,

This Agency, could send a warning to HERTZ in accordance with the power

that he perfectly understands that the Agency has to act through the mechanisms

PDGDD), which is why this sanctioning procedure is being processed,
there is no other different procedure.

accidental loss, destruction or damage, through the application of technical measures or
appropriate organizational measures (“integrity and confidentiality”).”

In accordance with the evidence available at the present time of
resolution of the sanctioning procedure, it is considered that the personal data of
one of the clients (Ms. A.A.A.), recorded in the HERTZ database, were independent

duly exposed to a third party (the complaining party), violating the principles of
integrity and confidentiality, on two occasions.

The known facts are considered to constitute an infringement, attributable to HER-
