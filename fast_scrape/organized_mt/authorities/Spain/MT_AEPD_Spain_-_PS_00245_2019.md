## English Summary

### Facts

On 25 February 2019, an individual filed a complaint with the AEDP against the Department of Education of the Government of Navarra regarding a survey conducted by his son in class, asking him about intimate, family, and personal issues.

The respondent stated that the purpose of the surveys was to guide and inform schools and families about the level of education acquired by the schoolchildren. Together with these surveys, context questionnaires were provided to obtain information on the socio-economic and cultural conditions of the schools in order to contextualize the results obtained.

The respondent also explained in detail the respective organic laws that justified the collection of these personal data of the students, in order to know better the conditions of the students. At the same time, it also described the security and confidentiality measures that were being followed to protect this information.

The Department of Education of the Government of Navarra replied to the decision to initiate the procedure, agreeing with the allegations of infringement of Articles 5(1)(a) GDPR and 13 GDPR. On the other hand, they disagreed with the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in relation to Article 9(1) GDPR with regard to the question of the gender identity of pupils.

### Dispute

Should government surveys of underage students do comply with the principles of transparency, lawfulness, and fairness, respecting Articles 5 (1) (a), 9 (1), and 13 GDPR?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA confirmed that the defendant collected specific personal data that was not necessary for the purpose in question. Therefore, if they could have achieved the same purpose without processing those data, there is no legal basis for processing them.

Consequently, the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in relation to Article 9(1) GDPR is established. Article 13 GDPR is also considered to have been infringed as regards the information to be provided when personal data are obtained from the data subject.

The Spanish legal system has chosen not to penalize public bodies with a fine, as indicated in Article 77(1)(c) LOPDDGG, and paragraphs 2, 4, 5, and 6 of the same article.

In view of the above, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency decided to impose three different warning sanctions: one for infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, another for infringement of the same Article 5(1)(a) GDPR in relation to Article 9(1) GDPR, and a third warning sanction for infringement of Article 13 GDPR.

  

## Comment

Particularly interesting here is the argumentation according to which by asking to pupils whether they were a "girl", a "boy", or "other", what was being collected was a special category of data (about gender identity). This is interesting because actually Article 9 GDPR does not mention gender identity as a special category of data. It mentions sexual orientation, which the AEPD believes to be somehow connected to the "other" question. As a consequence of this being about "sensitive data", a legal basis allowing specifically for this processing is needed. However, the AEPD notes that Spanish law on these matters is based on a gender binary, and therefore cannot support questions including the "other" choice (see pages 28 and ff. of the Decision).

before the Spanish Data Protection Agency against the DEPARTMENT OF
EDUCATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF NAVARRA (DIRECTORATE GENERAL OF EDUCATION)
(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent).

       The complainant states that his son is studying at a state school in the 4th year of
(4EP from now on) and has carried out a nominative survey where, among others
issues, asks about "your gender (boy/girl/other), the language you use
out of school, their feelings about school, their relationships with their peers, or

  2) In addition to DE, "simultaneous" context questionnaires are carried out, (CC in

Sport, which provide information on socio-economic and cultural conditions
The aim is to provide a context for the results obtained. See, for example

These questionnaires will provide information on socio-economic conditions and
cultural centres for the contextualisation of the results obtained'.

   "Article 8 on results states:

  "1. The result of the final stage evaluation shall be expressed at the following levels for
each of the competences: Insufficient (IN), Sufficient (SU), Good (BI), Remarkable (NT) and
Outstanding (SB).

  The competent education authorities shall record the level obtained by each

in an individual report, which will be given to the parents or
legal guardians and transferred to schools where the students are to continue their
schooling. The report will be of an informative and guiding nature for schools where

        As a starting point, it should be noted that the twenty-third additional
of the Organic Law 2/2006, of 3/05, on Education, generally establishes the principles
in relation to the processing and communication of personal data within
of its scope, by providing for the following:

        "1. Schools may collect personal data from their students that
        are necessary for the exercise of their educational function. Such data may make
        reference to the origin and family and social environment, characteristics or conditions
        and results of their schooling, as well as those of other
        circumstances whose knowledge is necessary for the education and guidance of

        the students.

        2. Parents or guardians and the students themselves must collaborate in obtaining
        the information referred to in this article. The incorporation of a student
        to an educational establishment will imply consent to the processing of its data and,

        where appropriate, the transfer of data from the centre where it was
        schooling, under the terms established in the legislation on
        data protection. In any case, the information referred to in this section
        will be the strictly necessary for the teaching and guidance function, and cannot
        be treated for purposes other than educational without express consent.
