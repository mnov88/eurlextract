## English Summary

### Facts

A student handed in a complaint against the University of Navarra because they asked the students to fill in their vaccination status. The complainant understands this as a breach of the data protection regulation because it would access the students medical records. The grounds are based on an e-mail from the University of Navarra, in which it announces to collaborate with the Navarro Health Service in the Vaccination against COVID-19 and it asks the students to inform about their vaccination status. On October 26, 2021 the University of Navarra replied to the complaint that the students were not coerced to give the information, but they were given the possibility to do so. The University does not process the personal data of the students without their explicit consent. The consent would in no case be vitiated since no condition has been established that could nullify the correct will of the interested party to the processing. There is no measure contrary to the interests of those students who do not provide the information freely and voluntarily. The sole purpose of the communication made is to comply with the objective of the collaboration agreement reached with the Government of Navarra by virtue of the actions taken in its place against SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The complaint filed was admitted for processing on November 24, 2021 in Accordance with Article 65 of the LOPDGDD. The collaboration was known to the public. There is a press release stating the fact that the University of Navarra should communicate the list of persons who are to receive the vaccine so that their identity can be recorded in the health databases. This is in compliance with a legal obligation in terms of prevention of legal risks. This is due to the severity of the pandemic. The form for acceptance of the data processing states that the compliance with the form is voluntary. The first field of the form is the request for consent. Furthermore it is added that the information provided will not be communicated to third parties unless the health authorities require it. This clause can also be accepted.

### Holding

The Court does not consider that there is a violation of the provisions of the regulation in force regarding protection, and there is no substantive issue to support such an allegation. In accordance with the functions that Article 57 (1) a, f and h of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 GDPR confers to each supervisory authority and according to the provisions of Articles 47 and 48 (1) of LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve these investigative actions. In light of provisions (Article 4 (15) GDPR, [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"), [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR")) the vaccination of a person against Covid-19 implies the provision of a health care service. Therefore the information about whether or not an identified natural person has received the Covid-19 vaccine is in the nature of personal data concerning health, falling within the category of special of sensitive data regulated in [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"). The task of the University was to provide the Navarra Health Department, Osasunbidea, with the lists of the people who were going to receive the vaccine so that they could be registered in the health database. The students that wanted to fill out the form on the vaccination were fully informed about the processing of the data, this is on the legal obligation to take care of the health of students in Article 7.1.n Royal Decree 1791/2010. It has not been possible to prove that the students were forced to provide information on their vaccination status. The transfer of data is completely voluntary and informed, requesting the consent of the person concerned and the data is (if even) only transferred to health authorities. No evidence has been found to prove the existence of an infringement within the competence of the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The interested parties may file an appeal.

       In short, recital 35 of the GDPR determines that “the information

health care, or on the occasion of the provision of such care, in accordance with the
Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council” is included in the
special category of health data.

       In light of the provisions cited, the vaccination of a person against

Covid-19 involves the provision of a healthcare service.

       Therefore, information about whether an identified natural person has
received or not the Covid-19 vaccine is in the nature of personal data related to the
health, framed in the category of special or sensitive data regulated in the

Article 9 of the GDPR.

       The complaint is made concrete in the access to the medical history of the students by
part of the University denounced and the transfer of vaccination data to third parties.

       It is necessary to analyze, next, whether the treatment carried out by the University
of Navarra of the students' health data is in accordance with the provisions of the

GDPR.

       All data processing must comply with the regulations governing this
fundamental right, especially the principles that govern the treatment,
established in article 5.1 of Regulation (EU) 679/2016, among them (section a)
that of legality.

       As already indicated, the RGPD, article 9.1., generally prohibits,
the processing of “special data”, among which it mentions those related to the
health. However, section 2 of the provision introduces ten exceptions; ten
cases in which the prohibition of treatment can be lifted if a

of them. These circumstances that exempt the general rule of prohibition are
connected with “any” of the legal bases that according to article 6.1 of the RGPD
legitimize the processing of data.

       It is necessary to refer to the possibility that, in the treatment of
data that constitutes the object of the claim, if any of the

exceptions that lift the general prohibition provided for in article 9.1 of the RGPD.

      Article 9.2 of the GDPR refers to several causes that would lift the ban:

      “a) the interested party gave his explicit consent for the processing of said

      personal data for one or more of the specified purposes, except when the
      Union or Member State law establishes that the prohibition
      mentioned in section 1 cannot be lifted by the interested party;”.
      “g) the treatment is necessary for reasons of essential public interest, especially
      the basis of Union or Member State law, which must be

      proportional to the objective pursued, respect in essence the right to
      data protection and establish appropriate and specific measures to protect
      the interests and fundamental rights of the interested party;”
      “h) the treatment is necessary for preventive or occupational medicine purposes,
      evaluation of the worker's work capacity, medical diagnosis,
      provision of health or social assistance or treatment, or management of

      health and social assistance systems and services, based on Law
      of the Union or the Member States or under a contract with a
      healthcare professional and without prejudice to the conditions and guarantees contemplated
      in section 3;”
      “i) the treatment is necessary for reasons of public interest in the field of

      public health, such as protection against serious cross-border threats
      for health, or to guarantee high levels of quality and safety of the
      health care and medicines or health products, on the basis
      of Union or Member State law establishing measures
      appropriate and specific to protect the rights and freedoms of the interested party,

      in particular professional secrecy.

       The treatment carried out is part of a collaboration campaign of the
University with health authorities in the vaccination campaign against the virus

Covid. The Ministry of Health of the Government of Navarra makes an assignment to the
Universities of that Foral Community to carry out this collaboration and that
students who voluntarily wanted to do so could be vaccinated on campus or

in some other educational center. The news was published in the press.

       The document object of claim in which it was indicated that coercion was

       The work of the Universities was to facilitate the Department of Health of
Navarra, Osasunbidea, the lists of people who were going to receive the vaccine for
to be registered in health databases.

       If the student voluntarily wanted to fill out the vaccination form,

was fully informed about the processing of these data, adding the
legitimizing basis for it: the legal obligation to take care of the health of the students who
is included in article 7.1.n) of Royal Decree 1791/2010 (vaccination is a
further section of the Covid-19 Contingency Plan for the 2021-2022 Academic Year, prepared
by the Joint Occupational Risk Prevention Service of the University
of Navarra), as well as the free consent of students who wanted to be vaccinated

in the places designated for this purpose by the University.
