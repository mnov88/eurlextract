## English Summary

### Facts

On 9 July 2019, a citizen filed a complaint with the AEPD because he continued to receive emails from Vodafone regarding payments despite the existence of an Arbitration Award prohibiting him from continuing with these communications.

On April 2, 2018, the Galician Institute of Consumer Affairs issued an Arbitration Award stating that Vodafone must stop issuing invoices and that the complainant had caused the definitive cancellation of any type of activated service and that Vodafone must eliminate the complainant's data from any type of database.

On 25 September 2019, the claimant once again sent a letter to the AEPD stating that Vodafone continued to violate its rights by failing to comply with the arbitration award and the order of execution of the arbitration award dated 25 March 2019, issued by the Court of First Instance No. 3 of Pontevedra.

On February 24, 2020, the respondent (Vodafone) stated that the measures set forth in the Arbitration Award were fully executed. Nevertheless, due to a computer error, they continued to send invoice notifications.

### Dispute

Is it a breach of Article 6 (1) GDPR to send out invoice mails when the obligation to cease this conduct has been laid down in an Arbitration Award?

### Holding

The AEDP considered that the documentation provides evidence that Vodafone infringed Article 6 (1) GDPR since it processed the complainant's personal data without having any legitimacy to do so.

Aggravating circumstances were taken into account when setting the amount of the penalty:

\-this is an unintentional but significant negligent action identified (Art. 83 (2) (b) GDPR).

\-basic personal affected (Art. 83 (2) (g) GDPR).

\-Actions previously committed, as this is not an isolated case as Vodafone had committed similar offences previously (Art. 83 (2) (e) GDPR)

\-The continuous nature of the infringement attributed to the defendant (Art. 76 (2) (k) LOPDGDD)

For all the circumstances described, the amount of the penalty was set at € 70000.

## Comment

Vodafone acknowledged the error and admitted that the reason for sending the emails was a computer error. However, it did not prove that it was entitled to process the complainant's data.

Vodafone acknowledged its responsibility (Art. 85 LPACAP) which resulted in a 20% reduction of the penalty. Furthermore, it carried out the voluntary payment of the proposed penalty before the resolution, so it favoured an additional reduction of 20%.

Therefore, favoured by the two 20% reductions, VODAFONE paid € 42000 instead of the initial € 70000 in the draft resolution.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                              I

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each

control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate

and to solve this procedure.

                                             II

        The defendant is charged with committing an infraction for violation of the
Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", which indicates in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

        "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
      personal for one or more specific purposes;

      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
      pre-contractual;

      (…) "

       The offense is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/12

       Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions

considered very serious ”provides:

      "1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
in particular, the following:

        (…)

        a) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
           conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
           Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                            III

      The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it processed the
Claimant's personal data without having any legitimacy to do so.

      The respondent has recognized this error and has indicated as the cause that motivated the
sending the emails the one of a computer error and therefore they continued
sending notifications of invoices available at zero cost between June 2017 and

September 2019.

      Well, it is especially important that the respondent continued to send invoices

to the claimant after the estimated arbitration award of April 2, 2018 and the Order of
enforcement of the Award of March 25, 2019, that is, the

personal data of the claimant and communications ceased once the
claimed received the transfer of the claim sent by this Agency on 29
August 2019, which contained the notification emails of new

invoice received by the claimant.

      In any case, and this is the essential thing, the defendant does not prove the legitimacy
for the treatment of the claimant's data.

                                            IV

        b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

        c) any measure taken by the controller or processor

        e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
        treatment;

         f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to
        remedy the violation and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the violation;

        g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

        h) the way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement,
        in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infraction and, in such
        case, to what extent;

        i) when the measures indicated in Article 58 (2) have been

        previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge
        in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/12

        j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or to mechanisms
        certification approved in accordance with Article 42, and

        k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the

        case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct
        or indirectly, through the infringement. " (The underlining is from the AEPD)

      In order to specify the amount of the penalty to be imposed on the one claimed by

violation of article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, it is essential to examine and assess whether
The circumstances described in article 83.2 of the RGPD concur and if they intervene
mitigating or aggravating the responsibility of the responsible entity.

      In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the fine to impose
in the present case, the claimed party is considered responsible for an infringement
typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, in an initial assessment, they are considered concurrent
the following factors.

      As aggravating factors the following:

        -In the present case we are facing an unintentional negligent action, but
        identified significant (article 83.2 b).

        -Basic personal identifiers are affected (name, a number of
        identification, the line identifier) (article 83.2 g).

         -Any offense previously committed (article 83.2 e).

         -Section k), in relation to article 76.2 of Organic Law 3/2018, in which

         the continued nature of the offense attributed to the
         claimed.

     That is why it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction to impose on the claimed and
set it at the amount of € 70,000 for the violation of article 6 of the RGPD.

        Therefore, based on the foregoing,
