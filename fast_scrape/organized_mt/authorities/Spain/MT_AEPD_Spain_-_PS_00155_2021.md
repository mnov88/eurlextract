        Procedural law of the Union or of the Member States. "

procedure, it is considered that it is appropriate to impute the defendant for the violation

of article 58.1 of the RGPD typified in article 83.5 e) of the RGPD. The sanction that
it would be appropriate to impose an administrative fine.

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate

established in article 83.2 of the RGPD, and with the provisions of article 76 of the

        of a company that is not newly created and should have
        procedures established for the fulfillment of the obligations that
        contemplates the data protection regulations, among them, to respond to

        the requirements of the supervisory authority.

        - Art. 83.2 k) RGPD: any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the

        circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits obtained or the
        losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement. The
        claim refers to the particular case of a person, but the

        data processing to which it refers, can potentially affect a
        very high number of clients of the responsible entity or users of the

        service provided by the responsible entity.
