## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen (the claimant) stating that the defendant has charged him five invoices of a third person, and that, despite the fact that he is not a client of the defendant and he has contacted the defendant to solve this situation, it did not offer any kind of solution.

### Dispute

The defendant answered the first requirements of the AEPD stating that (i) the claimant had been informed on the steps to follow in order to solve the situation, (ii) in the end, the invoices were not paid by the claimant, and (iii) that the banking information on the invoices was provided by a bank, so there was no breach of the lawfulness principle. The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that the defendant has infringed the lawfulness principle included at Article 6 GDPR, as it did not have the corresponding legal basis to process the personal data of the claimant when it charged him five invoices. Consequently, after considering some circumstances \[(i) there is a wilful misconduct by the defendant, (ii) basic personal data have been affected, (iii) the duration of the infraction by the defendant, and (iv) the evident connection between the main activity of the defendant ant the processing of personal data\], the AEPD decided to impose a fine of € 75000 to the defendant.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                             I

       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each

control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve
this procedure.

                                            II

       The defendant is accused of committing an offense for violation of the
Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", which indicates in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

        "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met

terms:
      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
      personal for one or more specific purposes;

      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
      pre-contractual;

      (…) "

       The offense is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance

with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

       Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious ”provides:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/7

      "1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in

in particular, the following:

        (…)
       b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
       conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
       Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                            III

      The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it processed personal data

of the claimant without standing.

    Well, with respect to the facts that are the subject of this claim,
We must emphasize that the claimed has answered but the content of the same has not
it follows that they had responded to the claimant with a reliable explanation
of the reasons why invoices were charged to your account that you do not recognize. From

here that does not provide any evidence that would allow estimating that the treatment of
Claimant's data had been legitimate.

       The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the
Obligations imposed by the regulations for the protection of personal data

It is thus obvious. A diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the treatment
of third-party data requires that the person responsible for the treatment is in conditions
to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).

                                            IV

        k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
        case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct
        or indirectly, through the infringement. "

        Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76,
        "Sanctions and corrective measures", provides:

        "2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

      In accordance with the transcribed precepts, in order to set the amount of the

      sanction of a fine to be imposed in the present case for the offense typified in the

       claimed (article 83.2. a) of the RGPD).
