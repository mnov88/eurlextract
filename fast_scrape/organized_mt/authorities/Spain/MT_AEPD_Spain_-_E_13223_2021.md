## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against the Local Police of the Municipal Council of La Puebla del Río, Seville after a police officer took a photograph of their ID with a cell phone. The data subject claimed that the device was privately owned by the police officer.

The context involved restrictive measures due to the Covid 19 pandemic, and the City of La Puebla del Río had its perimeter closed, with entry and exit controls for vehicles. The police officers managed to identify that the data subject was from a different location, and their ID was required and photographed, based on public safety regulatory legislation. The device was actually owned by the police unit, and was not the private property of the agent. Upon completion of police registration procedure, the photograph was removed from the device.

The purpose of taking the photograph was to obtain an image of the ID without physically handling it, and carry out the necessary checks in accordance with Article 16 of the Spanish Citizen Safety Law (_[Ley Orgánica 4/2015, de 30 de marzo, de protección de la seguridad ciudadana](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-3442)_) to comply with specific health and security measures in the context of the pandemic.

### Holding

The AEPD held that as long as data protection principles in the GDPR and the Spanish Data Protection Act (_[Ley Orgánica 3/2018 Ley Orgánica 3/2018 de Protección de Datos Personales y Garantía de los Derechos Digitales - LOPDGDD](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673)_) were observed, state security bodies could process data to achieve their inherent objectives, including prevention, investigation, detection or repression of criminal offenses. The AEPD concluded that in this case, given the exceptional context related to the pandemic, a police agent's use of a cell phone which is owned by the police unit to photograph ID documents complied with the security measures established in [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"), and therefore dismissed the case.

maintenance and, where appropriate, the restoration of citizen tranquility in
assumptions of public insecurity, regulating with precision the budgets, the

for the sanction of penal and administrative infractions, the agents of the Forces
and Security Bodies may require the identification of the persons in the

carried out respecting at all times, what is established in the regulations in force in

identification, by the agents of the Local Police, must be carried out with

necessary verifications in the identification, the images taken with the mobile
