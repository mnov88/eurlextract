## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Civil Guard local office (the claimant) stating that the data controller had sent a Whatsapp message to a third party including personal data (name, surname, ID number) of three people (a mother and her children, probably underage) without their knowledge nor their consent. The complaint includes a copy of such message and a certification by the Civil Guard (although the mobile number of the sender is not identified).

The data controller did not answer to any AEPD investigation requests, so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Dispute

...

### Holding

The AEPD found that the data controller has infringed not only the integrity and confidentiality principle, but also the accountability principle of Article 5(2) GDPR and, after considering some aggravating circumstances \[(i) the data controller has performed a not intentional, but significantly negligent action; (ii) basic personal identification data have been affected (name, surname, domicile)\], it decided to impose a fine of 30,000 € to the data controller.

Article 6 (1) of the GDPR lays down the cases in which the processing of personal data may be considered lawful.
For its part, Article 5 of the GDPR provides that personal data shall be:
“(a) processed lawfully, fairly and transparently in respect of the data subject (“lawfulness, fairness and transparency”);
b)	collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);

c)	 adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (“data minimisation”);
d)	accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’);
e)	maintained in such a way as to permit identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods provided that they are processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, in accordance with Article 89(1), without prejudice to the application of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to protect the rights and freedoms of the data subject (‘storage limitation’);

Article 58 (2) GDPR reads: ‘Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following corrective powers:
(b) to sanction any controller or processor with a warning when the processing operations have infringed the provisions of this Regulation;
