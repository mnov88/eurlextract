The AEPD found that a data controller may not require from the data subject to collect the personal data requested himself or on his behalf if it can be sent with appropriate and adequate means instead. Indeed, the data controller was able to identify the data subject and to send the personal data via encrypted email. Therefore, it was not proportionate to answer that the right of access could be exercised only if the data subject has appointed someone to collect his personal data on his behalf instead of sending directly to him, under Articles 12 and 15 GDPR.

## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant requested his medical records containing personal data to the University Hospital Puerta de Hierro by e-mail. He asked them to send the documentation by post to his place of residence in Honduras and later, noticed that he wanted the document to be sent in Greece. The hospital answered it would have been impossible to send him the documentation requested to the alleged place of residence, namely in Greece, by post.

Nevertheless, they answered it was only possible that someone collect the documentation on the behalf of the data subject, as it was not possible to verify the data subject’s identity.

Following the data controller’s answer, the complainant filed a complaint with the AEPD, pursuant to Articles 56 and 57(1)(f) GDPR for obstructing his right of access.

### Dispute

Could the data controller require to the data subject to collect the personal data or to appoint someone to collect them on his behalf?

### Holding

The AEPD pointed out that the data controller could have been easily identified the data subject as he sent a photocopy of his identity card. It also noticed that the data controller could have use an encryption system and send the medical records by e-mail.

Therefore, the AEPD rejected the data controller’s argument and urged the data controller to comply with the data subject’s request within the ten workings following days.

LEGAL GROUNDS

FIRST: The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to take a decision in accordance with the provisions of Article 56(2) in conjunction with Article 57(1)(f) both of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (hereinafter referred to as 'RGPD'); anddin Article 47 of the Organic Law 3/2018 of December 5,,onnPersonal Data Protection anddGuarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter referred too as LOPDGDD).

Once this period has elapsed, the interested party may consider his claim to have been accepted".

THIRD: Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, General Data Protection (GDPS), provides that:
"The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide the data subject with any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and any communication pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to the processing, in a clear, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using plain language, in particular any information specifically addressed to a child.

In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), the controller shall not refuse to act on the request of the data subject for the purpose of exercising his/her rights pursuant to Articles 15 to 22, unless he/she can prove that he/she is not able to identify the data subject.
3. The controller shall provide the data subject with information concerning his or her actions on the basis of a request pursuant to Articles 15 to 22, and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. The period may be extended by two months if necessary, taking into account the complexity and the number of applications. The person responsible shall inform the applicant of any such extension within one month of receipt of the application, stating the reasons for the delay.  Where the data subject submits the request by electronic means, the information shall be provided by electronic means where possible, unless the data subject requests otherwise.
4. If the data controller does not comply with the request of the data subject, he shall inform the data subject without delay, and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request, of the reasons for his failure to act and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and of taking legal action.
5. The information provided under Articles 13 and 14 as well as any communication and any action taken under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 shall be free of charge. (a) charge a reasonable fee related to the administrative costs incurred in providing the information or communication or in performing the requested action; or
6. Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubt as to the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, he or she may request that the controller provide such further information as is necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.
7.

FOURTH: Article 15 of the RGPD provides that:
“1.   The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the data controllerconfirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him are being processed and, if so, the right of access to the personal data and to the following information:(c) the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations(e) the existence of the right to request from the controller the rectification or erasure of personal data or the limitation of the processing of personal data relating to the data subject or to object to such processing (h) the existence of automated decisions, including profiling, as referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in such cases, significant information on the logic applied and the relevance and foreseeable consequences of such processing for the data subject.
2. Where personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 concerning the transfer.
3. The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data being processed. The controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs for any other copies requested by the data subject. Where the request is made by the data subject by electronic means, and unless the data subject requests otherwise, the information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic format.
4.   The right to obtain a copy referred to in paragraph 3 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

FIFTH: Article 13 of the LOPDGDD determines the following:
"The data subject's right of access shall be exercised in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.Where the controller processes a large amount of data relating to the data subject and the controller exercises his right of access without specifying whether it relates to all or part of the data, the controller may, before providing the information, ask the data subject to specify the data or processing activities to which the request relates.2The right of access shall be deemed to be granted if the controller provides the data subject with a system of remote, direct and secure access to the personal data which guarantees, on a permanent basis, access to all the data. To this end, the communication by the controller to the data subject of the way in which he may access the system shall be sufficient to satisfy the request to exercise the right. However, the data subject may request from the controller information on the points set out in Article 15(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that is not included in the remote access system.3. For the purposes set out in Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the exercise of the right of access may be considered to be repetitive on more than one occasion during the six-month period, unless there is a legitimate reason to do so.4 Where the person concerned chooses a means other than that offered to him/her which entails disproportionate costs, the application shall be considered excessive and the person concerned shall bear the additional costs involved. In this case, only the satisfaction of the right of access to undue syndication shall be demanded of the data controller.

SIXTH: Before going into the substance of the questions raised, it should be noted that the present procedure is being conducted as a result of the refusal of any of the rights regulated by data protection legislation (access, rectification, deletion, limitation, portability and opposition) and aims to ensure that the corresponding measures are adopted so that the guarantees and rights of the affected party are duly restored. Therefore, in the present case, only those issues raised by the claimant that are included within the object of the aforementioned data protection claims procedure will be analysed and assessed.
The complainant requested access to his medical file by e-mail and, although in principle he requests that it be sent by post to Honduras, he later provides another address, this time in Greece. The complainant claims that he cannot send such documentation by mail abroad.
It should be pointed out that the complainant requested access by e-mail by sending a photocopy of his identity card, so he is perfectly identified and there is no doubt that the complainant can prove his identity.
In addition to offering him the option of having a third party collect the documentation on his behalf, the claimant could have considered sending him the documentation by e-mail and using an encryption system to safeguard the content.
What is not contemplated in the data protection regulations is not to attend to the right due to problems that may have a solution. In fact, this Agency is communicating with the complainant through the Notific@ electronic system, which shows the diversity of systems that can be used to exchange information.
In view of the above and other generally applicable provisions, the director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency
