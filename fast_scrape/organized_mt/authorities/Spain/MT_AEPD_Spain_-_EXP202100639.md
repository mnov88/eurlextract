## English Summary

### Facts

The Spanish police notified the Spanish DPA (AEPD) that a private individual had placed security cameras facing public and private spaces in the surroundings of their property. The police report stated that they had warned the individual that the cameras should not be pointed in the direction of areas beyond their property, and that there was no sign posted with adequate information related to the functioning of these video cameras.

Despite the police’s warnings, the individual refused to redirect the cameras, or to place the appropriate sign with information required under GDPR. The AEPD therefore initiated proceedings in order to investigate the issue, and bring the individual into compliance with their obligations related to the use of security cameras under GDPR. The individual did not submit any allegations or proof to contradict the police report, and also ignored the AEPD’s request for information related to their compliance with GDPR on this matter.

### Holding

The AEPD held that according to Article 22 of the Spanish Data Protection Act (Ley Orgánica de Protección de Datos Personales y Garantía de los Derechos Digitales – LOPDGDD), security cameras can be installed in order to preserve the safety of persons and property, as well as the security of premises, but that recording of public streets is only permitted to the extent that it is essential for these purposes. Additionally, the AEPD held that any recording of private premises cannot take place without consent.

Morever, the AEPD held that when installing video cameras, the information requirements under [Articles 12](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") and [13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") must be fulfilled by placing a sign in a sufficiently visible place which announces that the video processing of personal data is taking place, the identity of the data controller, and the possibility for data subjects to exercise the rights provided for in [Articles 15](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") to [22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR").

Since the individual did not submit any defense in order to justify why the cameras were pointed towards the street and adjacent private areas, the AEPD issued a fine of €1500 against the individual (€1000 for a violation of the data minimisation principle under [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"), and €500 for a violation of the information requirements under [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR")). Additionally, the AEPD ordered the individual to either take down the cameras, or to redirect them facing his property and place a sign containing the aforementioned information requirements.

                                            III

In accordance with the foregoing, the processing of images through a system
of video surveillance, to be in accordance with current regulations, must comply with the

following requirements:

    - Respect the principle of proportionality.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 5/11

    - When the system is connected to an alarm center, you can only
       be installed by a private security company that meets the requirements
       contemplated in article 5 of Law 5/2014 on Private Security, of 4
       april.

    - The video cameras will not be able to capture images of the people who
       are outside the private space where the security system is installed.
       video surveillance, since the processing of images in public places only
       can be carried out, unless there is government authorization, by the
       Security Forces and Bodies. They cannot be captured or recorded
       spaces owned by third parties without the consent of their owners, or, in their

       case, of the people who are in them.

       This rule admits some exceptions since, on some occasions, for the
       protection of private spaces, where cameras have been installed in
       facades or inside, it may be necessary to guarantee the purpose of

       security recording a portion of the public highway. That is, the cameras
       and video cameras installed for security purposes will not be able to obtain images
       of public roads unless it is essential for that purpose, or it is
       impossible to avoid due to their location and extraordinarily
       The minimum space for said purpose will also be collected. Therefore, the
       cameras could exceptionally capture the minimally necessary portion

       for its intended security purpose.

    - The duty to inform those affected provided for in articles
       12 and 13 of the RGPD and 22.4 of the LOPDGDD.

    - The person in charge must keep a record of treatment activities

       carried out under their responsibility, including the information to which
       refers to article 30.1 of the RGPD.

    - The installed cameras cannot obtain images of private spaces.
       third party and/or public space without duly accredited justified cause, or
       may affect the privacy of passers-by who move freely through the

       zone. It is not allowed, therefore, the placement of cameras towards the
       private property of neighbors with the purpose of intimidating them or affecting their
       private sphere without just cause.

    - In no case will the use of surveillance practices be admitted beyond the
       environment object of the installations and in particular, not being able to affect the

       surrounding public spaces, adjoining buildings and vehicles other than those

In relation to the foregoing, to facilitate the consultation of interested parties, the Agency
Spanish Data Protection offers through its website

\[https://www.aepd.es\] access to data protection legislation

through specific questions, it allows to assess the situation of the person in charge
regarding the processing of personal data that it carries out and, where appropriate, generate
various documents, informative and contractual clauses, as well as an annex with
indicative security measures considered minimal.

                                          IV

In the present case, the respondent has not presented arguments or evidence that

contradict the facts denounced within the period given for it.

In accordance with the evidence available and which has not been
distorted during the sanctioning procedure, the defendant has installed two
video surveillance cameras on the facade of the building where your home is located, located

in \*\*\*ADDRESS.1, \*\*\*LOCATION.1, capturing images of both transit areas
public and private. In addition, it lacks an information sign for a video-monitored area.

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;

b) The rights of the interested parties according to articles 12 to 22;

established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;

b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;

(…)

or the power to order the person in charge or in charge of the treatment that the
treatment operations comply with the provisions of the RGPD, where appropriate,

in a certain way and within a specified period (art. 58.2 d)).

According to the provisions of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the measure provided for in article 58.2
d) of the aforementioned Regulation is compatible with the sanction consisting of a fine
administrative.

In this case, based on the facts set forth, it is considered that the sanction
that should be imposed is an administrative fine for each of the
offenses committed. The fine imposed must be, in each individual case,
effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with article 83.1 of the RGPD. finally
determining the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of the

article 83.2 of the RGPD, which indicates:

"two. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each
individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine

administration and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:

a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well
such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that
have suffered;

b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 9/11

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, in order to set the amount of the sanction of
fine to be imposed in the present case for the infractions typified in article 83.5
a) and b) of the RGPD, it is appropriate to grade them according to the following aggravating factors:

    - The nature of the offence. The claimed by having a system of
        video surveillance that is oriented to public roads and private areas without cause
        justified, as well as the absence of an informative poster, produces damages and
        damages to all affected stakeholders who do not know who is the
        responsible for the treatment and to whom they must be addressed in order to exercise the

        rights recognized in the RGPD (art. 83.2 a) RGPD).

    - The intention or negligence in the infringement. With the system
        video surveillance carries out excessive control of the area without any justified cause,
        highlighting the poor orientation of the device (art. 83.2 b) RGPD).

    - The degree of cooperation with this Agency in order to remedy the
        infringement. After having made a transfer to the claimed party for the purpose of being able to
        answer and, where appropriate, take measures to avoid the infringement, the AEPD has not
        received any response. No response has been received either.
        Once the opening agreement has been notified (art. 83.2 f) RGPD).

    - The way in which the control authority became aware of the infraction. The
        The way in which this Agency has become aware has been through the
        remission of the notification Act of the CIVIL GUARD - POSITION OF
        \*\*\* LOCATION.1 (art. 83.2 h) RGPD).

    - The continuing nature of the offence. The respondent had already received with
        Prior to the claim notices by the claimant so that
        adopt the necessary measures in order to comply with the regulations of
        personal data protection. However, the respondent continues without putting

        the informative poster and capturing images which supposes a treatment of
        data of identifiable natural persons (art. 76.2 a) LOPDGDD).

The balance of the circumstances contemplated, with respect to the infractions
committed by violating the provisions of articles 5.1 c) and 13 of the RGPD, allows setting
a fine of 1,000 euros (one thousand euros) and 500 euros (five hundred euros), respectively.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE A.A.A., with NIF \*\*\*NIF.1, for an infraction of article 5.1.c)
of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, a fine of €1,000 (one thousand euros).

SECOND: IMPOSE A.A.A., with NIF \*\*\*NIF.1, for an infraction of article 13

of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 b) of the RGPD, a fine of €500 (five hundred
euros).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 10/11

THIRD: ORDER A.A.A., with NIF \*\*\*NIF.1 that, by virtue of article 58.2 d)
of the RGPD, within ten business days, take the following measures:

    - Prove that you proceeded to remove the cameras from the current location, or to
        the reorientation of these towards their particular area.

    - Prove that you have proceeded to place the informative poster in the areas
        video-monitored (at least the existence of a treatment must be identified,
        the identity of the controller and the possibility of exercising the rights provided

        in said precepts), locating this device in a sufficiently
        visible.

    - Prove that you keep the information to which it refers available to those affected.
        refers to the aforementioned RGPD.

FOURTH: NOTIFY this resolution to A.A.A., with NIF \*\*\*NIF.1.

FIFTH: Warn the sanctioned party that he must enforce the sanctions imposed
Once this resolution is enforceable, in accordance with the provisions of
