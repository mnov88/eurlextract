## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject purchased property from Rodali Gestión Inmobiliaria (controller), a real estate agency. She signed a contract to make a reservation of the property. This document included her personal data. The contract neither included a clause nor was the data subject otherwise informed on how her personal data would be processed. When the data subject discovered this, she filed a complaint with the DPA.

The DPA tried to notify the controller about both the complaint and the start of a sanctioning procedure for the alleged infringement of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"), but was unsuccesful. The notifications were repeatedly rejected and returned.

### Holding

The DPA noted that when a controller obtains personal data, it must provide the data subject with all information regarding their processing activities pursuant to [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). In the present case, the controller omitted this obligation. The DPA therefore held that the controller violated [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") by neither informing the data subject nor including any clause about the processing of personal data in the contract.

The DPA found that since the main activity of the controller was direcltly linked to the processing of personal data, the controller was required to have a higher level of rigorousness, professionalism and, consequently, responsibility regarding the processing.

Because of this aggravating circumstance, the DPA imposed a fine of €5.000. The DPA further ordered the controller to bring its operations into compliance with [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") and thus making sure to inform its clients about the processing of their data.

       of personal data:

Recital 61) of the RGPD establishes that:

       “Interested parties must be provided with information on the treatment of their

       personal data at the time it is obtained from them or, if obtained
       from another source, within a reasonable time, depending on the circumstances of the

       representative; b) the contact details of the data protection officer,

       in your case; c) the purposes of the treatment to which the personal data is destined
       and the legal basis of the treatment; d) when the treatment is based on the
       article 6, paragraph 1, letter f), the legitimate interests of the person in charge or of a
       third; e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the data
       personal, if any; f) if applicable, the intention of the controller to transfer
       personal data to a third country or international organization and the existence or

       absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or, in the case of
       transfers indicated in articles 46 or 47 or article 49, paragraph 1,
       second paragraph, reference to the adequate or appropriate guarantees and the
       means to obtain a copy of them or to the fact that they have been loaned.

       2. In addition to the information mentioned in section 1, the person in charge of the
       treatment will facilitate the interested party, at the moment in which the
       personal data, the following information necessary to guarantee a
       fair and transparent data processing: a) the period during which the
       will keep the personal data or, when it is not possible, the criteria
       used to determine this term; b) the existence of the right to request the

       data controller access to personal data relating to the
       interested, and its rectification or deletion, or the limitation of its treatment, or to
       oppose the treatment, as well as the right to data portability; c)
       when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter a), or the
       Article 9, paragraph 2, letter a), the existence of the right to withdraw the

       consent at any time, without affecting the legality of the
       treatment based on consent prior to its withdrawal; d) the right to
       file a claim with a control authority; e) if the communication
       of personal data is a legal or contractual requirement, or a requirement

       personal data and is informed of the possible consequences of
       not provide such data; f) the existence of automated decisions, including the
       profiling, referred to in article 22, sections 1 and 4, and, when
       least in such cases, meaningful information about the applied logic, as well
       as the significance and anticipated consequences of such processing for the
       interested".

Therefore, in the case at hand, the lack of information on the treatment of
personal data when obtaining the personal data of the clients supposes, for
part of the person in charge of the treatment, the violation of article 13 of the RGPD.

In this sense, article 72.1.h) of the LOPDGDD, considers it very serious, for
of prescription, “the omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the treatment
of your personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the RGPD”

This infraction may be sanctioned according to the provisions of article 83.5.b) of the

RGPD, where it is established that: “Infringements of the following provisions are
shall be sanctioned, in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines of 20,000,000
EUR maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4%
as a maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the financial year

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/7

above, opting for the highest amount: a) the rights of the interested parties to
tenor of articles 12 to 22”.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated, with respect to the infractions
committed, by violating the provisions of its article 13 of the RGPD, allows to set a
fine of 5,000 euros (five thousand euros).

In accordance with the precepts indicated, in order to set the amount of the penalty to
impose, it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction in accordance with the following

aggravating criteria established in article 76 of the LOPDGDD:

       personal data, (section b), considering the level of implementation of the

       reforms. financial broker. consultancy, administration, services to
       companies, appraisal and appraisal, all these services related to property
       real estate. This circumstance determines a higher degree of demand and
       professionalism and, consequently, the responsibility of the entity in

       relation to the processing of personal data.

IV.- Regarding the corrective measures to be implemented:

Article 58.2. of the RGPD, establishes, on the corrective powers that each

control authority may require the offender, among whom is, in his
section d): "(...) order the person responsible or in charge of processing that the
processing operations comply with the provisions of this Regulation,
when appropriate, in a certain way and within a specified period”.

Therefore, it is appropriate to impose, in accordance with the provisions of the cited article, the
following corrective action:

    - Implement a mechanism in the management of the services performed by the
