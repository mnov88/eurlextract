## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of an investigation procedure started by the AEPD against the defendant due to a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that he/she had requested his/her right to be forgotten in relation to nine (9) URLs, but this right was not approved by the defendant.

### Dispute

The defendant answered to the AEPD investigation requests stating that one (1) of the URLs had been duly erased, and during this procedure, another two (2) URLs were also erased, but it declared that the other six (6) had not been approved as they were referring to the professional life of the Spanish citizen, and not to his/her personal life. The defendant also added that such not-erased-information was related to the activity of the claimant as candidate for different public jobs, so erasing it would not be compliant with the legitimate public interests.

### Holding

After obtaining the corresponding evidences, the AEPD understood that, as long as the not-erased-URLs are related to professional and not personal information of the claimant (and that CJEU judgement 13/05/14 clarified that the right to be forgotten can be declined due to the role of the claimant in the public life), they are excluded from the data protection regulation as per Articles 1 and 2 of the GPDR. In this sense, the AEPD decided to dismiss the claim from the Spanish citizen.
