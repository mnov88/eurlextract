## English Summary

### Facts

In 2017, the Municipality of Ibiza (the data controller) started a sanctioning procedure against the data subject due to an unauthorized construction. After demolishing the construction, the data subject requested the end of the procedure and filed a application for a license. Not satisfied, the data subject decided to report some neighbours who were also carrying out irregular constructions.

Based on this report, the controller opened investigations. Subsequently, it informed the neighbors of the investigation and disclosed the identity of the complainant. The data data subject made an access request to the controller and required it to delete all their personal data, including their name from all the complaints. However, the controller did not respond.

The data subject filed a complaint with the DPA alleging that the controller illegally disclosed their personal data to the neighbors. According to the data subject, these neighbors were threatening them because of the complaint. In addition, the data subject informed that their requests for access and deletion of personal data were not answered.

In defense, the controller argued that it was necessary to inform the neighbors about the investigations and attributed the lack of response to changes in its staff.

### Holding

The DPA held that the sharing of personal data with third parties was not necessary for the purposes of following the investigation of irregular construction since the investigated persons could have been notified without being provided with information about the complainant.

In addition, the DPA highlighted that the failure to respond to the data subject's requests was illegal. Thus, the DPA found a violation of [Articles 12](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") and [5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"), issuing a reprimand to the controller and ordering it to respond to the data subject's requests.

Regulation;", you are urged to prove the content of the right of deletion that has been

NINTH: On 01/04/2023, the following allegations are received:

-They understand that the violation of article 12 of the GDPR, would be of 83.5.b) of the GDPR, not
of letter a) of the same article 83.5 that is dragging on the file.

The conduct that typifies said infraction does not occur, because it is not explained clearly.

exercise of the established rights, Explains the literal meaning that the RAE gives to each
one of the words, and it may be considered in any case that said word must be completed

claimant exercised the right and the defendant did not put up an obstacle to said exercise.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/19

-He considers that only a single right of deletion has been exercised (08/22/2019) and a
only right of access (\*\*\*DATE.1), which are both answered on 02/18/2022, both

in writing and by phone. In the configuration of the consideration of the facts
as a violation of article 12 of the GDPR, it cannot be treated as a reiteration of the

that he had requested the right of deletion and had not been answered, since this has to be
considered as a new request, in this case, for access. In any case, it cannot be

The aforementioned non-motivation would give rise to its classification as mild in article 74.c of the
LOPDGDD.

Counting from the date on which the deletion could be considered as not addressed,
09/22/2019, more than a year has passed from the period that would entail its qualification as

mild, so it must be considered prescribed. It shows that the same is true of
regarding the right of access, prescribed on 01/17/2022.

-Regarding the infringement of article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, the provision of the
The identity of the complainant is in accordance with Article 62 of the LPCAP, since complaints must be

preferential application of the LPCAP and transparency legislation. Article 53 LPACP
prevails over data protection regulations.” The defendant has the right to
access to the file and obtain a copy of it.

The AEPD affirms that "the interference in the data of the claimant, because it is not precise,
necessary, adequate or proportional, must not be made known in the procedure that
start the administration of the defendant", but the City Council cannot be required to
eliminate said information as it would imply the non-satisfaction of a right to

provided in writing or by other means, including, if applicable, by electronic means.
When requested by the interested party, the information may be provided orally provided that
the identity of the interested party is proven by other means.

2. The data controller will facilitate the interested party to exercise their rights in
virtue of articles 15 to 22…

3. The person responsible for the treatment will provide the interested party with information regarding their
proceedings on the basis of a request under articles 15 to 22, without delay

improper and, in any case, within a period of one month from receipt of the
application…"

4. If the person in charge of the treatment does not process the request of the interested party, he will inform him
without delay, and no later than one month after receipt of the request, of the ra-
reasons for their failure to act and the possibility of filing a claim before an auto-
control and exercise judicial actions.

Regarding the lack of attention to the right of deletion requested on 08/22/2019, the article
17 of the GDPR indicates:

"1. The interested party shall have the right to obtain without undue delay from the person responsible for the

treatment the deletion of personal data that concerns you, which will be
obliged to delete personal data without undue delay when any of the
the following circumstances..."

The claimant in her request for deletion makes it based on the same facts that
explained in this claim. It is about the appearance of your data in files with your

data as a complainant, clarifying that she did not file any complaint. The
claimant indicates that he is making known some facts. It is also observed that the
competent authority through its employees, visited the address that
The claimant provided in its brief of X/XX/2016 to verify the legality of the
buildings.

One of the points that favors deletion is that of point d of the aforementioned article 17:

“d) the personal data have been processed unlawfully;” although it is also stated that

"3. Sections 1 and 2 will not apply when the treatment is necessary:

 a) to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information;

b) for compliance with a legal obligation that requires data processing
imposed by the law of the Union or of the Member States that applies to the

responsible for the treatment, or for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the person responsible;

c) for reasons of public interest in the field of public health in accordance with the
Article 9, paragraph 2, letters h) and i), and paragraph 3;

  d) for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
statistical purposes, in accordance with Article 89(1), to the extent that the
right indicated in paragraph 1 could make impossible or seriously impede the
achievement of the objectives of such processing, or

  e) for the formulation, exercise or defense of claims.”

In accordance with the ruling of the National Court, contentious court
administrative section 1, resource 165/2005 of 12/14/2006 "Regulates art. 15 of the LO
15/1999 the right called habeas data or habeas scriptum which consists of the fact that the
affected may require the person responsible for the file to make a service consisting of

the mere display of your data and, where appropriate, its rectification or cancellation. Is about
an essential right in the matter that is included in art.8.b) and c) of the
Convention 108 of the Council of Europe and 12 and 13 of Directive 95/46/CE”" For the rest,
It is indisputable that the right of access constitutes the essential core of the regulated law
in art.18.4 of the Constitution -STC 292/2000”

The defendant did not process in any way the claimant's exercise of rights, nor
when the suppression first entered, on 08/22/2019 (the resolution in which
their data appear in one of the denounced was from XX/XX/2019), nor when in the letter
subsequent request for documentation and access, \*\*\* DATE.1 also made
reference and recalled in numerous details the one he had presented earlier, noting
including the date of the aforementioned deletion, without obtaining his attention in any of them.

Presumably, given the omission in the response provided and not being taken into
account of the deletion, your data could have continued to be provided in other
files of other defendants. This could be deduced from the statement made by
about what:

"Taking into account that the administrative files have concluded, the City Council,
complementing the answer given on 02/18/2022, has given instructions for the
deletion of the data of the complainant from the administrative files in which
for the record A letter will be provided confirming this point.”

On the other hand, for the first petition, the defendant indicates that "they began to carry out

actions to respond to his request, but no written response was received in
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/19

term and form, due to a human error derived from the month in which we were
(August) and the change of staff due to the summer holidays. “

Regarding her exercise of access, presented on \*\*\*DATE.1, the defendant states

that "the person responsible for the file was transferred, and due to internal ignorance, no
response to the applicant.

Both reasons do not agree with the content of this right, which in this case implies
a non-response in either of them, which implies a refusal to facilitate the

requested information, resulting in the fact that it does not seem possible to be a major impediment other than the
absolute disregard for the exercise of rights, in such a way that said right becomes
useless or completely ineffective.

Understands the defendant, who has given effect to it on 02/18/2022, by telephone and in a
writing stating:

"Once the information is sent to you, in accordance with the right of access formulated by
you, the requested data deletion exercise will be carried out in accordance with the
current legislation of Public Administrations.", without the wording being
fortunate, since the exercise of the right corresponds to the claimant, and without having

any accredited writing of attention in any sense of said right, consigning in
their allegations that "Taking into account that the administrative files have
completed, the City Council, complementing the response given on 02/18/2022, has given
instructions for the deletion of the data of the complainant from the files
administrative documents in which it is recorded. A written document will be provided confirming this point.", and

In addition, both the claimant and this AEPD are unaware of the number of files
in which your data was included and if the complete copy of your writ of
X/XX/2016, which was one of the key points of his access exercise.

"The interested party shall have the right to obtain from the data controller confirmation of
whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed and, in such a case, the right to
access to personal data and the following information:”, article 15.1 of the GDPR.

Regarding telephone information, based on the principle of meeting the requirement of
proactive responsibility established in article 5.2 of the GDPR, is not guaranteed
nor that it had been produced, nor of the same content, considering in this case that it
satisfies the right.

Summarizing, the fact is that it was not answered, which implies a refusal to facilitate the

information requested within the established period and manner. However, this absolute
inattention has made law illusory, in which the completion of the
response, waiting for the moment in which it has been considered that the
files, The defendant has stated that it was going to proceed with the suppression of the
data, although the terms in which they have been carried out, the scope and the

how you have deleted the data. Regarding the exercise of the right of access,
nor is the response contemplated as to whether their data appeared in other files.

This supposes the commission of the infringement of article 12 of the GDPR that is attributed to the
claimed.

                                           II

The defendant considered the claimant as a complainant in the X/XX/2016 form
and yielded such data, in the record of his name and surname at the beginning of

procedures to third parties. With the mention of (...) that the houses to which he referred
on the aforementioned form, it could have been identified without great difficulty.

 The LPACAP, states in its article 62, "Initiation of the complaint procedure":

1. A complaint is understood to be the act by which any person, in compliance or not
of a legal obligation, notifies an administrative body of the existence
of a certain fact that could justify the ex officio initiation of a procedure
administrative.

2. The complaints must express the identity of the person or persons presenting them.
so and the account of the facts that are brought to the attention of the Administration. When
said facts could constitute an administrative infraction, they will collect the date of their
commission and, when possible, the identification of the alleged perpetrators.

\[…\]”

"5. The presentation of a complaint does not confer, by itself, the condition of interested party
in the procedure."

And in article 13: "Rights of individuals in their relations with
Public administrations:

Those who, in accordance with article 3, have the capacity to act before the

Public Administrations, are holders, in their relations with them, of the following
rights:

h) To the protection of personal data, and in particular to the security and
confidentiality of the data contained in the files, systems and applications of the
Public administrations."

Article 4 of the LPCAP attributes the status of interested party in a procedure
administrative to:

“a) Those who promote it as holders of rights or legitimate individual interests or
collective.

b) Those who, without having initiated the procedure, have rights that may be
affected by the decision adopted therein.

c) Those whose legitimate interests, individual or collective, may be affected
by the resolution and appear in the procedure as long as no resolution has been handed down
definitive.”

Seen from the perspective of the defendant, as an interested party (art 64.1 LPCAP), affected
directly because a sanctioning procedure in urban matters is initiated,
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/19

Article 53.1 of the LPCAP, grants the right to "access and obtain a copy of the
documents contained in the aforementioned procedures”. Obviously, this aspect is
different from the content of the resolutions and agreements that are notified, which is the case

which is dealt with here. Access to a copy of the documents in the file should be to the
essential data, not giving access to data not necessary for the exercise of the
right of defense or that have nothing to do with the matter, which must, if applicable,
remain anonymous. As an example, give in the copy of the file the data of the NIF or
of the address could constitute data processing that, depending on the circumstances, could
not be necessary for this purpose.

However, what is being analyzed here is that the data of the name and surname in the agreement
that the claimant provided as proof of access to her data, violates article 5.1.c
of the GDPR, which indicates:

1. Personal data will be:

c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
are processed ("data minimization");

The claimant informs the City Council of some facts, so that the
verify, circumstance that it performs, in some addresses of (...). irregularities
urban planning evidenced by the claimant, were thus verified by the
inspection authority with competences in the matter, who enjoy the status of

agent of the authority, in order to attest to the facts as thus formalized in
the aforementioned agreement to start the procedure.

The issue could affect the defendants who are mentioned in the agreements

identity of the complainant. In at least one of the cases it was found that
the claimant was referred to.

Although from the partial copy of the resolution of a defendant provided by the claimant, it is

confirms that only his name and first surname were listed, it is enough to be
identified, especially when the (...) and the claimant alludes to the fact that they are part of her
"colla" "group".

The mention of your data proceeding to your identification or being identifiable, puts
evidence of the conflict between the claimant's right to privacy and
preservation and reserve of knowledge of your data, against the right of the accused to
that in the agreement to initiate a disciplinary procedure, it relates

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 15/19

the specific origin of the claimant's identification data,
with the category of complainant.

There is no question in an initiation agreement of disclosing or not to the person denounced the

identity of the complainant, but if in accordance with the purpose of the agreement
communication and the rights at stake, if such is necessary, proportional and appropriate.
communication with such content.

Considering that the status of complainant does not attribute per se the quality of interested party.
In this case, given that the purpose of disclosing the facts was the
protection of urban legality and its eventual restoration to a previous situation,
situation in which the claimant was not involved. Taking into account that the
urban planning authority verified the facts and initiated the disciplinary procedure ex officio

(Article 63.1 LPCAP: ”The procedures of a sanctioning nature will begin
always ex officio by agreement of the competent body"). It is considered that giving
Knowing the identity data of the person claiming may cause damage
As in this case, it is not estimated that the data that the defendant had collected and that
were brought to the attention of at least one denounced person, were the appropriate ones,
relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purpose for which the processing is carried out

of data. Its incorporation in cases like this, can give rise to the same or
similar effects on the people who make known facts such as those
here are analyzed that may give rise to disciplinary proceedings.

Add the claimed, which complied with the provisions of the LPCAP, but, among the content
of the agreement to start the disciplinary procedure of the LPCAP, article 64, does not appear to give
know the identity of the person complaining.

In a case like the one analyzed here, proof of identification of the person in the

agreement addressed to the sanctioned party, does not contribute anything substantial to it, nor does it imply a
loss of his right to defense, stating below that the facts were
verified by the urban authority. Lack of any effect for the defendant, which
prevents the data processing of the claimed party.

Although it is not possible to generalize, and must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the

circumstances, in this case, the reconciliation of the rights of the parties leads to
resolve that it was not appropriate, pertinent or necessary for said agreement to
contain the identification data of the claimant. This extreme can only be reached
analyzing the various elements that come together in the rights in dispute of the parties.
The consequence must be that the interference with the data of the claimant, which is

embodied in the record in an agreement to start a disciplinary file,
It can happen in environments where everyone knows each other, and it could also cause serious
risks for claimants and discourage this type of claim in addition to
may suffer other consequences. In this way, it is only estimated that the aforementioned
constancy would be precise if the knowledge of the identity were determinant in the
configuration of the facts or was related to them, affecting the rights to

exercise by the defendant, especially his right of defense. Not being the one
case, it is determined that the aforementioned article 5.1.c) is infringed)

                                            IV.

Violations of articles 12 and 5.1.c) of the GDPR are typified in article
83.5.a) of the GDPR, which indicates:

Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of
of a company, in an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the volume of

overall annual total business of the previous financial year, opting for the one with the highest
amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;

b) the rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22;”

The LOPDGDD also contemplates these infractions in terms of the term of their
prescription in the following articles:

71

"Infractions are the acts and conducts referred to in sections 4, 5 and
6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to
the present organic law.”

article 72

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

a) The processing of personal data in violation of the established principles and guarantees

in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

"k) The impediment or the obstruction or the reiterated non-attention of the exercise of the
rights established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

Regarding the allegation that the infringement typified in 72.1.k) of the LOPDGDD,
not having been motivated, should be classified as minor, for obeying article 74 c) of
the LOPDGDD that indicates: "Not responding to requests for the exercise of rights
established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, unless it is

application of the provisions of article 72.1.k) of this organic law.", it must be indicated that
it has been explained that it falls within a substantial non-compliance, total of two years
of law, and that when answered on 02/18/2022 it has not been fully provided, for
what is incardinated in this type the referred conduct.

Article 58.2 of the GDPR indicates as powers of the control authority:

exercise of the rights of the interested party under this Regulation;”

“i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or instead of the

measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each case
particular"

The claimed party has not explained how and when it proceeded to delete the data

scope of compliance of the exercise that was carried out.

It is also not known if your data was provided in the course of the proceedings.

The imposition of this measure is compatible with the sanction, according to the provisions of art.
83.2 of the GDPR.

Article 83.7 of the GDPR adds:

"Without prejudice to the corrective powers of the control authorities under the
Article 58(2), each Member State may lay down rules on whether
can, and to what extent, impose administrative fines on authorities and bodies
public establishments established in that Member State.”

The Spanish legal system has chosen not to penalize entities
public, as indicated in article 77.1. c) and 2. 4. 5. and 6. of the LOPDDGG:

"1. The regime established in this article will be applicable to the treatment of
who are responsible or in charge:

  "c) The General Administration of the State, the Administrations of the communities

autonomous entities and the entities that make up the Local Administration.”

  "2. When the managers or managers listed in section 1 commit
any of the offenses referred to in articles 72 to 74 of this organic law,
the competent data protection authority will issue a resolution
sanctioning them with warning. The resolution will also establish the

measures that should be adopted to cease the conduct or to correct the effects of the
offense that was committed.

  The resolution will be notified to the person in charge or in charge of the treatment, to the body of the

  3. Without prejudice to what is established in the previous section, the data protection authority

enough evidence for it. In this case, the procedure and the sanctions to be applied
will be those established in the legislation on the disciplinary or sanctioning regime that

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

be applicable.

  Likewise, when the infractions are attributable to authorities and executives, and
certify the existence of technical reports or recommendations for treatment that do not

have been duly attended to, in the resolution in which the sanction is imposed
a reprimand will be included with the name of the responsible position and the
publication in the corresponding Official State or regional Gazette.

  4. The data protection authority must be informed of the resolutions that
