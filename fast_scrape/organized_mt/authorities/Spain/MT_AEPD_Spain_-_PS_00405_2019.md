LEGAL FOUNDATIONS
I
By virtue of the powers conferred on each individual by Article 58(2) of the GPRS, the
supervisory authority, and as established in Articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to resolve this procedure.
II
Article 58 of the RGPD, "Powers", says:
"2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers
corrections indicated below:
(…)
(b) sanction any person responsible for or in charge of the processing with a warning
where processing operations have infringed the provisions of this
Regulations;
(...)
(d) instruct the controller or processor to ensure that the processing operations
treatment are in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable,
in a certain way and within a specified time frame.
(…)
(i) to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to or in place of
measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of the case
particular
(…)”
III
Article 5 of the RGPD deals with the principles that should govern the
processing of personal data and mentions among them that of "lawfulness, loyalty and
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es
4/12
transparency". The precept states:
"1. Personal data shall be:
(a) processed in a lawful, fair and transparent manner in connection with
interested (<<lawfulness, loyalty and transparency>>);"
Article 6 of the RGPD, "Lawfulness of processing", details in its paragraph 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:
"1. Processing shall be lawful only if at least one of the following conditions is met
conditions:
(a) the data subject has given his consent to the processing of his data
personal for one or more specific purposes;
(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
interested is a party to or for the application at his request of measures
pre-contractual;
(…)”
The infringement for which the claimed entity is held responsible is
Article 83 of the RGPD which, under the heading "General conditions for
the imposition of administrative fines," he says:
“5. Infringements of the following provisions shall be penalised, in accordance with
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 20 000 000 or,
in the case of a company, for an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of
total annual turnover for the previous financial year, opting for
the largest:
(a) The basic principles for treatment, including the conditions for
consent under Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9.
The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered to be very serious," he says:
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es
5/12
"1. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83(5) of the Rules of Procedure (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infringements that
constitute a substantial infringement of the articles mentioned in that
In particular, the following:
(…)
b) The processing of personal data without any
conditions for the lawfulness of processing laid down in Article 6 of
Regulation (EU)2016/679.
IV
The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
Article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it dealt with the
personal data of the claimant without her consent. The personal data of the
were incorporated into the company's information systems, without
has provided evidence that it had his consent to the collection and processing
of your personal data.
The Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the National Court, in cases
like the one here, has considered that when the data owner denies
the burden of proof is on the person claiming its existence
the data controller of third parties must collect and keep the
documentation necessary to prove the consent of the owner. We quote, for
All, SAN of 31/05/2006 (Rec. 539/2004), Fundamento de Derecho Cuarto.
The complainant's personal data were recorded in the files of the
claimed and were treated for the issuance of invoices for services associated with the
complainant. Consequently, it has carried out a processing of the data
personal without proof of consent
for treatment, not to mention legal authorization.
However, and this is the essential point, the claimed does not prove the legitimacy to
the processing of the claimant's data.
In short, the respondent has not provided any document or evidence
any evidence that the entity, in such a situation, would have deployed the
minimum diligence required to verify that your interlocutor was indeed the one

he claimed to hold.
Respect for the principle of legality which is at the heart of the fundamental right
of personal data protection requires proof that the
The controller took the necessary steps to prove that the
extreme. If this is not done - and if it is not demanded by this Agency, which is responsible for ensuring
for the compliance with the regulations of the data protection law of
personal nature - the result would be to empty the principle of legality of its content.
V

With respect to section 83.2 (k) of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, section 76,
"Sanctions and corrective measures," he says:
"In accordance with Article 83(2)(k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
may also be taken into account:
(a) the continuing nature of the infringement
(b) The link between the activity of the offender and the processing of data

g) To have, when it is not compulsory, a data protection delegate.
h) The submission by the person responsible or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, and without prejudice to what may result from the
proceedings, for the purpose of setting the amount of the fine to be imposed
in the present case, the party complained of is considered to be responsible for an infringement
