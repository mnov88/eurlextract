## English Summary

### Facts

BBVA sent the claimant's personal data to a collection agency. The claimant had no relationship with the debt, as he was no longer the administrator of the company for which the bank was claiming the debt. Even so, the claimant was receiving mail and calls from the company hired by BBVA to claim the debt.

BBVA failed to verify the accuracy of the data relating to the claimant and the debt incurred by the debtor company, and therefore the claimant could not request the deletion of his personal data held by BBVA.

### Dispute

Is the lack of diligence in checking for accuracy when processing personal data an infringement of Article 5(1)(d) GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD held that BBVA processed the complainant's personal data in infringement of the principle of accuracy.

The AEPD took into account, in determining the amount of a significantly serious infringement, the lack of diligence in the conduct of BBVA and the volume of business of the complainant, and the relationship of its habitual activity in the data processing.

BBVA made use of two reductions in the amount of a sanction: voluntary payment (20%) and acknowledgment of responsibility (20%). So they finally paid €36000 after the application of the reductions.

       electronic dated 09/28/2018. It informs you about your request for
       access, through six devices. Regarding the cancellation request

       the data that about you appear in our records, of which
       has left a literal copy in this writing, we inform you that after making the
       timely checks, we note that today it maintains positions

       current with the entity, so it is not possible to access your request, since
       the legal basis that obliges us to process your personal data is based on the

       contractual relationship in addition to compliance with the law. In order to perform the
       effective deletion of your personal data, no
       position or commercial relationship with our entity ”. (The underlining is from

claim made by the claimant.

B.- The claimant filed on 12/26/2018 an optional appeal for reconsideration against the
inadmissibility agreement for processing (RR / 0002/2019) in which it underlines that BBVA denied
the cancellation of your data for maintaining, supposedly, debtor positions in
quality of representative of POUSEN, S.L .; that he communicated to the claimed entity,
both before requesting the cancellation of your data and when requesting it, which does not have

no connection with POUSEN and that this company has another sole administrator.

BANCO BILBAO VIZCAYA ARGENTARIA, S.A. "

C.- Article 67 of the LOPDGDD, under the heading "Previous Actions of

investigation ”provides that before the adoption of the agreement to initiate
procedure and once the claim is admitted for processing, if any, the Agency
may carry out preliminary investigation actions. And he adds that section 2

more than twelve months from the date of the agreement for admission to processing… ”.

             Through Diligence dated 12/20/2019 of the data inspector,
incorporate into the file various screen captures related to the information that

appears in the Mercantile Registry regarding the company POUSEN, S.L. Through them
it is verified that, from the cessation of the claimant as sole Administrator of POUSEN,

S.L., and the appointment as Administrator of D. B.B.B., the company has not changed
their legal representatives.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                              I

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

                                             II

      Article 58 of the RGPD, "Powers", states:

      “2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers
corrective measures listed below:

      (…)

      c) order the data controller to respond to exercise requests
of the rights of the interested party under this Regulation;

       (…)

      i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition or instead
of the measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances of the
particular case

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/16

      (…) "

      The RGPD deals in article 5 with the principles that must govern the

treatment of personal data and mention among them the "accuracy"

      "1. The personal data will be:

      (…)

      d) exact, and if necessary updated; all measures will be taken
reasonable so that the personal data that

are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are treated <<inaccuracy>> ”

       Article 5.2. GDPR adds:

      "The person responsible for the treatment will be responsible for compliance with the
provided in section 1 and capable of demonstrating it (<< proactive responsibility >>) "

      The violation of article 5.1.d) of the RGPD is typified in article
83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in the following terms:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of maximum 20,000,000 Eur or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

      a) Basic principles for treatment, including basic conditions
for consent in accordance with articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; "

      For its part, the LOPDGDD, for prescription purposes, considers as
very serious infringement in article 72.1.a) "The processing of personal data
violating the principles and guarantees established in article 5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 ".

                                            III

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/16

      The documentation in the file certifies that BBVA processed the data

claims of the claimant violating the principle of accuracy.

      The treatment of the claimant's data associated with an inaccurate data -the

attribution of a debt to which he was alien- evidence of the text of the emails
emails that he sent on 05/25/2018 both to BBVA and to the person in charge of
treatment, Multigestión Iberia, S.L., and the latter on 05/26/2018.

      It also shows that BBVA processed data from the
complainant contrary to the principle of accuracy the response of that entity to the

informative request that the Agency made in the phase of admission for processing of the
claim. Thus, in writing that the
10/01/2018, BBVA informed the AEPD that, as a result of the claimant exercising the

right to cancel your personal data, with a precautionary nature, the
file with Multigestión Iberia, S.L.U., but the customer service
(SAC) of BBVA responded to the claimant in an email dated 09/28/2018 that no

could access the requested cancellation right “since it presented positions
active with the bank ”.

      The defendant adds that the claimant “was the sole partner and administrator of the
mercantile POUSEN, S.L., between 03/12/2009 and 12/02/2014 "and that" due to that
professional bond ”on 10/22/2012 contract number was signed

\*\*\* CONTRACT. 1 between POUSEN, S.L., in which the claimant stated as
representative of the company and his email address was collected. BBVA ends its

explanation saying that “contract number \*\*\* CONTRACT.1 maintains a debt
pending of XXX euros as can be seen in the screenshot of the systems
of the Bank that is contributed ”. The documents it provides in this regard are captures of

screen in which POUSEN, S.L. appears as a client, as the "owner" of the
account previously transcribed and the claimant as “representative”.

      Among the documents that BBVA sent to this Agency in the admission phase to
process, there is a report provided by AXESOR on 09/14/2018 which includes
with total clarity that on 12/02/2014 the termination of the business is already registered in the Mercantile Registry

claimant as sole administrator of POUSEN and has been designated as new
sole administrator to D. B.B.B.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/16

      Thus, contract number \*\*\* CONTRATO.1 was entered into by BBVA with a
legal person, the mercantile POUSEN, S.L., an extreme of which there is no doubt as it is

that company appears as the "owner" of the contract in BBVA's files. In
In the screenshots provided by BBVA, the claimant appears as
"Representative", given his condition of sole administrator of the company and of

in accordance with article 233.1 of the Consolidated Text of Law 1/2010 of Companies
of Capital.

      The attribution to the administrator of a capital company of a debt
contracted by the company it represents constitutes in itself an infringement
of the principle of accuracy. Even more serious is BBVA's conduct if it is taken into

Considering that since four years before the events occurred, the
claimant was no longer administrator of POUSEN, S.L., since he had ceased in that

charge by social resolution dated 10/15/2014, raised to public deed on
10/29/2014 and published in the Mercantile Registry on \*\*\* DATE. 1.

      As a result of the attribution to the claimant of an inaccurate data - a debt that does not

belonged- BBVA processed your personal data without legitimacy communicating it to your
in charge of treatment to claim on his behalf a debt to which he was

alien. Also a consequence of the violation of the principle of accuracy is the
refusal by BBVA to the claimant to delete their personal data
requested. Starting from inaccurate information, the entity reaches the wrong one

conclusion of rejecting the requested deletion by improperly estimating that those
Claimant's data are necessary for the purpose for which they were collected (ex
article 17.1.a; of the RGPD to sensu contrary)

      The facts presented also show a serious lack of diligence in

BBVA not only for having attributed to the claimant, whose status was not that of debtor, the
debt contracted by whoever had been represented, but also because of having
consulted the R.M. could have known that the claimant no longer held the

administrator status. Furthermore, the claimed persists in its
offending conduct and, despite being informed by the claimant at the end of May
2018 that he is no longer administrator of the debtor entity, POUSEN, does not carry out

no checking on that end and refuses to cancel your data. It's more,
Nor does he realize his error when he collects from Axesor in September 2018 a
report with the history of the social agreements registered by POUSEN in the R.M.,

which includes the claimant's termination agreement as administrator and the
appointment of a new sole director of the company adopted in October

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/16

2014 and registered in the R.M. on \*\*\* DATE. 1.

      BBVA's behavior described above is subsumed under the penalty type of the
Article 83.5.a, RGPD.

                                             IV

instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the fine penalty that
it corresponds to impose the claimed party as allegedly responsible for a criminal offense
