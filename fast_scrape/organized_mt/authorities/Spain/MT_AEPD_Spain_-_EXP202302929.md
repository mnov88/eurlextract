## English Summary

### Facts

In September and December 2022, a data subject requested that ID Finance Spain, S.A.U. (the controller), a financial technology company that provides loans, delete their personal data from its credit information systems. The data subject stated that it had never applied for a loan from the controller and attached a police report to its request to demonstrate that they had reported the alleged fraud to the police. The controller only responded to the latter request, when it refused to delete the data on the basis that the data subject had an unpaid debt and, ignoring the attached police report, stated that a police report was required for all deletion requests.

On 23 January 2023, a data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD), seeking deletion of their data. The complaint also argued that the controller unlawfully transmitted their data to the national association of credit financiers ASNEF-EQUIFAX’s solvency files.

The controller argued that its processing was based on consent and produced a contract and debt certificate. Neither document was signed by the data subject. In addition to the unsigned contract, the controller claimed that it verified the identity of the loan applicant based on:

*   SMS messages with the phone number listed by the applicant. The AEPD’s investigation revealed that the phone number provided in the loan application did not belong to the data subject.
*   Responses from an IP address. The AEPD noted that the controller did not verify whether or not the IP address belonged to the data subject.
*   A certificate of bank title. The AEPD’s investigation revealed that the bank account listed in the loan application did not belong to the data subject.
*   Verification of the loan applicant’s name and national identification number. The controller serviced DEYDE Calidad de Datos, S.L., a processor which cross-referenced the name and national ID provided in the application against the State Agency of Tax Administration’s census. This process verified that the name and ID provided in the application was consistent with the Tax Administration’s registry. However, this process did not verify the identity of the applicant.

The controller also noted that in response to the December 2022 deletion request, it suspended its transfer of the data subject’s information to ASNEF-EQIFAX in accordance with the controller’s internal policy, which states that when a police report is received for identity theft, personal data will be removed from ASNEF-EQUIFAX. However, in April 2023, the controller again transferred the data subject’s information to the credit bureau.

### Holding

The AEPD found that the controller lacked a legal basis, failed to provide a deletion request and lacked a data protection officer (DPO), infringing Articles 6, 17 and 37(7) GDPR. The controller was fined €180,000.

The data subject did not apply for a loan with the controller. As a result, it did not provide consent for the processing of its data in connection with this loan and a legal basis under [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") does not exist. The AEPD rejected the controller’s defense that it did not submit the data subject’s information to ASNEF-EQUIFAX upon receiving the data subject’s police report because it included them again in April 2023.

The AEPD found that the controller repeatedly infringed the data subject’s right to deletion under [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR"). It rejected the controller’s argument that the data subject’s erasure request in September 2022 was not responded to due to an involuntary internal error. Indeed, in response to the data subject’ second erasure request in December 2022, which attached the police report, the controller rejected the request and ignored the attachment. Furthermore, the controller continued to include the data subject’s data in ASNEF-EQUIFAX’s creditworthiness file.

Finally, the AEPD noted that in response to its request for a report of the actions carried out by the DPO, the controller failed to demonstrate that it had appointed a DPO or to communicate it to the AEPD within the requisite time. The controller thus infringed [Article 37(7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR#7 "Article 37 GDPR") as well as [Article 34(1)(f) LOPDGDD](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673).

The AEPD recommended a sanction of €225,000. Pursuant to [Law 39/2015](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10565), a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the AEPD informed the controller that it may acknowledge its responsibility for the alleged violations and/or pay the proposed fine. Each of these actions reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to reduce the fine by 20%, paying a fine of €180,000.

## Comment

This case bears similarity to one resolved by the AEPD in May 2024. In [EXP202313713](https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=AEPD_\(Spain\)_-_EXP202313713), the AEPD sanctioned the same controller €56,000 when it failed to remove a contested debt from a data subject's financial records. As in this case, the controller argued that it had deleted the data subject’s data from the ASNEF file as requested, but that a technical error had occurred which caused the personal data to be re-uploaded on ASNEF.

In both cases, the AEPD found that the controller lacked a legal basis to process the data subject's information.

“We attach as ANNEX IX by certificate the list of the data that our
system stores when a new client registers, as well as a copy of the

request, automatically sends DEYDE the name and surname and ID number.
In this way, DEYDE checks the Tax Agency database
Spanish that these data actually coincide with the information they have in the

coincidence between the information provided to IDFINANCE and that known to the
Spanish Tax Agency, so IDFINANCE considered said verification valid.

We attach as ANNEX IV the verification of the identity of the Claimant.”

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/42

The claimed party provides an image showing the registration date of the party
complainant in Moneyman (March 9, 2020) and mentions of “Deyde-Passport",

but no data appears that allows the information to be associated with the complaining party,
although the figure that appears in the last line “\*\*\*DATE.2 12:25:14: Money sent;
payment order XXXXXXX; Unnax XXXXXXX”, also appears in the contract, page. 9,
and in the complaint.

The statements of DEYDE QUALIDAD DE DADOS S.L. about the contract

signed service with the claimed party with its addendum, and a copy of the same contract
subsequently provided by the claimed party as with its addendum, describe
the service provided as verification of the correspondence between a name and a
NIF in contrast to the AEAT census.

ACTIONS BEFORE DEYDE DATA QUALITY S.L.

DEYDE DATA QUALITY S.L. states:

“In no case does DEYDE offer or market MyDataQ\_ID Validation as a
identity verification system, nor the functions it performs can be considered

included in this concept since they only receive a name and a document of
identity, without having access to other data that would allow validation of
any identity. That is, the purpose of said service is to verify that the user
It is registered with the Tax Agency.

Likewise, the product does not access any database of the Tax Agency,
It only provides a service included in its electronic headquarters.

This is expressly stated in the contract signed between DEYDE and ID FINANCE.

\[…\]
We understand that the A.A.A. data with NIF \*\*\*NIF.1 should have been sent more than
18 months, since we currently have no record of it even in our systems
production, which have data from the last 20 days, nor in the backup system that
contains information from the previous 18 months.

If we have been able to verify that, as of June 1, 2023, the service tells us that those
data are registered in the Tax Agency.”

That is, it states that, when contrasted with the AEAT census, there is
match between the name and the NIF provided.

By following the following link, you can consult more information about this service:

\*\*\*URL.2.

The claimed party states that “The data was obtained directly from the
interested at the time the loan was formalized” and that provides “the contract
signed by the Claimant as ANNEX II” and the “current procedure for requesting
loan as ANNEX III”.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/42

The claimed party states that the procedure followed to verify the
identity of the complaining party consisted of verifying the coincidence between

name and DNI/NIF number through the aforementioned Agency service
Tax and, as deduced and explained later, should have included a call
telephone and sending images of the DNI through a web page whose URL was
provided via SMS messages.

The procedure provided does not correspond to the previous statements, since

which includes verification by providing images of the DNI and photograph
“selfie” through an app of the complaining party, while in the SMS that the
claimed party states to have sent in the registration process, and that are analyzed
Later on, there is no mention of sending any “selfies”.

The claimed party has not stated that it processes images of the complaining party.

The document includes a contract along with a debt certificate issued by the
own part and an amortization table. However, this document does not contain
the electronic signature of the complaining party, nor does his handwritten signature appear on any
of its pages.

On page 1, the identity and contact information of the complaining party are detailed, and
mentions:

“The bank account provided by the owner for the entry of the loan amount

and of which he claims to be the owner and responsible is \*\*\*ACCOUNT.1”.

The requested party is requested to provide the information available to their company regarding the
relationship between the claiming party and the account into which the money of the
loan, and whether it was made before the deposit or has subsequently made any

account ownership verification procedure, and its result.

In its response, the claimed party states:

“The information that Moneyman had about the relationship between the claimant and the
account into which the money is deposited is based on the document, issued by the entity

BBVA (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A.), provided by the same claimant in
the loan underwriting process. It indicates that the ownership of the

document as ANNEX 1. Since the certificate provided was issued by BBVA
(with electronic signature at the bottom of the certificate) and the data obtained directly by

the claimant, these were considered accurate.”

A document is provided that appears to be a certification from the banking entity
attributing ownership of the account \*\*\*ACCOUNT.1 to the complaining party.

The document includes a logo and seal of the banking entity, but not the signature of the bank.

However, it has been verified that the document provided is not found

allows you to verify its authenticity.

ACTIONS BEFORE BANCO BILBAO VIZCAYA ARGENTARIA, S.A.

BANCO BILBAO VIZCAYA ARGENTARIA, S.A. states that the ownership of the
account \*\*\*ACCOUNT.1 corresponds to a person other than the complaining party.

The claimed party states:

 “We attach as ANNEX IV the verification of the identity of the Claimant,” and
provides the image \[6\]. In that image there is no data that allows us to associate the
information to the complaining party. You can only associate this image with the rest of the
documentation by the figure that appears at the bottom, 00000000, which also appears in the
contract and in the complaint.

When asked to provide the list of personal data that your system
stored when a new customer registers and copy of the data and images
saved by the application when the complaining party registered, the claimed party
states:

 “We attach as ANNEX IX by certificate the list of the data that our
system stores when a new client registers, as well as a copy of the
themselves.”

This document includes, among other personal data of the claimed party, the

numbering +\*\*\*PHONE.2 (hereinafter, Numbering\_1).

PROCEEDINGS BEFORE XFERA MÓVILES S.A.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/42

XFERA MÓVILES S.A. states that between March 3 and August 1, 2020 the
Numbering\_1 corresponds to a person other than the complaining party. Person
The owner of the line does not match the owner of the bank account either.

When requesting proof, if applicable, of the SMS sent to the claimant for registration and
For the loan application, the claimed party states:

“We attach as ANNEX X the accreditation of the SMS sent to the claimant
for registration and loan application”

Said document contains a table that contains 14 SMS sending records on the 9th
March 2020 between 12:06 and 12:25 at Numbering\_1.

As already mentioned, the complaining party was not the owner of Numbering\_1, and

It has not been proven that the complaining party could read the messages sent to
Numbering\_1.

The document tables are Excel tables with information, among other things, related to the
date and time, destination numbering and content of various SMS. This information has
has been provided by the claimed party, but has not been accredited by a third party.

The SMS in the table, dated March 9, 2020 between 09:12 and 12:25 follow
the following sequence:

    - “Your Moneyman.es confirmation code 8872”

    - “We have sent you the standardized consumer credit information and the
       terms and conditions of your loan. Please read them carefully.
       “Moneyman.”

    - “Last step to receive your money! Call XXXXXXXX now to finish.”

    - “MONEYMAN: pending sending DNI/NIE on both sides. Click on
       https://\*\*\*URL.1/ to upload them. Thank you."

(This SMS appears nine consecutive times).

    - “Your money is on the way! We have already issued the payment order for the amount
       requested a loan of 200.00 euros.”

    - “We have sent you the standardized consumer credit information and the

       terms and conditions of your loan. Please read them carefully.
       “Moneyman.”

From the sequence it is deduced that during the registration process there must have been a
phone call, followed by sending images of the DNI on both sides, through

of the link \*\*\*URL.1.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/42

When asking about receiving an image of the party's identity document
claimant, the claimed party states that it received a photograph of the
identity during the registration process and provides the image.

It is concluded from the above that the identity verification carried out during the
User registration process with the data of the complaining party consisted of the
checking the match of your name, surname and identity document
with those included in the Tax Agency census, the sending of SMS messages to
Numbering\_1, a telephone call, the acceptance of a certificate lacking the

electronic signature that the text itself stated in it cites to contain in its
electronic version of bank account ownership, and receipt of an image of the
DNI of the complaining party.

In relation to notifications sent by the claimed party, and consent

of the claimant for the processing of her personal data and for the registration of
the same in credit information systems, there has been knowledge of what
following:

The complaining party states that it never requested credit through the party
claimant and declares that “he does not recognize such debt since he has not made any

contracting with such company.”

When requesting from the claimed party documentation proving the origin of the debt
that motivated the inclusion of the personal data of the affected person in the systems
of credit information, the claimed party states that it provides a contract together

with a debt certificate issued by the claimed party itself and a table of
amortization. Neither does the document received contain the electronic signature of the party
claimant, nor does his handwritten signature appear on any of its pages.

When requesting again from the claimed party proof of the party's acceptance

claimant, of the debt, the contract and its clauses, the claimed party states:

The complaining party also declares that on May 16, 2020 “he received in his mailbox
a notification from the claimed company \[…\] in which it is required to non-pay
312.80 euros. The loan contract number 0000000 appears as a reference.

By requesting a copy of the aforementioned notification from the claimed party, it states that it does not
have proof of that shipment, and provides, as proof of receipt of the
notifications of demand for payment to the claimed party, the table referring to two

The table is similar to the tables mentioned above and as already mentioned

Parts:

Borrower: the one indicated in the Loan application \[…\]”

Therefore, although it has been proven that the complaining party received a
notification at his address, the claimed party states that this was made through

of SMS to Numbering\_1, and has not proven that it was carried out in accordance
with the general conditions, which according to their statements were accepted by
both parties.

The claimed party also states:

“We attach as ANNEX XI the certificate issued by the company in which
proves that the claimant accepted the processing of her personal data by
“IDFINANCE SPAIN, S.A.U.”

As ANNEX XI, it provides a certification from the claimed party itself.

The complaining party states that it has been improperly included in the
ASNEF EQUIFAX equity solvency file.

By asking the claimed party for information in the contract about the

possibility of inclusion in credit information systems, it states:

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/42

As ANNEX II, the contract provides where in article “16.- Data protection of
personal character” (p. 6) indicates:

“16.1. With the consent of the Loan Applicant, regardless of the
Loan Decision, the Borrower declares himself informed, consents and authorizes

The party claimed in ANNEX IV provides a document that contains a description
of the variables, requirements and notifications to be sent, related to the

information about two SMS sent to Numbering\_1 on May 14 and 17,
2020.

As previously mentioned, the claimed party has not proven that the
complaining party could read the SMS sent to Number\_1. Furthermore, shipping
SMS is not considered a means of communication.

The claimed party states:

“On January 23, 2023, mail was received from FACUA Córdoba, as indicated
in the response dated March 23, 2023 to the first request received from

the AEPD, in which we are informed of the complaint to the police for impersonation of
identity presented by the claimant.

It is at that moment when this entity becomes aware of the complaint
presented and proceeds to apply the measures established for cases of fraud (1st-
blocking the claimant's data in our systems, 2nd paralyzing the

debt claim (keeping the data locked and limited in the
treatment given that they may be required by the competent authorities for the
investigation of the facts.) and 3rd, delete the claimant's data from the
assets solvency files).

This is indicated to FACUA in the response email to its request for
information, which is attached as ANNEX 4.

From that moment on, the data has been maintained until the clarification of the
made by the police.”

As ANNEX 4 provides the document signed on February 6, 2023, in which
responds to the complaining party:

On the other hand, ASNEF-EQUIFAX, INFORMATION SERVICES ON
SOLVENCIA Y CRÉDITO, S.L., provides the registrations of the complaining party
in its records following the request of the claimed party, with registration and cancellation dates:

    - May 29, 2020 (high) and June 8, 2020 (low).
    - July 10, 2020 (registered) and January 30, 2023 (registered).

It also sends the registration notifications to the complaining party, for

ordinary postal mail to the address of the complaining party, dated May 29,
2020, July 10, 2020 and April 15, 2023.

It is proven that the defendant kept the claimant registered in
credit information systems during the three periods mentioned above, the

last of which is after February 6, 2023, the date of your response to the
complaining party, in which it communicates the blocking of its data.

ACTIONS BEFORE IDFINANCE
In relation to the actions adopted by IDFINANCE in response to the requests of the
complaining party related to their rights regarding the processing of their data

personal:

The complaining party requested that the defendant pay attention to its right to erasure.
of your personal data and the elimination of the same from the solvency files
patrimonial, on September 21, 2022, through its legal representative

FACUA, sending the letter to three email addresses of the party
claimed (\*\*\*EMAIL.1, \*\*\*EMAIL.2 and \*\*\*EMAIL.3).

This request received no response nor was it attended to.

The claimed party has not communicated the Spanish Data Protection Agency, to
date of preparation of this report, identification data of your Delegate of
Data Protection.

By requesting the claimed party to “provide a report or summary of the actions
carried out by the Data Protection Officer of your company regarding the

request, by the claimant, for the deletion of her personal data”, the party
claimed makes different statements:

“In relation to the actions carried out by the Delegate for the protection of
Data regarding the deletion of the claimant's personal data, the

in accordance with the internal procedure for the management of rights of the
interested.”

In response to the request for information on the reason for not responding to the
email from the legal representative of the complaining party, the defendant states:

“\[…\] due to personnel changes in Moneyman's Legal department, the email
sent by FACUA on September 21, 2022, the mailbox where said email arrived

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 15/42

was left without management, without the staff who replaced the person responsible for said mailbox
knew about the message without responding.”

It is proven that the claimed party did not adequately respond to the request for
deletion of data of the complaining party, since he did not respond to the email
sent by FACUA as its legal representative on September 21,
2022.

The complaining party again requested that the defendant pay attention to its right to

deletion of your personal data and the elimination of the same from the files of
patrimonial solvency, on December 1, 2022, sending the letter to two
email addresses of the claimed party (\*\*\*EMAIL.1 and \*\*\*EMAIL.3).

The claimed party also states that “it proceeded in accordance with the

internal procedure for the management of the rights of interested parties”, and provides
document, in which, among others, establishes a period of one month for the deletion or
communication against the affected person, the need to immediately communicate the
requests to the DPD, who must check if you meet some requirements (name and
surnames, if you provide a photocopy of your ID or similar, if you express your request, address, date),
and that the DPD must request their correction where appropriate.

When requesting more information about attention to the rights of the complaining party, the
claimed manifest:

“On December 22, 2022, the exercise of rights presented was responded to

by the claimant on December 1, 2022, as can be seen in the
document attached as ANNEX 3.”

As ANNEX 3 provides the email sent on December 22
from \*\*\*EMAIL.1 to \*\*\*EMAIL.4, in response to the complaining party, in which

indicates that:

“you cannot proceed to delete your personal data in our database
for having an unpaid loan” and that “if you suspect that you may have been a victim of
identity theft, we recommend that you report the facts to the
police and send us the complaint so that we can take the appropriate measures.”

Likewise, it points out the following:

“On January 23, 2023, mail was received from FACUA Córdoba, as indicated
in the response dated March 23, 2023 to the first request received from

the AEPD, in which we are informed of the complaint to the police for impersonation of
identity presented by the claimant.

It is at that moment when this entity becomes aware of the complaint
presented and proceeds to apply the measures established for cases of fraud (1st-

blocking the claimant's data in our systems, 2nd paralyzing the
debt claim (keeping the data locked and limited in the

investigation of the facts.) and 3rd, delete the claimant's data from the
assets solvency files).

This is indicated to FACUA in the response email to its request for
information, which is attached as ANNEX 4.”

As ANNEX 4 provides email signed on February 6, 2023 in the
which, as has already been explained in the previous section, communicates to the complaining party
that takes care of your rights.

However, as already established, the claimed party re-registered the
complaining party in ASNEF-EQUIFAX between April 15 and 16, 2023.

FOURTH: According to the report collected from the AXESOR tool, the entity

ID FINANCE SPAIN, S.A.U. is a large company established in 2015, whose
corporate purpose is the granting of non-mortgage loans or credits to any
person, with a number of employees of 146 people, and a turnover of
€178,771,000 in 2022.

FIFTH: On April 19, 2024, the Director of the Spanish Agency for

Data Protection agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against the claimed party,
in accordance with the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1,
of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (in
hereinafter, LPACAP), for the alleged violation of Article 17 of the RGPD, Article 6 of the
GDPR and Article 37 of the GDPR, typified in Article 83.4.a) of the GDPR, Article

83.5.b) of the RGPD and Article 83.5.a) of the RGPD.

SIXTH: The aforementioned initiation agreement has been notified in accordance with the rules established in
Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of the
Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), the claimed party presented two

allegations, a first in relation to the aggravating circumstance of the possible violation of the
right to deletion of data and a second on the classification and classification of
the alleged violation of article 6 of the GDPR.

In relation to his first allegation, he has stated the following:

“As for the aggravating factor of negligence in data processing, the AEPD
considers that it is applicable since, “(…) despite the fact that in response
provided on February 6, 2023, it indicates that the request for

the claimant, the inclusion again at a later time in the file of
financial solvency seems to prove that this was not the case.”

However, this part considers that it is not applicable since, in no case
moment, ID Finance notified the Claimant of the deletion of her data, but the
blocking them in the ID Finance system; paralyze the claim of the

debt; and delete the data from the asset solvency file, but in no case
the definitive deletion of the data is communicated (page 346 of the complete file
facilitated by the AEPD).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 17/42

This is because in this case, data deletion cannot be carried out.

definitive as the police investigation remains open, in which they can request
information to ID Finance, and the existence of a crime of
identity fraud.

Therefore, ID Finance considers that the application of this aggravating circumstance has no place.

Furthermore, the AEPD also justifies the fact that the data was
communicated again to ASNEF-EQUIFAX at a later time, indicating that they did not
The request was correctly attended to, but this is not true, since the day after

said communication of the data to ASNEF-EQUIFAX, were deregistered again, with
which, no right of the Claimant has been violated. What's more, these data
They were never published since in accordance with art. 20.1.c of the LOPGDD,

30 days must pass before publishing them.

Likewise, in the claim made by the Claimant, it does not reveal

at no time this circumstance, so this party considers that, if
Well, there was a computer failure as has been alleged in previous writings.
submitted to the AEPD, is not the subject of this claim.

Thus, while it is true that ID Finance erred in not realizing that the Claimant
had provided a copy of the complaint in its request of December 1, 2022, the

ID Finance worker who responded to the request responded within the deadline,
arguing the reasons for the denial of the right, providing a direct link
to the AEPD website, informing of the right to make the claim that

deemed appropriate and proposing that if he considered that there was a
identity theft, you will file a complaint in order to delete your data (page.

351 and 352 of the complete AEPD file). When on January 23, 2023
receives a copy of the complaint, ID Finance proceeds to remove it from ASNEF-EQUIFAX
on January 30, 2023 and communicate it to the Claimant on February 6,

2023, which was the goal pursued by the Claimant, all within the period of one
month established by the GDPR.

All of this accredits the transparency and good faith of ID Finance, actions totally
contrary to those of obstruction of people's data protection rights.

On the other hand, since this claim affects only one person, this party
considers that the aggravating circumstance of the article cannot be taken into consideration either
76.2 b) LOPDGDD regarding the linking of the offender's activity with the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 18/42

processing of personal data, as has been alleged in the
previous allegations presented, since the processing of data subject to

alleged identity theft is not the main data processing of the
ID Finance activity.”

In its second allegation, the defendant states the following:

“In relation to the classification and classification of the alleged violation of article 6 of the

RGPD, according to the information that this party has been able to access after the
complete review of the file, the AEPD requested the General Directorate of the Police
(hereinafter, the “Police”) information on the “Diligencies and/or investigations

carried out to clarify the facts reported by A.A.A., with
DNI \*\*\*NIF.1. According to our knowledge, he filed a complaint with the
CÓRDOBA ESTE on 05/18/2020 before instructor 115476 (attestation number

6224/20)” (page 106 of the complete file provided by the AEPD), in order to
assess the legality of the processing of the Claimant's data according to art. 6 of the
GDPR.

Thus, it is proven that the Police do not provide any information about the
investigation that is being carried out on their part. Despite this, the AEPD, in the

present sanctioning procedure, assumes that the Claimant actually
has been a victim of identity theft with the complaint submitted, which does not
can be presupposed when said assessment corresponds to the police and, in any case, to

a judge.

It should be taken into account that the filing of a police report does not imply the

veracity of the information, not even the demonstration of the alleged crime. No
However, ID Finance's internal policy, as a precaution and as a measure

precautionary measure, establishes that when a police report is received for alleged
identity theft, personal data from ASNEF-EQUIFAX is deleted.

On the other hand, regarding the verification of the owner of the telephone number provided and

bank account, the AEPD cannot deny that if ID Finance had requested this
information to the corresponding companies, in this case, XFERA MÓVILES,

S.A.U. and BANCO BILBAO VIZCAYA ARGENTARIA, S.A. (“BBVA”) these under no
concept would have provided the information based, prudently, on the
data protection regulations and indicating that said information should

be requested from the Court, in any case, specifying the legal framework and the need to
its valuation, which is excessive and disproportionate for ID Finance.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 19/42

Therefore, we consider that before resolving this procedure and confirming

the violation of art. 6 of the RGPD by ID Finance and, given that the AEPD
has at its disposal the identification data of the owners of the telephone line and
BBVA bank account, the aforementioned Authority should contact said

people to request information in this regard for the purposes of confirming the
existence of the possible illegality of the treatment. Therefore, with the information
available to date by the AEPD without having contacted the people

detailed in the file after the letter made to the entities BBVA and XFERA
MÓVILES, S.A.U., this party considers that the impersonation of
identity of the claimant, and therefore the illegality of the treatment by ID

FINANCE and its corresponding sanction proposal.

In accordance with the above, the details of the people are detailed below

informed and that appear in the file for the purposes that the AEPD can
complete the appropriate investigations to clarify if you are facing a treatment

of illicit data, that is, confirming the link between the owner of the telephone line, the
bank account holder and the Claimant:

- Data of the owner of the telephone line provided to the AEPD by XFERA

MÓVILES, S.A.U. on August 10, 2023 (pages 326 and 327 of the complete file
of the AEPD):

      o NAME: B.B.B.
      o DOC TYPE: DNI o DOC NUMBER: 00000000

 - Details of the owner of the bank account ES00 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 of the
  BBVA provided to the AEPD by BBVA on September 7, 2023 (page 358 of the
  complete AEPD file).

      o Owner: C.C.C. o Identification document: 00000000 o Current postal address
      working in systems: Street \*\*\*ADDRESS.2.

      o Address that appears on the DNI delivered to BBVA for the purposes:
      \*\*\*ADDRESS.3.

Therefore, the AEPD in this case is proposing a sanction based on art. 6 of the
RGPD for facts that have not yet been proven, that is, it understands the
illegality of the treatment without having previously ascertained whether they are really

illicitly processing the Claimant's data.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 20/42

Therefore, this party considers, in strict defense terms, that the AEPD is
exceeds its competence in qualifying identity verification measures
as insufficient, when demonstrated by the activity of ID Finance and the

relationship with its clients, which are exceptional cases in which the measures
applied by the entity do not give the expected results.

Even so, the AEPD itself in its Guide to “Risk management and impact assessment in
personal data processing” recognizes that zero risk does not exist, and ID Finance
is continually adopting improvements in its procedures to prevent
give cases of identity theft.

IX. B.- ASSUMED RISKS (Guide to “Risk management and impact assessment”
in personal data processing” -Page. 127)

“As noted above, the “zero risk” level does not exist. One has to
find a compromise between the level of residual risk achieved and the viability of the

treatment, which means making a decision when a risk level is
acceptable.”

Thus, this party considers that the aggravating circumstances imposed are excessive and not

correspond to this specific case since it has not been accredited by the
competent authorities in the matter that we are really facing a case of
identity fraud.

Despite the fact that the existence of the crime of impersonation of
identity by the Respondent or the AEPD, this part reiterates that the ID policy
Finance is to delete the data immediately with the mere presentation of the

complaint, since ID Finance prefers to increase its losses, that is, not
recover the capital borrowed or the interest accrued, than to harm someone
who has really been a victim of a crime, bearing all the damages that this
means for the activity of the entity itself.

Additionally, the AEPD maintains as a basis for the aggravating circumstance of art. 83.2. b of
GDPR that “Although the claimed party proceeded to block the personal data

of the complaining party on February 6, 2023, upon receipt of the copy of the
complaint to the National Police, where he reported that he had been the victim of a
identity theft, between April 15 and 16, 2023, he again requested his

registration in ASNEF-EQUIFAX”.

This party considers that the AEPD, in this case, has exceeded the scope of
its sanctioning competence in proposing the imposition of the aggravating circumstance related to the

blocking of the data, since it is not connected with the claim made by the
Claimant, who relies on the right to deletion of data for his deregistration
ASNEF-EQUIFAX, and which has never been brought to the attention of the AEPD
this event caused by a computer error as already explained in the

previous allegations made by ID Finance, and to which no third party has had any
access in accordance with art. 20.1.c of the LOPDGDD.
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 21/42

This means that no real harm has been caused to the Claimant since

that no one has been aware of this last inscription, which justifies, in
in any case, the magnitude of the amount of the proposed sanction.

Even so, it is worth mentioning that ID Finance, based on this error, has proceeded to
implement the appropriate technical measures to fix this bug, computer failure,
that affected the interested party but, in any case, it is very important to keep in mind

take into account, when grading the possible sanction, that no harm has been caused
damage since no third party has had access to this information.

Currently, the data is not registered in ASNEF and the Claimant's profile
is blocked in ID Finance systems, in accordance with the access policy
ID Finance (see Annex 1), so that only workers with a certain

degree of responsibility and certain departments can view them, with
in order to address possible police actions that may occur.

On the other hand, since this claim affects only one person, this party

considers that the aggravating circumstance of the article cannot be taken into consideration either
76.2 b) LOPDGDD regarding the linking of the offender's activity with the
processing of personal data, as has been alleged in the

previous allegations presented, since the processing of data subject to
alleged identity theft is not the main data processing of the
ID Finance activity.

Additionally, since the same aggravating factor related to the
linking the activity of the alleged infringer, both in the alleged infringement of the
art. 37.7, 17 and 6 of the GDPR, ID Finance considers that it is being repeatedly tried

for the same reason, violating the principle “non bis in idem” in accordance with the criteria
established jurisprudence.

For all these reasons, the violation of article 6 of the RGPD by
ID Finance and, we request, even taking into account unintentional human error in
which ID Finance has incurred, the archive of these proceedings, with the
commitment to improve all appropriate processes to prevent this type of occurrence

of such particular situations”

recorded in the file, the following have been accredited:

In the present case, on March 9, 2020, a user account was opened for
through the website of the claimed entity, \*\*\*URL.1, using the personal data of
the complaining party.

To open said account, and according to information provided by the claimed party about the
procedure followed for this purpose, the personal data of the
claimant (name, ID, address, an image of your ID), a bank certificate,
a mobile phone number+\*\*\*PHONE.2 and a certificate of ownership of

The investigative actions have made it possible to prove that the complaining party did not

nor the bank account used in the account opening procedure.
indicated user.

Using the created user, a loan was requested; the claimed party accepted the
processed on March 9, 2020 as stated in the SMS sent to Numbering\_1.

During the registration process, verification of the user identity of the website
the claimed party was based on the comparison, through a third company, of

name and NIF of the complaining party with those existing in the Agency's census
Tax and the receipt of an image of the DNI on both sides in response to the
requests sent by SMS to Number\_1. The claimed party thus gave
verified the identity of the applicant.

Following its internal procedures in case of non-payment, the claimed party sent
different SMS notification and debt claim to Number\_1 on days
May 14, 17 and 20, 2020, thus declaring the debt communicated, and the
registration in credit information systems, to the complaining party.

The complaining party reports, on May 18, 2020, to the National Police, having
received a letter from the claimed party in his mailbox two days before, demanding a
debt for a loan. In the complaint he states that he does not recognize the debt and has not
made any contract with the aforementioned company.

The defendant registered the claiming party in ASNEF-EQUIFAX, which includes

registration in the periods May 29 to June 8, 2020, July 10, 2020 to June 30
January 2023, and April 15 to 16, 2023.

The claimed party states that they have the consent of the party
complainant to the processing of his personal data and the authorization for its possible

registration in credit information systems based on
    - a contract in which there is no signature of the complaining party
    - communications via SMS to Number\_1
    - responses from an IP address without proving its relationship with the party
       claimant, and

    - a certificate of account ownership whose information has been refuted
       after consulting the bank.

The claimed party does not include, in the list of personal data that it claims to process,
copies of DNI images.

It has been proven that the defendant processed the data of the party
claimant, whom he registered in credit information systems for three
periods between the years 2020 and 2023.

As legal representative of the complaining party, FACUA Córdoba sent on December 12
September 2022 an email to the defendant requesting the deletion of

the personal data of your client. This request received no response. The part
claimed attributes this lack of response to an involuntary error on its part.

On December 1, 2022, the complaining party sent an email to the
complained requesting again the deletion of his personal data and received on 22

of December response from the person complained about, which considers the deletion to be inadmissible
there is an outstanding debt and urges the complaining party to report the impersonation
identity card and send a copy of the complaint.

On January 23, 2023, the complaining party again requested the deletion of its data
to the person claimed and filed a claim with the Spanish Agency for the Protection of

Data.

The claimed party states that it proceeded to block the data on February 6,
2023, after receipt of the copy of the complaint to the National Police. Without
However, it registered the complaining party again in ASNEF-EQUIFAX between the days

April 15 and 16, 2023.

                           Allegations to the initiation agreement

The claimed party in its defense has made statements questioning the
violation of article 6 of the RGPD, as well as the aggravating circumstance related to negligence in
their performances.

In response to such statements, the AEPD must indicate that such statements

are to a certain extent contradictory, since on the one hand he affirms that his actions have
has been diligent since it has deleted the personal data of the complaining party,
in accordance with the procedure established in these cases, when in March
2023, through FACUA, was aware of the complaint filed by the party
claimant, for identity theft by not recognizing the debt that the party

claimed demands.

However, despite indicating that the solvency file has been lowered
property at the request of the claimed entity, the AEPD has verified that the
data of the complaining party were again registered in the files of

patrimonial solvency in April 2023 at the request of the claimed party.

On the other hand, the claimed entity initially states that this new
inclusion was due to a technical failure, but then says that in reality it only

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 25/42

The data was blocked and the deletion order was never given, since it has not been accredited
that said identity theft has occurred.

The AEPD considers that the actions of the claimed entity have been negligent and that
there is a clear violation of article 6 of the RGPD, since the data of the part
claimant have been included in a solvency file illegally since the
claimed party has processed personal data despite not
be found in none of the cases that legitimize said data processing
personal.

The claimed entity alleges a legitimate interest based on the claimed party being the
debt holder. However, the ownership of the debt subject to inclusion in the
financial solvency file cannot be considered true, after presenting
complaint in March 2023 to the police, by the complaining party, for impersonation

of identity, and before the consumer association FACUA. Such facts show
that the claiming party has not recognized said debt, and that it questions it because
You do not have any signed contract with the claimed entity.

Therefore, if the ownership of the debt subject to inclusion in the solvency file
patrimonial cannot be accredited by the claimed party, it cannot request its

inclusion in any asset solvency file until it is proven that the
claiming party is the owner of said debt.

So requesting the inclusion of the personal data of the complaining party in
a financial solvency file for a debt whose ownership has been questioned

and the claimed entity has not been able to prove, it represents a clear violation of the article
6 of the RGPD, since unlawful processing of personal data is being carried out.

Such events are aggravated by a lack of diligence on the part of the entity.
claimed, since despite having been informed by FACUA that the complaining party

does not recognize the debt, has not proceeded to cancel the registration in the file of
financial solvency of the data of the complaining party.

                                  GDPR Article 6

The GDPR in its article 4.11 defines the consent of the interested party as “any
manifestation of free, specific, informed and unequivocal will by which the
interested party accepts, either by a declaration or a clear affirmative action, the
processing of personal data that concerns you.”

In relation to the legality of the processing of personal data, article 6.1
of the GDPR, establishes the following:

"1. Treatment will only be legal if at least one of the following is met

by the person responsible for the treatment or by a third party, provided that regarding said
interests do not prevail over the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party requiring the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child.

The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph will not apply to the treatment
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.”

In relation to credit information systems, we must go to article 20
of the LOPDGDD, highlighting its section b), which establishes the following:

"1. Unless proven otherwise, the processing of personal data will be presumed lawful.

           Classification and classification of the violation of article 6 of the RGPD

If confirmed, the aforementioned violation of article 6 of the RGPD could mean the
commission of the infractions classified in article 83.5 of the RGPD that under the

The section “General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines” provides:

“Infractions of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20 000 000 or,

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 “Infringements” establishes that

“The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4,

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 “Infringements considered very

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

following:

    a) The processing of personal data without any of the
    conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation
    (EU) 2016/679. (…)”

It is considered that the reported facts represent a violation of article 6.1 of the
GDPR. In this sense, and according to the information available after the
investigative actions carried out, the complaining party did not contract any debt
with the claimed party, so the budget that motivated the data processing
personal details of the complaining party and its registration in the solvency file

patrimonial has not been justified. In this sense, it is appreciated the lack of
a legitimizing basis for the processing of personal data carried out and, therefore,
an alleged violation of article 6 of the GDPR.

On the other hand, although the claimed party claims to have blocked the data of the

claimant on February 6, 2023, after learning of the complaint filed
by the complaining party before the National Police for identity theft, it has been
found that the complained party re-included the complaining party's data in
the ASNEF-EQUIFAX solvency file, on April 15 and 16, 2023,

"1. The interested party will have the right to obtain without undue delay from the person responsible for the
processing the deletion of personal data that concerns you, which will be

obliged to delete personal data without undue delay when any
of the following circumstances:

a) the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were

d) the personal data have been processed unlawfully; e) personal data
must be deleted for compliance with a legal obligation established in the
Union or Member State law applicable to the person responsible for the
treatment;

f) the personal data have been obtained in relation to the offer of services of the

2. When you have made personal data public and are obliged, by virtue of the

“serious” of the LOPDGDD indicates:

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that involve

following:

k) The impediment or obstruction or repeated failure to attend to the exercise of the
rights established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)”

It is considered that the reported facts represent a violation of article 17 of the
RGPD, regarding the right to deletion of personal data, since the first
request, made by FACUA on behalf of the claimant in September 2022, does not
was responded to due to what the claimed party qualifies as an “involuntary error.”

Once the complaining party has exercised its right again, acting in its own name,
receives a response in which it is informed of the existence of a debt that prevents
that your data may be deleted from the asset solvency file. In bliss
response, you are required to provide, if applicable, a police report that had

presented in case of suspicion of having been a victim of fraud; a document
which had already been provided by the complaining party in the application being processed
giving response. Finally, the complaining party submits a new request,
through its representative, which is the subject of a response and which indicates that it has been
proceeded to block your data.

However, as demonstrated by the fact that, after that response
and, therefore, to the alleged blocking of the personal data of the claimant, her
data were again incorporated into the asset solvency file, the right to
deletion of your personal data was not effectively satisfied.

Therefore, we are faced with the repeated violation of the right of deletion
exercised by the complaining party.
