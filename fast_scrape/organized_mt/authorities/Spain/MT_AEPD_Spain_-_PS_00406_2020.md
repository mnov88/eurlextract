## English Summary

### Facts

Testa Residencial, as creditor, and Equifax, as responsible for the credit information file, had signed a contract. This contract established that Equifax had to send a payment request letter to Testa's debtors before including their personal data in the file.

The claimant received the payment request, but did not receive information about the fact that, if she did not pay, her data would be included in the credit file. For this reason, the claimant turned to the AEPD.

### Dispute

Did Equifax have the legitimacy to include the claimant's data in its credit file?

### Holding

In accordance with Article 20 of the Spanish Data Protection Act (LOPDGDD), individuals should be aware that if they do not pay their debts, their personal data will be included in the solvency file. This information could have been provided by Testa at the time of contracting or, failing that, by Equifax when it sent the payment request. However, neither of the two entities informed the respondent about it, so the inclusion of the data implies an illegitimate processing of personal data.

acknowledgment by Equifax of its alleged responsibility and voluntary payment of the
sanction, in the opinion of this party, the rules established in article 85 are not
applicable in the present case.

That Equifax did not include the claimant's data in the ASNEF file

since she is not the entity that manages it, but TESTA as a creditor entity,
therefore non-existent the treatment supposedly carried out by
EQUIFAX and that begins the disciplinary proceedings filed before it.

Indeed EQUIFAX acquired a series of contractual obligations in the

provision of notification delivery services (in this case, of requirements

responsibility in a legally established obligation for the creditor to
data controller for the mere assumption of contractual obligations

operation indicated in the Contract for the provision of services in its FIFTH clause

of the content of the letter, this being the full responsibility of the Client "
thus evidencing that Equifax is a mere provider of shipping services but it is the

responsible nor does he have to know the content of the communication
regardless of whether it is a “prior payment requirement”.

Since Equifax is not responsible for the content of the communication, nor the
bound by the principle of information contained in article 20.1.c), it is by

Hence, it is completely impossible to be responsible for whether or not said requirement includes the
obligation to inform the affected party about the possibility of including their data in the

      Article 58 of the RGPD, "Powers", says:

           “2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers

(…)
b) punish any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with warning

the imposition of administrative fines ”, it states:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with

       b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
           conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
           Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                           IV

      The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 f) of the RGPD, for data processing without
legitimation, obligation established in article 20.1 c) of the LOPDGDD, that is to say
I include the claimant's data in the Asnef file without previously requiring the
payment.

      Article 20.1 c) of the LOPDGDD establishes:

"That the creditor has informed the affected party in the contract or at the time of
require payment about the possibility of inclusion in said systems, with

indication of those in which it participates.
The entity that maintains the credit information system with data related to the
breach of monetary, financial or credit obligations must notify the
affected the inclusion of such data and will inform you about the possibility of exercising the
rights established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 within
of the thirty days following the notification of the debt to the system, remaining

data blocked during that period. "

       Therefore, the data was included in the Asnef file without requiring it
prior to payment in contravention of the requirements set forth in the LOPDGDD.

      EQUIFAX provides a copy of the notification letter to the claimant dated 24
April 2019, requiring the payment of the debt, but without stating the warning that
in case of non-payment, it would be included in the capital solvency file and
of credit.

      Now, in the lease signed on August 3, 2016
with Testa as there is no information either in the contract or in the prior requirement of
payment the elements are not fulfilled so that this treatment can be presumed
protected by the legitimate interest and therefore it has been carried out without a legitimizing basis. Of

agreement with the contract for the provision of services provided between Testa and Equifax
Ibérica, this last entity will be in charge of making the request
prior payment prior to inclusion in the equity and credit solvency file,

without their sending and receiving by the claimant having been accredited.

      It is clear, and this is the essential, the above makes the data processing
of the claimant is not legitimate, since the established budgets were not given
in article 20.1 c) of the LOPDGDD.

                                            V

        In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the

        h) the way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement,
        in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such

        case, to what extent;
        i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
        previously ordered against the person responsible or the person in charge
        in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;
        j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or to mechanisms

        certification approved in accordance with Article 42, and
        k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the

      "two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

  g) Have, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.
  h) The submission by the person in charge or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to

      In accordance with the transcribed precepts, in order to set the amount of the

sanction of a fine to be imposed in the present case, the defendant is considered as
responsible for an offense typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, they are deemed
the following factors concurrent.

      As aggravating factors the following:
