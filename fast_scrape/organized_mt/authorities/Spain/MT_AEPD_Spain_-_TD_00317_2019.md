## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that the defendant had not complied with her right of access; such complaint included diverse documentation in order to prove it (i.e. she stopped receiving propaganda, but she did not receive an answer to her right of access).

### Dispute

The defendant answered to the AEPD investigation request, stating that, before receiving the request for the right of access by the claimant, her email address had already been included in a Robinson list, but, due to a mistake, they had sent her an email without marketing content. It also stated that, since then, (i) it had reinforced the training of its staff in order to avoid new mistakes like that one, and that (ii) it had created a single email address only for data protection issues. Afterwards, the defendant finally answered the right of access, but the AEPD considered it not enough, so the defendant sent a second email to the claimant including (i) the origins of the email address, (ii) a declaration that the defendant did not process any other personal data of the claimant, and (iii) the defendant had not sent such personal data to third parties.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that the right of access has been duly fulfilled, and so it decided not to impose any fine nor warning to the defendant.
