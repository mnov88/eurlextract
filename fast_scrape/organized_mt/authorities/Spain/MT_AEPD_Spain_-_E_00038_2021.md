In my capacity as a notary, they required me to record that, in the Plaza del Ayuntamiento de \*\*\* LOCALIDAD.1 (\*\*\* PROVINCIA.1), calle \*\*\* DIRECCIÓN.1, there is a semi-hidden camera that focuses to the town hall square.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW I
In accordance with the investigative and corrective powers that Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD) grants to each control authority, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 47 of the
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es 28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es
   
3/5
 Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve these investigative actions.
II
In the present case, we proceed to examine the claim dated 10/02/20 which brings about the “presence of a recording device that could affect public space” (folio no 1).
The events described may affect the content of article 5.1 c) RGPD, as it is allegedly capturing personal data from third parties that pass through public space.
The art. 5.1 c) RGPD provides the following: Personal data will be:
"Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (" data minimization ").
It should be remembered that individuals are responsible for ensuring that the installed systems comply with current legislation, proving that it complies with all the requirements demanded by current regulations.
The installation of this type of device must have the mandatory informative poster, indicating the purposes and the person responsible for the treatment, where appropriate, of the personal data.
In any case, the cameras must be oriented towards the particular space, avoiding intimidating neighboring neighbors with this type of device, as well as controlling areas of transit without just cause.
Nor can public space image (s) be obtained with this type of device, as this is the exclusive competence of the State Security Forces and Bodies.
It should be remembered that even in the case of a “simulated” camera, it should preferably be oriented towards private space, since it is considered that this type of device can affect the privacy of third parties, who are intimidated by it. in the belief of being the object of permanent recording.
Individuals cannot install devices for obtaining images in public spaces, outside of the cases allowed in the regulations.
III
The present claim is subject to transfer to this body by the Catalan Data Protection Authority, considering that its analysis does not fall within its competence framework, being received on 10/02/20.

 The device in question was installed in C / \*\*\* ADDRESS.1 of \*\*\* LOCALIDAD.1 (\*\*\* PROVINCE.1), having been installed by the tenant of the house, without any knowledge of the owner of the property, which he exempts from any responsibility.
The tenant of the property where the cameras were installed in writing dated 07/30/21 states that “they have proceeded to remove them”, these being at all times a dissuasive purpose.
Likewise, it provides as documentary evidence a copy of the invoice describing “False camera for video-surveillance purposes” arguing unfair acts for the installation of the same.
The installation of this type of deterrent device is not prohibited in our legal system, and their presence has proliferated due to the increase in vandalism against public property (eg graffiti, waste on sidewalks, etc.).
On occasions, this body has allowed the presence of this type of device, given the fact that a situation of strict compliance with the law entails a double punishment for the victim of this type of incivility, so that the consequences of the withdrawal of the cameras, suppose a greater damage as they are the patrimonial damages to the public furniture.
Faced with this type of situation, the presence of the device in question can be made known to the local Police, proceeding to adopt certain precautions when installing them (eg avoiding their orientation towards particular windows, etc).
Likewise, the Reports in this regard in relation to the installation of video surveillance cameras by City Councils can be consulted on the website of this Agency www.aepd.es "Reports and Resolutions" or in the Guide for the uses of video cameras for security and other purposes.
From the moment these types of devices are "simulated", it goes without saying that they do not carry out any "data processing" associated with an identified or identifiable natural person; although certain precautions must be taken in their installation so that third-party space is not affected in an unjustified manner.
IV
In accordance with the foregoing, it can be concluded that the purpose of the installation of the simulated device was none other than to avoid greater damage to the public heritage, being a false device equipped with a red LED light, for which it has not been accredited treatment of any personal data; all of them reasons that lead to the filing of this procedure.
Therefore, in accordance with the provisions, by the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection,
