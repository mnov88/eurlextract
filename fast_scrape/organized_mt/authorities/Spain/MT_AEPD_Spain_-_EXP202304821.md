## English Summary

### Facts

Naturgy (the controller) is one of the main electricity and utilities company in Spain. In December 2022, the data subject's electricity provider informed the data subject that it had discontinued its service at the request of the controller. This was done on the basis of a contract the data subject had allegedly signed. The data subject claimed that the contract was signed through an unknown phone number and IP address, and refused to pay the bills sent by the controller.

The process of signing a contract with the controller was carried out by an external company. If an individual expresses the intention to enter into a contract (this was not defined by the controller in the case), they are sent an SMS with a link. This leads to a website containing the product information and policies, and the individual can press a button to give consent to enter into a contract. The time and date are recorded, as well as the individual’s IP address.

On 21 February 2023 the data subject presented a complaint to the DPA. The DPA chose not to proceed with the case, and the data subject presented an internal appeal in June 2023. The data subject attached additional evidence in which they claim the controller threatened them if the bills were not paid.

The controller argued that the unlawful processing was carried out by a processor acting outside of the instructions of the controller.

### Holding

According to the DPA, the controller did not process the data subject’s personal data lawfully because it did not have a legal basis to do so under [Article 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1b "Article 6 GDPR"). The DPA criticized the fact that the controller did not ensure it had a valid legal basis before processing the data.

The DPA dismissed the controller's argument, stating it was the controller’s responsibility to verify the phone number that received the SMS to confirm the contract. Furthermore, the data subject warned the controller that they had not signed the contract after being notified of the data transfer. Despite this, the controller continued to send invoices.

The DPA fined the controller €100,000. The DPA considered it a serious infraction of the GDPR.

## Comment

The controller appealed the decision on 18 October 2024. The DPA dismissed the internal appeal on the basis that the controller had not presented new facts or legal arguments.

 File No.: EXP202304821

SANCTIONING PROCEDURE RESOLUTION

From the procedure initiated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based

on the following:

BACKGROUND

FIRST: Mr. A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complainant) filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency on February 21,

2023. The complaint is directed against NATURGY IBERIA, S.A. with NIF (Tax Identification Number) A08431090 (hereinafter, the respondent or Naturgy). The grounds for the complaint are as follows:

-He states that on December 1, 2022, his electricity company informed him that he had been terminated at the request of his new supplier (Naturgy).

- After learning of this, he proceeded to make several calls to Naturgy, through

which they informed him that he had been registered for electricity, gas, and related contracts,
and also provided him with an email address to file his complaint, as he did not agree with this registration.

- He states that, through emails dated December 1 and 16,
he filed an electronic complaint with the supposed new company (Naturgy),

requesting authorization for the transfer of his data, which he believes was used
illegally.

- He indicates that, in response to the repeated issuance of invoices, he filed a written complaint with Naturgy, stating that he would not pay any bills until the veracity of the alleged gas, electricity, and related services contract was proven. He also asked them to refrain from making threats, warnings, or coercion until the complaint was resolved.

- She maintains that, despite the complaint filed, Naturgy made a direct debit with her bank and issued various charges.

- That she received an email informing her that her data was transferred under an active contract (which does not exist, as there was no consent, and is therefore null and void).

- Despite the complaints filed, she claims to have been threatened in letters dated January 11 and 13 if she did not pay the improperly issued invoices.

- On January 26, she received the alleged contract she signed, which she states was made through an unknown phone number and an IP address whose origin is unknown.

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/26

- Finally, the court concludes that, considering this action to be fraudulent, it filed a complaint about these events with the National Police on February 7, 2023.

Along with its complaint, it attaches the following documentation:

- Emails exchanged between the complainant and the Customer Service of the respondent between December 1 and 16, 2022, with the subject line "Fraudulent Contract."

- Complaint Form submitted by the complainant to the Galician Institute of Consumer Affairs and Competition on December 22, 2022.

- Email sent by the complainant's Customer Service Guarantee Office to the respondent on January 26, 2023, with the subject line "(...)", to which two files are attached:

1. Letter from the complainant's Customer Service Guarantee Office, dated January 25, 2023, addressed to the complainant.

2. Naturgy's Dual Supply and Services Contract, dated October 26, 2022, with the complainant's personal data. Attached hereto is a
certification dated October 26, 2022, issued by Aviva Voice Systems & Services, S.L., acting as a Trusted Third Party.
-Report to the National Police of Santiago de Compostela, Report No.
\*\*\*REPORT.1, dated February 7, 2020.

SECOND: In accordance with the mechanism prior to admitting complaints to the AEPD, as provided for in Article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), which consists of forwarding the complaints to the data protection officers designated by the data controllers or processors, or to the latter when none have been designated, and for the purpose indicated in the aforementioned article, the complaint was forwarded to Naturgy, so that it could analyze it and respond within one month. The forwarding, which was carried out in accordance with the rules established in Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), was received on April 19, 2023, as

recorded in the acknowledgment of receipt in the file.

On May 19, 2023, Naturgy responded to the request, stating:

1) "The contract was made through a tool in which, during the contracting process, if the customer expresses their intention to purchase a product,

an SMS is sent containing a link to a website where the customer is shown information about the products offered and the contractual conditions, and where they must click a button to give their consent for the contract and SEPA debit. The date and time the customer expresses their willingness to purchase, as well as the IP address from which the contract is made, are recorded. The entire contracting process, from the sending of the SMS, its content, access to the linked website, selected preferences, date and time, and IP address from which consent is granted. The contracting process is certified by a Trusted Third Party, Aviva Voice Systems & Services, S.L.

Thus, as stated on the first page of the certification issued by Aviva for the contracting of the Services Subject to the Complaint, on October 26, 2022, at 1:31 p.m., an SMS was sent to the mobile phone number \*\*\*TELEPHONE.1. This SMS contained a link to the website where information on the products offered was displayed, as well as the contracting conditions, and consent to contract was requested. Subsequently, at 1:31 p.m., the aforementioned website was accessed, and the "Contract" button on said website was clicked from the address \*\*\*IP.1, confirming the intention to contract.

2) Naturgy indicates that following the first complaint filed by the complainant on

December 1, 2022, Naturgy initiated a detailed investigation into the incident, with the result that this contract was managed by the company
Soluciones Empresariales Integrales 2022 S.L., (hereinafter SEI), acting as the data processor.

Naturgy also indicates that it has verified that the data processor had not

recorded in its systems the recording of the call to contract the services that are the subject of the complaint, and therefore Naturgy has requested that the data processor
provide said recording, although SEI has not provided it to date.

3) That the contracting carried out through SEI, the data processor, was fraudulent, as it "would only seek to illicitly obtain a commission for obtaining new contracts."

4) It considers that the data processor's conduct "has not obeyed, directly or indirectly, any instructions or mandates from Naturgy, and was carried out in clear violation of the instructions and best practices that Naturgy requires of its collaborating companies. In addition to being a serious breach of contractual obligations, it constitutes fraud against Naturgy."

5) That a series of measures have been adopted against the data processor, immediately terminating the contract it had with that entity.

6) Likewise, another series of measures have been adopted "so that the Claimant does not suffer any economic harm as a result of what happened," canceling all contracts and canceling any invoices that may have been generated during the period in which the contracts were in force. Regarding the request

received requesting payment of certain amounts as compensation, Naturgy states that it responded to the claimant: "that it was not possible to meet their request for compensation. Furthermore, the Claimant's claim for compensation should be substantiated, where appropriate, before the competent judicial or arbitration authorities outside the AEPD."

THIRD: On May 31, 2023, after analyzing the documentation in the file, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency issued a resolution ordering the claim to be dismissed.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/26

FOURTH: On June 5, 2023, the complainant filed an optional appeal for reconsideration through the AEPD Electronic Registry against the

resolution issued in file EXP202304821, in which he expressed his disagreement with the contested resolution and requested that the processing of the initial claim be continued.

He attached to the aforementioned appeal documents sent by Naturgy on January 11 and 13, 2023, demanding payment of a debt.

FIFTH: On October 31, 2023, the respondent was notified of the appeal filed within the framework of the provisions of Article 118.1 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP) for the purpose of formulating allegations and submitting any documents and supporting documents it deemed appropriate. This was verified by means of a response letter dated November 13, 2023.

SIXTH: On November 23, 2023, the appeal for reconsideration filed by the complainant against the resolution of this Agency issued on May 31, 2023, which ordered the filing of the claim against Naturgy, was upheld, so that its processing could continue.

SEVENTH: According to the report collected from the AXESOR tool, NATURGY IBERIA, S.A. is a large company established in 1976, with a turnover of €3,873,110,000 in 2022.

EIGHTH: On March 12, 2024, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against the respondent, in accordance with Articles 63 and 64 of the LPACAP (Spanish Data Protection Act), for the alleged violation of Article 6.1 of the GDPR, as defined in Article 83.5 of the GDPR.

NINTH: After notification of the aforementioned initiation agreement in accordance with the rules established in the LPACAP, the respondent requested an extension of the deadline to submit allegations, which was granted. It submitted a written statement of allegations on April 8, 2024, in which, in summary, it reiterates the arguments presented in its response to the transfer process. It states: <<SEI not only failed to follow NATURGY's instructions, but completely deviated from them, constituting its conduct as outright fraud against NATURGY, which is further injured party to the extent that SEI only sought to improperly obtain a commission for the sale of products for a contract that has been proven to have been carried out through irregular practices by its agents and that, far from reporting any economic benefit to NATURGY, caused economic harm to the Claimant, which NATURGY had to compensate by reimbursing it. the bills corresponding to the energy consumed at the supply point, as well as reputational damage.

NATURGY implemented decisive measures as soon as it became aware of the facts with the aim of pursuing and sanctioning this type of conduct.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/26

As my client stated in the Response to the request for information, and given that NATURGY is absolutely intolerant of the practices carried out by SEI, NATURGY immediately implemented the following measures: (i) Request explanations from SEI and terminate the collaboration contract with said company in advance and immediately.

The termination fax sent is attached as DOCUMENT NO. 2. (ii) Apply the contractual penalty to SEI for breach of contract. (iii) Adopt the appropriate measures to ensure that the Claimant does not suffer any financial harm as a result of SEI's irregular practices, consisting of: - Terminating all contracts that may still be active. - Canceling all invoices that may have been generated during the period in which the contracts were active with NATURGY. Since the Claimant had rejected all the charges made to him, it was not necessary to make any payments to the Claimant. - Contacting the Claimant to apologize and making himself available to pay any damages that he can provide documentary evidence of and that may have been caused to him—which he alleged in his appeal for reconsideration. The irregular contracts entered into by SEI contrary to NATURGY's instructions do not allow it to be considered a data processor in the case at hand. Rather, by acting outside of NATURGY's instructions—as NATURGY has acknowledged—it therefore acted as a data controller. Considering that Article 4.8 of the GDPR defines a data processor as a natural or legal person, public authority, service, or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the data controller, as explained below, SEI did not act as a data processor in the contracts that are the subject of this complaint.

In other words, ">" means that the data processor serves the controller's interest in carrying out a specific task and, therefore, follows the instructions established by the controller, at least with regard to the purpose and essential means of the processing entrusted to it. This is precisely what is established in Article 28.10 of the GDPR, which

provides that if a data processor violates the GDPR when determining the
purposes and means of processing, it will be considered the data controller
with respect to that processing.

For example, Procedure No.: PS/00059/2020 Page 7 of 8 Likewise, Article 29
of the GDPR establishes that <>. Similarly, Article 33.2 of the LOPDGDD regulates this: <>. Additionally, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) itself insisted in its Guidelines 07/2020 adopted on July 7, 2021, that <>.
Furthermore, the EDPB already insisted in these Guidelines that when a data processor
processes data without complying with the controller's instructions and this amounts to a
decision determining the purposes and means of the processing—as would undoubtedly be the determination of the lawfulness of the processing—the processor will be deemed to have breached its obligations and will even be considered a data controller for said processing pursuant to Article 28.10 of the GDPR.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/26

In this regard, the EDPB recalls that the GDPR establishes specific obligations that directly bind data processors, so it is possible to hold a processor accountable or sanction it when it fails to comply with these obligations or acts outside or contrary to the controller's legal instructions.

The AEPD has also issued a similar ruling in its resolutions: "of the processing operation in which it participates." Therefore, it is indisputable that if a data processor processes personal data in violation of data protection regulations or

acting outside the instructions of the data controller—as SEI did—the processor is no longer considered a data processor because
it is acting de facto as a data controller.

Thus, it is evident that SEI unlawfully processed the Complainant's personal data as a data controller, as it was not only acting outside NATURGY's instructions, but also deliberately violating them with
the sole objective of committing fraud against NATURGY.

Therefore, NATURGY cannot be sanctioned for processing that SEI carried out
as an independent data controller. Even more so when Article 82.2 of the GDPR provides that the data processor is liable for damages caused by the processing when they have not complied with the GDPR obligations specifically directed at data processors or have acted outside or contrary to the legal instructions of the data controller, as occurred in the case at hand.

For all the above, I REQUEST: That this document be deemed submitted, that the allegations contained therein be formulated, and that, following the appropriate procedures, the proceedings be closed.

The following documentation is attached to the allegations:

- Contract for the provision of commercial services for collaborating companies
signed on May 1, 2022, between Naturgy Iberia, S.A. and Soluciones Empresariales Integrales 2022, S.L.

- Data processing contract signed on May 1, 2022, between Naturgy Iberia S.A. and Soluciones Empresariales Integrales 2022, S.L.

- Communication sent by Naturgy to Soluciones Empresariales Integrales 2022, S.L.
on May 15, 2023, with the subject line "Notice of early termination of the Collaboration contract due to non-compliance by the Collaborating Company."

- Email sent by the complaining party to Naturgy's Customer Service Guarantee Office on November 28, 2023, with the subject line "(...)".

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/26

- Email sent by the complainant to the Naturgy Customer Service Guarantee Office dated February 21, 2024, with the subject name (…).”

TENTH: On April 11, 2024, the investigating judge agreed to conduct the following tests: “1. The claim filed by Mr. A.A.A. and its documentation, the documents obtained and generated during the claim admission phase, are hereby reproduced for evidentiary purposes. 2. Likewise, the allegations regarding the agreement to initiate the aforementioned sanctioning procedure, submitted by NATURGY IBERIA, S.A., and the accompanying documentation, are hereby reproduced for evidentiary purposes.”

ELEVENTH: After receiving notification of the proposed resolution, on June 12, 2024, the respondent filed a written statement of allegations, reiterating the arguments already presented and summarizing Naturgy's lack of liability and culpability.

Furthermore, it notes that, as Naturgy stated in its Response to the Request for Information, after an investigation, it was concluded that the contract subject to the complaint was carried out by the collaborating company SEI, which breached each and every one of the obligations referenced in the contract signed between both parties, and that Naturgy had no way of discovering this until it received the Request for Information.

Furthermore, it indicates that there has been a change in criteria on the part of the AEPD, given that

without explaining what the change in criteria was, it has given a different assessment of facts that were already assessed and regarding which no changes have occurred nor has any information subsequently been discovered that would alter them or could modify their classification from the perspective of data protection regulations.

It states that "these matters were not justified in either the Initiation Agreement or the Resolution Proposal, an aspect that undeniably leaves my client defenseless, as already stated in the allegations presented throughout this sanctioning procedure. For this reason, all of the above contravenes the doctrine of proper acts, which must govern the actions of the Administration, as established by the Supreme Court: "The principles of legal certainty, good faith, protection of legitimate expectations, and the doctrine of proper acts inform any legal system, whether state or regional, and constitute an elementary component of either, to which public authorities must submit at all times," in accordance with the provisions of Article 3.1.e) of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector, by which the Administration must act with the principles of good faith, legitimate expectations, and institutional loyalty.

The The irregular contracts entered into by SEI contrary to NATURGY's instructions do not allow it to be considered a data processor in the case at hand. Rather, since it acted outside of NATURGY's instructions, it therefore acted as a data controller.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/26

The AEPD has also issued a similar ruling in its resolutions (PS/00059/2020):
"Data processors may be considered responsible when they have acted outside the mandate granted by the data controller, or have not fulfilled their own contractual obligations or those under the GDPR. In these cases, the data processor may be considered fully or partially responsible for the "part" of the processing operation in which it participates.

Therefore, it is indisputable that if a data processor processes personal data in violation of data protection regulations or acting outside the instructions of the data controller—as SEI did—it ceases to be considered a data processor because it is acting de facto as a data controller.

Thus, it is evident that SEI unlawfully processed the Complainant's personal data as a data controller, as it was not only acting outside NATURGY's documented instructions, but also deliberately failing to comply with them with the sole purpose of committing fraud against NATURGY.

At no time can NATURGY be considered a data controller with respect to said processing carried out by SEI, which has completely deviated from the instructions issued by NATURGY, as detailed in the allegation. Second.

SEI's actions can in no way be considered to have been carried out on behalf of NATURGY. The fact that SEI partially used a work tool provided by NATURGY does not mean that NATURGY incurs strict liability for any use SEI made of said tool, especially when, as has been amply demonstrated, this use was made in violation of NATURGY's instructions and in the commission of fraud against NATURGY itself.

However, the Draft Resolution simply states that NATURGY acted as the data controller, without taking into account the allegations presented to the Initiation Agreement and without substantiating the reasoning by which the AEPD considers, contrary to the provisions of the aforementioned regulations and Guidelines, that NATURGY acted as the data controller within the framework of data processing carried out exclusively by SEI and in violation of all documented instructions provided by NATURGY: <such as: first and last name,
ID document, address, telephone number, bank details, supply details, among other processing. Naturgy Iberia carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller, given that it determines the purposes and

means of such activity, pursuant to Article 4.7 of the GDPR>>.

That is, the Draft Resolution states, without any justification, that
NATURGY carried out said data processing and, furthermore, that it did so as data controller, deviating from the provisions of Articles 28.10 and 29

of the GDPR.

In conclusion, NATURGY cannot be sanctioned for processing that SEI has carried out as an independent data controller. This is even more so when Article

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/26

82.2 of the GDPR provides that The data processor is liable for damages caused by the processing when it has not complied with the GDPR obligations specifically directed at data processors or has acted outside or contrary to the legal instructions of the data controller, as occurred in the case at hand. Additionally, the requirements of the common administrative procedure have not been met because the doctrine of own acts is being violated, and NATURGY, as an interested party, was not notified of the upholding of the appeal for reconsideration filed by the Claimant against the Proposed Resolution to dismiss the claim against my client.

From the actions taken in this procedure and from the documentation in the file, the following have been established:

PROVEN FACTS

(…)"

EIGHTH. - On May 19, 2023, in response to the transfer of this claim, and on April 8, 2024, in the allegations to the Initiation Agreement, the respondent acknowledged that the contracting process carried out through SEI was fraudulent, stating that "it was established that this contract was managed by the company SOLUCIONES EMPRESARIALES INTEGRALES 2022 S.L. • It has been verified that SEI had not registered in Naturgy's systems the recording of the call to contract the Services Subject to the Claim, so Naturgy has requested that SEI provide said recording, but to date, SEI has not provided it. • The Claimant indicates that the contracting process was carried out through a telephone and an IP address that is unknown to him. Naturgy has carried out checks and has identified certain irregular practices by SEI in relation to said IP address. • It has This has led to SEI's reluctance to collaborate with the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/26

investigation" because "it would only pursue the illicit obtaining of a commission for the

LEGAL BASIS

I
Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR) and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The Procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, this Organic Law, the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II
Response to the allegations presented

In relation to the allegations of the respondent, who states: <<The irregular contracts carried out by SEI against the instructions of NATURGY do not allow it to be considered a data processor in the case at hand. Rather, by acting outside of NATURGY's instructions—as they have acknowledged—they therefore acted as a data controller: Considering that Article 4.8 of the GDPR defines the role of data processor as any natural or legal person, public authority, service, or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the data controller. of the processing, as will be explained below, SEI did not act as a data processor in the contracts that are the subject of this complaint.

In other words, "> means that the data processor serves the data controller's interest in carrying out a specific task and, therefore, follows the instructions established by the data controller, at least as regards the essential purpose and means of the processing entrusted to it." This is precisely established in Article 28.10 of the GDPR, which provides that if a data processor infringes the GDPR by determining the purposes and means of processing, it will be considered a data controller with respect to that processing.

On this matter, Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of "controller" and "processor" in the GDPR, adopted by the EDPB on July 7, 2021, detail the following:

“Although the elements provided for in Article 28 of the Regulation constitute its essential content, the contract should serve to enable the controller and the processor to clarify, through detailed instructions, how these fundamental elements will be applied in practice.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 15/26

elements. Therefore, the data processing contract should not be limited to reproducing the provisions of the GDPR, but should include more specific and concrete information on how the requirements will be met and the degree of security that will be required for the processing of the personal data subject to the data processing contract. Far from being a merely formal exercise, the negotiation and stipulation of the terms of the contract serve to specify the details of the processing.”

They add that “Generally, the data processing contract establishes who is the determining party (the data controller) and who is the party that follows the instructions (the data processor).” However, “If one party decides in practice how and why personal data is processed, that party will be the data controller, even if the contract stipulates that it is the data processor.”

Regarding “Purposes and Means,” the aforementioned guidelines include the following considerations:
“(…)
Dictionaries define the word purpose as “an anticipated result that is pursued or that guides the intended action” and the word means as “the manner in which a result is obtained or an objective is achieved.”

(…)
Determining purposes and means is equivalent to deciding, respectively, the “why” and “how” of the processing: in a specific processing operation, the data controller is the party that determines why the processing takes place (i.e., “for what purpose” or “for what purpose”). "for what purpose") and how this objective will be achieved

(i.e., what means will be used to achieve it). A natural or legal person who
influences the processing of personal data in this way is therefore involved in determining the purposes and means of such processing in accordance with the definition provided in Article 4(7) of the GDPR.

The controller must decide on both the purpose and the means of processing, as described below. Consequently, it cannot simply determine the purpose: it must also make decisions on the means of processing. In contrast, the party acting as processor can never determine the purpose of processing. In practice, if a controller uses a processor to carry out processing on its behalf, the processor will normally be able to make certain decisions of its own regarding how the processing will be carried out. The EDPB recognizes that the processor may have some leeway in making some decisions about processing. In this sense, it is necessary to clarify what degree of influence on the "why" and "how" a data controller has on the data, and to what extent the data processor can make its own decisions. (…)”
Well, the respondent adds that the collaborating company did not follow its instructions, but rather completely deviated from them. However, the respondent not only must give instructions to SEI, as it states, but is also obliged to supervise its actions, that is, it must establish compliance controls to ensure that they are followed and thus detect any illegal or inappropriate activity by the data processor, which the respondent did not do.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 16/26

For further details, it is necessary to refer to the Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union, of December 5, 2023, issued in Case C-
683/21 (Nacionalinis visiomenès sveikatos centras), which states:

“83 With regard, secondly, to Regarding the question of whether an administrative fine under Article 83 of the GDPR may be imposed on a controller in relation to processing operations carried out by a processor, it should be recalled that, according to the definition in Article 4(8) of the GDPR, a processor is defined as "a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller."

84 Since, as indicated in paragraph 36 of this judgment, a controller is responsible not only for any processing of personal data carried out by it, but also for processing carried out on its behalf, an administrative fine may be imposed on that controller under Article 83 of the GDPR in a situation where the personal data are subject to unlawful processing and where it is not the controller, but a processor engaged in the processing. on your account."

As well as citing the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of December 5, 2022, in Case C-807/21 (Deutsche Wohnen), which states:

"24 Indeed, according to the aforementioned court, this case law, like the majority of national doctrine, attaches particular importance to the concept of "undertaking" within the meaning of Articles 101 TFEU and 102 TFEU, and therefore to the idea that liability is attributed to the economic entity in which the undesirable behavior, for example, anti-competitive behavior, has been adopted. In its view, according to this "functional" conception, all acts of all employees authorized to act on behalf of a company are also attributable to the company within the framework of an administrative procedure.

44 With regard to legal persons, this implies, on the one hand, as the Advocate General has essentially pointed out in points 57 to 59 of his Opinion, that they are liable not only for infringements committed by their representatives, directors, or managers, but also by any other person acting within the scope of the business activity of those legal persons and on their behalf. Secondly, the administrative fines provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR in the event of such infringements must be imposed directly on legal persons, since they can be classified as controllers of the data processing in question.

Therefore, in view of the foregoing, the controller of personal data may be liable for the negligent actions of the employees of its processor.

Naturgy has stated in its arguments that this conclusion deviates from other pronouncements of this AEPD. However, it argues this by invoking a precedent in which the entity responsible for the processing, and not the data processor, is sanctioned based on legal grounds similar to those assessed in this ruling.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 17/26

Thus, this precedent states:

“Article 33.2 of the LOPDGDD indicates that those who “in their own name and without it being proven that they are acting on behalf of another, establish relationships with the data subjects” are considered to be controllers and not processors; which, interpreted in the opposite sense, means that a processor is someone who, on behalf of the controller, establishes relationships with the data subjects. This applies regardless of whether this requires access to data on behalf of third parties.

As a processor, it does not have any personal interest in the outcome of the processing commissioned, without prejudice to the financial compensation it receives for the service provided, which is what occurs in the case examined. Processors do not have any personal interest; they act on behalf of and in the name of the controller, fulfilling its orders and for the purposes of the latter, and this is what determines that they are processors from the outset."

"The existence of a processor depends on a decision taken by the controller, who may decide to carry out certain processing operations themselves or contract all or part of the processing to a processor. The essence of the "processor" role is that personal data are processed on behalf of and on behalf of the controller.

In practice, it is the controller who determines the purpose and means, at least the essential ones, while the processor has the role of providing services to the controllers. In other words, "acting on behalf of and on behalf of the controller" means that the processor serves the controller's interest in carrying out a specific task and, therefore, follows the instructions established by the controller, at least with regard to the purpose and essential means of the entrusted processing."

“Furthermore, the processing materially carried out by a data processor on behalf of the data controller falls within the latter's sphere of action, just as if it were carried out directly by the controller itself. The data processor, in the case examined, is an extension of the data controller.

The data controller has the obligation to integrate and deploy data protection within its entire organization, in all its areas. It must be kept in mind that, ultimately, the determining purpose is to guarantee the protection of the data subject.

Interpreting it the other way around—the obligations that Article 28 of the GDPR imposes on the data controller are limited to verifying the processor's capabilities ab initio and signing the data processor contract—would not only contravene current legislation, constituting clearly fraudulent conduct, but would also violate the spirit and purpose of the GDPR.”

“…processors may be held liable when they have acted outside the mandate granted by the data controller, or have not fulfilled their own contractual obligations or those under the GDPR. In these cases, the data processor may be held fully or partially responsible for the “part” of the processing operation in which they are involved. The data processor will only be fully liable when they are entirely responsible for the damage caused to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects affected; all of this, without evading any liability incurred by the data controller in order to avoid such damage.”

In order to respond to the allegation that there was a change in criteria without sufficient reasoning, it is sufficient to refer to the Background, which addresses this issue. It should be noted that the claimant filed an appeal against this Agency's decision to dismiss the claim, providing new documentation along with the appeal. The appeal was sent by the respondent to the claimant on January 11 and 13, 2023, demanding payment of a debt.

Contrary to what Naturgy stated, the upholding of the appeal filed by the claimant, which led to the admission of the claim for processing, does not violate the doctrine of proper actions.

Furthermore, on October 31, 2023, the respondent was notified of the appeal filed, which was verified by a response letter dated November 13, 2023. On November 23, 2023, the appeal for reconsideration filed by the complainant against this Agency's resolution issued on May 31, 2023, which ordered the dismissal of the complaint, was upheld. The appeal stated:

"In this case, it is observed that the entity in charge of the contracting, acting on behalf of the respondent, engaged in fraudulent conduct, which is fully acknowledged by the respondent, causing harm to the client. The contracting system allows entities other than the respondent, for whose actions it denies all responsibility, to execute contracts on its behalf.
It is also noteworthy that, despite the fact that the respondent The Agency insists that appropriate measures be established for the fulfillment of these contracts and that this is an act of bad faith by the specific entity involved in the contract.

There is a precedent for fraudulent contracts, carried out under similar terms, in other files of this Agency, all of which were carried out on behalf of NATURGY IBERIA, S.A. by contracted entities other than the one indicated in this proceeding. Therefore, in this case, the appeal filed should be upheld.

Regarding the existence of a lack of defense, for it to be assessed, it is not sufficient that a formal violation has occurred; rather, a lack of defense of a material nature must have occurred. In the words of the Constitutional Court, STC 290/1993, legal ground 4, "For a lack of defense to be considered with constitutional relevance, which places the interested party outside any possibility of alleging and defending their rights in the proceedings, a merely formal violation is not enough. It is necessary that this formal violation result in a material effect of lack of defense, an effective and real impairment of the right to defense (STC 149/1998, C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 19/26

legal ground 3), with the consequent real and effective harm to the affected interested parties (SSTC 155/1988, legal basis 4, and 112/1989, legal basis 2).

The National Court has also ruled on this matter, among others, in its Judgment, Administrative Litigation Division, Section 1, of June 25, 2009 (rec. 638/2008), which states that, "this Court has reiterated on numerous occasions (SAN 8-3-2006, Rec. 319/2004, for all), echoing the doctrine of the Constitutional Court, that for a procedural defect to result in the nullity of the contested act, it is necessary that the irregularities are not merely procedural, but rather defects that cause a situation of defenselessness of a material, not merely formal, nature, that is, that they have caused the appellant a real impairment of his right to defense, causing him real and effective harm" (SSTC 155/1988, of June 22). July, 212/1994, of July 13, and 78/1999, of April 26).

In short, for the prohibition on defenselessness to be violated, it is necessary that
a situation of defenselessness actually exists, which did not occur in this case,
since, on October 27, 2023, the appeal filed was forwarded to Naturgy Iberia, S.A., and on the 31st of the same month and year, the respondent party accessed the content thereof within the framework of the provisions of Article 118.1 of the LPACAP,

for the purpose of formulating allegations and submitting the documents and supporting documents it deemed appropriate. Furthermore, the respondent party has been able to allege
in the sanctioning procedure everything it deemed appropriate,
so no material defenselessness has occurred.

It should also be noted that the decision granting the appeal for reconsideration, which admitted the claim that gave rise to these proceedings, was notified to the complainant in accordance with the provisions of Article 65.5 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Organic Law on the Protection of Personal Data), according to which "The decision on whether to admit or reject the claim for processing, as well as the decision determining, where appropriate, the referral of the claim to the principal supervisory authority deemed competent, must be notified to the complainant..."

III

Unfulfilled Obligation

Well, the defendant is charged with committing an infringement for violating

Article 6 of the GDPR, "Lawfulness of Processing," which sets forth in section 1 the circumstances in which the processing of third-party data is considered lawful:

"1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:

a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes;

b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the implementation, at the request of the data subject, of pre-contractual measures;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 20/26

c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the data controller;

d) processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person;

e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;

f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, provided that such interests are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. Point (f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their tasks.

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.1 of the GDPR, it is established that personal data has been processed, since Naturgy Iberia collects and stores, among other processing operations, the following personal data of individuals, such as: first and last name, identity document, address, telephone number, bank details, and supply data, among other processing operations.

Naturgy Iberia carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller,

since it determines the purposes and means of such activity, pursuant to Article 4.7 of the GDPR.

It has been established that the respondent activated the gas and electricity contracts and the maintenance services, and the respective invoices and payment orders were issued.

Furthermore, the documentation in the file shows that the respondent violated Article 6.1 of the GDPR, as it processed the complainant's personal data without any legal authority to do so. The complainant's personal data was incorporated into the company's information systems, without proof that it had legitimately contracted, obtained her consent for the collection and subsequent processing of her personal data, or that there was any other reason that made the processing lawful.

The complainant's personal data was recorded in the respondent's files and processed to issue invoices for services associated with the complainant. Consequently, the complainant processed the personal data without proof that it had the legal authority to do so.

Article 6.1 of the GDPR states that processing "shall be lawful if necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party."

It was therefore essential that the respondent prove to this Agency that the

claimant had contracted gas and electricity supplies with it; that at the time of the contract, it had exercised the due diligence required by the circumstances of the
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 21/26

case to ensure that the person who processed the cancellation of the gas and electricity contracts, registering new ones with the claimant, was indeed the contract holder.

Well, it should be noted first that, in a response dated May 19, 2023, to the transfer action sent to Naturgy, the latter stated that: 1) "The contract was made through a tool in which, during the contracting process, if the customer expresses their intention to purchase a product, they are sent an SMS containing a link to a website where the customer is shown information on the products offered and contractual conditions, and where they must click a button to give their consent for the contract and SEPA debit. The date and time the customer expresses their willingness to purchase, as well as the IP address from which the contract is made, are thus recorded. The entire contracting process, from the sending of the SMS, its content, access to the linked website, selected preferences, date and time, and IP address from which the contract is consented to, is certified by a Trusted Third Party, the entity Aviva Voice

Systems & Services, S.L.

Thus, as stated on the first page of the certification issued by Aviva
for the contracting of the Services Subject to the Complaint, on (...) an SMS was sent to the mobile phone number \*\*\*TELÉPHONE.1. This SMS contained a link

to the website where information about the products offered was displayed, as well as the contracting conditions, and consent to contract was requested.
Then, at 1:31 p.m., the aforementioned website was accessed, and from the address
\*\*\*IP.1, the "Contract" button on said website was clicked, confirming the intention to contract.

2) Naturgy indicates that following the first complaint filed by the complainant on December 1, 2022, Naturgy initiated a detailed investigation into the incident, with the result that this contract was managed by the company
Soluciones Empresariales Integrales 2022 S.L. (hereinafter, SEI), as the data processor.

Naturgy also indicates that it has verified that the data processor had not recorded in its systems the recording of the call to contract the services that are the subject of the complaint. Therefore, Naturgy has requested that the data processor provide said recording, which SEI has not provided to date.

3) That the contract entered into through SEI was fraudulent, as it "would only seek to illicitly obtain a commission for obtaining new contracts."

4) It considers that SEI's conduct "has not obeyed, directly or indirectly, any instruction or mandate from Naturgy, and would have been carried out in clear contravention of the instructions and good practices that Naturgy requires of its collaborating companies and, in addition to a serious breach of contractual obligations, would constitute fraud against Naturgy."

5) That a series of measures have been adopted against SEI, immediately terminating the contract it had signed with that entity.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 22/26

Therefore, Naturgy has acknowledged the existence of improper conduct in the management of the complaining party's data, as indicated by the contract executed through a data processor, which was fraudulent. The telephone number to which the SMS confirmation of the contract was sent was not verified.

Furthermore, the file shows that the complainant informed Naturgy, via email dated December 1, 2022, that it had not requested activation of the supplies referred to in the complaint nor signed any contract with said entity. These supplies were terminated due to a change of supplier made by the complainant itself, which reactivated said supplies with its previous supplier, and not in response to this complaint, as the respondent appears to claim.
It also shows that, despite the complaint filed by the complainant

with Naturgy, the latter subsequently issued invoices and payment requests and cancelled the charges issued in February 2024 once the complaint that gave rise to the proceedings was admitted for processing by the AEPD.

In view of the above, the respondent fails to demonstrate that it acted diligently and, consequently, there was unlawful processing of the complainant's personal data, thereby violating Article 6 of the GDPR.

In this regard, Recital 40 of the GDPR states:

“(40) For processing to be lawful, personal data must be processed with the consent of the data subject or on another legitimate basis established by law, whether in this Regulation, including the need for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the controller or the need to perform a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.”

Based on the above, Naturgy is considered to have violated Article 6.1 of the GDPR.

IV
Classification and qualification of the violation

The violation is classified in Article 83.5 of the GDPR, which states:

“5. Violations of the following provisions shall be punishable, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

1. The basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9.”

For the purposes of the statute of limitations for infringements, Article 72.1 of the LOPDGD classifies as a very serious infringement, with the statute of limitations being three years, “b)
The processing of personal data without any of the conditions for the lawfulness of processing established in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 being met.”

V
Proposed Sanction

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:

“Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 9, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.”

“Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures provided for in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j).When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:

a) the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them;

b) the intentionality or negligence of the infringement;

c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects;

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;

e) any previous infringements committed by the controller or processor;

f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the infringement and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the infringement;

(g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

(h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the breach and, if so, to what extent;

(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have been previously ordered against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with those measures;

(j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42; and

(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly through the breach.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 24/26

or indirectly, through the breach.

Regarding section k) of Article 83.2 of the GDPR, Article 76 of the LOPDGDD, "Sanctions and Corrective Measures," provides:

"2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

the following may also be taken into account:

a) The ongoing nature of the infringement.

b) The connection between the infringer's activity and the processing of personal data.

c) The benefits obtained as a result of the infringement.

d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the infringement.

e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the acquiring entity.

f) The impact on the rights of minors.

g) The availability of a data protection officer, when not mandatory.

h) Voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in those cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.

In accordance with the transcribed provisions, for the purposes of determining the amount of the fine to be imposed on the defendant, as the party responsible for an infringement classified as Article 83.5.a) of the GDPR, the following factors are considered concurrent:
- The seriousness of the infringement, taking into account the scope of the processing operation, a circumstance provided for in Article 83.2.a) of the GDPR.

A significant circumstance in the case examined is that it was an electricity and gas supply contract, and related contracts, to which the defendant allegedly linked the complainant's personal data and the issuance of the corresponding invoices.

- "The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data," a circumstance provided for in Article 76.2.b) of the LOPDGDD (General Data Protection Act) in conjunction with Article 83.2.k) of the GDPR.

The defendant's business activity necessarily processes data. personal data,
being one of the largest gas and electricity companies in Spain. This
characteristic of its business activity has an impact, reinforcing it, on the diligence it

must display in compliance with the principles governing the processing of personal data and on the quality and effectiveness of the technical and
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 25/26

organizational measures it must implement to guarantee respect for fundamental rights.

The Ruling of the National Court of 17/10/2007 (rec. 63/2006), in which,
regarding entities whose activity involves the continuous processing of customer data, states that "...the Supreme Court has held that negligence exists whenever a legal duty of care is disregarded, that is, when the
