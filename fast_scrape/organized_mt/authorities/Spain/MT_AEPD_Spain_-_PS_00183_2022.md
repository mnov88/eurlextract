## English Summary

### Facts

In October 2017, the data subject moved to a new address and notified CaixaBank (the controller). However, in 2020, they noticed that the controller was still making use of their old address. That year, the data subject requested the rectification of their address in July and one more time in September. In the first answer, the controller asked the data subject to submit the request through one specific email address. On a second communication, it requested additional information from the data subject to proceed with the change. Finally, the controller notified them that the request was sent to the specialised department.

After realising that the request had not been complied with, the data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA who started proceedings against the controller. In the evidence submitted by the controller, there were some documents and communications sent to the new address and others to the old address. The controller claimed that the DPA proceeding should be declared null due to procedural errors since the investigative body should not quantify the fine in the proposed decision, that being a violation of the right to an impartial judge. Secondly, the controller stated that the right of rectification was observed with no delay since there is evidence of communications with the data subject. Finally, regarding the two contracts with the old address, the controller manifested that the data subject supplied that address (the old one) when the contract was signed.

For these reasons, the controller requested that the investigative phase should be declared null and void, the fine should be dismissed and replaced with a reprimand.

### Holding

Regarding the first claim, the Spanish DPA referred to the national administrative procedural law which foresees the possibility to reduce the penalties (in case of voluntary payment and admission of guilt) and stated that for the application of those reductions it is necessary to quantify the fine. Furthermore, according to national case law, the principle of separation between the investigative body and the sentencing body does not apply to administrative proceedings nor is the right to an impartial judge applicable in these proceedings. Additionally, the quantification of the fine cannot be seen as a serious violation of the fundamental rights of the defendant.

Regarding the violation of the right of rectification of [Article 16 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_16_GDPR "Article 16 GDPR") and [Article 14 of LOPDGDD](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673), the national data protection law, the DPA stated that [Article 12(4) LOPDGDD](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673) obliges the controller to provide evidence of compliance with the requests related to the data subject’s rights foreseen in Articles 15 to 22 GDPR. Moreover, [Article 72(1)(k) LOPDGDD](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673), considers as a serious violations the repeated lack of attention to these requests. In the present case, in February 2021 (the date of the complaint), the address was not rectified yet for all the documents related to the data subject. In fact, the controller provided as evidence bank statements from 31 January 2021 and 31 May 2021 with the old address and other documents with the new address, showing that the controller was aware of the data subject’s new address.

Regarding the substitution of the fine with a reprimand, the DPA alluded to Recital 148 GDPR which stated that the applicable sanctions for the violation of the Regulation are fines.

Finally, the DPA imposed a fine of €25,000 on the controller for a violation of [Article 16 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_16_GDPR "Article 16 GDPR"), considering as aggravating factors the activity of the controller and the delay in the rectification requested.

FOURTH: On April 20, 2022, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the claimed party,
in accordance with the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1,
of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Public Administrations (in
hereinafter, LPACAP), for the alleged violation of Article 16 of the RGPD, typified in
Article 83.5 of the RGPD.

FIFTH: Notification of the initiation agreement, the claimed party, by means of documents presented
on May 6 and June 3, 2022, requests that, in accordance with article 32.1 of
the aforementioned LPACAP, the term initially granted for
formulate allegations in accordance with article 53.1.a) of the LPACAP, and be provided with a

copy of the documents that make up the administrative file.

It is agreed to extend the term to formulate allegations by the maximum allowed
legally and send the copy of the electronic file to the claimed party.

SIXTH: On May 13, 2022, the respondent presents her allegations to the
agreement to open the sanctioning procedure in which it requests that it be declared
the nullity of full right of the procedure for the reasons detailed in the
first allegation of your brief. Subsidiarily, request that the file be remembered
of the procedure for non-existence of infringement of data protection regulations
of personal. And, in the alternative with respect to the previous claims, that

it is agreed to warn the claimed party (article 58.2.b) RGPD.

In defense of their respective claims, they adduce the following arguments:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/20

<<First. - Of the defenselessness caused to my principal as a consequence of the
fixing the amount of the sanction in the initial agreement that, in our opinion, would vitiate

of nullity the same. Indeed, the first and fourth paragraphs of the operative part
of the Initiation Agreement of this sanctioning procedure indicate verbatim
that the criteria to be taken into account to graduate the amount will be determined
of the sanction that, in the judgment of the Sanctioning Body, should be imposed in this case "without
prejudice to what results from the investigation”, ruling in the following
terms: “In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what may result

of the instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the sanction of a fine
to impose on the defendant as responsible for an infraction typified in article
83.5.b) of the RGPD, in an initial assessment, they are estimated to be concurrent in this
case, as aggravating factors, the following factors: - The evident connection of the
responsible for data processing. (art.83.2. k) of the RGPD in relation to art.

76.2 b of the LOPDGDD). - The time since the claimant requested the
rectification until it was carried out (art. 83.2 a) of the RGPD).”

In this way, the Sanctioning Body comes to determine in the act that supposes the
start of the processing of the sanctioning procedure what is the sanctioning reproach
that, in his opinion, it is appropriate to impose on my client, even evaluating the mitigating and
concurrent aggravating circumstances in the case, despite the fact that Caixabank has not had the opportunity to

no time to reveal before the aforementioned body what could be the
circumstances that could be applicable in this case, given that,
obviously, he could not have been aware of the opening of the procedure until
has been notified of the agreement in which they are unilaterally appreciated by the Body
Sanctioning the aforementioned circumstances. All this supposes, in the opinion of this

Entity, conduct that significantly affects the application of the principles
fundamental principles of criminal law that, with certain specifications, are applicable to
sanctioning administrative procedure, as has been shown
reiterated jurisprudence of our Constitutional Court.

In summary, in this procedure the Sanctioning Body itself does in the Agreement
Start an assessment (anticipated and lacking any motivation), of the

responsibility of this Entity, even indicating, even if only for its
mere mention, the concurrent aggravating circumstances in the case, even when formally
intends to leave safe what finally proceeds based on the instruction. Well
well, from the foregoing one can only draw the conclusion that, to be said with the greatest
respect, the legality of the administrative action is seriously affected,

every time the degree of culpability of the Entity in the
alleged commission of the offending conduct, without being able to in any way
moment to carry out any allegation that allows the Sanctioning Body
assess, even minimally, the concurrent circumstances in the case in light of
these allegations. All this leads to the generation of an absolute and total
defenselessness to this part, which at no time can make use of its right

in order to highlight the inaccuracy of the valuation carried out by the
Sanctioning Body when determining a limine the amount of the sanction that "could
correspond” for the, still, alleged violation of article 6.1 in relation to 5.1.
a) both of the RGPD, since it was not yet a party to the procedure, for the simple
reason that the sanction is fixed in the act by which it begins.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/20

Well, the fact that the Sanctioning Body establishes in the initial agreement
the amount of the sanction that, in his opinion, should be imposed on this Entity, affects
substantially to the impartiality of the performance of the Investigating Body, which is

aware, before starting the processing of the procedure, of what is the criterion of the
Body to which it will finally submit the file for the imposition of the sanction that
“could correspond”, with respect to the amount of the same and the circumstances
modifications of the responsibility that must be taken into account in its
determination. Thus, the scope of action of the body is substantially affected.
competent for instruction.

On the other hand, the invocation that the Initiation Agreement makes of article 85 is not ignored
of the LPACAP. However, in the opinion of this party, the rules established in the
Article 85 are not applicable in the present case, since said rule
is applicable to cases in which the sanctioning rule imposes a fine
of a fixed and objective nature for the commission of an infraction, so that only
It corresponds to the accused to debate the effective concurrence of the typical conduct.

In consideration of the foregoing, this party understands that there is a radical defect in the
processing of this sanctioning file that affects the nullity of the
procedure, while the investigation phase has been contaminated by the
action of the Sanctioning Body that, when assessing the amount of the sanction that
proceed to impose, has compromised the impartiality of the Instructor, of which he is superior

hierarchical, having evaluated the causes of aggravation of the responsibility to its
concurrent trial in the case and has quantified what should be, in his opinion, the
sanctioning reproach that must be imposed on this part.

The consequence of all the above is that there is a radical defect in the processing of
this sanctioning file, derived from an interpretation contrary to the
Constitution of articles 64 and 85 of the LPACAP, which affects the nullity of the

procedure, having violated the fundamental rights of my principal, as
and as established in article 47.1 a) of the LPACAP.

(twenty five thousand euros).

On July 19, 2022, the respondent presented arguments to the proposal for

resolution in which it requests that the nullity be declared in full right of the
procedure for the reasons detailed in the first allegation of his brief.

Subsidiarily, it requests that the procedure be archived due to the non-existence
violation of the personal data protection regulations. And with character
subsidiary with respect to the previous claims, that it be agreed to warn the

claimed (article 58.2.b) RGPD.

In defense of their respective claims, they reaffirm their allegations to the
initial agreement and consider reproduced the same, indicate that there is no
any accreditation of the alleged "delay" in the response to the exercise of rights
and, consequently, evidence of any charge that motivates a possible sanction to the

Entity.

Likewise, it states that the Resolution Proposal includes the same aggravating factors
that were indicated in the Initiation Agreement, without upholding any of their allegations, and

insists on the arguments put forward in the Initiation Agreement, namely: "being
accredited that the claimed party did not exercise any right of rectification through the
channel "My manager" in 2017, in the opinion of my client there is no delay between the

request for rectification and the response provided, as you can already prove in the
exercises of rights on 11/4/20 and 04/21/21, both answered within the term

of one month indicated in article 12.3 of the RGPD. My principal, as responsible for the
treatment of the claimant's data, proceeded in a timely manner to respond
motivated to exercise their rights, complying at all times with the regulations

applicable and facilitating the channels by which the claimant could modify their data.
What's more, the modification of your address information was immediate at the time when
that the claimant, on 5/3/21, went to his office and requested the change”

The questions that the respondent has raised in her
two briefs of allegations and that are unrelated to the merits of the matter on which the

sanctioning procedure in question.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/20

In its allegations to the proposed resolution the one claimed, in addition to expressing
that “reiterates” in full the allegations that it made in the face of the agreement to open the
procedure, affects again the questions, unrelated to the merits of the matter, that

already raised in his first pleadings brief.

This Agency also reiterates what it stated in the motion for a resolution in
response to the allegations put forward by the respondent against the initiation agreement.

In the opinion of the respondent, the opening agreement is invalidated by the
helplessness generated by the fact that the AEPD has set the amount
of the sanction, instead of expressing only the limits of the possible sanction; because I don't know

have motivated the aggravating circumstances and because through the initial agreement a
assessment of the defendant's guilt without having had the opportunity to
pronounce on it. It also adds that the initial agreement exceeds the content
provided for in article 68 of the LOPDGDD and that, since the decision-making body has set the
amount of the sanction in the agreement to open the procedure, has been seen
compromised the impartiality of the examining body, which thus knows, before initiating the

procedure, the criterion of the body to which the file must be submitted, what
determines in his opinion a “clear break in the principle of phase separation
instructor and sanction”.

The respondent understands that the rules of article 85 of the LPACAP are not applicable
to the present case but to the cases in which the sanctioning norm imposes a
fixed and objective fine and that the application that has been made of this precept

in the initial agreement does not respect its literal meaning, according to which the amount of the
pecuniary sanction may be determined "initiated the sanctioning procedure", therefore
that, maintains the entity, "it would be assimilating" "the very act of initiation with the
fact that the procedure has been initiated”.

The arguments put forward by the respondent cannot be admitted.

The opening agreement is in accordance with the provisions of article 68 of the LOPDGDD,

according to which it will suffice to specify the facts that motivate the opening,
identify the person or entity against whom the procedure is directed, the infraction
that he could have committed and his possible sanction. In the same sense, it is expressed
Article 64.2 of the LPACAP that refers to the minimum content of the agreement of
initiation. According to this precept, among other details, it must contain “the facts that

motivate the initiation of the procedure, its possible legal qualification and the sanctions
that may correspond, without prejudice to what results from the investigation.” Thus,
In this case, not only the requirements mentioned in the precepts
cited, but goes further, offering reasoning that justifies the possible
legal qualification of the facts and the circumstances that may influence

in determining the penalty.

It cannot be ignored that article 85 of the LPACAP - which contemplates the possibility of
apply reductions on the amount of the sanction in the event that the offender
recognizes its responsibility and in case of voluntary payment of the sanction - obliges
determine those reductions in the notification of the agreement to initiate the
procedure, which necessarily implies that said agreement must establish the

amount of the sanction corresponding to the imputed acts. End that justifies
amply that it refers to the modifying circumstances of the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/20

responsibility, since these directly affect the determination of the amount of
The sanction.

Contrary to the thesis defended by the defendant, article 85 of the LPACAP does not provide
nor that the amount of the sanction is determined once the procedure has begun.

On the contrary, it is the acknowledgment of responsibility and the voluntary payment of
sanction what has to take place after that moment, but not the fixation
of its amount.

Regarding that according to which article 85 LPACAP could only be applied to
assumptions in which the sanctioning norm imposes a fixed fine and

objective and that the application that has been made of this precept in the initial agreement
does not respect its literal meaning, it must be indicated that the AEPD has been applying article 85
LPACAP in the same way since the entry into force of the aforementioned law without the Chamber of the
Administrative Litigation of the National Court, before which it is possible to appeal
contentious administrative against its resolutions, has never pronounced itself in
line with the criterion that this entity defends.

Nor can it be admitted that having indicated in the initial agreement the sanctions
that could correspond to that claimed for the imputed infractions is
determinant of helplessness or involves a breach of the principle of separation of
instruction and resolution phases, since this Agency is limited to complying with
this to one of the requirements set forth in the standards outlined. to major
abundance, also articles 68 of the LOPDGDD and 64.2 of the LPACAP require

as content of the opening agreement that the sanction that could
correspond.

Thus, the alleged rupture "of the principle of separation of the instructional phase and
sanction” that the claimed claim adduces -an extreme that this Agency denies- would be, if it existed, the
consequence of the correct application that this Agency has been making of a

legal precept, article 85 of the LPACAP.

Regarding what was stated by the respondent that, having established the opening agreement
the amount of the sanction and the modifying circumstances of the responsibility that
could be appreciated, she has not had the opportunity to comment, we limit ourselves to pointing out
that the administrative procedure begins precisely with the opening agreement
and it is from then -not before- when article 53 of the LPACAP recognizes the

interested party a series of rights, among them the one foreseen in article 53.1.e).

Lastly, as regards the vice of nullity which, in the opinion of the respondent,
suffers from the procedure as a result of the defenselessness that he claims to have suffered
The following should be noted: First of all, the respondent does not specify in what
section of article 47.1 of the LPACAP founds the nullity that it invokes.

Secondly, the invoked nullity of the procedure in no case could

based on section a) of article 47.1. of the LPACAP, in connection with the
alleged rupture of the separation between the instruction phase and the resolution phase according to the
article 24.2 of the C.E. This, because according to the SSTC 74/2004 and 175/2005, the
principle enshrined in article 24.2 of the C.E. under which the instructor does not
resolves, is not applicable to the administrative procedure, so that in this area

We are not facing a right with constitutional rank.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/20

And finally, thirdly, in the event that it is intended to establish the nullity of the
procedure in the reason included in section e) of article 47.1 of the LPACAP
it seems appropriate to bring up STC 78/1999, of April 26, which in its

Legal Basis 2, says:

“Thus, according to reiterated constitutional doctrine that is synthesized in the foundation
legal 3 of the STC 62/1998, "the estimation of an amparo appeal by the
existence of breaches of procedural rules 'does not simply result from the
assessment of the eventual violation of the right due to the existence of a defect
procedural more or less serious, but it is necessary to prove the effective concurrence

of a state of material or real defenselessness' (STC 126/1991, legal basis 5º;
STC 290/1993, legal basis 4º). So that a helplessness can be estimated
with constitutional relevance, which places the interested party outside any possibility of
claim and defend their rights in the process, a violation is not enough
merely formal, being necessary that a formal effect be derived from this formal infringement.
defenseless material, an effective and real impairment of the right of defense (STC

149/1998, legal basis 3), with the consequent real and effective damage to the
affected stakeholders (SSTC 155/1988, legal basis 4, and 112/1989,
2nd legal basis).

In view of the foregoing, the request of the respondent to declare the nullity of the
sanctioning administrative procedure that concerns us must be rejected.

To end the chapter on the alleged radical nullity of the procedure that the

claimed adduces in its defence, the following considerations should be added.

One of them related to the fundamental right to an impartial judge guaranteed in the
article 24.2 of the C.E. The respondent has referred in her two writings of
allegations that the action of the AEPD has determined that it has "seen
substantially affected the impartiality of the investigating body”, which is why

We take this opportunity to specify that this alleged affectation of the impartiality of the
instructor does not fit into that fundamental right guaranteed by article
24.2 of the C.E., for which reason the nullity of the procedure could not be founded on it either.
under section a) of article 47.1 of the LPACAP.

Regarding the right to an impartial judge, it should be noted that, furthermore, it is not
that this guarantee is not transferable to the instructor - who is the one about whom the claimed

pivots the much-desired nullity of the procedure - but not even
recognizes this right within the framework of the administrative procedure. The STC 76/1990,
legal basis 8, could not be clearer:

“The right to \[...\] and to a process with all the guarantees -among them, the independence
and impartiality of the judge - is a characteristic guarantee of the judicial process that does not
extends to the administrative procedure, since the strict impartiality and

independence of the organs of the judiciary is not, by essence, predicable with
equal meaning and to the same extent of the administrative bodies (SSTC
175/1987 and 22/1990...”. (emphasis ours)

Lastly, regarding the minimum content of the opening agreement foreseen in the
article 64 of the LPACAP and the "manifest contradiction" in which, according to the entity,

would have been incurred by saying that it "goes beyond" that minimum content, it is enough

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/20

point out that article 64.2 indicates that "it must contain at least", "b) \[...\] the
sanctions that may correspond, without prejudice to what results from the investigation.

So, as stated at the time, the agreement to open this
procedure not only met the requirements of article 64.2 LPACAP - it established the facts

that motivate the initiation of the procedure, its possible qualification and the sanctions that
could correspond - but "went further" because it detailed, among other things,
the modifying circumstances of the responsibility that were appreciated in that phase.

With this, neither "a kind of benefit is granted to the company" nor are they "undermined"
“the rights enshrined in article 24 of the Constitution.”, as we

reproaches the claimed. Comment that is still striking if we take into account
that one of the arguments put forward by the respondent in her allegations to the
opening agreement was the poor argumentation of the circumstances
modifications of the responsibility set forth in the aforementioned agreement.

In short, the guarantees granted to the defendant in the administrative procedure
sanctioning and the rules governing the procedure have been respected

scrupulously. The extremes mentioned by the claimed in its two writings
of allegations do not entail the violation of any fundamental right recognized
in article 24.2 of the C.E. in which to support the concurrence of the reason for
radical nullity of article 47.1.a) LPACAP.

Based on the foregoing, the claim of the respondent to declare the
nullity of the procedure.

Section d) of article 5.1. of the RGPD determine in terms of the "Principles
regarding the treatment” that: “The personal data will be:

 (…)

d) accurate and, if necessary, updated; all measures will be taken

reasonable to eliminate or rectify without delay the personal data that
are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are processed (<exactness>)”

For its part, regarding the "Principles of Data Protection", article 4.1 of the
LOPDGDD determines:

"4. Data accuracy.

1. In accordance with article 5.1.d) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the data will be accurate
and, if necessary, updated.

                                            IV

Article 16 of the RGPD, regarding the "Right of rectification" establishes that:

“The interested party shall have the right to obtain, without undue delay, from the person responsible for the
processing the rectification of personal data concerning you. Having in
account the purposes of the treatment, the interested party will have the right to complement

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

personal data that is incomplete, including by means of a statement
additional."

In turn, article 12.4 of the aforementioned LOPDGDD, establishes as one of the
“General provisions on the exercise of rights” that:

 "4. Proof of compliance with the duty to respond to the request to exercise
their rights formulated by the affected party will fall on the person responsible”.

For its part, article 14 of the LOPDGDD, under the heading, “Right of rectification”,
provides that: "By exercising the right of rectification recognized in article 16 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the affected party must indicate in their request what data is
refers and the correction to be made. You must accompany, whenever

accurate, supporting documentation of the inaccuracy or incompleteness of the
data object of treatment.”

Article 83 of the RGPD, under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of
administrative fines”, states:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or, in the case of

of a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the volume of
Total annual global business of the previous financial year, opting for the one with the highest
amount:

b) the rights of the interested parties pursuant to articles 12 to 22.”

The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 74.c) establishes that: "They are considered

minor and will prescribe after a year the remaining infractions of a merely formal nature of
the articles mentioned in paragraphs 4 and 5 of article 83 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 and, in particular, the following: (...)

c) Failure to respond to requests to exercise the rights established in articles
15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, unless the provisions
in article 72.1.k) of this organic law.”

And, for these purposes, obviously, the fact that the complaining party requested the
rectification several times, and the claimed party did not proceed to make said
rectification, which is why the established exception is applicable.

Article 72.1k) of the LOPDGDD establishes that they are infractions considered very
Serious “The impediment or the obstruction or the repeated non-attention of the exercise of
the rights established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

                                               v

According to the available evidence, it must be taken into account that the
lack of attention to the claimant's right to obtain without undue delay from the
responsible for the treatment the rectification of the personal data that concerns him.
Taking into account the purposes of the treatment, the interested party will have the right to
supplement personal data that is incomplete, including through a

additional statement.

In the case analyzed here, it has been proven that the claimant exercised
your right of rectification before the defendant entity, your request did not obtain the
legally required response.

Likewise, after the evidence obtained, it is verified in relation to the requests for

rectification by the claimant and the answers by the claimed party:

1. There is no evidence, with the information provided by the respondent, of communications through
from the My Manager channel.

2. There is a response from the respondent dated 11/05/2020 after request
by the claimant dated 10/31/2020. In this answer only
explain the channels enabled for the exercise of rights. This answer consists

sent but not delivered because the claimant was absent at home.

In relation to the origin of the different postal addresses and their effective rectification:

3. In the evidence provided by the claimant, it is recorded on 01/31/2021 the
address \*\*\*ADDRESS.2 associated with the contract \*\*\*CONTRACT.1, contract that, in the
evidence provided by the defendant as of 10/13/2021, is associated with the
address \*\*\*ADDRESS.1.

4. Regarding the claimant's mailing address at \*\*\*ADDRESS.1, address to
which he requested the rectification, the respondent does not provide the information requested in
regarding how and when changes to that postal address have occurred, nor the
reason for this change. Nor does the respondent provide information in relation to the fact that
there has been a change to this address at any time. Without
However, this address is used by the claimed address in some communications

addressed to the claimant in November and December 2020 and in April 2021.

5. In relation to the postal address of the claimant in \*\*\*ADDRESS.1 the claimed
does not provide the information requested in relation to how and when they occurred
changes to that mailing address. It does state that the origin of that address is
the claimant's contracts and that the address was provided by the claimant, but not

provide evidence in this regard beyond the mere association of this address to
said contracts, as extracted from the screen capture of the systems of the party
claimed.

On May 13, 2022, the respondent presents its allegations to the agreement of
opening of this sanctioning procedure, stating: << Comply with us
state that such a statement does not conform to reality, since it is stated in

our files that on May 3, 2021 the client appeared at the office
6435- STORE COSO and the address of the contract was changed. it of
in accordance with the indications provided by the Entity in the response to the exercise of the
right of rectification requested. To this end, we attach (DOCUMENT
NUMBER EIGHT and DOCUMENT NUMBER NINE, respectively) the receipts

corresponding to the interested contract, dated April 2021 and May 2021, where
you can see the modification made>>.

Well, contrary to what the defendant states, it is stated in the document
number 8 the old mailing address of the claimant \*\*\*ADDRESS.2 associated with the
contract \*\*\* CONTRACT.1, corresponding to the receipt dated April 30, 2021.

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 17/20

In short, there is evidence in the file of the lack of attention to the right to
rectification of data, by Caixabank. It should be noted that in the receipt of
dated April 30, 2021, provided by the respondent, there is still the old
postal address and only on the receipt dated May 31, 2021, is when it appears
and to the claimant's new mailing address.

The behavior described violates article 16 of the RGPD and is subsumable in the type
sanctioning article 83.5.b, of the RGPD.

                                             v

The defendant has requested in its allegations that, in substitution of the fine
administrative provision provided for in the start-up agreement, this Agency warns you and,
subsidiarily, reduce the amount of the sanction of a fine established in the agreement of
opening at 25,000 euros.

Regarding the claim that a warning be addressed to him, we refer to
Considering 148 of the RGPD that says:

“In order to reinforce the application of the rules of this Regulation, any
infringement of this must be punished with sanctions, including administrative fines,

in addition to appropriate measures imposed by the supervisory authority in
under this Regulation, or in substitution of these. In case of a minor infraction,
or if the fine likely to be imposed constituted a burden
disproportionate for a natural person, instead of sanctioning by means of a fine,
impose a warning. However, special attention should be paid to the

nature, seriousness and duration of the infraction, its intentional nature, the
measures taken to alleviate the damages suffered, to the degree of
liability or any relevant prior violation, to the manner in which the
control authority has become aware of the infraction, compliance with
measures ordered against the person in charge or in charge, adherence to codes of
conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance. The imposition of

sanctions, including administrative fines, must be subject to guarantees
sufficient procedural requirements in accordance with the general principles of Union Law and
of the Charter, including the right to effective judicial protection and to a process with all
guarantees.”

It is clear that the elements that

They allow substituting the sanction of an administrative fine established by article 83.5. of
RPGD for a warning.

In determining the fine to be imposed on the person claimed for the infraction
of article 16 RGPD for which you are responsible, typified in article 83.5.b)
RGPD, the provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD must be observed,

precepts that state:

“Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of administrative fines
under this Article for infringements of this Regulation
indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case effective,
proportionate and dissuasive.”

“Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each
individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine

administration and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:

a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well
such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that
have suffered;

b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to

e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the treatment;

f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the
infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement;

certification approved in accordance with article 42, and

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,
such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or
indirectly, through the infringement.”

Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76,
“Sanctions and corrective measures”, establishes:

"two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

g) Have, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.

In the case analyzed, the concurrence of the following factors that

They operate by aggravating the responsibility required of the entity because they show a
greater unlawfulness of their conduct or greater culpability:

- The evident link between the business activity of the defendant and the
processing of personal data (article 83.2.k, of the RGPD in relation to article

76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD) The activity of the defendant requires that numerous
personal data of its clients, therefore, given the very important volume
of business of the claimed financial institution when the events occur, the
significance that their offending conduct may have is undeniable.

- The time from when the complaining party requested the rectification until it was carried out.
