## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject made a complaint regarding the ongoing processing of their personal data via email messages where their email address was available for members and non-members of the Personnel Board which both the data controller and the data subject are part of. Being part of the same labour group could justify processing personal data from the data subject. However, the data controller has shared personal data with various persons, including people outside of the Board. Even after the data subject requested that the information processing stopped, the emails with personal data continued to be sent. Even without the data subject's consent, the data controller justified the processing for laboural reasons, based on Article 9 of the GDPR, which is highlighted by the fact that the email with personal data is a corporate one.

### Holding

The DPA understood that the processing of the data subject was abusive, especially because personal data as the email of the data subject was processed without their consent. In discordance with the GDPR, even after the request of the data subject to not have their email processed and shared with other people anymore, the activity continued without considering simple features such as "hidden copy" for sending emails that would mitigate risks. Thus, the DPA ruled that the processing was illegal, not complying with Article 6 of the GDPR, since there is no legal basis for the processing. The fact that both the data subject and the data controller were part of the same Personnel Board did not change the outcome, since the email address, reveling personal information was sent for non-members, so the Article 9 of the GDPR does not apply.

                                PROVEN FACTS

FIRST: Dissemination of the email addresses of each member of the

board meetings to corporate emails from unions and groups without

legitimation for its reception, as well as to third parties who do not belong to the board of

SECOND: The defendant alleges the non-existence of the infringement as the

                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                            Yo

Article 4.11 of the GDPR defines the consent of the interested party as “any
manifestation of free, specific, informed and unequivocal will by which the
interested party accepts, either by a declaration or a clear affirmative action, the
processing of personal data that concerns you.”

In this sense, article 6.1 of the LOPDGDD establishes that “in accordance with the
provided in article 4.11 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, consent is understood to be
ment of the affected person any manifestation of free, specific, informed and ineligible will.
ambiguity by which he accepts, either through a statement or a clear action
“Yes, the processing of personal data that concerns you.”

For its part, article 6 of the RGPD establishes the following:

"1. The treatment will only be legal if at least one of the following conditions is met:
nes:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;

b) the processing is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party

is part of or for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures;

c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;

d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the interested party or another
Physical person;

e) the processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest

 f) the processing is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person responsible for the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said interests

interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the interest do not prevail.
s that require the protection of personal data, particularly when the interest
sado be a child.

The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph will not apply to the treatment
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.”

                                           III

In the present case, the complaining party denounces the claimed party because

Emails have been repeatedly forwarded to other members and
non-members of the personnel board of which he is a member and to corporate emails of
unions and groups without legitimacy or consent on the part of the claimant.

A document submitted on behalf of FSP-UGT has been entered into the AEPD,

where two aspects are revealed, on the one hand the corporate nature of the
email account object of this assumption (\*\*\*EMAIL.14), which makes its use
is strictly related to the professional field of the personnel board
of the workplace.”

Secondly, it is alleged that the emails reported by the claimant
have been sent from an email account (\*\*\*EMAIL.15) that is not
property of FeSP-UGT, and it is indicated that this aspect had already been warned to the
UGT workers.

Print is provided of a “Reminder to workers” dated January 15,

2020 which indicates, among other things, the following:

“Therefore, any email that is sent by any of the
workers of this Federation from an unauthorized or unofficial address not
will be considered the responsibility of this body, and measures may be adopted

individuals that correspond against the issuers.”

Thus, it seems that FSP-UGT is exempt from all responsibility, but not
the defendant, since the issuance of emails on the 16th and 17th of
February 2021 and March 16, 2021, despite the claimant's request that

stop forwarding your email address to third parties.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/11

The defendant, in a written statement of allegations dated June 30, 2022, requests feedback from
the actions for not having received the information request dated 2
February 2022.

In this sense we must indicate that the actions carried out in the month of February
They are prior actions that are carried out in accordance with article 65.4 of the
LOPDGDD, carried out prior to the start of the sanctioning procedure.

Therefore, defenselessness can only be considered in the event that once the

initiation agreement, and not before, the defendant would not have been able to exercise the rights
that law 39/2015 on common administrative procedure confers in all
sanctioning procedure, such as the right to know the facts that are
accused and be able to present allegations and evidence, or exercise their right to
audience.

Since we are not in any of these cases, retroaction does not apply.
of the performances.

Secondly, the defendant resorts to article 9 of the RGPD, justifying that the
The data processed is about union membership and was disseminated in a work environment.

However, it is considered that the processing of the claimant's personal data
has been excessive because the emails subject to this complaint were
They also referred people outside the personnel board, and more so when possible
its omission with the use of tools such as blind copy, when required

by the owner of that personal data that it is not used when expressing
expressly that you do not consent to the processing of your email, in the exercise of
your right to object.

Therefore, it is considered that we are dealing with illegal processing of personal data,

by sending emails to other members and non-members of the board of directors
personnel of which the claimant is a member, and to corporate emails of unions and
collectives, incurring a violation of article 6 of the RGPD, indicated in the
legal basis II, since the personal data have been processed without counting
with any type of legitimation.

                                          IV

In accordance with the transcribed precepts, in order to set the amount of the sanction of
fine to impose we must take into account article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, where
indicates that “violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with

in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of EUR 20 000 000 as
maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% as
maximum of the total global annual turnover of the previous financial year,
opting for the highest amount:

 a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;”

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/11

Article 72.1 b) of the LOPDGDD states that “based on what is established by the
article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are considered very serious and will prescribe
after three years, infractions that involve a substantial violation of the

articles mentioned in that and in particular, the following:

b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

                                           V

In order to determine the administrative fine to impose, the following must be observed:
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, provisions that indicate:

“Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of administrative fines

under this Article for infringements of this Regulation
indicated in sections 4, 5 and 6 are effective in each individual case,
proportionate and dissuasive.”

“Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each
individual case, as an additional or substitute for the measures contemplated in the

Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administrative and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:

a) the nature, severity and duration of the infringement, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that
have suffered;

b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

c) any measure taken by the person responsible or in charge of the treatment to
alleviate the damages and losses suffered by the interested parties;

d) the degree of responsibility of the person responsible or in charge of the treatment,
taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have been applied under
of articles 25 and 32;

e) any previous infringement committed by the controller or processor;

 f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the
infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in
particular whether the controller or processor notified the infringement and, if so, in what
extent;

i) when the measures indicated in Article 58, paragraph 2, have been ordered
previously against the person responsible or the person in charge in question in relation to the
same matter, compliance with said measures;

j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or to mechanisms of
certification approved in accordance with Article 42, and

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,
such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct or

indirectly, through infringement.”

Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76,
“Sanctions and corrective measures” provides:

"2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
may also be taken into account:

a) The continuous nature of the infringement.

b) The linking of the offender's activity with the performance of medical treatments.
