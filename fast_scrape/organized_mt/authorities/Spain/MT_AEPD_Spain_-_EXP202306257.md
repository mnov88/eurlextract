## English Summary

### Facts

On 20 August 2020 the data subject, represented by noyb, filed a complaint against eDreams, the controller, with the Spanish DPA. The data subject stated that he visited the eDreams website, while connected to his Google account. His IP address and cookies information were collected and transferred to Google U.S. through the services of Google Analytics and Google Ads, contractualized by eDreams.

The Spanish DPA started an investigation. Based on the documents and the requests made by the Spanish DPA, it was confirmed that Google Analytics statistics were collected from stakeholders in other Member States where eDreams concentrates its activity. The data of the Google Analytics tool is accessed mainly from eDream's offices in Spain, led by the head of the Analytics team, but also from France and Germany by their country management teams in each country.

eDreams stated that they only communicate the data collected through Google Analytics to Google. In the event that the user provides their consent for advertising cookies and does not block cookies in its browser, Google Ad Manager and Google Ads tools will also be recipients of the data. The controller specified that legal basis for the incorporation of the Google Analytics tool was legitimate interest, based on the need to understand how their website is used as well as to provide a better service to users.

Concerning the international transfer of data to the U.S., the controller was using the Privacy Shield Certificate until the latter was declared invalid and subsequently the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the Commission, together with the appropriate complementary measures provided by Google. Additionally, eDreams did not have the option to opt-out from transferring data outside the EEA when using Google Analytics, since the configuration of the tool does not allow it.

The browsing and behavioral data of customers were pseudonymized by means of a cookie identifier "Cookie ID" that allowed eDreams to analyze how the user accessed and interacted with their website. The Cookie ID was also their internal identifier to analyze the results at a statistical level. The controller claimed that no processing of special categories of personal data took place as defined in [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"), nor any processing of personal data of particularly vulnerable persons. The data storage was 26 months, which allowed the controller to make comparisons with the previous year data.

On 12 October 2020, in response to the DPA’s requests, Google stated that customers using Google Analytics can enable IP anonymization immediately after the data is collected. When data collected through Google Analytics transferred by Google's customers are personal data, they would have to be pseudonymised (as mandated by Google Analytics Terms of Service). Also, Google highlighted that they obtained ISO 27001 certification and will allow customers or customer-appoint third-party auditor to conduct audits of Google Analytics and verify Google's compliance with its obligations.

Google also claimed that if any government request access to personal data stored in Google's systems in the course of an investigation, a dedicated team of Google lawyers and specially trained personnel will carefully review the request to verify that it is lawful, proportionate, and complies with Google's policies. Their infrastructure is not designed to, and does not, give the U.S. government or any other government "backdoor" access to customer data or its servers. In addition, they highlighted that it uses strong technical measures (such as encryption) to protect against interception, including surveillance attempts by government authorities around the world.

Despite all the arguments, on 26 July 2023, the DPA ordered eDreams to comply with [Article 44 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_44_GDPR "Article 44 GDPR"), specifically to adapt its data processing with Google Analytics to ensure no international data transfers to U.S. occur without adequate safeguards. The Spanish DPA determined the measures implemented by eDreams were insufficient to address the core issue of unlawful data transfers and the risk it posed to EU citizens' data protection rights.

### Holding

eDreams contested the Resolution, leading to the appeal, based on the following arguments.

Firstly, eDreams claimed that the DPA infringed their right of defense, as the controller affected by the delay on the access to the case file. These circumstances limited their time for presenting allegations, and for not granting a requested trial period. They highlighted that further technical proof was unnecessary, since Google's terms allow data storage and processing in any country with Google facilities and all data collected via Google Analytics is hosted in the U.S. The DPA attributed the delays to technical issues and miscommunication rather than procedural fairness, and argued that the extension of deadlines to submit allegations was sufficient, countering claims of unjustified period limitation.

Secondly, eDreams contested the decision for failing to technically demonstrate international data transfers to the U.S and claimed that their privacy settings prevent such transfers. The DPA refuted these claims, stating that regardless of the eDream's ability to technically demonstrate international data transfers to the USA, these transfers have been documented and confirmed by the Terms of Use clause which allows Google to store and process citing customer personal data in any country where Google or its sub-processors have facilities, including the U.S.

Thirdly, eDreams argued that the decision did not consider the new U.S. legal framework and the European Commission's Adequacy Decision, claiming it is unfair and legally improper. The DPA disagreed, stating that the legal framework at the time of the infraction applies, and compliance with GDPR was required at the time of the complaint.

Fourthly, At the same time, eDreams contends that the imposed sanction presents an unattainable requirement. This is because EDREAMS would be compelled to administer and regulate a service that belongs to a third party (Google), and thus falls outside its sphere of control. The DPA disagrees that the decisions should be considered unattainable as it orders precise adaptation of data processing activity of the Google Analytics service with the provisions of [Article 44 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_44_GDPR "Article 44 GDPR"), in particular by ceasing the international transfer of data until it is established that the Google Analytics service complies with the GDPR provisions.

In light of the above, the DPA decided to dismiss the appeal by eDreams against the decision made on 26 July 2023, since eDreams did not provide new facts or legal arguments to reconsider the original decision.

## Comment

In this case, the Spanish DPA was the lead supervisory authority and the Austrian, French and Italian DPA's concerned supervisory authorities.

THIRD: On August 30, 2023, the appellant has presented
appeal for reconsideration before this Agency, basing it, basically, on the fact that
defenseless, with infringement of the right of defense, with a denial

unjustified trial period. Furthermore, it considers that the sanctioning resolution
is incongruent and lacks the necessary motivation, and that the sanction imposed has
illegal effects and impossible content. Finally, the lack of purpose is alleged
of the sanctioning procedure and the subjective element and guilt.

                                        Yo
                                  Competence

The Director of the Spanish Agency is competent to resolve this appeal.
of Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of article 123 of the Law
39/2015, of October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the
Public Administrations (hereinafter LPACAP) and article 48.1 of the Law

Organic 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD).

                                        II
        Response to the allegations presented in the appeal for reconsideration

In relation to the allegations made by the appellant in the appeal for
replacement, we proceed to respond to them according to the order set forth by
EDREAMS:

“FIRST.- Helplessness. Violation of the right of defense. Unjustified denial

of the probationary period.”

According to EDREAMS, this Agency has made EDREAMS defenseless by delaying
unjustifiably access to the File, by unjustifiably limiting the deadlines for
extension for the presentation of allegations and, even more so, by not agreeing to this AEPD

the opening of the trial period expressly requested by EDREAMS in several
occasions.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 20/29

Next, we proceed to give a due response to these arguments. With respect to
rejection of the request for evidence formulated by EDREAMS, it ignores in its
approach the provisions of point 10 of the “Terms of Data Processing

of Google Ads”, according to which the controller has agreed that Google
can store and process personal data of the client (in this case, data
of the complaining party) in any country in which Google or any of
its subprocessors maintain facilities. When
collects this information, it is transmitted to Google Analytics servers.
Specifically, the document in the file sent by Google LLC with

date April 9, 2021, in the last paragraph to the answer to question 8, Google
declares that all data collected through Google Analytics is hosted
in the U.S. Therefore, the data collected on the website «\*\*\*URL.1» to
through Google Analytics are transferred to the United States.
Documentally accredited the international transfer of personal data to the

United States, it was not necessary to carry out technical proof of a fact that has been
recognized by Google, and is that, ultimately, all the data processed by
Google Analytics are hosted in the USA in accordance with the provisions of the
article 77.3 of the LPACAP, “the instructor of the procedure may only reject the
evidence proposed by the interested parties when they are manifestly inappropriate
or unnecessary, through a reasoned resolution”, in this way, a

“omnimode” right to the taking of evidence, which EDREAMS claims, but rather
can be rejected with reasons, as was done in the resolution, in the
terms that have been reproduced again in this paragraph.

Regarding what EDREAMS calls “unjustified delay in access to the

File”, the form of delivery of the file was motivated by the impossibility
technique of making it available to EDREAMS through the electronic headquarters, due to
to the size of the document, therefore it was decided to send the copy of the file in
electronic support through messaging. It was the will of this Agency that
EDREAMS had access to the copy of the EDREAMS file as soon as possible, to

which the personnel in charge of your shipment confirmed the address by telephone to
that had to be sent to EDREAMS personnel who, at that time, included
the database of this Agency, to which the shipment was sent on December 12,
2022.

Despite the aforementioned verification, as stated in the receipt issued by the

courier company on file, on December 13, 2022, when
There were still 6 business days left until the end of the period to submit allegations,
The delivery man of the courier company could not deliver the shipment for the following reason:
cause: “Unknown recipient at the delivery address.” After this first attempt
delivery, EDREAMS was contacted again to confirm the address.

Therefore, the delay in delivering the copy of the file is due to the fact that
EDREAMS had not notified this Agency of the change of address.

On December 15, 2022, EDREAMS personnel appeared before this
Agency, when there were four business days left for the last day of submission of

allegations. The EDREAMS representation was provided with a copy of the file
in person, and the copy cannot be provided two days before, when
appeared before this Agency without proving said representation. Without a doubt, this

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 21/29

This circumstance was also the cause of the delay in the delivery of the copy of the
proceedings.

In any case, since December 15, 2022, the day on which the
copy of the file, EDREAMS has had a fairly long period of time to
review the documents in the file; proof of this, as an example,
is constituted by the expert report that he attaches to his allegations (attached document no.
3), where in 134 pages technical issues of some of the
documents on file.

Finally, regarding what EDREAMS calls “unjustified limitation” of the
extension of the deadline to present allegations to the proposed resolution, provides
Article 32.1 of the LPACAP that “The Administration, unless otherwise provided,
may grant... an extension of the established deadlines...", so it is not

obliged to do so.” In the present case, the deadline for allegations to the initiation agreement was
extended five business days, the maximum period allowed by article 32.1 of the
LPACAP, taking into account that the initial period was ten business days, and, within the period
of allegations to the proposed resolution, two business days have been granted
additional, so it has been guaranteed that EDREAMS has a term longer than
sufficient to make allegations.

For all the above reasons, this allegation is rejected.

“SECOND.- Lack of motivation for the Sanctioning Resolution.”

In this section EDREAMS reiterates the lack of proof of the facts constituting the
infringement, without this Agency having been able to technically demonstrate that
cause international data transfers to the USA. EDREAMS considers
that the privacy settings with which you use the Google Analytics service

prevents international data transfers. Likewise, according to EDREAMS, in the
appealed resolution is sanctioned by the future prohibition of treatment, without
having carried out this risk analysis of what the risk is like today. By
Lastly, other arguments already supported in the previous sections are repeated, such as the
absence of proof in the procedure and configuration of Privacy in use
of Google Analytics by EDREAMS, which have already been the subject of a response.

In response to this allegation, first of all, it must be clarified in relation to the
assessment carried out by the Inspector who carried out in the previous actions of
investigation (page 5373 of the file) to which EDREAMS alludes in its appeal for
replacement that, regardless of whether this Agency has been able to demonstrate

Technically, international data transfers to the US occur,
These have been documented, as has been reasoned in the
response to EDREAMS' allegation in the section preceding this one, in which
refers to point 10 of the “Google Data Processing Terms
Ads”, according to which the controller has agreed that Google may

store and process customer personal data in any country in which Google or
any of its subprocessors maintain facilities and
that, specifically, the document in the file sent by Google LLC
dated April 9, 2021, in the last paragraph to the answer to question 8,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 22/29

Google states that all data collected through Google Analytics is
hosted in the United States.

It was already justified in the appealed resolution that the configuration of Google Analytics
used by EDREAMS on its website, without having Google Signal enabled, did not prevent the
processing of personal data. In the document dated April 9, 2021 that
GOOGLE LLC refers to the Austrian data protection authority, in which
GOOGLE LLC answers a series of questions asked by the Austrian authority
in connection with a claim substantially similar to this

procedure, and to which EDREAMS has had access since it is incorporated into the
proceedings; In point number 9 (page 5234 of the file), the following is stated:
(unofficial translation):

“In this claim, the complaining party was logged into his account

Google when visiting the specific website of the site owner. Does the implementation of
Google services (including Google Analytics) allow Google to receive
information that a specific user of a Google account has visited a
specific website? If yes, please describe how and what information
about the user's Google account is collected.

No, the implementation of Google Analytics as such does not allow Google to receive the
information that a specific Google user has visited a specific website.
Implementing Google Analytics on a website allows Google to receive the
information that a certain Google user has visited a website
specific, only if the following additional conditions are met:

(1) The user has activated activity on the Internet and in their Google account and, in addition,
you have visited the website;
(2) The user has chosen to include the activity of companies that use the
Google services;

(3) The user has activated ad personalization;
(4) and the user logs in to their Google account in the same browser while
visit the website.

If Google Signals (see our answer to question 6(ii)) is activated in that
website, Google will then be able to visit the user to said website in the activity

of the user's Google account on the Internet and applications. “

As can be seen, again by Google's own response, it is not
It is necessary to have Google Signals activated for Google to receive information from a
Google user if the four transcribed conditions are met, being a function

optional whose deactivation does not prevent Google from receiving information that a
A certain user of a Google account has visited a specific website. In the
answer 6 (ii), Google says: “Google Signals is an optional feature of Google
Analytics that, when enabled, adds supplemental reports that are based on the
data from Google users who have activated ad personalization on

your account."

On the other hand, EDREAMS regarding the collection of IP Addresses: “The
IP addresses would be anonymized at the time of collection and such anonymization,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 23/29

As confirmed by Google, it is produced within the European region for
users browsing from the EEA. Consequently, data that could be
potentially transferred to the USA is not personal data, but has undergone

a solid and irreversible anonymization process.” Neither Google nor EDREAMS have
accredited in any way - that the IPs are anonymized within the territory of the
European Union.

We can take as good the statements made by Google that IPs are
anonymized within the territory of the EU just as we have reproduced

previously how they treat cookies and their use to distinguish users, but,
They could be subject to treatment once collected. As an example, in
Google Analytics, according to Google's “Privacy and Data in the EU” document
(available at https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12017362?
hl=es&ref\_topic=2919631), “…IP address data is used only for

obtain the geolocation data and it is immediately discarded”, so it is
uses information that may be provided by the IP before anonymization.
EDREAMS, uses as proof that IPs are always anonymized in
territory of the European Union an email from a Google worker, therefore
that there is no technical evidence to prove it.

Consequently, in accordance with the most widely developed in the
Legal basis IV of the appealed resolution, especially in point 2,
“On the classification of the data subject to processing as personal data”,
EDREAMS carries out international transfers of personal data through
Google Analytics.

Finally, as expressed by EDREAMS, in the appealed resolution there has been no

regulations on data protection that have taken place in the USA, which

has occurred after the events in question.

On the date on which the events object of the claim occurred, it was
application of the grounds of the CJEU ruling in case C-311/18 (Schrems
II), which declared Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 invalid,
July 12, 2016, on the adequacy of the protection conferred by the Shield of the

EU-US Privacy USA

In paragraphs 184 and 185 of this ruling it is established: “Therefore, it is evident
that neither section 702 of the FISA nor the E.O. 12333, interpreted in relation to the
PPD-28, satisfy the minimum requirements established by Union Law

with respect to the principle of proportionality, so that it cannot be considered
that surveillance programs based on these provisions be limited to what
strictly necesary.

In these circumstances, the limitations of the protection of personal data that are

derive from the domestic regulations of the United States relating to access and
use, by US authorities, of data transferred from the
Union to the United States, which the Commission assessed in the EP Decision, are not

regulated in accordance with requirements substantially equivalent to those required, in the
Union law, in Article 52, paragraph 1, second sentence, of the Charter.”

Google LLC (as importer of the data to the USA) should be qualified as
electronic communications service provider within the meaning of paragraph (b)
of point 4 of article 1881 of title 50 of the United States Code and, therefore,
Therefore, it is subject to surveillance by the US intelligence services of
in accordance with section (a) of article 1881 of title 50 of the State Code

personal data to the United States government when requested
pursuant to section (a) of article 1881 of title 50 of the United States Code
United States (FISA 702). As can be seen in the Transparency Report of
Google, Google LLC is regularly subject to access requests from
United States intelligence services. The report can be consulted at:

https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/us-national-security?hl=en

Consequently, international data transfers carried out by
EDREAMS through the Google Analytics tool at the time of the
claim did not comply with the provisions of article 44 of the RGPD, without the
application of the new adequacy decision “EU-Data Privacy Framework

“USA” can solve.

For all the above reasons, this allegation is rejected.

“THIRD.- Inconsistency of the Sanctioning Resolution. Sanction with effects
illegal and of impossible content.”

EDREAMS argues that it is incongruous that the appealed resolution does not analyze the
new US legal framework and the European Commission's Adequacy Decision

because it is not automatic nor does it apply to this procedure, but at the same time,
Precisely in the sanction that is imposed, reference is made to the current moment and to
adaptation to the applicable regulations that necessarily include the new framework
US legal and Adequacy Decision. According to EDREAMS, the sanction
generates disproportionate and unfair harm, and is illegal because they would be
prohibiting future treatments that are lawful. Finally, EDREAMS estimates that the

sanction imposed has an impossible content since it would be forcing
EDREAMS to impose and modulate a service that is not its own but that of a third party
(Google), and therefore does not fall under its sphere of control.

In response to the allegation about the new US legal framework and the new

Adequacy Decision “EU-US Data Privacy Framework.” “U.S.”, just as it is
Agency maintained in the appealed resolution and once again justified itself in the allegation
above, for the purposes of determining responsibility for the commission of the infraction, it is not
the current legal framework is applicable, but rather the legal regime in force on the date of the
facts constituting the infringement, in particular as established by the CJEU in the

judgment in case C-311,/18 (Schrems II), which declared invalid the Decision of
Commission Implementation (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 on adequacy
of the protection conferred by the EU-US Privacy Shield. USA

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 25/29

Since Google LLC is required to provide personal data to the
United States Government when requested pursuant to section
(a) of section 1881 of title 50 of the United States Code (FISA 702), as
can be seen in its Transparency Report
(https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/us-national-security?hl=en), it is your

full application of the doctrine established by the CJEU in the aforementioned ruling.

Furthermore, in order to ensure that international data transfers
to the US comply with the GDPR, the approval of the Implementing Decision of the
Commission dated July 10, 2023, in accordance with Regulation (EU)
2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the appropriate level of

protection of personal data in the “EU-US Data Privacy Framework”,
establishes in its Annex I, “Principles of the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.
issued by the United States Department of Commerce” the following
(unofficial translation):

"2. In order to rely on the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. for
transfer personal data from the EU, an organization must
self-certify your adherence to the Principles to the Department (or your person
designated). Although the decisions of the organizations to thus enter the Framework
EU-US Privacy Policy are completely voluntary, effective compliance is
mandatory: organizations that self-certify before the Department and declare

publicly their commitment to adhere to the Principles must fully comply
with the Principles…

3. …The benefits of the EU-US Privacy Framework are insured from
the date the Department places the organization on the Framework List of
Data Privacy.”

However, at the time the resolution was issued, Google had not self-certified
its adherence to the Principles of the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. USA so
international data transfers could not be considered to be carried out with
sufficient guarantees and under the protection of the new Adequacy Decision.

The appealed resolution cannot be considered “illegal” when what it orders is
precisely compliance with current regulations, that is, adapting the activity of
data processing at the service of Google Analytics in accordance with the provisions of articles 44 and
following Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of
April 27, 2016, in particular by cessation of the international transfer of
data until it is proven that the Google Analytics service complies with the aforementioned

provisions of the Regulation. Compliance with this mandate was not proven before
of issuing a resolution in the sanctioning procedure, without the adaptation
carried out subsequently determines the invalidity of that, on the contrary, it means that
The imposed measure has been complied with.

On the other hand, the mandate included in the appealed resolution does not have a content
impossible. Let us remember that, regardless of whether the current Clauses
Type Contractual Clauses (Google Ads and Measurement: Standard Contractual Clauses (Module 3:
Processor to Processor) consider Google Ireland as data exporter.
EDREAMS, as data controller, assumes, together with the other

conditions of contracting the services of Google LLC, the relative agreements
to data processing and the Standard Contractual Clauses that allow the data
are transferred to Google LLC, based in the United States.

Specifically, EDREAMS assumes point 10 of the “Terms of Treatment of

Google Ads Data”, so the data controller has agreed that
Google may store and process personal data of the customer (i.e. data
personal of the complaining party and of any user who visits the website in question)
in any country in which Google or any of its “subprocessors”
data processing facilities, including the USA, as declared by the
Google LLC itself in the document dated April 9, 2021.

Consequently, having contracted the services of GOOGLE, assuming its
contracting conditions, EDREAMS, as responsible for the treatment, is the one
You must take the necessary measures so that the data of those who visit your website
are treated in accordance with the GDPR.

For all the above reasons, this allegation is rejected.

“FOURTH.- Lack of purpose of the sanctioning procedure.”

In this allegation he summarizes what has already been argued in the allegations.

preceding this one: Application of the new Framework Adaptation Decision of
EU-US Data Privacy In the US, there are no international data transfers to
cannot be technically proven and due to the privacy settings of
Google Analytics selected by EDREAMS (IP anonymization and deactivation
of Google Signals). A novel argument is included: The European Committee of
Data Protection has confirmed “that all the guarantees that the

US government regulations apply to all data transfers to
"United States, regardless of the transfer mechanism used" and, in its
default, “even if the EU-US Privacy Framework were not applicable.” USA, the
European Commission and the EDPB have clearly confirmed that the Decision of
Adequacy is fully applicable to all transfers to the US.”

In response to this argument, it is worth highlighting that the adoption by the Commission of the
EU-US Data Privacy Framework Adequacy Decision. UU does not come but to
confirm that international data transfers carried out by EDREAMS
prior to the approval of that, represented a violation of the rights and

freedoms of European citizens in terms of data protection, through the
indiscriminate access to your personal data by the intelligence services of the
USA, from the moment in which the aforementioned Adequacy Decision was
justified based on the new guarantees regarding data protection
established by the U.S. These guarantees include the limitation of the
access by US intelligence services to data

of EU citizens to what is necessary and proportionate, and the
establishment of a Data Protection Appeal Court, to which
EU citizens will have access.

Well, none of these guarantees existed on the date of the events referred to.
refers to the appealed resolution, when EDREAMS, through its website, and because

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid Seeagpd.gob.es 27/29

operates in other Member States of the Union, transferred personal data of
citizens of the European Union to the USA in violation of the current regulatory framework
according to the ruling of the CJEU in case C-311/18 (Schrems II), which declared invalid

Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 on
the adequacy of the protection conferred by the EU US Privacy Shield.

In this ruling, the Court considered that the requirements of national law
American, and in particular, some programs that allowed the authorities
Public authorities in the United States access personal data transferred from the

EU to the US for national security purposes, imposed limitations on the
protection of personal data that were not circumscribed in a way that
offered guarantees substantially equivalent to those required by the Law of the
Union, and that this legislation did not provide any means of judicial recourse against
the United States authorities to the data subjects.

However, EDREAMS maintains in its appeal for reconsideration the non-existence of the
infringement, and that your international data transfers to the US have complied
at all times with the legal system, even prior to the new
Adequacy Decision, through which the Commission concludes the existence of
guarantees in the US that ensure a level of protection equivalent to that of the EU for

European citizens, and considers that the questions have been answered
elucidated by the CJEU in the Schrems II ruling. This reasoning, according to which
EDREAMS defends the validity of its actions regardless of the legal framework
applicable, is completely incongruous. Furthermore, it is worth remembering that, among others
arguments, EDREAMS has defended ideas such as that the data sent is not

Furthermore, EDREAMS has not justified that it has signed with Google,

would allow the international transfer of data to the USA to be considered to be in accordance with

For all the above reasons, this allegation is rejected.

“FIFTH.- Lack of subjective element and guilt.”

As EDREAMS already maintained in the Briefs of Allegations, the requirement of
guilt of the subject who carries out the illicit conduct is necessary for the imposition of
an administrative sanction.

In response to this allegation, as already stated in the response to the Fourth allegation

of the replacement appeal, EDREAMS assumes point 10 of the “Terms of the
Google Ads Data Processing”, so the person responsible for the treatment has
agreed that Google may store and process customer personal data (i.e.
personal data of the complaining party and of any user who visits the website in
issue) in any country in which Google or any of its “subprocessors”

data processing facilities, including the US, regardless of whether
the Standard Contractual Clauses have been modified with respect to those in force in the
moment of the events subject to claim, attributing the status of exporter
to Google Ireland. Thus, the actions of Google LLC. adheres to what is stipulated and, therefore,
EDREAMS account, carrying out the processing of personal data
necessary for the correct provision of the service, which determines the responsibility

administrative of the person responsible for the treatment.

For all the above reasons, this allegation is rejected.

                                        III
                                   Conclusion

Consequently, in the present appeal for reconsideration, the appellant has not

provided new facts or legal arguments that allow reconsideration of the validity
of the contested resolution.

Considering the aforementioned precepts and others of general application, the Director of the Agency

Spanish Data Protection RESOLVES:

FIRST: DISMISS the appeal for reconsideration filed by VACATIONS
