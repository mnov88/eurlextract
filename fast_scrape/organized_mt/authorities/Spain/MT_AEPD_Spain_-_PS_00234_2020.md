## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a sanction procedure started by the AEPD against the defendant due to a complaint submitted by the Spanish company Neptunos Formación, S.L. (the claimant). The main points of the complaint include the following: (i) the defendant had published copyrighted material in its website without the consent, (ii) the website did not include information on the identity of the defendant, (iii) the claimant requested the erasure of all the content through the contact form, (iv) all personal data obtained from such contact form were transferred to a third company (Formación Universitaria, S.L.) which directly contacted the claimant, (v) the claimant requested again all the erasure of the data during that phone call, without result, (vi) the comments provided in the contact form were published on the website without the user's consent.

### Dispute

The AEPD assessed the controller's compliance with the applicable legislation. The Authority focused on whether or not: (i) the privacy policy included information on the data controller; (ii) the data subject was given an effective way to exercise his/her GDPR rights (as the email address provided refused each email received); (iii) the website offered an option to provide a specific and separate consent for the different purposes; (iv) the first layer of the website included any banner on cookies or information on their use.

### Holding

The AEPD concluded that the defendant could have breached Article 13 GDPR, Article 7 GDPR and Article 22(2) LSSI: there was no identification of the data controller, no possibility to give a separate consent for each purpose, and there was not enough information on the use of cookies. Consequently, after considering some aggravating circumstances \[(i) intentionality by the defendant, (ii) period of time in which the infringements had been happening\], the AEPD understood that, in case the sanction procedure resulted in a successful decision, this infringement would be fined with 13,000 € to the defendant. In this sense, the AEPD offered the defendant the possibility to settle the issue before the decision took place by agreeing to a voluntary payment of part of the fine and by acknowledging its liability. The defendant agreed and the sanction procedure was closed by the AEPD.
