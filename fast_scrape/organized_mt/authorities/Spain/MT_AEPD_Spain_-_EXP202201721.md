## English Summary

### Facts

In July 2021, the data subject lost his ID card. A third party went to his bank with the ID card and withdrew all the money available in the account, a total of €9,400, without his authorization or consent. The withdrawal was made in person at the local bank branch. The withdrawal also required the signature of the third party. The third party was able to withdraw the money despite their signature not corresponding to the signature on the data subject's ID card.

### Holding

The DPA seemed to infer that identifying a client at a bank for just the sake of providing them with a bank service involves a processing operation which must be carried out in compliance with Article 32 GDPR. The Spanish DPA considered the bank to have failed in adopting appropriate security measures by not verifying the data subject's identity in a reliable manner. As highlighted by AEPD, it was negligence that would have been overcome if available protocols would have been correctly followed. For example, correctly comparing and verifying both the photograph and the signature of the document that was presented in the request.

By not using appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, the controller violated [Article 6](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") and [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

## Comment

The DPA seems to consider the authentication procedure itself as "processing" and therefore Article 32 GDPR applies even if the damage is only monetary in nature.

       “1) “personal data”: any information about an identified natural person
or identifiable ("the interested party"); Any identifiable natural person will be considered
person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular
by means of an identifier, such as a name, an identification number,

location data, an online identifier or one or more elements of the

automated or not, such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring,
conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use,
communication by transmission, broadcast or any other form of enabling

       In accordance with what is stated in article 6.1, there is no proven basis
of legitimation of any of those contemplated in the aforementioned precept for the treatment
of the claimant's data and whose personality was impersonated to empty the

account of which he was the owner, without the defendant displaying the diligence that was
necessary to avoid incidents such as the one that gave rise to the claim and therefore the
present procedure.

       2. In the present case, the claimant's data has been used to carry out

       It should be noted that, as appears in the proven facts, the defendant himself
has stated in his response to the Agency's information request
of 04/07/2021 that “In the case being analyzed and in accordance with the aforementioned

rule, the paying office did not correctly identify the person who
ordered, since the refund was carried out by a person other than the owner with the
documentation stolen from the client.”

       Furthermore, the defendant himself has provided proof of the request for

provision whose signature does not match the one that appears on the claimant's DNI.

       Furthermore, he points out that “…he has resolved to annul the movement of the
fraudulent disposition made against the balance of the current account of the

       Therefore, it is not treated as claimed by the respondent in the response to the Proposal.

what was indicated by the defendant himself, pointing out that a correct

       On the other hand, it is unnecessary to point out that the state of the art would allow
perhaps the adoption of more effective identification measures such as biometrics, but
that these are considered illegal by the AEPD.

       In accordance with the foregoing, it is estimated that the defendant would be
responsible for the violation of the GDPR: violation of article 6.1, violation
typified in its article 83.5.a).

                                               IV
       Secondly, article 32 of the GDPR “Security of processing”,
states that:

       "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the

nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for people's rights and freedoms
physical, the person responsible and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which, if applicable, includes, among others:

       a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
       b) the ability to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
       c) the ability to restore availability and access to data
       personnel quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;

       d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness
       of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the
       treatment.

       2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration will be given to

take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
consequence of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of data
personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data.

       3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved pursuant to article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the
present article.

       4. The controller and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to

ensure that any person acting under the authority of the controller or
manager and has access to personal data can only process said data
following instructions from the person responsible, unless obliged to do so by virtue of the
Law of the Union or of the Member States”.

       The violation of article 32 of the RGPD is classified in the article
83.4.a) of the aforementioned RGPD in the following terms:

       "4. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, according to
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10 000 000 or,

substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

       (…)

       1. The GDPR defines personal data security breaches as
“all those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or
accidental or illicit alteration of personal data transmitted, preserved or processed

otherwise, or unauthorized communication or access to said data.”

       The documentation in the file shows that the defendant has
violated article 32 of the RGPD, by not having implemented and not using measures
appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the
risk in this treatment. This is independent of the fact that, in this specific case,

not only the totality of the money that existed in the account, but information related to the
same.

       It should be noted that the RGPD in the aforementioned provision does not establish a list of
the security measures that are applicable in accordance with the data that are

object of treatment, but rather establishes that the person responsible and the person in charge of the
treatment will apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk
that the treatment entails, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of
application, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, the risks of
probability and seriousness for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.

       Likewise, security measures must be adequate and
proportionate to the risk detected, pointing out that the determination of the measures
technical and organizational measures must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymization and
encryption, the ability to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
resilience, the ability to restore availability and access to data after a

incident, verification process (not audit), evaluation and assessment of the
effectiveness of the measures.

       In any case, when evaluating the adequacy of the security level, the
particularly taking into account the risks presented by data processing, such as

       In this same sense, recital 83 of the GDPR states that:

       “(83) In order to maintain security and prevent the treatment from infringing the
provided in this Regulation, the person responsible or the person in charge must evaluate

the risks inherent to the treatment and apply measures to mitigate them, such as

       2. In the present case, as stated in the facts and within the framework of the
investigation file, the AEPD transferred the claim presented to the defendant
for analysis requesting the contribution of information related to the incident
claimed without initially providing any information about the claim
transferred.

       However, as stated previously in a letter dated
04/07/2021 the defendant has acknowledged that in this specific case that “the office

       The defendant provides proof of the disposition request in which the

which must be verified prior to the provision of cash.

       The signature that appears on the receipt of the disposal request is not

       In point 2, Risk aspects, it is stated:

       Finally, it is mandatory to use the ultraviolet light lamp for

       Also in the document Prevention of fraud and scam, it contains
instructions to avoid this type of crime. In this regard, it is pointed out

       This document already states that “The correct identification of the client, whether

       Likewise, it indicates that:

       “The only valid documents for correct identification are:
       \* National Identity Document.
       \* Passport.
       \* Foreigner Identification Number (NIE), with its different modalities

       Photography.
       Only originals will be valid, never photocopies, and only
       if they are in force. In no case will expired documents be accepted.”

       And:

       The second thing is to observe if there could be any simple manipulation.

       However, in the present case it does not appear that the action carried out
by the employee in the office, as confirmed by the claimant himself, will verify

       But what is paradoxical is that the copy of the DNI that was provided at that time

       In his allegations to the Proposal, the defendant insists on stating that
adopted the necessary measures to prove the identity of the applicant, reaching
to the conclusion that the person who went to the bank office was the one who

claimed to be and corresponded to the claimant, whose document she provided, which
is surprising in light of the facts established in the procedure: the signature
did not correspond to the one existing in the DNI and even so the employee, as stated
indicated previously, the digitization proceeded in the systems of the

what we are dealing with is truly negligent behavior, easily

affected by the protection of your personal data.
       5. Finally, it is true that the Supreme Court in a ruling of 02/15/2022

stated that: “The obligation to adopt the necessary measures to guarantee the
security of personal data cannot be considered an obligation of result,
that implies that there is a leak of personal data to a third party
responsibility regardless of the measures adopted and the activity
displayed by the person responsible for the file or processing.

       In result obligations there is a commitment consisting of the
fulfillment of a certain objective, ensuring the proposed achievement or result,
In this case, guarantee the security of personal data and the absence of
security leaks or breaches.
       In the obligations of means the commitment that is acquired is to adopt

the technical and organizational means, as well as deploying diligent activity in its
implementation and use that tends to achieve the expected result with means
that can reasonably be classified as suitable and sufficient for its achievement,
For this reason, they are called "diligence" or "behavioral" obligations.
       The difference lies in the responsibility in both cases, because while
that in the obligation of result one responds to a harmful result due to the failure of the

security system, whatever its cause and the diligence used. In the
obligation of means, it is enough to establish technically adequate measures and
implement and use them with reasonable diligence.
       In the latter, the sufficiency of the security measures that the
responsible must establish must be put in relation to the state of technology

at any given time and the level of protection required in relation to the data
treated, but a result is not guaranteed.”

       However, the Court also confirms that the design is not sufficient
of the necessary technical and organizational means, since it is also

Its correct implementation and use appropriately are necessary.

       And the responsibility of the defendant is determined by the incident

decisions aimed at effectively implementing that technical measures and
organizational measures are appropriate to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk

to ensure the confidentiality of the data, restoring its availability and preventing
access to them.

       In accordance with the foregoing, it is estimated that the defendant would be
allegedly responsible for the violation of the RGPD: the violation of article 32,
offense classified in article 83.4.a).

                                           SAW
       1. The defendant alleges the existence of a medial competition of infractions for

the assumption referred to in art. 29.5 of Law 40/2015, of October 1,
Therefore, the imposition of only one of the two sanctions would be appropriate, specifically, the
regarding the violation of article 6.1 of the RGPD.

       The art. 29.5 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Sector

Public, establishes that: "When the commission of an infraction results
necessarily the commission of another or others, only the sanction should be imposed
corresponding to the most serious infraction committed".

       However, such an argument cannot be accepted; the specific standard in
matter of data protection, that is, the RGPD, establishes in its article 83.3 that:

       "3. If a controller or a person in charge of the treatment fails to comply
intentional or negligent, for the same treatment operations or operations
linked, various provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the
administrative fine will not be higher than the amount provided for the most serious violations.

serious.

       We already pointed out in FD IV that the processing of personal data
violating the principles and guarantees established in article 6 of the RGPD,
considered a very serious infraction, so the only limit would be established by

the amount indicated in article 83.5 of the RGPD “€20,000,000 maximum or,
In the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount.”

       2. In allegations to the Proposal, the defendant insists on the existence of a

medial contest of violations; Continuing with what has been expressed, it should be noted that the
Article 29 of the LRJSP is not applicable to the sanctioning regime imposed by
the GDPR. And this is because the GDPR is a closed and complete system.

       The GDPR is a European standard directly applicable in the States

members, which contains a new, closed, complete and global system intended to
ensure the protection of personal data uniformly throughout the
European Union.

       In relation, specifically and also, to the sanctioning regime established

In it, its provisions are applicable immediately, directly and
integral, providing for a complete system without gaps that must be understood,
be interpreted and integrated in an absolute, complete, integral manner, thus leaving the
Its ultimate purpose is the effective and real guarantee of the fundamental right to

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 19/26

Personal data protection. The opposite determines the loss of
guarantees of the rights and freedoms of citizens.

       In fact, a specific example of the lack of loopholes in the system
of the GDPR is Article 83 of the GDPR which determines the circumstances that may
operate as aggravating or mitigating circumstances with respect to an infraction (article 83.2 of the
RGDP) or that specifies the existing rule regarding a possible medial contest
(article 83.3 of the RGPD).

       To the above we must add that the RGPD does not allow the development or
implementation of its provisions by the legislators of the Member States, safe
of what the European legislator himself has specifically provided for, delimiting it
in a very specific way (for example, the provision of article 83.7 of the RGPD). In this
sense, the LOPDGDD only develops or specifies some aspects of the RGPD as far as

that it allows and with the scope that it allows.

       This is so because the intended purpose of the European legislator is to implement
a uniform system throughout the European Union that guarantees the rights and freedoms
of natural persons, that corrects behavior contrary to the RGPD, that encourages
compliance, which enables the free circulation of this data.

       In this sense, recital 2 of the GDPR determines that:

       “(2) The principles and rules relating to the protection of natural persons in
regarding the processing of your personal data, they must, whatever

whatever their nationality or residence, respect their freedoms and rights
fundamentals, in particular the right to the protection of personal data
staff. This Regulation aims to contribute to the full realization of a
space of freedom, security and justice and of an economic union, to progress
economic and social, to the reinforcement and convergence of economies within the

internal market, as well as the well-being of natural persons.”

       And recital 13 of the GDPR that:

       “(13) To ensure a consistent level of protection of natural persons
throughout the Union and avoid divergences that hinder the free flow of data

within the internal market, a regulation is necessary that provides
legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including
micro, small and medium-sized businesses, and offer natural persons
of all Member States the same level of rights and obligations enforceable and
of responsibilities for those responsible and in charge of the treatment, in order to

to ensure consistent supervision of the processing of personal data and
equivalent sanctions in all Member States, as well as cooperation
effective between the supervisory authorities of the different Member States. The good
functioning of the internal market requires that the free circulation of data
personal property in the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons related to

protection of natural persons with regard to data processing
personal”.

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 20/26

       In this system, the determining factor of the GDPR is not the fines. The powers
corrective actions of the control authorities provided for in art. 58.2 of the GDPR conjugate
with the provisions of article 83 of the GDPR show the prevalence of measures

corrective measures against fines.

       Thus, article 83.2 of the RGPD establishes that “Administrative fines are
will impose, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, additionally
or substitute for the measures referred to in Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and
j).

       In this way the corrective measures, which are all those provided for in the
article 58.2 of the RGPD, except for the fine, have prevalence in this system, leaving
relegated the financial fine to cases in which the circumstances of the case
specifically determine that a fine is imposed together with corrective measures or in

replacement thereof.

       And all this with the purpose of forcing compliance with the RGPD, avoiding
non-compliance, encourage compliance and ensure that infringement is not more profitable
than non-compliance.

       For this reason, article 83.1 of the RGPD prevents that “Each supervisory authority
shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this
article for the infringements of this Regulation indicated in paragraphs 4, 5 and
6 be effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each individual case.”

       Fines must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive for the
achievement of the purpose intended by the RGPD.

       For this system to work with all its guarantees, it is necessary that
several elements are deployed in an integral and complete manner. The application of rules

unrelated to the RGPD regarding the determination of fines in each of the
Member States applying their national law, whether due to circumstances
aggravating or mitigating circumstances not provided for in the RGPD -or in the LOPDGDD in the case
Spanish as permitted by the RGPD itself-, either by the application of a media contest
different from that provided in the RGPD, would reduce the effectiveness of the system that would lose its
meaning, its teleological purpose, the will of the legislator, resulting in the fines

imposed for different infractions would cease to be effective, proportionate and
deterrents. And in this way the interested parties would also be robbed of the guarantee.
effective enforcement of their rights and freedoms, weakening the uniform application of the GDPR. HE
would diminish the mechanisms for protecting the rights and freedoms of
citizens and would be contrary to the spirit of the RGPD.

       The GDPR is endowed with its own principle of proportionality that must be
applied in its strict terms.
