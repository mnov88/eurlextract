## English Summary

### Facts

A public body for the defense of consumers' rights filed a complaint with the AEPD against the defendant for failing to comply with Article 13 GDPR on its website.

In its investigation, the AEPD found that the defendant's website had a data collection form, but users did not have all the necessary information on the processing of their data according to Article 13 GDPR.

Subsequently, the AEPD verified that the defendant had updated the information on its website.

### Dispute

The decision does not establish precisely why the information provided was not in accordance with the GDPR. However, on the basis of the available information it seems that the information appeared under the title "legal notice" instead of "privacy policy". In addition, the text referred to the old Spanish law instead of the current one.

### Holding

The AEPD imposes a warning sanction and explains that imposing a sanction under Article 83(5)(b) of the GDPR against the respondent would be a disproportionate burden on it. In addition, the AEPD takes into account two factors: 1) that the main activity of the respondent is not directly linked to the processing of personal data and 2) that there is no record of previous data protection infringements.

of users who fill in the form included in the website \*\*\* URL.1 without

Specifically, the content of points 2 to 7 of the Legal Notice, had to be updated

Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights.

privacy has been modified adapting to data protection regulations
current.

                                           SAW

This being the case, in accordance with the evidence available, the facts
exposed, specifically, that since May 2018 the
information provided to users and clients about the processing of their data,
constitute, on the part of the defendant, an infringement of the provisions of article 13 of the

GDPR.
This infraction will be sanctioned with a warning, in accordance with article 58.2.b)
of the RGPD, when collecting basic data from users and

consider that the administrative fine that may be incurred in accordance with the provisions of
Article 83.5.b) of the GDPR would constitute a disproportionate burden for the
claimed, whose main activity is not directly linked to the treatment of
personal data, since there is no evidence of the commission of any previous infringement in
data protection matters.

Likewise, since the adequacy of the information offered to the
users whose personal data is collected from them to the requirements

contemplated in article 13 of the RGPD, it is not necessary to make a request
any.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and assessed the criteria of
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE A.A.A. with NIF \*\*\* NIF.1, for a violation of article 13 of the
RGPD, typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, a warning sanction.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to A.A.A. with NIF \*\*\* NIF. 1.

In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this
Resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.

Against this resolution, which puts an end to the administrative procedure in accordance with art. 48.6 of the
LOPDGDD, and in accordance with the provisions of article 123 of the LPACAP, the
Interested parties may optionally file an appeal for reconsideration before the
Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection within a month to

the Contentious-Administrative Jurisdiction, within a period of two months from the
day following notification of this act, as provided in article 46.1 of the
referred Law.

Finally, it is pointed out that in accordance with the provisions of art. 90.3 a) of the LPACAP,
