## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant had an outstanding debt with his neighbourhood community. After several attempts to notify the debt, the administrator of the community published the complainant's name, address, and amount owed on the community's notice board. The publication was allegedly justified by Article 9 (h) of the Ley 49/1960 de Propriedad Horizontal.

### Dispute

Is the public displaying of a document containing personal data on the notice board of the neighbour’s community a violation of Article 5 (1) (f) GDPR?

### Holding

Article 9 of Ley de Propriedad Horizontal provides that: "If a summons or notification to the owner cannot be made in the place foreseen in the previous paragraph, it will be understood that it has been made by placing the corresponding communication on the community notice board, or in a visible place of general use enabled for this purpose, with express diligence of the date and reasons for which this form of notification is made".

The Spanish DPA held that the public sharing of the personal data on the notice board infringes the principles of integrity and confidentiality set forth in Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. In quantifying the fine, the Authority took into consideration different factors including the non-intentional nature of the infringement and the categories of data concerned. The controller was finally fined for Euro 10.000,00.

## Comment

The complainant was a victim of gender-based violence recognized by a court ruling and therefore requested that her data be processed more carefully.
