## English Summary

### Facts

The electricity and gas company (controller) billed a data subject illegally, in absence of a valid contract for that.

On 14 February 2022, the data subject filed a complaint to the Spanish DPA. The data subject provided several invoices and transaction data from his bank account, which were related to a contract that he had not agreed to. The data subject also showed that he had complained about this issue to the controller several times.

On 18 April 2022, the controller acknowledged that there had been an internal error which had resulted in the unjustified contracting. The controller used a two-step system for contract-signings over the phone. The first step was informing data subjects on the phone about the nature of the service provided by the controller. The second step followed after data subjects accepted the conditions on the phone, after which the controller would send a contract to the data subject by SMS for a signature in order to give consent. According to the controller, the data subject had accepted the conditions, but did not sign the contract and did therefore also not consent to the contract. However, due to an internal synchronisation error at the side of the controller, it seemed that the data subject had signed the contract by SMS and had consented to the contract.

### Holding

The DPA determined that the controller had violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") because of a lack of a legal basis for processing. The DPA determined that this was a fraudulent contract because of a missing signature from the data subject. The processing by the controller was carried out without a legitimate reason.

The DPA originally fined the controller €30,000. That amount was reduced to €24,000 due to a voluntary payment by the controller.

      PROPOSED RESOLUTION OF SANCTION PROCEDURE

Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on
to the following:

                                  BACKGROUND

FIRST: D.A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claiming party) on February 14,
2022 filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
The claim is directed against SUMINISTRADOR IBÉRICO DE ENERGÍA, S.L. with NIF
B67421867 (hereinafter, the claimed party or SIE). The reasons on which the

claim are as follows:

The claimant states that there has been a change in the company of the
electricity and gas supply without your consent.

Provide invoices associated with non-consensual contracting, charges made on your
bank account and claims filed with the claimed party.

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in

forward LOPDGDD), said claim was transferred to the claimed party, for
to proceed with its analysis and inform this Agency within a month of the
actions carried out to adapt to the requirements established in the regulations of
Data Protection.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/13

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of
October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Administrations

Public (hereinafter, LPACAP), was collected on March 14, 2022 as
It appears in the acknowledgment of receipt that is in the file.

On April 18, 2022, this Agency received a written response
indicating:

<<According to the Complainant, during the call the salesperson pretended to work for a
third company, with the aim of misleading him and hiring his services
without knowing that he was changing electricity supplier.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is necessary to indicate that the procedures for the

formalization of the electricity supply contract in SIE require, of course,
the verification and authentication of the manifestation of the client's willingness to proceed
upon signing the contract. This implies that, when a service provider
telemarketing formalizes a supply contract on behalf of SIE, it must provide the
Recording of the sales process. In this way, SIE can verify that the contracting
has been carried out properly.

After reviewing the recordings of the phone call, we were able to
verify that the commercial at no time said that he worked for the third
company in question, but rather carried out the contracting process indicating to the
Claimant that said contracting would be carried out with Más Energía, which is a

brand that sells SIE.

Regarding the origin of the personal data referred to by the Complainant,
The following considerations should be made about the contracting process when
This is done by a company that provides telemarketing services:

- The telemarketing service provider transfers to SIE the personal data of
stakeholders to whom SIE products and services will be offered. Later,
The telemarketing service provider acts as the person in charge of the
treatment of SIE to carry out the activities of offering its products and
services and contracting of the corresponding products and services.

- Notwithstanding the foregoing, the telemarketing service provider may only
carry out commercial actions on those interested parties who have provided them with
your consent for the transfer of your personal data to SIE for said purpose.

Taking into account the above, from SIE it is not possible to determine where the
telemarketing service provider the personal data of the Complainant, since
that he obtained them as the person responsible for the independent treatment of SIE.

However, at the time of signing the contract for the provision of services, said

provider of telemarketing services acquired the commitment to assign only
the personal data of those interested who have given their consent
for said purpose.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/13

Additionally, the service provider undertook to inform the interested parties
duly and in accordance with the regulations on data protection about
of the transfer to SIE of your data.

2. As a result of the receipt of the transfer of claim and request for information that
motivates this writing, from SIE an internal investigation was initiated, in order to
determine whether there had been any non-compliance with the regulations on
of data protection in the organization during the contracting process with the
claimant.

However, this party acknowledges an error in the contract signing process, which
caused unjustified hiring and, therefore, the issuance of invoices that
did not correspond either: SIE has a contract signing process with two
steps: A first step in which the conditions of the service are reported via

telephone and that, if the client accepts said conditions by the same means,
The contract is sent to you for your signature via SMS.

In the case of this claim, the interested party accepted the conditions of the
service by telephone and, despite not having signed the contract via SMS, it appeared
as formalized in the SIE information systems due to an error in

synchronization of these systems.

4. SIE is the first party interested in having its services contracted
always in accordance with current legislation.

Therefore, and although in this case it has been possible to determine after the investigations
made that their action has been in accordance with the data protection regulations
personal, because incidents of a different nature have been detected in the
contracting procedure for its services, SIE has adopted as a measure the
total stoppage of the contracting procedure for its services since the past

March 4, 2022 and until they are resolved>>.

THIRD: In accordance with article 65 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights
(LOPDGDD), when submitted to the Spanish Data Protection Agency
(hereinafter, AEPD) a claim, it must evaluate its admissibility for processing,

must notify the claimant of the decision on the admission or non-admission to
procedure, within three months from the date the claim was entered into this
Agency.

If, after this period, said notification does not take place, it will be understood that

the processing of the claim continues in accordance with the provisions of Title VIII of
Law. Said provision is also applicable to the procedures that the
AEPD would have to process in exercise of the powers that were attributed to it by
other laws.

In this case, taking into account the foregoing and that the claim is
filed with this Agency, on February 14, 2022, it is communicated that your
The claim has been admitted for processing on May 14, 2022, having elapsed
three months from the time it entered the AEPD.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/13

FOURTH: On September 9, 2022, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the claimed party,

in accordance with the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1,
of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (in
hereinafter, LPACAP), for the alleged infringement of Article 6.1 of the GDPR, typified in
Article 83.5 of the GDPR.

FIFTH: Notified of the aforementioned start-up agreement in accordance with the rules established in

Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of
Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), the claimed party submitted a written
of allegations in which, in summary, he stated that: <<as we already explained in
our response to the request for information sent to the AEPD, our
procedure for contracting our services consists of a process of

verification and authentication of the manifestation of the client's willingness to proceed
to the formalization of the supply contract. This implies that, when the service provider
telemarketing services formalizes a supply contract on behalf of SIE, the latter
must provide the recording of the sale process, in this way, SIE can verify that
recruitment has been carried out properly.

Once we have reviewed the recording of the telephone call, we can affirm that: 1. The
commercial at no time indicated that he worked for a third company. The
indicates that the contract will be carried out with Más Luz Energía, a
brand marketed by SIE.

2. The interested party expresses his will during the call to hire both
supplies (electricity and gas) with the SIE company through the Más Luz Energía brand.

We attach as Annex I the transcript of the call where the interested party
expresses its willingness to contract both supplies.

This party explained that the contracting process for the services offered by SIE is
is done by means of a double acceptance, a first acceptance occurs during the
phone call and a second by sending an SMS to finish
formalize the contract. Although in this specific case this second acceptance is not
was carried out when the SMS was not sent to the interested party, to which they had to respond with a “YES”.

This party understands that, although the formalization of the contract was not carried out through the
sending of the corresponding SMS due to a human error not attributable to SIE, yes
the claimant clearly stated his willingness to contract with SIE (as
can be seen in the transcript of the call provided), and consequently the

treatment carried out would fall within the expectation of the interested party.

For this reason, as a result of the internal investigations into what happened in the process of
contracting its services, SIE halted the contracting of its services with
undefined character.

For all of the foregoing, that the Proceedings File be filed by the
AEPD>>.

                                PROVEN FACTS

FIRST: On February 14, 2022, it has entered the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection a letter from the complaining party in which it states that it has been
carried out a change of the electricity and gas supply company without your

consent.

Provide invoices associated with non-consensual contracting, charges made on your

SECOND: SIE acknowledges in its brief of April 18, 2022 and in the allegations to the

                           FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

                                           Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/13

guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

                                            II

In response to the allegations presented by the respondent entity, it should be noted
the next:

Article 6.1 of the GDPR establishes the assumptions that allow the use of
processing of personal data.

"one. Processing will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following

conditions:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;

c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the

responsible for the treatment;

d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another
Physical person.

e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller;

f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said

interests do not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child.

The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the treatment
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.”

On this question of the legality of the treatment, Recital 40 also affects

of the aforementioned GDPR, when it provides that "For the treatment to be lawful, the
Personal data must be processed with the consent of the interested party or on
some other legitimate basis established in accordance with Law, either in the present
Regulation or by virtue of another Law of the Union or of the Member States to which
referred to in this Regulation, including the need to comply with the legal obligation

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/13

applicable to the data controller or the need to perform a contract with
to which the interested party is a party or in order to take measures at the request of the
concerned prior to the conclusion of a contract."

Well then, in response to the allegations presented by the defendant, it is

It should be noted that there is evidence that the data processing of the person who
appears in the contract object of this claim has been made without cause
legitimizing the data collected in article 6 of the GDPR.

The GDPR applies to personal data, which is defined as "personal data":
any information about an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject");

An identifiable natural person shall be considered any person whose identity can be
be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as
for example a name, an identification number, location data, a
online identifier or one or more elements of physical identity,
physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social of said person.

It has been verified, as the defendant acknowledges, that the data of the person

claimant "However, this party acknowledges an error in the process of signing the
contract, which caused an unjustified hiring and, therefore, the issuance of some
invoices that did not correspond either: SIE has a contract signing process
with two steps: A first step in which the conditions of service are reported by
by telephone and that, if the client accepts said conditions for the same
via, the contract is sent to you for your signature via SMS.

In the case of this claim, the interested party accepted the conditions of the
service by telephone and, despite not having signed the contract via SMS, it appeared
as formalized in the SIE information systems due to an error in
synchronization of said systems" were treated without legitimizing basis and without

The signature of the complaining party was recorded in the contract, and that there was a contract
fraudulent.

And, in the allegations to the present procedure of September 30, 2022,
The defendant states that <<Although in this specific case this second

answer with a “YES”>>.

According to what has been stated, data processing requires the existence of a
legal basis that legitimizes it, such as the consent of the interested party provided
validly, and in this specific case there is no legitimating basis since the contract

it was not formalized.

                                           II

In accordance with the available evidence, it is considered that the
facts exposed do not comply with the provisions of article 6.1. of the GDPR, therefore

could involve the commission of an offense classified in article 83.5 of the GDPR,
which provides the following:

 Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/13

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;

b) the rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22; \[…\].”

For the purposes of the limitation period for infringements, the infringement indicated in the
previous paragraph is considered very serious and prescribes after three years, in accordance with the
Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which establishes that:

       According to what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

b) The processing of personal data without the fulfillment of any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

(…)»

                                            IV.

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR, precepts that state:

“Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of administrative fines
under this Article for infringements of this Regulation

indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are effective in each individual case,

        damages they have suffered;

        b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

        c) any measure taken by the controller or processor

        to alleviate the damages and losses suffered by the interested parties;

        d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or the person in charge of the
        processing, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have
        applied under articles 25 and 32;

        e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or in charge of the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

        treatment;

         f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put
        remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach;

        g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

        h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement,
        in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such
        case, to what extent;

        i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
        previously ordered against the person in charge or in charge in question
        in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;

        j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or to mechanisms

        of certification approved in accordance with article 42, and

        k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
        case, such as the financial benefits obtained or the losses avoided, direct
        or indirectly, through the infraction.”

Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the GDPR, the LOPDGDD, article 76,
"Sanctions and corrective measures", provides:

 "2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
