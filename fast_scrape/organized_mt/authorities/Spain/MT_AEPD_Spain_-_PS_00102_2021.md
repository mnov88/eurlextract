## English Summary

### Facts

The political activist association Hazte Oir shared a leaflet containing the names, surnames and images of three individuals that were giving sexual education lectures in schools, without their consent.

Subsequently, a LGBT-rights association lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA, which launched an investigation. During this investigation, Hazte Oir withdrew the leaflets and distributed new ones without the names and pictures.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA held that sharing the names, surnames and pictures of the individuals without their consent was a violation of Article 6 GDPR.

Because of that, they fined Hazte Oir €5000, with a possibility of a reduced fine of €3000 if the association made an early payment and recognized their responsibility. The association chose to make the early payment, but refused to recognize their responsibility. Therefore, the fine was only reduced to €4000.
