## English Summary

### Facts

This decision is a consequence of a complaint submitted by a citizen stating that they requested via email the defendant’s Data Protection Officer access to the record of processing activities, but the controller never replied to the request. Four months after the request the claimant brought the dispute to the Spanish Data Protection Authority (AEPD). The AEPD found that the Council did not have a record of processing activities, what was confirmed by the controller.

### Dispute

The controller answered to the AEPD's investigation requests confirming that it had not implemented a record of processing activities, due to political issues and the pandemic situation.

With regards to the lack of answer to the data subject, the controller stated that the request was not addressed by the means required by the Spanish Administrative Law.

The AEPD launched a sanctioning procedure, remaking that the GDPR entered into force in 2016 and is fully applicable since 2018, so the controller had had enough time to adapt to it.

### Holding

In the allegations process, the controller argued that it had started implementing the record of processing activities during the duration of this procedure and was compliant with Article 30 GDPR and Article 31 of the [Spanish Data Protection Act](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673).

The DPA concluded that there had been no record of processing activities, and that consequently the controller had infringed Article 30 GDPR and Article 31 of the [Spanish Data Protection Act](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673). Since the City Council is a public body, the AEPD imposed a warning on the controller, and compelled it to comply with the GDPR.

treatment activities.

Treatment is an instrument to prove that the action of the controller complies with the

strict liability.

Article 30, "Registration of treatment activities", of the RGPD establishes that:

may involve a risk to the rights and freedoms of the interested parties, not occasional, or

On the other hand, article 31 of the LOPDGDD establishes the following:

"1. Those responsible and in charge of the treatment or, where appropriate, their representatives must
maintain the record of treatment activities referred to in article 30 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, unless the exception provided for in its section applies

5.

The registry, which may be organized around structured data sets, must
specify, according to their purposes, the processing activities carried out and the other

data protection must notify you of any addition, modification or exclusion in the
registry content.

2. The subjects listed in article 77.1 of this organic law will make public an inventory
of its treatment activities accessible by electronic means, which will include the
information established in article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and its legal basis ”.

                                            III

The aforementioned standards establish the obligation of those responsible and in charge of the

processing of personal data to keep a record of the activities of the
treatment. In addition, in the case of the subjects listed in article 77.1 of the
LOPDGDD, which includes the entities that make up the Administration
Local, like the one claimed, is also obliged to make said record public and accessible
by electronic means.

In this case, the documentation in the file certifies that the claimed
violated article 30 of the RGPD, "Registration of treatment activities", by not
have prepared and published this registry until June 2021. As recorded in the
brief of allegations to the proposal and in the attached documentation, the

"Inventory of the registry of personal data processing activities" of the
GIJÓN CITY COUNCIL was approved by Resolution of the Mayor's Office and
06/16/2021.

The defendant himself, prior to the aforementioned hearing procedure, had recognized
that it is the responsibility of the data controller to provide the interested party with access to the RAT;
and that, where appropriate, said record was in the process of validation, without
date on which he formulates his allegations at the opening of the procedure, the works
related to said registry have reached the publication phase. And raised

these initial allegations at the opening in accordance with this fact, noting that
This was due to delays derived from the beginning of a new mandate of the
municipal corporation in mid-2019, of its consequent readjustments
competences and the difficulties caused by the current socio-sanitary crisis.

According to the claimed entity, the configuration of the Municipal Government team to
mid-2019, motivated by local elections, led to a series of changes
in the municipal internal organization. Through the Governing Board Agreement
Local, of 07/28/2020, the current job list was approved,

eliminating the Planning and Modernization Service and creating the Service of
Strategy and Coordination of Resources, who is attributed, among others, the
assistance, technical and material support to the Data Protection Delegate for the
performance of their duties.

On the other hand, the defendant pointed out that he has seen how in recent years by
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/11

certain circumstances have imposed a series of limitations and difficulties
in the optimal performance of services, which has been joined by the current crisis
health care derived from COVI-19, which has caused delays in some processes

ongoing, based on more urgent and urgent needs.

The complainant explained that on 03/15/2019 he approved the "Roadmap" for adaptation to
the new LOPDGDD, among whose measures was the preparation of the registry of
treatment activities, and expressly stated that he was not in
conditions to make it accessible to citizens through publication.

He also reported that security and data protection policies were being
promoted through the tendering of a contract to try to provide solutions for
management derived from perimeter security, correlation of security events,
training in security measures, adaptation to the National Security Scheme

(ENS) and the RGPD, currently in process. Finally, I point out that "immaturity"
current record of treatment activities prevented its publication.

Ultimately, the defendant, in his responses to this body, attached evidence that
would show the existence of the preparatory work for the elaboration of the indicated
registration, although such work had not been completed at the time the

present procedure, so that said Registry had not been prepared at that time.
date, nor at the moment in which the allegations are presented at the opening.
It was expressly admitted that it was not in a position to make the
registration of treatment activities for citizens through publication.

These circumstances are referred to in the Second Proven Fact, which is
of the information provided by the claimed entity itself. They do not understand each other, in
Consequently, the allegations in the motion for a resolution question the
expressed in this proven fact.

Regarding the circumstances alleged to justify this delay in adapting to the
RGPD, the proposed resolution warned the defendant that said Regulation is
It has been in force since 05/24/2016 and fully applicable since 05/25/2018.
Therefore, the obligation to prepare the record of treatment activities is very
prior to the constitution of the new municipal corporation and the outbreak of the
pandemic. If the aforementioned City Council claimed, to overcome the alleged limitations,

recently started the procedures for the bidding of a contract that aims to
development of the necessary tasks to fulfill that adaptation to the RGPD, either
he could have formalized such a contract years before.

On the other hand, in its brief of allegations to the proposed resolution, the entity

complained considers that the lack of publicity of the record of activities of
treatment does not imply a breach, taking into account that this record is
configured in Recital 82 of the RGPD only as an instrument "(82)
To demonstrate compliance with these Regulations, the controller or the
processor must keep records of processing activities

under its responsibility".

This instrumental nature of the record of treatment activities is true, but
so is the obligation to maintain it. Failure to comply with this obligation is

constituting an infringement, as set out in the following Legal Basis.

Therefore, in the present case, the breach of the provisions is proven.
in articles 30 of the RGPD and 31 of the LOPDGDD.

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 establishes that “They constitute

Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to the

(…) ”.
                                              V

The LOPDGDD in its article 77, “Regime applicable to certain categories of

the conduct ceases or the effects of the offense that had been committed are corrected.

The resolution will be notified to the person in charge or in charge of the treatment, the body of which
hierarchically depends, where appropriate, and those affected who had the status of

3. Without prejudice to the provisions of the previous section, the data protection authority
will also propose the initiation of disciplinary actions when there are indications

Likewise, when the infractions are attributable to authorities and managers, and the

this article.

6. When the competent authority is the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, this

When the competence corresponds to an autonomous data protection authority,

It will be, as far as the publicity of these resolutions is concerned, to what its regulations provide
specific ”.

In the case at hand, it is found that the defendant, as he has

confirmed in its response to the informative request of this AEPD, it has breached
the obligation to have the RAT established, as well as to make it public by means of
electronic

Said conduct constitutes, on the part of the defendant, an infringement of the
provided in articles 30 of the RGPD and 31 of the LOPDGDD.

It should be noted that the RGPD, without prejudice to the provisions of its article 83,

contemplates in its article 77 the possibility of directing a warning to correct the
breaches of the provisions set forth in said Regulation and in the aforementioned
Organic Law by those responsible or in charge listed in section 1.

This being the case, the established circumstances cannot be applied in the present case.

GIJÓN in its brief of allegations to the resolution proposal.

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/11

On the other hand, it is contemplated that the resolution issued may establish the
measures to be taken to stop the behavior, correcting the effects of the
infraction that had been committed and the necessary adaptation is carried out, in this

case, to the requirements contemplated in article 30 of the RGPD, as well as the
Provision of means of accreditation of compliance with what is required.

Thus, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 77 of the LOPD, by the instructor of the
procedure, a resolution proposal was formulated so that the Director of the
AEPD agrees to require the responsible entity to adapt its action to the

personal data protection regulations, proceeding to prepare the registry of
treatment activities and providing what is necessary to make it accessible by
electronic media.

However, on the occasion of the hearing procedure on the proposed resolution, the

claimed has proven to have fulfilled these obligations. It is proven that,
By Resolution of the Mayor's Office dated 06/16/2021, the said
"Inventory of the registry of personal data processing activities" and published
Through the web “gijon.es” (url “https://www.gijon.es/es/publicaciones/inventario-del-
registry-of-activities-of-treatment-of-personal-data ”).

The brief of allegations included a link to the aforementioned "Inventory", in its initial edition.
It is verified that the treatments are grouped by common subjects and specific to
administrative areas, services or units; and that for each treatment activity
Its purpose, legal basis, category of personal data, category of
interested parties, recipients of communications, international transfers,

retention periods and technical and organizational measures. It also details the
identity of the person responsible for the treatment (GIJÓN CITY COUNCIL) and the data of
contact of the Data Protection Delegate.

This "Inventory", due to its content and structure, conforms to the regulated provisions

of articles 30 of the RGPD and 31 of the LOPD. Therefore, as of the current date, it is understood
the obligation to keep a record of processing activities has been fulfilled
carried out under the responsibility of the GIJÓN CITY COUNCIL, not resulting
from the imposition of additional measures.

This declaration does not imply any pronouncement on the regularity or legality of

the treatment activities described in the registry provided by the claimed, nor
on its purpose or legal basis, as they are aspects that exceed the object of the
