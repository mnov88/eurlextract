## English Summary

### Facts

On 13 November 2022, a data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. (the controller). The controller solicited ASNEF-Equifax, a solvency data collector, to include the data subject’s information concerning a credit card debt in its solvency file. The data subject claimed that this was done without prior notice because the postal address to which ASNEF-Equifax was meant to send notice was incomplete and not the exact address of the data subject. The data subject became aware of the processing when they were denied credit from other financial institutions.

On 13 August 2021, ASNEF-Equifax mailed the data subject a notification of their inclusion in its solvency file. It sent the notification to the address cosigned by controller. This was the address that the controller had registered as the data subject’s, and that it had sent payment demands to for the credit card in question. On 29 October 2021, ASNEF-Equifax received the mailed notification back due to incorrect delivery. ASNEF-Equifax then requested a confirmation of the mailing information from the controller, which indicated that the address was correct.

### Holding

By not providing the exact address of the data subject, the controller caused a serious damage to the data subject because it was not made aware of its inclusion in solvency files. The AEPD thus found that the controller violated the principle of accuracy pursuant to [Article 5(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1d "Article 5 GDPR").

The AEPD recommended a sanction of €200,000. Pursuant to [Law 39/2015,](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10565) a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the AEPD informed the controller that it may acknowledge its responsibility for the alleged violations and/or pay the proposed fine. Each of these actions reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to reduce the fine by 40%, both acknowledging its responsibility for the violations and paying the reduced sanction amount of €120,000.

                          Typification of Article 5 of the GDPR

Article 5 GDPR establishes that personal data will be:

considered incompatible with the initial purposes ("purpose limitation");

c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which

personal details of the complaining party, providing the email address to make the
prior notice the following address: \*\*\*ADDRESS.1, although the postal address

Therefore, such events could involve the commission of an infraction, attributable to
the claimed party, for violation of article 5.1.d) RGPD, which requires that the data

They must take all reasonable measures to ensure that they are deleted or rectified without

claimant, since he could not have been aware of its inclusion in files of

inaccurate email address, as it has not been updated by the claimed party,
which represents a violation of the principle of accuracy regulated in article 5.1 d)
