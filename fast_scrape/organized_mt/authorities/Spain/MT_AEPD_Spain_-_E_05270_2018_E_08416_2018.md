## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject complained because Facebook unilaterally generated a public page disclosing their name, surname and address without their consent. They had contacted the "_person in charge of the social network_" to request the deletion of the web page, but it were asked for an "_accreditation of \[their\] identity_."

### Holding

The Spanish DPA forwarded the complaint to the Irish DPA as the main establishment of Facebook in Europe is in Ireland. The Irish DPC forwarded the complaint to Facebook and mediated to find an amicable solution by which Facebook accepted to delete the account opened on behalf of the complainant. The decision was communicated to the Spanish DPA that forwarded it to the complainant.

## Comment
