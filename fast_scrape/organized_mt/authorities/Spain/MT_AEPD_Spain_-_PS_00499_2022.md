## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject booked an apartment from Marketing Accomodantion Solutions, the controller, for a period of vacation in Catalonia. To check in, the data subject had to fill in an online form and provide personal data of all guests, including emails, telephone numbers and addresses, as well as photos of both sides of the identity cards of each of them.

The data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA claiming that the data requested was excessive. In response, the controller argued that it was obliged by law to register its guests and to transfer their data to the Catalan police. Not satisfied with the response, the data subject filed a complaint twith the Spanish DPA, which proceeded to investigate the facts.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA highlighted that the controller must limit data processing to what is strictly necessary for the specific purpose it intends to achieve.

In the present case, it noted that not all data processed were necessary to provide the service of renting holiday apartments or to comply with the obligation to register guests provided for by Article 2 of Regulation IRP/418/2010. This Regulation deals with the obligation to register and notify the General Directorate of Police of persons staying in accommodation establishments located in Catalonia and only requires that the following data be collected: identity document number, type of document, date of issue thereof (if indicated), surnames, first name, gender, nationality, date of entry, address, telephone and expected days of stay. For this reason, the DPA found that the controller violated [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"), notably for having requested the image of both sides of the identity documents of its guests.

In addition, the DPA recalled that [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") requires the controller to provide the data subject with a series of information at the time of collection the collection of their personal data. In the case at stake, it verified that the information provided to the guests was not complete. In particular, the following information was missing: the identity and contact details of the controller, the contact of the DPO, the legal basis for the processing of personal data, the recipients or the categories of recipients and the retention period. Similarly, the controller's privacy policy did not comply with the provisions of [Article 13](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

In view of the above, the DPA imposed a fine of €25,000 for the violation of [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR") and a fine of €50,000 for the violation of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

on which the claim is based are the following:

Through the Airbnb online platform, the claimant contacted the entity
owner of an apartment in Barcelona, MARKETING ACCOMMODATION

his companions. Said entity had enabled a web page / app to make the

online check-in, a mandatory procedure to formalize the delivery of the keys to the
apartment. To carry out the online check-in, the seven people who were going to
to stay in the apartment they had to fill out a form with the post office,
telephone numbers and addresses, as well as send photos of your D.N.I. for the two
faces and selfies of each of them.

After the stay, specifically on October 23, 2021, the claimant
contacted the person responsible for the treatment to indicate that the data that

The response that has been given on October 25, 2021 is very generic.

FOURTH: It is accredited that the person in charge of the web page \*\*\*URL.1 is the
claimed part.

FIFTH: The Spanish Agency for Data Protection has legally notified
the party claimed the agreement to open this disciplinary proceeding,

but it has not presented allegations or evidence that contradict the facts
denounced.

                           FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

                                           Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure
Spanish Data Protection.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

Article 3.2 of the GDPR states that "This Regulation applies to the treatment
of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a
controller or processor not established in the Union, when the activities of
treatment are related to:

a) the offer of goods or services to said interested parties in the Union,
regardless of whether they are required to pay,

b) the control of their behavior, to the extent that this takes place in the Union”

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/21

In the present case, the claimed party, although not established in the Union,
offers a vacation rental service within the same, so
that the Agency is competent to process this file.

                                            II

Every data controller must respect the principles contained in article
5 of the GDPR. We will highlight article 5.1.c) of the GDPR which establishes that:

"1. Personal data will be

c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are processed ("data minimization");"

It must be clarified that this article does not limit the excess of data, but the need. Is
In other words, the personal data will be "adequate, pertinent and limited to the need"
for which they were collected, in such a way that if the objective pursued can
achieved without excessive data processing, this should be done at all
case.

Similarly, recital 39 of the GDPR indicates that: "Personal data only
should be processed if the purpose of the processing cannot reasonably be achieved by
other media." Therefore, only the data that is "adequate,
relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which they are obtained or processed”.

The categories of data selected for processing must be the
strictly necessary to achieve the stated objective and the person responsible for the
treatment must strictly limit the collection of data to that information that
is directly related to the specific purpose that is intended to be achieved.

In this case, the claimed party processes various data
personal information such as name, surname, telephone number, email address
email, postal address, image of the D.N.I. on both sides.

And not all of them are necessary to provide the apartment rental service
vacation or to comply with the obligation to register people who

stay in accommodation establishments in Catalonia required by article 2 of
Order IRP/418/2010, of August 5, on the obligation of registration and communication
to the General Directorate of Police of the people staying in the
lodging establishments located in Catalonia.

It is in Annex I of the aforementioned Order where the data that is necessary to
such registration: identity document number, type of document, date of
issuance of the same (if stated), surnames, first name, sex, nationality, date of
entry, address, telephone number and expected days of stay.

From the documentation in the file there is evidence that the party
claimed has violated article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, having demanded the image of the
ID on both sides, in order to be able to obtain the keys to the accommodation

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/21

that they have reserved, since such data is not necessary for the treatment carried out by
the claimed part.

On the other hand, it should be noted that, although the complaining party indicated that the party
claimed also demanded a selfie of the people who were going to stay in the
apartment, this point has not been properly tested.

                                           II

In the present case, the defendant party has not presented allegations or evidence that
contradict the facts denounced within the period given for it.

In accordance with the evidence that is available and that has not been
distorted during the disciplinary procedure, it is considered that the party

claimed has processed data that was excessive as it was not necessary for the purpose
for which they were treated.

In view of the foregoing, the facts imply a violation of what is established in the
Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, which implies the commission of an offense classified in the
Article 83.5, section a) of the GDPR, which under the heading "General conditions for

the imposition of administrative fines" provides that:

Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,

Taking into account the precepts transcribed, for the purpose of setting the amount of the sanction of

of the GDPR, it is appropriate to graduate it in accordance with the following circumstances:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/21

As aggravating factors:

- In the activity of the claimed party, it is essential to process personal data.

- The intent or negligence in the infringement, since the claimed party was
fully aware of the procedure implemented (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR).
Connected with the degree of diligence that the data controller is obliged to

data protection, the Judgment of the National Court of 17 of 10
of 2007 (rec. 63/2006), which, after alluding to the fact that the entities in which the

now examined, when the appellant's activity is of constant and abundant
handling of personal data must insist on rigor and exquisite care

for complying with the legal provisions in this regard” (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR).

The agreement to initiate this disciplinary procedure indicated that "The amount of
the corresponding fine, without prejudice to what results from the instruction of the
procedure, is €50,000 (fifty thousand euros).”

However, in view of the fact that it has not been proven that the claimed party requires a selfie
of the people who are going to stay in their apartments at the time of check-in
online, as well as by the balance of the circumstances contemplated, with respect to the
offense committed by violating the provisions of article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, a

fine of €25,000 (twenty-five thousand euros).

                                            V

From the documentation in the file there is evidence that the party
claimed has violated article 13 of the GDPR, by not having sent to the people
who have made the reservation of one of their holiday apartments all the
information required by the aforementioned precept, nor has its policy of

privacy to what is established in the aforementioned article.

                                           SAW

In the present case, the defendant party has not presented allegations or evidence that

contradict the facts denounced within the period given for it.

In accordance with the evidence that is available and that has not been
distorted during the disciplinary procedure, it is considered that the party
claimed has not complied with the obligation to send the interested party all the information

which includes article 13 of the GDPR.

In view of the foregoing, the facts imply a violation of what is established in the
Article 13 of the GDPR, which implies the commission of an offense classified in the
Article 83.5, section b) of the GDPR, which under the heading "General conditions for
the imposition of administrative fines" provides that:

Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for

the highest amount:

b) the rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22;”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 establishes that "They constitute
offenses the acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the

Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to the
present organic law”.
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 19/21

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 of the LOPDGDD indicates:

Article 72. Offenses considered very serious.

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

(…)

h) The omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the processing of their data

2016/679 and 12 of this organic law.”

                                           VII

For the purposes of setting the amount of the fine to be imposed in this case for
the infringement typified in article 83.5.b) of the GDPR, it is necessary to graduate it according to
with the following circumstances:

As aggravating factors:

- In the activity of the claimed party, it is essential to process personal data.

(article 76.2.b) of the LOPDGDD in relation to article 83.2.k) of the GDPR).

- The intent or negligence in the infringement, since the claimed party is
fully aware of its privacy policy. Connected with the degree of
diligence that the person responsible for the treatment is obliged to deploy in the
compliance with the obligations imposed by the data protection regulations

In assessing the degree of diligence, special consideration must be given to the
professionalism or not of the subject, and there is no doubt that, in the case now examined,
when the activity of the appellant is constant and abundant handling of data from

legal precautions in this regard” (article 83.2.b) of the GDPR).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 20/21

The balance of the circumstances contemplated, with respect to the infraction committed
by violating the provisions of article 13 of the GDPR, it allows setting a fine of €50,000
(fifty thousand euros).

                                         VIII

The text of the resolution establishes which have been the infractions committed and
the facts that have given rise to the violation of the regulations for the protection of
data, from which it is clearly inferred what are the measures to adopt, without prejudice

that the type of procedures, mechanisms or concrete instruments for
implement them corresponds to the sanctioned party, since it is responsible for the
treatment who fully knows its organization and has to decide, based on the
proactive responsibility and risk approach, how to comply with the GDPR and the
LOPDGDD.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and assessed the criteria of
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been accredited,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE MARKETING ACCOMMODATION SOLUTIONS FZ, L.L.C.,
with fiscal identifier 45000501, for the infraction:
