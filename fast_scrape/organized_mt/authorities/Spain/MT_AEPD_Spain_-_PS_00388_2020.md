## English Summary

### Facts

The AEPD received a complaint stating that two websites of a controller lacked a privacy and cookies policy, or any other kind of information regarding the data that they process.

After launching an investigation, the AEPD found that the one of the websites did have a privacy and cookies policy. However, the AEPD also found that both websites gathered consent from the use in a generic way. The user did not have an option to specify what processing they wanted to consent. This was amended by the controller during the proceeding.

The website also offered, in the form for collecting the user's data, information on who is responsible for the processing of personal data; the legitimacy of the data processing (consent); the recipients and the rights that assist the user in relation to the processing of their personal data.

The AEPD also found that the website placed unnecessary third-party cookies in the user's device without consent. The banner only offered generic information and had no button to reject the cookies in its first layer. An option to reject cookies was included by the controller during the proceeding.

In the second layer, the user can reject unnecessary cookies. However, the authority found that, when exercising this option, they were used anyway.

During the course of the investigation, the controller deleted the second website, that lacked a privacy and cookies policy, redirecting the user to the first website when using its domain.

### Holding

The AEPD held that the cookie banner of the website violated Article 22(2) of the [Spanish Information Society Services Act](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2002-13758) (LSSI), implementing the e-Privacy Directive, as it did not properly inform the user about the fact that the website used third-party cookies with marketing purposes, that would create a profile, based on the user's navigation behaviour, in order to show them advertisements related to their preferences.

It also violated Article 22(2) by not allowing to reject such cookies, using them without consent, even when the user had deactivated the option.

The AEPD also found that there had been a violation of Article 7 GDPR before the controller allowed the user to choose what specific processing they wanted to consent.

The AEPD decided the following:

*   To warn the controller with regards to a violation of Article 7 GDPR, for gathering consent in a generic way.
*   To fine the controller €3000 for infringing Article 22(2) LSSI, for installing third-party cookies without consent.
*   To warn the controller for lacking a privacy policy in their second website, thus violating Article 13 GDPR.
*   To order the controller to adapt its website, with respect to the "cookies policy", including the necessary information in the cookie banner regarding the use of third party cookies, as well as preventing the use of unnecessary cookies until the user has consented to their use.

In relation to the "Cookies Policy" of the website, it continues to be verified that:

    - When entering the home page of the web, without taking any other action on the

        itself and without rejecting cookies, unnecessary cookies are used.

    - The banner on cookies existing in the first layer does not inform the user of

        the use of third-party cookies, it is not reported that it will be displayed
        advertising related to preferences, based on the profile prepared from

    - If you choose to reject all cookies, in the control panel, leaving all
        the cursors in the <<off>> position, it is verified that the web page follows

        using non-necessary third-party cookies.

b) .- Regarding the website, \*\*\* URL.2,

It has been found that, when trying to access the page. \*\*\* URL.2, this one no longer

exists, redirecting the user to the page, \*\*\* URL.1.

                                              III
    - On the consent given by users for the treatment of their

        personal data, on the website \*\*\* URL.1.

In the last check that has been made of the web page, it has been possible to
verify that it allows collecting the consent of the user, individualized
for each of the purposes to which the entity will dedicate the data processing.

Article 6.1.a) of the RGPD, establishes that, “the treatment will only be lawful if the
interested party gave their consent to the processing of their personal data for
one or more specific purposes ”.

For its part, article 7 of the RGPD indicates, regarding consent, that:

"1. When the treatment is based on the consent of the interested party, the person in charge
must be able to demonstrate that he consented to the processing of his data
personal. 2. If the consent of the interested party is given in the context of a
written statement that also refers to other matters, the request for

Consent will be presented in such a way that it is clearly distinguishable from others
matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible way and using clear and simple language.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/19

Any part of the declaration that constitutes an infringement of the
this Regulation (…).

In relation to these two cited articles, the recital should be taken into account
(32) of the RGPD, as it indicates that:

“Consent must be given through a clear affirmative act that reflects a
manifestation of free, specific, informed, and unequivocal will of the interested party
accept the processing of personal data that concerns you ... Therefore, the

silence, checked boxes, or inaction should not constitute consent. The
Consent must be given for all processing activities carried out with the
same or the same ends. When the treatment has several purposes, the
consent for all of them ... "

Likewise, article 6.2 of the LOPDGDD indicates, on the treatment based on the
consent, that:

"two. When it is intended to base the processing of the data on the consent of the
affected for a plurality of purposes, it will be necessary to record in a
specific and unequivocal that said consent is granted for all of them.

Therefore, the known facts about the processing of personal data by the
website, until the collection of personal data processing was modified
were constitutive of an infringement for violation of article 7 of the RGPD
mentioned.

For its part, article 72.1.c) of the LOPDGDD, considers very serious, for the purposes of
prescription, "Failure to comply with the requirements of article 7 of the RGPD".

This offense may be punished with a fine of a maximum of € 20,000,000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
of a higher amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

However, Article 58.2) of the RGPD provides that: “Each control authority
have all of the following corrective powers listed below: b)

sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with warning when
the treatment operations have infringed the provisions of this
Regulation; (…); i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83,
in addition to or instead of the measures mentioned in this section, according to the
circumstances of each particular case, therefore, the sanction that could

Corresponding would be a warning, without prejudice to what results from the instruction
of the present file, since in this case, it has not been verified that the defendant
has sent communications unrelated to the main purpose.

In accordance with these criteria, it is considered appropriate to impose a sanction on the defendant

of "warning", for the violation of article 7 of the RGPD, on the website of your
ownership, during the time that the collection of the consent of the
user in a generic way for all purposes of the processing of personal data.

commission of the violation of article 22.2 of the LSSI, regarding the cookie policy

The foregoing will not prevent possible storage or access of a technical nature to only
in order to carry out the transmission of a communication over a communication network
electronic devices or, to the extent strictly necessary, for the provision of
an information society service expressly requested by the

addressee".

This offense is classified as "slight" in article 38.4 g), of the aforementioned Law, which
considers as such: “Use data storage and recovery devices
when the information has not been provided or the consent of the
recipient of the service in the terms required by article 22.2. ”, which may be

LSSI.

Based on these criteria, it is deemed appropriate to impose on the claimed entity
a penalty of 3,000 euros (three thousand euros), for the violation of article 22.2 of the
LSSI, regarding the cookie policy carried out on the website of its ownership.
