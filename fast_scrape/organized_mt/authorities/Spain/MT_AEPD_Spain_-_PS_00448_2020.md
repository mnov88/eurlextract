## English Summary

### Facts

First, a data subject filed a complaint in which indicated that they have exercised their right to object to the use of their personal data for direct marketing purposes but the defendant continued to send SMS to their mobile number. The complainant provided proof of having received more than 60 SMS within 30 days which suggests that the defendant did not fulfil the complainant’s request.

Second, the same complainant indicated that they reported to the defendant that they were receiving a large number of SMS to their mobile number with confidential information about third parties. The defendant told the complainant that it had noted the incident and that it would not reoccur. However, the defendant continued to send information related to third parties to the complainant, in particular, a security code to access the platform "Mi Yoigo", to which the complainant accessed and was able to view personal data from a third party. The access given allowed the complainant to view someone else’s bills, phone number, address, bank account, account number and the possibility to make any changes in the third party’s profile. The complainant also provided proof to this effect.

## Dispute

Were the actions of the defendant a violation of the principles relating to processing of personal data contained in article 5(f) and 32 the GDPR?

### Holding

\-Article 17 GDPR – Right to Erasure - €50000 fine

\-Article 32 GDPR – Failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk – €30000 fine

\- Article 21 of the LSSI (Spanish Law on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce) regarding the sending of commercial SMS or advertising without the express consent of the recipient - €20000 fine

The AEPD, indicated that the fine may be reduced to €90000 for voluntary payment and admission of responsibility.

## Comment

\- The duration of the violation, taking into account the scope or purpose of the data processing operation, as well as the damages caused to the interested party and third parties – Article 83(2)(a) GDPR

\- Negligence in the infringement, when verifying the lack of due diligence of the claimed entity in the fulfilment of its obligations with respect to the management of users' personal data - Article 83(2)(b) GDPR

Well, dated 10/01/20, once the reasons given by the
claimed entity, and consider that the person responsible had attended the claim

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/19

submitted, notifying the interested parties.

However, dated 10/16/20, a second entry has been entered into this Agency

complaint filed by the claimant indicating that the operator was still
sending SMS to his telephone line, and attached the screenshots of more than 60 SMS
received until that day, for which he considered that the operator had not attended

satisfactorily the first claim, and that the AEPD had rejected the processing of the

A few days later, on 10/31/20, the claimant resubmits a written statement of
complaint to this Agency, indicating that he had contacted the
claimed entity, on 09/24/20, to inform them that, although he had exercised before them

the right to object continued to receive a huge amount of advertising SMS,
receiving as a response from the entity that had responded to his request for opposition

dated 08/13/20 and that it would not happen again, but the claimant again justifies

of all of them. On 11/10/20, he once again submits a new letter to this

Agency providing advertising SMS of the claimed entity, up to 16 SMS, from the
10/18/20 to 11/09/20.

Apart from all the above, the claimant also reports that he has received an SMS from
the company, to your phone number with a security code to access the
platform, (“Mi Yoigo”), in which, once accessed, you have been able to verify that the

profile belongs to another user, but has access to the personal data of this
person, to their invoices, and even has the possibility and to carry out any procedure

with the data of this person.

     III- On the breach of the right to delete personal data.

This section examines the presumed non-compliance, on the part of the
claimed entity, of the deletion of all personal data from its databases

data, which was requested by the claimant.

Article 17.1.c) of the RGPD, establishes the right to delete data

personal data of the interested party, ("the right to be forgotten"), that:
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/19

"The interested party shall have the right to obtain without undue delay from the person responsible for the

treatment the deletion of personal data that concerns you, which will be
obliged to delete without undue delay the personal data when there is any

of the following circumstances: (…)

c) the interested party opposes the treatment in accordance with article 21, paragraph 1, and does not

other legitimate reasons for the treatment prevail, or the interested party opposes the
treatment in accordance with article 21, paragraph 2; ”.

From the existing documentation in the file followed in this Agency, by the
same facts denounced (E / 06604/2020), of the documentation presented by the
claimant in the present sanctioning procedure (PS / 00448/2020) and of the

Answers made by the claimed entity, to the requirements made
by this Agency, set forth in point II, it is verified that the facts known

could be constitutive of an infringement, attributable to the defendant, for violation of the
Article 17.1.c) of the RGPD, for breach of the right to delete data
personal data of the interested party, when he had exercised the right of opposition before the

entity and he had even confirmed that he had correctly managed said
right.

Article 72.1.k) of the LOPDGDD, considers very serious, for the purposes of prescription,
“The impediment or the obstruction or the repeated lack of attention to the exercise of the
rights established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. ”.

This offense may be punished with a fine of a maximum of € 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the

total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
of a higher amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

In accordance with the indicated precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the sanction to be imposed in

In this case, it is considered that the sanction to be imposed should be adjusted according to
with the following aggravating criteria established in article 83.2 of the RGPD:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/19

    - The duration of the offense, taking into account the scope or purpose of the
        data processing operation, as well as the damages caused to the

        interested party, as the entity stated that it had proceeded to erase the data of the
        complainant from their databases on 08/13/20 and continued to send SMS
        advertising until 11/09/20, (section a).

    - Negligence in the infringement, when verifying the lack of due diligence of the
        claimed entity in the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the
        management of users' personal data, (section b).

    - The way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement,
        since this was produced through several complaints filed by the
        claimant, (section h).

    - The existence of a previous complaint, which was not admitted for processing by this
        Agency, by affirming the claimed entity that it had proceeded
        satisfactorily to address the right to delete personal data

        of the interested party, (section k).

For its part, article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, establishes that, in accordance with the provisions
in article 83.2.k) of the RGPD, it will be taken into account, as aggravating factors of the

sanction, the following:

    - The continuing nature of the infringement, therefore, although the claimed entity

        affirms that it has proceeded to the erasure of the claimant's personal data from
        your databases on 08/13/20, continues to send advertising SMS on your mobile,
        even after 11/08/20, (section a).

    - The linking of the activity of the offender with the performance of treatment of
        personal data, (section b).

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with

Regarding the offense committed by violating the provisions of article 17 of the
RGPD, allows setting an initial penalty of 50,000 euros, (fifty thousand euros).

      IV- On the lack of security measures in the company's systems.

This section examines the presumed non-compliance, on the part of the

claimed entity, of the security in the treatment of the personal data of its
clients, since the claimant reports having received an SMS from the company, with his
telephone number and a security code to access the platform (“My

Yoigo ”), in which, he has been able to verify that the profile belongs to another user, that
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/19

has access to the personal data of this person, to their invoices, and there is even the
possibility of carrying out any procedure with your personal data.

The security of personal data is regulated in article 32 of the RGPD,

where it is stated that:

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the

nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for people's rights and freedoms
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical measures and

appropriate organizational arrangements to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,
(…) "

The GDPR defines personal data security breaches as “all
those security violations that cause destruction, loss or
accidental or illegal alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or processed

otherwise, or unauthorized communication or access to said data ”.

From the documentation in the file there are evident indications that the
claimed has violated article 32 of the RGPD, due to a breach of
security in their systems by sending an SMS to the claimant with the access codes to

the “Mi Yoigo” platform, belonging to another client of the company.

It should be noted that the RGPD in the aforementioned precept does not establish a list of the

security measures that are applicable according to the data that are the object
of treatment, but establishes that the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment
apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk involved

the treatment, taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, the risks of probability

and seriousness for the rights and freedoms of the interested persons.

Article 73.g) of the LOPDGDD, considers serious, for the purposes of prescription, "The

breach, as a consequence of the lack of due diligence, of the
technical and organizational measures that have been implemented as required
by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ”.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/19

This offense can be sanctioned with administrative fines of 10,000,000 EUR

at most or, in the case of a company, of an amount equivalent to 2% as
maximum total annual global business volume of the previous financial year,

opting for the highest amount in accordance with article 83.4.a) of the RGPD.

In accordance with the indicated precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the

instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the sanction to be imposed in

        treatment operation in question, (section a).

    - Negligence in the infringement, when verifying the lack of due diligence of the
        claimed entity in the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the
        management of the security of the personal data of its clients, (section b).

    - The way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement,
        as it has been through the complaint filed by the claimant, (section

        h).

For its part, article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, establishes that, in accordance with the provisions
in article 83.2.k) of the RGPD, it will be taken into account, as aggravating factors of the

sanction, the following:

    - The linking of the activity of the offender with the performance of treatment of

        personal data, (section b).

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with
Regarding the offense committed by violating the provisions of Article 32 of the

RGPD, allows setting an initial penalty of 30,000 euros, (thirty thousand euros).

      V- On the consequences of the lack of adequate security measures.

This section examines the presumed non-compliance, on the part of the
claimed entity, of the security in the treatment of the personal data of its

clients, since the claimant reports that he has received an SMS from the company, with
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/19

your phone number and a security code to access the platform (“My
Yoigo ”), in which, he has been able to verify that the profile belongs to another user, that

has access to the personal data of this person, to their invoices, and there is even the
possibility and to carry out any procedure with your these personnel who are not the

his.

The RGPD establishes, in article 5, the principles that must govern the treatment of

the

personal data and mentions among them that of "integrity and confidentiality".

The article states, in point 1.f) that: "Personal data will be treated in such a way
in a way that ensures adequate security of personal data, including the
protection against unauthorized or illegal processing and against its loss, destruction

or accidental damage, through the application of technical or organizational measures
appropriate ('integrity and confidentiality') ”.

Well, in accordance with the evidence available at present
moment, the fact that the claimed entity made it possible to view data

personal data of a third person outside the claimant, allow verifying that the
complained has not been able to guarantee the security in the processing of the data
personal data of its clients, thereby showing a serious lack of due diligence and

incurring, therefore, in the violation of article 5.1 f) of the RGPD, which establishes the
principles of integrity and confidentiality of personal data, as well as the
proactive responsibility of the controller to demonstrate its

compliance.

Article 72.1.a) of the LOPDGDD considers very serious, for the purposes of prescription: "The
processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees established in
Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 "

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the

total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
of a higher amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.
