## English Summary

### Facts

The controller was a security guard hired by a private company providing video surveillance services to a prison in Madrid. The guard used his mobile phone to capture images of a visitor from the video surveillance system and sent these images via WhatsApp to other colleagues. In September 2022, the prison's security department filed a complaint against the controller for possible GDPR violations.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA highlighted that the physical image of a person is personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) GDPR. Therefore, their processing is subject to data protection regulations. The DPA concluded that capturing the images of a person from the prison's video surveillance system and disseminating them via WhatsApp violates the provisions of [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). For this reason, the DPA fined the controller €10,000.
