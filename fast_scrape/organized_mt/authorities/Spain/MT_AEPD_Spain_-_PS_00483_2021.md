## English Summary

### Facts

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) initiated proceedings exercising its investigation powers under [Article 58 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR") against Ramona Films S.L. (previously Kalandrakas Films S.L.), owner of [https://www.putalocura.com](https://www.putalocura.com), a website containing adult and pornographic material. The investigation was related to the possible processing of personal data and profiling of data subjects below the age of 14. In particular, the AEPD inquired the controller regarding the risk of processing activities that could take place if a minor gained unauthorised access to the website’s contents, a data protection impact assessment related to these risks, the technical and organisational measures implemented to ensure data protection, as well as its privacy policy.

### Holding

In its investigation, the AEPD determined that the page contained a warning that the website contained adult material, and to abandon the website in case of being a minor.

However, the AEPD found that the website did not have a mechanism that permitted the rejection of non-essential cookies, or a second layer to allow the granular acceptance of specific cookies. Additionally, the AEPD also found that when accessing the website, the use of non-essential cookies took place without prior consent, and that there was insufficient information related to the nature of the cookies, and if any of them were third party cookies. The AEPD held that the website’s cookie policy violated Article 22.2 of the [Spanish Law of Information Society Services (LSSI)](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2002-13758), which establishes that clear and complete information on the use of cookies and the purposes of the data processing must be provided to data subjects, and that where the use of a cookie entails processing that makes it possible to identify the user, data controllers must provide users with information in compliance with the provisions of the GDPR.

Furthermore, the AEPD found that the website’s privacy policy referred to the previous data protection laws in Spain, which were derogated when the GDPR entered into force. Therefore, the AEPD held that the website did not provide users with adequate data protection information, in violation of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

Based on these considerations, the AEPD issued a total fine of €10,000 on the controller, €5000 for the violation of Article 22.2 LSSI and €5000 for the violation of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). However, this fine was reduced to €8000 because the controller did not object to the fine and paid it voluntarily within the period established by the AEPD to do so, although the reduction of the fee paid for by the controller did not include an express acceptance of culpability regarding the violations held by the AEPD. The AEPD also ordered the controller to modify its privacy and cookie policy in order to comply with GDPR.

However, it has been found that the "Privacy Policy" of the website,

Personal data.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 6/18

Well, in accordance with the provisions of article 99 of the RGPD, the entry into

force and application of the new RGPD was: "twenty days after its publication in the
Official Journal of the European Union (05/25/16)” and would be applicable from May 25
of 2018”. Therefore, as of 05/25/18, the LO was repealed. 15/1999, (LOPD),

07/12/18 the new LOPDGDD.

In application of the RGPD, its article 13, establishes the information that must be

when this is not possible, the criteria used to determine this period; b) the

existence of the right to request access to data from the data controller

treatment, or to oppose the treatment, as well as the right to the portability of the

data; c) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter a), or the
Article 9, paragraph 2, letter a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent in
any time, without affecting the legality of the treatment based on the

consent prior to its withdrawal; d) the right to file a claim with

possible consequences of not providing such data; f) the existence of decisions
you automate, including profiling, referred to in article 22,

paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, significant information about the logic
applied, as well as the importance and expected consequences of said treatment
for the interested party”.

Therefore, in accordance with the evidence obtained and without prejudice to what
result of the investigation, the exposed facts could suppose the violation, for

part of the entity that owns the web page in question, of article 13 of the RGPD.

Regarding this, article 72.1.h) of the LOPDGDD, considers it very serious, for

of prescription, “the omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the treatment
of your personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the RGPD”

This infraction can be sanctioned with a maximum fine of €20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the

global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for the
of greater amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

In accordance with the precepts indicated, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the sanction to be imposed in
the present case, it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction in accordance with the

following aggravating criteria established in article 83.2 of the RGPD:

    - The duration of the infringement, taking into account that current regulations, this

       is, the RGPD, is mandatory since 05/25/18, and that from that
       Date the LOPD was repealed, by which the website is still governed

       in question, (section a).

regarding the infraction committed, by violating the provisions of article 13 of the
RGPD, makes it possible to set an initial penalty of 5,000 euros (five thousand euros).

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 8/18

On the other hand, and in accordance with article 58.2 of the RGPD, the corrective measure
that could be imposed on the person responsible for the website in question would consist of

order you to take the necessary measures to adapt the privacy policy to
what is stipulated in the current regulations, that is, the RGPD and the LOPDGDD.

IV- Violation of the Cookies Policy

The deficiencies detected in the "Cookies Policy" of the website in question,
could suppose on the part of the claimed entity, the commission of the infraction of the

Article 22.2 of the LSSI, since it establishes that:

“Service providers may use storage devices and

recovery of data in terminal equipment of the recipients, provided that
they have given their consent after they have been provided
clear and complete information on its use, in particular, on the purposes of the

data processing, in accordance with the provisions of Organic Law 15/1999, of 13
December, on the protection of personal data.

Where technically possible and effective, the recipient's consent to
Accepting the processing of the data may be facilitated through the use of the parameters

from the browser or other applications.

The foregoing will not prevent the possible storage or access of a technical nature to the sole

purpose of effecting the transmission of a communication over a communications network
electronic or, to the extent that is strictly necessary, for the provision of
a service of the information society expressly requested by the

addressee".

This Infraction is typified as "minor" in article 38.4 g), of the aforementioned Law, which

considers as such: “Use data storage and retrieval devices
when the information has not been provided or the consent of the
recipient of the service in the terms required by article 22.2.”, and may be

sanctioned with a fine of up to €30,000, in accordance with article 39 of the aforementioned
LSSI.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 13/18

After the evidence obtained in the preliminary investigation phase, and without prejudice to
whatever results from the investigation, it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction to

impose in accordance with the following aggravating criteria, established by art. 40 of
the LSSI:

    - The existence of intentionality, an expression that must be interpreted as
        equivalent to a degree of guilt according to the Judgment of the

        National High Court of 11/12/07 relapse in Appeal no. 351/2006,
        corresponding to the denounced entity the determination of a system of
        Obtaining informed consent that is in accordance with the mandate of the LSSI.

In accordance with these criteria, it is considered appropriate to impose an initial sanction of
5,000 euros, (two thousand euros), for the infringement of article 22.2 of the LSSI, regarding

the cookie policy made on the website in question.

On the other hand, and in accordance with article 58.2 of the RGPD, the corrective measure

that could be imposed on the entity responsible for the website would consist of order-
order him to take the necessary measures on the web page of his ownership to

adapt it to current regulations, including a mechanism that makes it impossible to use
tion of non-necessary cookies before the user gives his consent for it;
including a mechanism that makes it possible to reject all cookies or to do so

ma granular through a control panel and extend the information provided in the
banner of the main page and in the "Cookies Policy" adapting it to the regulations
in force, indicated in section III of the Legal Basis.

V-Initial total sanction:
