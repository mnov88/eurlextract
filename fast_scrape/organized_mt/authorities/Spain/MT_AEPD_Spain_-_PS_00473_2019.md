## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant highlights general non-compliance regarding processing. Just to take a couple of examples, in order to access the workstation, employees are not requested to use login credentials nor password are needed to unlock the screen. Employee can access all type of personal data regardless of their concrete tasks.

Moreover, the company's website does not provide an appropriate information regarding the use of cookies. The first pop-up banner does not inform about the existence of tracking cookies. The full cookie policy is also vague and does not provide a tool to uninstall cookies easily.

### Dispute

The AEPD must assess whether or not the statements from the complainant are true. In particular if the processing is safeguarded with appropriate technical and organisational measures.

The Authority must also verify if the controller has respected the Spanish implementation of ePrivacy Directive (Ley 34/2002, Servicios de la Sociedad de la Información y ComercioElectrónico - LSSI). In particular if, under Article 22 LSSI, the controller has provided a clear and complete information on the use of cookies.

### Holding

After thorough investigation, the AEPD considers that some statements in the complaint are not - or no longer - accurate.

For example, the controller has convincingly demonstrated that its personnel can now only access those data and resources required to carry out their tasks. Printed manuals and personal data are stored into locked filing cabinets and access to the office is only allowed to authorized personnel. Because of that, the AEPD decided to dismiss this part of the complaint.

The Authority then addresses the second point of the complaint.

According to the analysis, the pop-up notification (first layer) does not allow users to understand the use of cookies, as it happens, for instance, for phrases like “improve our services”. The Cookie Policy (second layer) does not describe which type of cookies is used or provide information regarding their sources (first or third-party). Also, it does not include any tool to manage cookies in a granular way. For these reasons, the Authority found a violation of Article 22(2) LSSI.
