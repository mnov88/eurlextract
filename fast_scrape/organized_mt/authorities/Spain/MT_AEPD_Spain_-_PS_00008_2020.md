## English Summary

### Facts

The AEPD found different data processing activities related to the claimant. The claimant argued that he had received a message from Vodafone about a purchase made in a physical shop. The complainant denies that this purchase actually happened.

Further, a seller from Oliveros Ustrell forwarded an unsigned number portability contract to Vodafone concerning the claimant. Oliveros Ustrell was unable to provide proof of the order.

In addition, the AEPD could not find a legal basis for the collection and processing of personal data on the information systems of the Oliveros Ustrell.

### Dispute

Whether the collection and process of personal data from Oliveros Ustrell was based on consent.

### Holding

Since the AEPD did not receive evidence of the existence of consents for the different data processing activities and no other justifications apply, the AEPD considered these activities as unlawful.

The original amount of the fine was set up to EUR 10,000. The AEPD considered the voluntarily payment from Oliveros Ustrell of the fine and therefore deducted the amount to EUR 6,000.

FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW
I
By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.
II
Article 58 of the RGPD, " Powers ", says:
"2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers
corrective indicated below:
(…)
b) sanction any person responsible or responsible for the treatment with warning
when the processing operations have violated the provisions of this
Regulation;
(...)
d) order the data controller or processor that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period.
(…)
i) impose an administrative fine pursuant to article 83, in addition to or instead of
measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances of the case

www.aepd.es

sedeagpd.gob.es

particular
(…) ”
III
The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them that of " legality, loyalty and
transparency". The precept provides:
"1 . The personal data will be:
a) Treaties in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the
interested (<< legality, loyalty and transparency >>); ”
Article 6 of the RGPD, “ Lawfulness of treatment ”, details in its section 1 the
Assumptions in which the processing of third-party data is considered lawful:
"one. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:
a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the
interested party or for the application at the request of this measures
pre-contractual;
(…) ”
The infraction for which the claimed entity is responsible is found
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading " General conditions for
the imposition of administrative fines ”, states:
"5 . Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, according
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
In the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total global annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

6/14
a) The basic principles for treatment, including conditions for
consent pursuant to articles 5,6,7 and 9. "
Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading “ Infractions
considered very serious ” states:
"one. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in
In particular, the following:
(…)
b) The processing of personal data without any of the
conditions of lawfulness of the treatment established in article 6 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679. ”
IV
The documentation in the file offers evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD , since it carried out the treatment of the
Claimant's personal data without her consent. The personal data of the
claimant were incorporated into the company's information systems, without
has proven that it had its consent for the collection and treatment
later of your personal data.
Based on the above, in the case analyzed, it remains
questioned the diligence used by the defendant to identify the
person who contracted on behalf of the claimant.
The Administrative Litigation Chamber of the National Court, in
assumptions such as the one presented here, has considered that when the owner of the
data denies the hiring the burden of proof corresponds to those who affirm their
existence, and the person responsible for the data processing of third parties must collect and
C / Jorge Juan, 6
www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid
sedeagpd.gob.es
Page 7
7/14
keep the necessary documentation to prove the owner's consent.
We cite, for all, the SAN of 05/31/2006 (Rec. 539/2004), Law Foundation
Room.
Well, it follows that the claimant received a message about portability and,
in the contract obtained through the Vodafone client mobile application
contributed by the claimant, all the spaces for the signatures of the
blank customers.
On the other hand, according to Vodafone, it is mandatory that the store
keep these contracts, but the claimed party states that for other reasons,
it has documentation on the portability indicated in the claim. Exists
evidence, in the contract provided by the claimant, that the contract for
portability in the physical store of the claimed and that the contract is unsigned.
Although the company states that portability does not occur if it is missing
any of the signatures, the contract obtained by the claimant through the application
for Vodafone mobile contains all the spaces for the signatures of the
blank headlines.
However, and this is the essential, the defendant does not prove the legitimacy for
the treatment of the claimant's data.
Ultimately, the defendant has not provided a document or evidence
some that shows that the entity, in such a situation, had deployed the
minimum due diligence to verify that indeed your interlocutor was the one
claimed to flaunt.
Respect for the principle of legality that is at the core of the fundamental right
of personal data protection requires that it be proven that the
responsible for the treatment deployed the essential diligence to prove that
extreme. If this Agency does not act in this way - and this Agency does not demand it, it is incumbent on it
for compliance with regulatory regulations of the data protection right of
personal character - the result would be to empty of content the principle of legality.
