## English Summary

### Facts

In June 2022, the data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA, claiming that GRUPO TRANSAHER, the controller, had installed surveillance cameras in workers' rest areas such as the canteen. The data subject also claimed that the informative notice regarding the cameras was not visible or did not exist.

In July 2022, the controller replied to the complaint, admitting the installation of the cameras and providing more detailed information about them.

First, the controller argued that it has a logistics park where a large number of people circulate and therefore it is necessary to ensure a high level of security, monitoring and protecting property and people in the building. For this reason, the controller considered that it was legitimate to video-surveil the entire work center, including the industrial building and the offices.

Second, with regard to the workers' rest area, it argued that it is actually a common area open 24 hours and is not intended for the exclusive rest of the workers. According to the controller, the room does not have restricted access for the exclusive use of employees, also being used by clients, customers, suppliers and freelancers.

Third, the controller pointed out that it performed a proportionality test and implemented mitigating measures such as providing informative notices, deleting the recordings after 30 days and limiting the access to the images to only 5 persons. Finally, the controller stated that in the employment contract there is a clause informing employees about the use of video surveillance systems for security purposes.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA found that the use of surveillance cameras in an enclosed room, used as a canteen, was disproportionately invading the employee's privacy. The DPA highlighted that while [Article 20.3 Workers' Statute Law](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-11430) allows the use of videocameras for labor control, this control must respect some limitations, such as the worker's dignity. Similarly, [Article 89.2 LOPDGDD](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673) prohibits, in any case, the installation of image recording systems "in places intended for the rest or recreation of the workers, such as changing rooms, toilets, canteens and the like."

For these reasons, the DPA found a violation of [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") and fined the controller €50,000.

The controller appealed the decision, but the appeal was dismissed as it did not provide new facts or legal arguments that allow the decision to be reconsidered.

RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE
Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on
to the following
BACKGROUND
FIRST: A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claimant), on 06/10/2022, filed
claim before the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The claim is
directed against GRUPO TRANSAHER, S.L., with NIF B78147758 (hereinafter, the party
claimed or TRANSAHER), for the installation of a video surveillance system,
located at \*\*\*ADDRESS.1, there being indications of a possible breach of the
provided in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Regulation of
Data Protection, hereinafter GDPR).
The reasons for the claim are the following:
The claiming party states that the claimed party has installed security cameras

workers. The claimant understands that it is a "camera installed
illegally that controls the workers.”
Likewise, it states that the informative posters related to security cameras

dining room interior.
SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
forward LOPDGDD), said claim was transferred to the claimed party, for
to proceed with its analysis and inform this Agency within a month of the
actions carried out to adapt to the requirements established in the regulations of

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of
October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Administrations
Public (hereinafter, LPACAP), was collected on 06/14/2022 as stated in the
acknowledgment of receipt in the file.
On 07/13/2022, this Agency received a written response from the party
claimed, in which it provides complete information on its video surveillance system and
acknowledges having cameras installed in the dining room, stating in his response the
reasons that have led to its installation:
. It is a company that, due to the purpose of its business (transport and logistics), (...)
You need to have high security. It shares a logistics park (...), with
large influx of people, both workers and freelancers who provide their jobs there
services (...), ETT staff, customers and suppliers.
. Given the circumstances expressed above, and by virtue of article 20.3 of the
Workers' Statute, the entire workplace, including the industrial warehouse and
offices are video-surveilled by cameras, which only record
images, in no case audio. Its installation is proportional in terms of the
weighting of the power of direction and control of business activity and the right to
the privacy of the interested parties, who are aware of the use of their data that entails the
employment relationship, purpose and mechanisms to exercise recognized rights.
. There are signs that announce the installation of these cameras (provide photographs
about its content and location, including the badge installed in the dining room to which
refers to the claim).
. Only five people are authorized to view the images; (…).
. Images are stored for 30 days.
. The system is certified by a security company, which is also responsible for
of their review (they provide the latest technical report from February).
. It has informed the existence of the video surveillance system both to the Committee of
The company and the workers, who sign an informative clause in their contract
(model taken from SEPE), receive a welcome manual with information
relevant, which is completed in the employee portal. In this regard, provide a copy
of the document signed by the workers in which it is indicated that they remain
unequivocally informed of the "use of video surveillance systems to
business control”. This document includes a space for the worker's signature,
preceded by the following text:
"By signing this document, the worker declares that he has read and understood in all its
extension the aforementioned information that will be available at all times for consultation in the
employee portal and a copy is delivered to the interested party”.
. (…).
The defendant refers to "the camera located in the dining room", noting that

providers, freelancers, service companies and ETT workers; and in it
They find 4 vending machines, 2 refrigerators, several microwaves and an oven.
It adds that they have suffered theft of products from the refrigerators, acts of vandalism in front of
to the vending machines to obtain the products without paying and in 2013 a
worker put a soft drink in the microwave causing the appliance to
set fire According to the entity, all of this entails a risk for tangible assets,
own or third parties (vending machines) and for people that the employer
has the duty to prevent and avoid, in accordance with the regulations for the prevention of
labor risks, and that can lead to civil liability of the company.
In addition, it indicates that the video surveillance area's label informs that its purposes are "to
monitor and protect the goods and people of the plant”.
The installed system complies with the proportionality judgment set by the Court
Constitutional:
. Legitimacy, as long as it is not mere suspicions about the existence of
illegal actions repeated over time, including robberies produced through
the Windows.
. Suitable for the purpose intended by the company, to determine who or
who are the authors of said damages, as well as the protection of the goods
your own as well as those you have on deposit.
. Necessary, since the recording would serve as proof of such irregularities and not
there is another type of less intrusive means to achieve the aforementioned purpose
. Proportionality, since the recording of images was limited to the area
previously informed and visualizes the company utilities, vending machines and
windows, as it is a transit area with a large number of
people.
According to the defendant, the latest jurisprudential doctrine states that the
installation of cameras is lawful and does not violate any fundamental right when the
workers have been expressly informed of the installation of the system
surveillance and their location for security reasons, an expression that
includes surveillance of illegal acts by workers and third parties and, in
Ultimately, the safety of the workplace.
But, in addition, it also considers it lawful, even if it is not previously reported to the
worker, if the installation of the camera is carried out due to suspicion of
irregular behavior and is placed in full view of the workers, although
they are not warned of their possible use for disciplinary purposes, since they understand that

He provided a photograph of the camera located in the passageway that adjoins the dining room.
Provide again this photograph corresponding to the image captured by the camera
in question. In this image it can be seen that the camera captures the entire room,
including the tables arranged in the dining room, which appear in the image
shaded with a mask. The image shows the vending machines and all the
space that separates them from the tables (the detail about the space captured consists of
outlined in the Third Proven Fact).
On this last question, he cites two precedents, marked with the numbers
E/09297/2018 and E/01760/2017, referring to the installation of cameras in areas of
rest oriented to the goods that are intended to be protected, in which the Agency
resolved the file of proceedings.
Also in relation to the possibility of installing cameras to protect heritage
business when irregularities have been committed or there are suspicions of it, cites
the party claimed the Judgment no. 630/2016 of the Supreme Court and Judgment of
10/17/2019 of the European Court of Human Rights.
. Finally, the TRANSAHER entity reiterates that it has complied with the judgment of
proportionality set by the Constitutional Court and ends by invoking the Judgment

Canary Islands in which it is expressed:
“It is recognized, however, that a minor portion of the camera's field of view
corresponded to a place of recreation for working people, but obviously not
All places of recreation can have the same consideration (waiting rooms,
parking, dining rooms in relation to others such as showers, changing rooms, etc.). So there could be
a need to monitor those places and even people's belongings
workers. This should lead us, in the appellant's opinion, to apply in this case the principle
of proportionality in relation to the principle of minimization of the data referred to”.
SEVENTH: On 03/06/2023, a resolution proposal was formulated in the sense of
that the claimed party be penalized for a violation of article 6 of the GDPR,
typified in article 83.5.a) of the same Regulation, and qualified for the purposes of
prescription as very serious in article 72.1.b) of the LOPDGDD, with a fine of
50,000 euros (fifty thousand euros).
Likewise, it was proposed that the claimed party be required so that, within the term
determined, adopt the necessary measures to adapt its performance to the
personal data protection regulations, with the scope expressed in the
Legal basis VII of the proposed resolution.
Notification of this resolution proposal was delivered to the claimed party in
the same date of 03/06/2023 through the Enabled Electronic Address service
Sole (DEHÚ), being granted a term to formulate allegations.
EIGHTH: On 03/10/2023, a letter from the party
claimant in which he states "that, having made the company available to the
claimant as well as the lawyers all the documentation that accredits the exposed
in the allegations made by the company, by means of the present proceed to

file..., as well as to request the filing of the file".
NINTH: On 03/17/2023, a written statement of allegations to the proposal for
resolution in which the claimed party reiterates and ratifies its previous allegations and
request the procedure file again. In this writing, the defendant
reveals the following:

And he adds that, "despite being an area that must inevitably cross all the

On the other hand, it indicates that the AEPD has not taken into account that the machines of
vending suffer constant acts of vandalism, as evidenced in the
actions, and that it is essential to protect tangible and business assets, as well as
such as the health and safety of workers, in an area with a high influx of
people who access the different rooms from outside through the area
in question 24 hours a day.

He wonders what less intrusive means he could have used to prove the damage
caused to the vending machines or the theft of products without payment from the

Likewise, it states that the complaining party has informed the
company that has requested the AEPD to file the proceedings, after examining the
documentation that proves the allegations of the claimed party.
The defendant concludes that the video surveillance of the area is not capricious, but
that it is a justified installation whose image capture field

FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW
Yo
Competence
In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of the GDPR grants to each authority of
control and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the LOPDGDD,
The Director of the Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure
Spanish Data Protection.
Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "Procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures”.
II
Withdrawal of the complaining party
The claiming party has stated that the claimed party has made available
the documentation that proves their allegations and that, based on this, requests the
file the procedure, waiving any compensation that may
correspond.
This claim must be rejected, considering that the complaining party is not
interested party in the procedure, which prevents him from intervening in it. Besides,
The purpose of these proceedings is not aimed at recognizing a right of the
claiming party to be indemnified, but to determine the possible existence of a
infringing conduct by the claimed party and the consequences that derive from it.
Said request must also be rejected, even if the writing was taken
presented by the complaining party as a withdrawal of their claim. Proceeds
point out in this regard what is established in article 63.1 of the LPACAP, according to which “the
procedures of a sanctioning nature will always be initiated ex officio by agreement
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es
9/25
of the competent body", establishing in article 68 of the LOPDGDD that
corresponds to the "Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
when appropriate, issue an agreement to start the procedure for the exercise of the
sanctioning power”. Thus, for the claiming party to withdraw their claim is
irrelevant and does not imply the filing or completion of the disciplinary procedure
initiated, since it begins and is processed in all its phases ex officio.
II
The image is a personal data
The physical image of a person, according to article 4.1 of the GDPR, is data
personnel and their protection, therefore, is the subject of said Regulation. In article 4.2
of the GDPR defines the concept of "processing" of personal data.
The images generated by a system of cameras or camcorders are data of
personal nature, so its treatment is subject to the protection regulations
of data.
It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image of the
natural persons) carried out through the denounced video surveillance system is
in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.
IV.
Infringement. Regulatory framework
Article 6.1 of the GDPR establishes the assumptions that allow the use of
processing of personal data.
"1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:
a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data for one or
various specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party is a party
or for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures;
c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;
d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another person

e) the processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a task carried out in the public interest
or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller;
f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued by the user.
responsible for the treatment or by a third party, provided that such interests are not
the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject prevail
require the protection of personal data, in particular when the data subject is a child.
The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the treatment carried out by
public authorities in the exercise of their functions.
The permanent implantation of a system of video cameras for reasons of
security has a legitimate basis in the LOPDGDD, the explanatory statement of which indicates:
“Together with these assumptions, others are included, such as video surveillance… in which the legality of the
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

10/25
treatment comes from the existence of a public interest, in the terms established in the
Article 6.1.e) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.
Regarding treatment for video surveillance purposes, article 22 of the LOPDGDD
establishes that natural or legal persons, public or private, may carry out
carry out the treatment of images through systems of cameras or video cameras
in order to preserve the safety of people and property, as well as their
facilities.
This same article 22, in its section 8, provides that "The treatment by the
Employer data obtained through camera or video camera systems will be

This article 89 of the LOPDGDD, referring to the "Right to privacy against the use of
video surveillance and sound recording devices in the workplace”.
sets the following:
"1. Employers may process the images obtained through camera systems or
video cameras for the exercise of control functions by workers or employees
provided for, respectively, in article 20.3 of the Workers' Statute and in the
public function legislation, provided that these functions are exercised within its framework
law and with the limits inherent to it. Employers must inform
previously, and expressly, clearly and concisely, to the workers or public employees and, in
your case, your representatives, about this measure.
In the event that the flagrant commission of an illegal act has been captured by the
workers or public employees, the duty to inform will be understood fulfilled when
at least the device referred to in article 22.4 of this organic law exists.
2. In no case will the installation of sound recording systems or
video surveillance in places intended for the rest or recreation of workers or
public employees, such as locker rooms, toilets, dining rooms and the like.
3. The use of systems similar to those referred to in the previous sections for the
sound recording in the workplace will be allowed only when relevant
risks to the safety of facilities, goods and people derived from the activity
that it takes place in the workplace and always respecting the principle of proportionality,
the minimum intervention and the guarantees provided for in the previous sections. the deletion
of the sounds preserved by these recording systems will be made according to the
provided in section 3 of article 22 of this law”.
On the legitimacy for the implementation of video surveillance systems in the field
labor, Royal Legislative Decree 1/1995, of 03/24, is taken into account, which approves
the revised text of the Workers' Statute Law (LET), whose article 20.3
notes:
"3. The employer may adopt the measures he deems most appropriate for surveillance and control
to verify compliance by the worker with his labor obligations and duties,
keeping in their adoption and application due consideration to their dignity and taking into account
account, where appropriate, the real capacity of workers with disabilities.
The Constitutional Court, in Judgment 98/2000, of 04/10/2000, highlights in its
legal basis 6 that “The jurisprudence of this Court has insisted
repeatedly in the full effectiveness of the fundamental rights of the worker
within the framework of the employment relationship, since this cannot imply in any way the
deprivation of such rights for those who serve in organizations

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es
11/25
productive, which are not alien to constitutional principles and rights. Without
However, the mere manifestation of the exercise of the power of control by the
employer so that the right of the worker is sacrificed. These limitations
business must be those indispensable and strictly necessary to
satisfy a business interest deserving of guardianship and protection, so that if
there are other less aggressive and affective possibilities of satisfying said interest
of the law in question, it will be necessary to use the latter and not those more
aggressive and affective. It is, ultimately, the application of the principle of
proportionality”.
To check whether a restrictive measure of a fundamental right passes the trial
of proportionality it is necessary to verify if it meets the three requirements or conditions
following:
. If such a measure is likely to achieve the proposed objective (judgment of suitability);
. If necessary, in the sense that there is no other more moderate measure for the
achievement of such purpose with equal effectiveness (judgment of necessity);
. If it is weighted or balanced, because it derives more benefits or

Administrative offense. Classification and qualification of the infraction.
The claim is based on the alleged illegality of the video surveillance camera
installed in the area set up as a workers' canteen, in the
Dependencies of the requested entity located at \*\*\*ADDRESS.1.
It is not disputed in this case the fact that the claimed party is the owner and
responsible for the reported video surveillance system and, therefore, the person responsible for
the data processing involved in the use of said system. And neither does he
fact that among the data processing carried out is the collection and
storage of personal data relating to the image of employees and others
affected within the area indicated above. The capture of these
images has been recognized by the claimed party.
It is proven in the proceedings, likewise, that said installation is carried out with
security and business control purposes.
When carrying out the collection and use of the images obtained in the dining room enabled
for personnel, the claimed part does not take into account the limits set forth in the
Article 20.3 of the Workers' Statute Law (LET), which admits the recording
of images for the exercise of labor control functions when those functions
respect the legal framework and the limits inherent to it, such as respect for the
worker's dignity; nor the provisions of article 89.2 of the LOPDGDD,
which prohibits, in any case, the installation of image recording systems or
video surveillance "in places intended for the rest or recreation of
workers..., such as locker rooms, toilets, dining rooms and the like”.
Consequently, in this case, the general prohibition that establishes
article 89.2 of the LOPDGDD, on the capture of images in an area of
staff dining room.
The claimed party does not dispute that the area captured by the camera that motivates the
performances is intended for dining room and that it is used for this purpose by
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es
15/25
your employees. But he has indicated that the dining room in question is not a zone of
exclusive access for employees, but rather an area with a large influx of people, of
common use by workers, freelancers who provide their services there (...),
ETT staff, customers and providers; that does not have, ultimately, the end of
exclusive rest of workers
In this regard, it should be noted, on the one hand, that it is the aforementioned standard that
assigns to dining rooms the classification of "places for rest or
recreation of the workers" and, on the other hand, that the fact that the dining room
is used by people other than the company's own workers
excludes or diminishes the aforementioned legal coverage, to the extent that such circumstances
do not exclude the classification of this room as a rest area for workers.
In addition, for the purposes at hand, this Agency understands that some of the
affected groups or categories indicated by the claimed party may be included in
the concept of workers, there being no reason to exclude from the protection
established in article 89.2 of the LOPDGDD to self-employed workers and
ETT personnel who provide services in the dependencies of the claimed party.
And not only that. It is also understood that the capture of images that
made by the camera installed in the aforementioned dining room and that the intended purpose could
be obtained in a less intrusive way, without implying an intrusion into privacy
of the people affected.
As stated in the Third Proven Fact, the dining room in which the
video surveillance camera is a large room, which has
numerous tables for four people, a kitchen furniture area that
It has eight microwaves and another area with several vending machines (drinks
cold drinks, hot drinks and snacks).
Likewise, according to the image provided to the proceedings by the claimed party itself,
It is clear that the field of vision of said camera captures the entire room, although the area
location of the tables is protected by a mask that covers the limit
exactly how much space they occupy.
However, between the tables, which occupy the right side of the dining room on the
image taken by the camera, and the vending machines, located at one end of
In the room, on the left side of the image, there is a wide space, about two
meters wide and from end to end of the room, which is fully captured
by the camera in question without restriction of any kind. This space that separates the
area with vending machines and tables belongs entirely to the interior of the
dining room, which is inevitably crossed by all the people who
They access the dining room to make use of the room.
Capturing this space between the tables and the vending machines does not meet the
trial of proportionality, considering the purpose pursued by the claimed party
with the installation of the camera in the dining room, so that this measure must
qualify as restrictive of the rights of those affected.
The claimed party, in its response to the claim transfer process and in the
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es
16/25
brief of allegations at the opening of the procedure, states that, by virtue of the
Article 20.3 of the Workers' Statute, the installation of a system of
video surveillance throughout the workplace is proportional, in terms of the
weighting of the power of direction and control of business activity and the right to
the privacy of the interested parties.
The defendant also considers that the use made of the
video surveillance pursues a legitimate objective, such as the protection of your assets, in
specifically the vending machines, which have suffered various acts of vandalism and theft; and
that said use is considered lawful by our jurisprudential doctrine for
situations as indicated; and that it complies with the judgment of proportionality established by the
Constitutional Court, understanding that the thefts and damages that have been occurring
in vending machines legitimize the installation of the camera, that this installation
is suitable to determine the authors of the damages, necessary to provide the
relevant and proportional evidence, given that the images are limited to the area
previously informed and only visualizes the company's tools, the aforementioned machines
of vending and the windows, in an area of passage with great concurrence of people.
However, as indicated above, this Agency does not share the
conclusion of the claimed party and understands that the data processing carried out is
beyond what is strictly necessary, judging by the detail displayed by the camera.
This capture is not limited to exclusively controlling the people who make use of
vending machines, but it reaches all the people who access the
dining room, whether or not they use said machines. The judgment of necessity implies that
there is another more moderate measure for the achievement of purpose with equal effectiveness.
If the purpose of installing the camera was the protection of property
assets of the company and vending machines, the field of vision captured by
said chamber should have been limited to the minimum necessary to guarantee this protection
or to obtain the intended results regarding the removal of items
property of the claimed party or the commission of unlawful acts against the property.
The Constitutional Court Judgment 119/2022, of September 29, admits these
recordings when there are indications of the commission of illegal acts, but always
that there is no other less invasive way to confirm the illegality of the conduct of the
worker and resting places are respected. In this Judgment it is declared:
"Consequently, in the general framework of monitoring compliance with an employment contract,
and for these purposes alone, the employer may install a video surveillance system. Installation
and use of the system will not require the consent of the workers, but it does require a duty of
inform them in advance and expressly about its existence and purpose. The
location of the cameras must respect the privacy of the places intended for
rest or recreation, or that have a reserved character. However, the use of
the images captured to verify or prove the flagrant commission of an illegal act
will require the prior duty of information, which may be understood to have been fulfilled when the
placed in a visible place an informative sign of the existence of the system, of its
responsible and its purpose.
(…)
In the specific circumstances of the case, it can be stated that the installation of the
video surveillance and the consequent use of the captured images was a measure
justified, suitable, necessary and proportionate.
(i) The measure was justified, because there were sufficient indicative suspicions of a
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es
17/25
irregular behavior of the worker —already described— that had to be verified.
(ii) The measure can be considered suitable for the intended purpose, which was none other
that the verification of the eventual illegality of the conduct, which was confirmed precisely
by viewing the images.
(iii) The measure was necessary, since it does not seem that any other less
invasive and equally effective to prove the labor infringement. Any other measure would
warned the worker, thus making the company's actions useless.
(iv) Finally, the measure can be considered proportionate. At this point you have to
weigh various elements of judgement. So, first of all, the cameras were not installed
in places of rest, leisure or of a reserved nature, where there is an expectation
reasonable privacy, but were installed in work areas open to the attention
to the public. Second, the cameras were not installed surreptitiously, but rather
They were located in visible places, both for the workers of the establishment and

generalized or indefinite, or to carry out a prospective investigation, but to
verify the possible existence of irregular conduct detected the day before. Therefore, the
degree of interference in the sphere of privacy of the worker (art. 18.1 CE), in terms of
space and time, cannot be considered unbalanced in relation to the rights and
interests of the company in the detection and punishment of conduct that violates the
contractual good faith, within the framework of the exercise of the rights to private property and
freedom of enterprise, recognized in arts. 33 and 38 CE, respectively”.
The defendant also alleges that the area between the vending machines and the
dining room is a "passage area", communicated with other spaces of the industrial warehouse
through two doors (one next to the vending machines and the other at the back of the room,
according to the field of vision of the video surveillance camera object of the actions).
(…). According to the plan provided to the actions, it is verified that the two doors
communicate with other closed spaces that can be accessed, in both cases,
to the stairs of the building.
For this reason, and considering the many people who pass through this area that crosses the
space in which the dining tables are located, understands that it cannot
be considered a space intended for rest or that the field of vision of the
camera belongs to the dining room. And add that the orientation of the camera
requires ensuring access from the street to the interior of the enclosure and the entrances to the
passage area.
This Agency understands, however, that the space in question belongs
entirely inside a closed room for dining room. Furthermore, the part
claimed does not justify that the security of the building requires the control of that supposed
"passage area" and that the same security and control cannot be obtained without this
additional camera installed in the dining room, making use only of the system installed in
the areas where the capture of images is allowed. (...) (...).
The claimed entity itself admits in its statement of allegations that the persons
Those who access the dining room go through "the rest of the corridors of the ship and the place of
video-monitored work to reach the dining room”.
With this statement, the claimed party also intends to assimilate the capture of
images of the worker in the controversial area, which belongs to the interior of the room
dining room, with the capture of images in the rooms or contiguous spaces that

as much as saying that, being possible to capture images of the people who are going
to the dining room through different parts of the building, it is also possible to capture
images inside the dining room, except in the space occupied by the tables
strictly delimited, as if the privacy of the person should only be protected
when you use one of the tables. However, it is clear both spaces are not
assimilable, and that the norm protects the space destined to rest in its entirety
and not just a part of it, at the convenience of the responsible entity.
Consequently, in this case, it can be understood disproportionate and illegal the
capture of images referred to in the claim that gives rise to this
sanctioning procedure. It is noted that recording images on the
indicated area is an intrusion into the privacy of people.
The approach and conclusion expressed in this act do not contradict what
indicated in the precedents of this Agency invoked by the claimed party, nor the
Sentences alluded to in his brief of allegations.
The defendant cites the precedents indicated with the numbers E/09297/2018 and E/
01760/2017, indicating that they refer to the installation of cameras in areas of
rest oriented to the goods that it is intended to protect, which is considered lawful

threats and that this Agency resolved the filing of the proceedings.

that may suffer such threats, not being provided that a dome-type camera monitors
the entire area. If it were decided to install, the assets to be protected could be moved to another location
in the least invasive space for people.
b) The collection of images, if said purpose is accredited, would have to be very limited to those
assets that have suffered such actions, without the belief or
expectation that they may suffer acts of vandalism”.
In the same way, the resolution to file the proceedings adopted in the
E/01760/2017, referring to a case of installation of cameras for the protection of
vending machines in worker rest areas, declares the following:
"In the present case, from the photographic documentation provided by the denounced entity,

provided, it can be deduced that said cameras are oriented to vending machines,
which would only allow to capture the people who used said machines, having to
considered, that as long as they are kept in these conditions and location, there would be a

the minimum area captured for the intended purpose”.

Also in relation to the possibility of installing cameras to protect heritage
business when irregularities have been committed or there are suspicions of it, cites
the party claimed the Judgment no. 630/2016 of the Supreme Court and Judgment of
10/17/2019 of the European Court of Human Rights, but the case analyzed
It does not deal with the recording of private areas, but work areas.
The defendant also cites Judgment no. 1190/2021, of the Social Chamber
of the Superior Court of Justice of the Canary Islands, but it does so by highlighting the
allegations of the recurring entity in that case and not what was declared by the Court.
And Judgment 432/2022, of the Administrative Litigation Chamber of the Court
National of 01/31/2022, which is not related to the present case as it refers to
to the installation of cameras inside a house.
Lastly, contrary to what was stated by the defendant, it should be clarified that this
Agency if it has taken into account the existence of informative posters or the non-existence
conservation of the images longer than the established time, although it is
circumstances that do not modify the conclusions presented. If confirmed
the non-existence of informative posters, which was the object of the claim, would have
motivated the imputation of an infraction for breach of the duty to inform in
personal data protection matter.
Consequently, by virtue of the foregoing, it is considered that the facts
exposed violate what is established in article 6 of the GDPR, for which they suppose the
commission of an offense classified in article 83.5 of the GDPR, which gives rise to the
application of the corrective powers that article 58 of the aforementioned Regulation grants to
the Spanish Data Protection Agency. This article 83.5.a) of the GDPR provides
the next:
Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with section
2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company,

previous financial year, opting for the highest amount:
a) the basic principles for treatment, including the conditions for consent to

For the purposes of the limitation period for infringements, the infringement indicated in the
previous paragraph is considered very serious in accordance with article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD,
which states that:
"Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, they are considered
very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose a violation
