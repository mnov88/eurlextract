## English Summary

### Facts

A Spanish Consumers and Users Organisation lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against MyHeritage, LTD, an online genealogy platform that offers a genetic testing service that analyses the user's DNA. The Spanish branch is part of a company based in Israel.

The complainant raised several issues:

*   International transfers of personal data outside the EEA to countries without adequate guarantees, as stipulated in [Article 46 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_46_GDPR "Article 46 GDPR").
*   Processing of personal data without a clear legal basis, and lack of adequate information given to the data subject.
*   Processing of genetic personal data (DNA) that does not seem to comply with any of the exceptions contained in [Article 9(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2 "Article 9 GDPR").
*   Disclosure to other users of the personal data of third parties that are included in the genealogical trees.
*   Disclosure of personal data of users among which "DNA Matches" or "Smart Matches" (similarities between their DNA) are established.
*   Assignments to third parties for strange purposes (e.g. to protect their rights or the property of other users).
*   Doubtful sharing of information with "Genealogy partners".
*   Deficiencies in information and consent related to cookies.
*   Legitimization of "investigations" based on consent. Doubts about whether they really get consent, what this investigation really consists of, its purposes, as well as the information provided to the data subjects.
*   Doubts about the processing of data for commercial purposes (opposition to the sending of advertising communications and what legal basis is used to send these, clarifying whether cookies are their own or third-party cookies, which is not clear in the privacy policy).
*   Deficiencies in information about the processing activities.
*   The privacy policy does not clearly specify that one should send their genetic material and not that of another. This issue could refer to the security measures to prove that a person is sending you their genetic material and not that of another person.
*   Other deficiencies in the matter of information to users from [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").
*   No doors are closed to possible assignments or sales under license of health information or DNA of users who are not Russian, Norwegian and Swedish.
*   Processing of minors' data between 13 years and the minimum age that each country establishes to provide consent without needing that of their parents or guardians.
*   Other deficiencies in the drafting of the policy (inconsistencies, duplicities, omissions, ambiguities, etc.)
*   Issues related to the exercise of rights.
*   Doubts about the storage period of data once deleted, and the scope of the deletion.

Hence, the AEPD launched a general investigation.

### Holding

According to the AEPD, the controller did not provide all the information required by [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"), since information about the right to portability and to restrict the processing was missing, as well as information about the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. In this regard, AEPD issued a reprimand to the controller and ordered them to include such information.

The AEPD found no evidence whatsoever of a violation of [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"), nor of [Article 8 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_8_GDPR "Article 8 GDPR"). There was also no violation of [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"), since the exception for explicit consent from [Article 9(2)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2a "Article 9 GDPR") applied.

With regard to international transfers of data, the AEPD concluded that there was no evidence of a violation, since the complainant did not point to any specific risks, and the controller manifested that they were working on new Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).

The AEPD also disregarded all the other allegations, finding no violations whatsoever, except in relation to cookies. Regarding cookies, the AEPD found that the website placed unnecessary own and third-party cookies before asking for consent. Additionally, the information offered in the banner was insufficient, and the cookies policy did not identify the cookies the web used. According to the AEPD, such facts constituted a violation of Article 22(2) LSSI, (the Spanish law implementing the e-Privacy Directive), and fined the controller €20,000, that were reduced to €16,000 because of an early payment.

Regarding deficiencies in the information provided to users whose data is

object of treatment.

Article 5 of the RGPD regarding the principles that must govern data processing

personal mention among them that of transparency. Section 1 of the precept provides
ne:

        "The personal data will be:

         a) treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party

("Legality, loyalty and transparency") "

Manifestation of the principle of transparency is the obligation incumbent on the

data controllers to inform, in the terms of article 13 of the RGPD, to the
owner of personal data when they are obtained directly from the interested party:

      "one. When personal data relating to him are obtained from an interested party, the
responsible for the treatment, at the time these are obtained, will provide

all the information indicated below:

      f) where appropriate, the intention of the person responsible to transfer personal data to a
third country or international organization and the existence or absence of a decision of

adequacy of the Commission, or, in the case of transfers indicated in articles
46 or 47 or article 49, paragraph 1, second paragraph, reference to guarantees

appropriate or appropriate and the means to obtain a copy of these or the fact of

      2. In addition to the information mentioned in section 1, the person responsible for the
treatment will facilitate the interested party, at the moment in which the personal data is obtained

sonal, the following information necessary to guarantee data processing
loyal and transparent:

      a) the period during which the personal data will be kept or, when it is not
possible, the criteria used to determine this deadline;

      b) the existence of the right to request the data controller access to

the personal data relating to the interested party, and its rectification or deletion, or the limitation-
tion of their treatment, or to oppose the treatment, as well as the right to portability
data quality;

      c) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter a), or the
Article 9, paragraph 2, letter a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent in
at any time, without affecting the legality of the treatment based on the

feeling prior to withdrawal;

      d) the right to file a claim with a supervisory authority;

      e) if the communication of personal data is a legal or contractual requirement, or

a necessary requirement to sign a contract, and if the interested party is obliged to
provide personal data and are informed of the possible consequences of not
provide such data;

      f) the existence of automated decisions, including profiling, to

      3. When the person responsible for the treatment plans the subsequent treatment of data

personal coughs for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, will provide
to the interested party, prior to said subsequent treatment, information about that other
purpose and any additional relevant information pursuant to section 2.

      4. The provisions of sections 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply when and in the
to the extent that the interested party already has the information. "

In this sense, Recital 60 of the RGPD says that “The principles of treatment
loyal and transparent require that the interested party be informed of the existence of the
tion of treatment and its purposes. The data controller must provide the interested party

the personal data is obtained from the interested parties, they must also be informed of

if they are obliged to facilitate them and of the consequences if they do not. "

The information collected in the privacy policy, which has been updated and expanded-

da, does not respond to all the requirements contained in article 13 of the RGPD.

It is found that there is no information on the possibility of exercising the right of portability and

the right to limit treatment. Likewise, the right of the intellectuals is not indicated.
rested from filing a claim with the supervisory authority.

The form used violates article 13 of the RGPD conduct that is subsumable
in article 83.5 of the RGPD which provides: “Violations of the provisions
The following will be sanctioned in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines of

EUR 20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, of an equal amount
equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover for the financial year

above, opting for the one with the highest amount:

        (...)

    b) The rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22; "

For the mere purposes of prescription, article 74.1.a) of the LOPDGDD considers
as slight “a) Failure to comply with the principle of transparency of information or the

right to information of the affected person for not providing all the information required by the
Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. ”. The statute of limitations for the
light fractions provided for in Organic Law 3/2018 is one year.

Article 58.2 of the RGPD establishes:

      “Each supervisory authority shall have all the following corrective powers
listed below:

      to) (..)

ment;

      d) order the person in charge or in charge of treatment that the operations of

      (...)

      i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition or instead of
of the measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of

each particular case ”.

In the present case, taking into account the special circumstances that concur and conform to

Recital 148 of the RGPD, according to which when there is a minor infringement
instead of the fine, the warning sanction may be imposed, in this
phase of the procedure, and without prejudice to the result of the investigation, it is estimated that

for the infringement of article 13 of the RGPD, it is necessary to impose the sanction of warning
to; taking into account that the privacy policy is very complete, although they have

omitted two pieces of information: the possibility of exercising the right of portability and
treatment, and the right to file a claim with the authority of
control.

Likewise, in the event that the resolution goes in the same direction as this agreement,
It would be appropriate to impose the corrective measure described in article 58.2.d) RGPD and order

tell the respondent to prepare a data collection form that offers to the
affected all the information that is obliged to provide under article 13 of the

GDPR.

Regarding the treatment of user data
