## English Summary

### Facts

The Spanish Data Protection Authority (AEPD) fined a data controller for unlawfully processing the personal data of its customer (data subject). The data controller assigned the duplicate of a mobile phone number of a data subject to a third party without the consent of the data subject. The third party, using the duplicate, fraudulently gained access to the data subject’s bank details and carried out various non-consensual transactions using the authentication SMS messages received through the phone number. The number was immediately blocked by the data controller after the incident, and a fraud victim check was activated by the data controller to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The data controller was issued a new SIM card and was refunded the amount incurred in SIM card replacement management. The data subject complained to the Spanish Data Protection Authority (AEPD) on the grounds of unlawful processing of the data subject’s personal data.

### Holding

The AEPD held that the data controller lacked any lawful basis under Article 6(1) of the GDPR to process the data subject’s personal data. In so holding, the DPA noted that the data controller did not act diligently in compliance with its obligation to guarantee that the personal data it processed respects the principle of legitimacy of processing. The call requesting the issuance of a duplicate of the mobile phone number was received from abroad using a hidden number, and the individual processing the request on behalf of the data controller did not conduct appropriate diligence to verify that the person making the request was the data subject who owned the number prior to issuing the duplicate of the number.

The AEPD noted that although the data controller had a security policy for handling such requests, the procedure outlined in the policy was not followed, as if it had been followed, the request should have been denied. It was further observed that the data controller did not clarify how it proceeded with handling the request, nor does it have documentation or recordings in that regard.

The AEPD equally held that the processing also breached the provisions of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR as it was done unlawfully. As noted by the AEPD, in order for the data processing carried out by the data controller to be legitimate, it was necessary that, in its capacity as data controller, it could prove that the owner of the processed data (the data subject) was actually the one who made the request. In this circumstance, the data controller failed to fulfill this obligation, which led to identity fraud.

In awarding a fine of €100,000, the AEPD considered as a mitigating factor under Article 83(2)(c) of the GDPR the fact that the data subject had proceeded to resolve the incident that was the subject of the complaint effectively by blocking the number the next day. The AEPD also considered the previous infractions of the data controller by virtue of Article 83(2)(e) of the GDPR in order to gauge the illegality of the data controller’s actions.

The AEPD, relying on Article 85 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (LPACAP), reduced the fine to €80,000 on the grounds of voluntary payment by the data controller, within the period permitted to do so.

regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”
II
Unfulfilled Obligation
Well, the defendant is accused of committing an infraction due to violation of the
Article 6 of the GDPR, “Legality of processing”, which states in section 1 the
Cases in which the processing of third-party data is considered lawful:
"1. Treatment will only be legal if at least one of the following is met
conditions:
a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;
b) the processing is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures;
c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;
d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the interested party or another
Physical person;
e) the processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the controller;
f) the processing is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person responsible for the treatment or by a third party, provided that regarding said
interests do not prevail over the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party requiring the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child. The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph will not be

application to the processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their
functions.”
In the present case, it is proven that a third party on February 27, 2022
requested through a phone call to the Vodafone customer service center
a duplicate of the SIM card of the complaining party, a duplicate that was provided to him,
Therefore, said third party had access to your bank details and carried out various
non-consensual operations, using the authentication SMS received,
thus confirming them.
So that the data processing carried out by the claimant could be based on

status as data controller, could prove that the owner of the data
treaties was actually the one who facilitated them.
However, the defendant did not provide her response to the prior information request.
to the admission for processing of this claim, no document or evidentiary element
that proves the legal basis of the treatment carried out.
Thus, in the response to the information request from the AEPD dated August 8,
2022, the defendant alleged <<It has been verified that the duplicate SIM card on
The mobile line \*\*\*TELEFONO.1 not recognized by the claimant was declared as
fraudulent on February 28, 2022 by Vodafone's fraud department.

October 28, 2022 that the duplicate SIM was fraudulent. Although politics provides
security, does not clarify how it was proceeded in this case, nor does it have documentation or
recordings. In addition, the call to request the duplicate was made from Norway
and using a hidden number, so it was not possible to verify who requested the
SIM.
In short, in the case analyzed, the diligence used by
part of the claimed to identify the person who requested the duplicate of the
SIM card.
In any case, the procedure implemented by the claimed party was not followed, since,
If it had been done, it should have been denied.

the complaining party, thereby contravening article 6 of the GDPR.
In this sense, Recital 40 of the GDPR states:

consent of the interested party or on some other legitimate basis established in accordance
a Law, whether in this Regulation or under other Union law

instruction of the procedure, for the purposes of setting the amount of the fine sanction
impose the claimed entity as responsible for an infraction classified in the
article 83.5.a) of the RGPD and 72.1 b) of the LOPDGDD, in an initial assessment,
The following factors are considered concurrent in the present case:
As aggravating factors:
- The circumstance of article 83.2.e) RGPD: “Any previous infraction committed by the
responsible or the person in charge of the treatment”.
Recital 148 of the GDPR states “In order to strengthen the application of the rules
of this Regulation \[...\]” and indicates in this regard that “It must, however,
Special attention should be paid to the nature, severity and duration of the infringement, its
intentional character \[...\] or to any pertinent infringement \[...\]”.
Thus, in accordance with section e) of article 83.2. GDPR, in determining the
amount of the administrative fine sanction cannot fail to be valued all
those previous infractions of the person responsible or of the person in charge of treatment in
in order to gauge the illegality of the analyzed behavior or the guilt of the subject

9/13
The allegedly infringing conduct consisted of the processing of personal data
without legitimation - fraudulent duplicate SIM - did not act diligently in the
compliance with its obligation to ensure that personal data
that deals with respect the principle of legality.
Therefore, the omission of the appropriate diligence, aimed at the
identification of the person who provided personal data of which they were not the owner as their own,
allowed identity fraud and determined that the processing of personal data
of the claimant made by the defendant lacked legal basis under the
article 5.1.a) in relation to article 6.1. GDPR.
There are numerous sanctioning procedures processed by the AEPD in which
the defendant did not act with the required diligence, since it did not apply the necessary measures
and appropriate to verify the identity of the contracting party or the third party that provided as
your data of which you were not the owner. The procedures and sanctions in them
were imposed to graduate the sanction that must be imposed for the violation of the
article 6.1. GDPR that is attributed to you in this opening agreement.
Reason why the defendant's history of violations, in which there was a
significant omission of the necessary diligence to verify the identity of the person
provided the personal data of a third party as his own, affects the guilt and
illegality of the conduct assessed here.
As an example, the resolutions issued by the AEPD are cited in the following
sanctioning procedures processed against the defendant:
i.EXP 202204287 Resolution issued on October 24, 2022 in which it was imposed
a fine of 70,000 euros. The facts concerned a duplicate of the card
Fraudulent SIM without legitimation. Vodafone took advantage of one of the two
planned reductions.
ii.EXP202103028. Resolution issued on November 29, 2022 in which it was imposed
a fine of 70,000 euros. The facts concerned a duplicate of the card
Fraudulent SIM without legitimation. Vodafone took advantage of one of the two reductions
planned.

a fine of 70,000 euros. The facts concerned a duplicate of the card
Fraudulent SIM without legitimation. Vodafone took advantage of one of the two reductions
planned.
- The evident link between the business activity of the defendant and the
processing of personal data of clients or third parties (article 83.2.k, of the RGPD
in relation to article 76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD).
The Judgment of the National Court of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006), in which,
regarding entities whose activity involves continuous data processing
of clients, indicates that “…the Supreme Court has been understanding that there is
recklessness whenever a legal duty of care is neglected, that is, when the
offender does not behave with the required diligence. And in assessing the degree of
diligence, the professionalism or otherwise of the subject must be especially considered, and not

There is no doubt that, in the case now examined, when the activity of the appellant
is constant and abundant handling of personal data, it must be insisted on
the rigor and exquisite care to comply with the legal preventions in this regard.”
As mitigating factors:
The claimed party proceeded to resolve the incident that was the subject of the claim in a manner
effective (art. 83.2 c).
It is necessary to graduate the sanction to be imposed on the person complained of and set it at the amount of 100,000
