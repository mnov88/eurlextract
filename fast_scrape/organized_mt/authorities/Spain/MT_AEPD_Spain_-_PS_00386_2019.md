## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that a website by the defendant loads a great number of analytical and advertising cookies without requesting the consent by the user.

### Dispute

The defendant did not answer to any AEPD investigation requests, so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure. During its investigations, the AEPD discovered that (i) the website automatically loaded cookies without any action by the user, such as MUID, test\_cookie, \_ga and \_gid, that (ii) the basic layer of the website informed that, in case the user continues browsing, cookies would be considered automatically accepted, (iii) the detailed layer of the website contained a Cookies Policy specifying that cookies would not link to personal data obtained in the process of product purchasing without the consent of the user, and that, in order to refuse the use of cookies, the user should choose that option on his/her browser.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that the defendant has infringed its information duties in relation to cookies as per Article 22(2) LSSI, according to which, digital services providers may use data storage and retrieval devices on computers terminals of the recipients, provided that such recipients have given their consent after they have been provided with clear and complete information on their use and, in particular, on the purposes of data processing according to the data protection laws. Consequently, after considering some aggravating circumstances \[(i) the existence of intentionality, and (ii) the period of time the defendant has been infringing its duties taking into account that the claim is dated February 2019\], the AEPD decided to impose a fine of 3,000 € to the defendant. Additionally, the AEPD requires the defendant to correct the situation on the cookies use at the website in the period of one (1) month since this resolution.
