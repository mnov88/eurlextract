## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen (the claimant) stating that the defendant transferred her personal data to the financial institution Evo Finance E.F.C., S.A.U., and this one, in turn, to the debt-recovery company TEAM4 Collection & Consulting; additionally, the claimant states that her personal data had been included in the solvency and credit file BADEXCUG, and that she only went to the premises of the defendant in order to ask for a budget for a stomach reduction, but she did not accept the budget nor subscribed any agreement with the defendant.

### Dispute

The defendant did not answer the AEPD request, so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that the defendant has infringed the lawfulness principle included at Article 6 GDPR, as it did not have the corresponding legal basis to process the personal data of the claimant when it transferred them to the financing entity. Consequently, after considering some circumstances \[(i) there is a wilful misconduct by the defendant, (ii) basic personal data have been affected, and (iii) there is a continuing nature of the infraction\], the AEPD decided to impose a fine of €50000 to the defendant.
