## English Summary

### Facts

A worker of a clinic lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA because their employer had used their image for advertisement purposes without consent. They had placed huge banners with it in a display window.

The banners were on sight for more than a year, despite the worker's repetitive request, via different ways, for them to take them down.

Such banners were, however, taken down after the worker made a notarial request. The clinic alleged, mainly, that the worker had signed an image rights transfer agreement previous to the display of the banner.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA held that the fact that the worker had signed an image rights transfer agreement previous to the display of the banner was considered as a legal basis for data processing. Hence, they did not find a violation of Article 6.
