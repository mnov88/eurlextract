## English Summary

### Facts

A complainant, a previous worker of Amazon Spain, made an access request to Amazon in order to obtain different pieces of information that Amazon owned in relation to the period in which they were working for the company. The worker needed this data to use it in a court proceeding regarding social security and disability issues.

Amazon answered to their access request extemporaneously, during the course of this procedure, alleging that they were not in possession of some of the data anymore. The respondent was able to provide some data relating to the claimant's production, but not the instructions and personal communications with Amazon's digital assistant.

The deleted information corresponds to operational instructions that are automatically generated by internal systems, relating to specific day-to-day tasks, which are displayed on the devices that employees use to work in the respondent's logistics centres. However, operational data and merely functional instructions are deleted after 7 days, for operational purposes and according to their retention policy.

### Dispute

Was Amazon allowed to delete such data or should them had kept it?

### Holding

The AEPD concluded that, even if the access request had been complied with in the end, they would investigate whether Amazon should had blocked and retained the data according to Article 32 of the [Spanish Data Protection Act](https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2018/12/06/pdfs/BOE-A-2018-16673.pdf) (LOPD). This Article obliges controllers to block and retain personal data when suppressing or rectifying it, when it may be necessary to comply with obligations or responsibilities regarding the processing coming from data protection authorities, judges, courts, and other public bodies.

They AEPD indicated that, regarding the requested data, they are only competent of the ones that are personal data. Therefore, on the one hand, functional or operative information, automatized instructions for day-to-day tasks, and work organization systems are excluded from the AEPD competence. On the other hand, personal communications and instructions from Amazon's digital assistant are included.

They AEPD decided to uphold the complaint for formal reasons, as the access request was answered extemporaneously, but did not impose any fine or warning on the respondent, as the rights of the complainant were not diminished, given that they had indeed answered.

They also remarked that sanction procedures shall have an exceptional character, and that shall be avoided unless there is no other solution or mechanism. For example, they may not necessary when the rights of the claimant have been fully restored.

Finally, the AEPD noted that, even if it is not their function to assess anything related to other kind of procedures, such as social security procedures, the data protection right may indeed have an instrumental character with regard to the exercise of other rights.

Despite this, once the documentation in the procedure has been examined, the
complaining party, specifically requests that the operational instructions that

displayed on devices that employees use for work, and that,
are necessary for a litigation in the social jurisdiction, and adds that the claimed has

daily and work organization systems, does not fall within the scope of competence

of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection to settle the conflict that underlies between
the parties, or enter into assessments regarding the validity of the employment contract, which

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
