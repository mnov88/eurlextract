## English Summary

### Facts

A rhythmic gymnastics club held an Instagram page called "RITMICASANANTONIO", in which images of children performing exercises were published. The mother of two minors had several times asked the club not to publish images of her daughters on the social networks and she had also made clear that she did not give the club the authorization to photograph and record her daughters, aged 10 and 12.

The club continued its conduct and posted another video in which the two girls appeared.

The mother then filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) in this regard.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA deemed that the club had violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"), since it had published images of the complainant's daughters on Instagram, without having any legitimacy to do so. The club could not prove that it had the right to process the data of the complainant's minor daughters, since they did not have the mother's consent.

The Spanish DPA considered that the sanction to be imposed should be aggravated in accordance with the criteria established in [Article 83(2)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2b "Article 83 GDPR"): negligent character of the infringement, and Article 83(2)(g) GDPR: categories of personal data affected, in this case images of minors.

For these reasons, the AEPD fined the rhythmic gymnastics club €5,000.
