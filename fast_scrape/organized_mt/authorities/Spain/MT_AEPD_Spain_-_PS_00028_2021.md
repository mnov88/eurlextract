## English Summary

### Facts

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) received a complaint from a data subject living close to a building owned by the Spanish Ministry of Defence. Such building had cameras recording its outside perimeter, that included private parking spots from homes more than five meters apart.

The data subject alleged that, as they owned one of those homes, they were recorded by the cameras every time they moved around their home, so any security workers of the building could know what time they left and entered the house, recording their vehicle, including its licence plate, and themselves while doing it.

The Ministry of Defence acknowledged that, even if there were informing banners about the cameras, some made reference to the former data protection act, and that the angles of some cameras should be adjusted. Those cameras showed part of an avenue, including private homes, and part of the facade of some buildings, showing the inside of the homes through them. They also alleged that the images could only be watched in certain cases authorized by law. Also, that the legal basis for the recording was Article 6(1)(e), given the fact that the surroundings of the building were classified as military-home-zone, and they had authorization to proceed in such a way.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA acknowledged the right of the Ministry of Defence to obtain such recordings through the camera, with grounds on Article 6(1)(e) GDPR and Article 22 of the [Spanish Data Protection Act](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673) (LOPDGDD), that allows the recording of public spaces when it is necessary to ensure the security of strategic facilities, as long as they do not record the inside of private homes.

However, the AEPD held that there had been a violation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. Even if the Ministry had a legal basis for the treatment, the minimization principle shall always be complied with. The AEPD concluded that some of the cameras gathered images that were not strictly necessary for security purposes (such as the ones that recorded a whole avenue, obtaining images of private parking spots, or the ones pointing to the facade of buildings), therefore infringing Article 5(1)(c).

For this, the AEPD warned the Ministry of Defence, given that the Spanish Data Protection Act does not allow for fines to public institutions.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                              I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director
of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and to re-

solve this procedure.
                                             II

Before going into the merits of the matter, it is convenient to examine the request for Annulment of the
present proceedings claiming helplessness.

        Article 62 of Law 39/2015 81 October) provides: “A complaint is understood to be
cia, the act by which any person, in compliance or not with a legal obligation,
gal, informs an administrative body of the existence of a certain

vo ".

Having consulted the base of this body, there is no record that the defendant exercised her
right (art. 53.1 "in fine" Law 39/2015) "to access and obtain a copy of the documents
contained in the aforementioned procedures ”.

Therefore, it is not possible to use "defenselessness" when it has not exercised in
time and form your legally recognized rights.

        As stated in the brief of allegations dated 03/22/21 in the Agreement

Initiation of this Agency is already expressly mentioned that the procedure begins
by Complaint of the claimant, being clear the "facts" that were imputed to him and
Those who have had the opportunity to claim what has been considered appropriate.

        Furthermore, it does not specify what the defenselessness produced consists of,

making a generic argument, when the reality is that it has been allowed

argue all that is necessary to prove the legality of the camera system object-
to denounce.

        Therefore, it is not considered that there is any cause for nullity, reason
by which the application in this regard should be rejected.

                                             III

In the present case, we proceed to examine the claim for the date of entry into

this Agency 10/04/19 by means of which the following is transferred as the main event
next:

        “The cameras capture the parking lot of the surrounding houses, taking
license plates with more than five meters of separation from its fence that limits the terrain of

said residence, in such a way that the workers of the residence with access to
camera screens or recordings know what time I arrive, when I leave and
they record my license plate and the movements of my vehicle and myself ”(folio nº 1).

The facts are therefore specified in the proportionality of the obtaining of images
through video surveillance cameras, considering "excessive" the target perimeter

uptake.

        Article 22 section 2 of the LOPDGDD provides the following:

        “Images of the public road may only be captured to the extent that it is

        The allegations made initially were considered insufficient to determine
create the File of the claim presented, by continuing to affect the system to the
claimant's parking area, without any reasoned explanation being made
in this regard, the "facts" that are the object of the complaint subsist.

        Video surveillance, as a solution to a security problem, should be a
adequate, pertinent and not excessive measure in relation to the purpose pursued and
that justifies the installation of surveillance cameras. Furthermore, the proportionality
requires that the end of security cannot be achieved through other alternative means.
