## English Summary

### Facts

The Spanish DPA analyzed the possible unlawfulness of the installation of a video surveillance system composed of 3 cameras located outside a house in SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE, a system that could capture images of neighbouring areas of houses in a disproportionate manner, as well as an automatic door phone for private use outside the building, all without the corresponding authorization of the Neighbours' Community.

The authorization of the Homeowners' Association has not been accredited for the installation of the above-mentioned devices, having to comply with the requirements established by Law 49/1960 of 21 July on horizontal property (LPH). This law regulates that the installation of a video surveillance system by a private individual will require the authorization of the Community of Owners' Meeting both when it is planned to be located in a common area and when, even if located in a private use area, it is oriented towards surrounding common areas and captures - respecting, in any case, the principle of data minimization - tangentially these common areas.

### Dispute

Is the installation of security cameras that capture images of the neighborhood and the street a violation of Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA has found that the facts of the present proceedings show that 2 of the 3 cameras installed by the claimant capture a disproportionate share of communal areas, neighbouring housing, and even public roads.

This situation is not covered by the exclusion set out in Article 22.5 of LOPDGDD as the capture of images that exceed the verification about the identity of people trying to access an address beyond the treatment "carried out by a natural person in the exercise of exclusively private or domestic activities" of Article 2.2.c) of the RGPD.

The same consideration must be extended to the video door entry system installed on the exterior wall of the Community, since its location cannot be compared to the video door phone installed at the front door of a house.

As this is a warning sanction, the AEPD gives the defendant a period of one month to correct the unlawful conduct.

The AEPD agreed to impose a warning sanction, according to the following facts:

\-This is a private individual whose main activity is not linked to the processing of personal data -No recidivism can be detected since no more than one infringement of the same nature has been recorded within a year. And furthermore, because the respondent has shown a cooperative attitude with the Agency in replying to the request.

LEGAL GROUNDS

I
By virtue of the powers conferred on each of the parties by Article 58(2) of the GDPR authority, and in accordance with the provisions of Articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

II
The defendant is charged with an infringement of the Article 5.1(c) of the GDPR on the principles of processing, which provides that personal data shall be "adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to for the purposes for which they are processed ("data minimisation")." This article enshrines the principle of data minimisation in data processingpersonal. It presupposes that such processing is adjusted and proportionate to the purpose to the one being addressed, with excessive data processing being restricted or be abolished.

The violation of this article is typified as an infraction in article 83.5 of the RGPD, which it considers as such:
"Infringements of the following provisions shall be sanctioned, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 20 000 000 or in the case of a company, for an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of total annual turnover for the previous financial year, opting for the largest:

(a) the basic principles for treatment, including the conditions for consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; \[...\].
However, Article 58(2)(b) of the same legal text provides for the possibility of to sanction with a warning, in relation to the provisions of recital 148:
"In the event of a minor infringement, or if the fine likely to be imposed constitute a disproportionate burden on a natural person, rather than a warning may be imposed by way of a fine. However, it must
particular attention should be paid to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, its the Commission shall take all necessary measures to mitigate the damage suffered, the degree of liability or any previous relevant infringement, the way in which that the monitoring authority has been made aware of the infringement, to compliance of measures ordered against the person responsible or entrusted, to the adherence to codes of conduct and to any other aggravating or mitigating circumstances".

For the purposes of the limitation period for infringements, the infringement in question in the previous paragraph is considered very serious and prescribes after three years, according to Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which establishes that

"In accordance with Article 83(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations for infringements involving a substantial breach of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following:
a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

III
In this procedure, the alleged unlawfulness of the installation, by the defendant, of a video surveillance system consisting of 3 cameras located outside the house on STREET \*\*\*DIRECTION.1, \*\*\*APARTMENTS.1 - \*\*\*LOCALITY.1 (SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE), system that could capture images of neighbouring housing areas in a way disproportionate, as well as an intercom for private use outside the without the corresponding authorisation of the Owners' Association of the Community. 

The facts of these proceedings show that 2 of the 3 cameras installed by the claimant (the so-called camera 1 and the one visible in the lower left quadrant of the viewing monitor) capture disproportionate share of communal areas, neighbouring housing and even public roads. 
This situation is not covered by the exclusion set out in Article 22.5 of LOPDGDD as the capture of images that exceed the verification about the identity of people trying to access an address beyond the
treatment "carried out by a natural person in the exercise of exclusively private or domestic activities" of Article 2.2.c) of the RGPD.
The same consideration must be extended to the video door entry system installed on the exterior wall
Community, since its location cannot be compared to the video doorphone installed at the front door of a house.
Likewise, although the purpose of the data processing carried out with the video surveillance system was to guarantee the security of the home and space and therefore this legitimizing basis could be asserted
-, the capture of images should be reduced to this private space, being limited that of common areas at the minimum tangential and essential, without in any case can reach the gardens of neighbouring houses or the public highway. They remind him that, with regard to the latter, the power is generally attributed to the Forces and Security Forces and that, in any case, the possibility of capturing a portion for security reasons, it would be necessary, because of the characteristics of the building in question, to the community of owners.
Finally, it should be noted that individuals who install this type of devices are responsible for ensuring that it complies with current legislation, and must comply with the requirements set out in Law 49/1960 of 21 July,
on horizontal property (LPH). Thus, the installation of a video surveillance system by a private individual will require the authorisation of the Community of Owners' Meeting both when its location is projected in a common area and when, even if located in an area of private use, to orient itself to surrounding common areas and to capture - while respecting the principle of data minimisation - tangentially these common areas.

IV
In the present case, when deciding on the penalty to be imposed, the following have been taking into account, in particular, the following elements.
That it is a private individual whose main activity is not linked to the processing of personal data.
That no recidivism is appreciated, as the commission is not recorded, within a year, of more than one infringement of the same nature.
That it has shown a cooperative attitude towards this Agency by replying to the requirement.
For all these reasons, it is considered that the sanction that should be imposed is warning, in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR, in connection with the above-mentioned Recital 148.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and having regard to the criteria of graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been accredited, the Director of Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: TO IMPOSE C.C.C., with NIF \*\*\*NIF.1, for an infringement of Article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, a penalty of WARNING. To that effect, within ONE MONTH from the notification of this act, you must provide proof of the following:

Proof of the removal of camera 1 and of the camera listed in the monitor in the lower left quadrant of your current locations, or to its reorientation by reducing the angle of capture.
Please note that the automatic video door entry system installed on the community wall will
found to be inoperative.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to C.C.C. and REPORT the result of actions to A.A.A. on behalf of B.B.B.
In accordance with the provisions of Article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this Resolution will be made public after it has been notified to the interested parties.

Finally, it is pointed out that in accordance with the provisions of Article 90.3 a) of the LPACAP, the final decision may be suspended in administrative proceedings as a precautionary measure if the person concerned indicates his intention to lodge an administrative appeal. If this is the case, the interested party must formally communicate this made by writing to the Spanish Data Protection Agency, by submitting it through the Agency's Electronic Register \[https://sedeagpd.gob.es/sede-electronica-web/\], or through one of the other registrations provided for in Article 16.4 of the aforementioned Law 39/2015, of 1 October.
