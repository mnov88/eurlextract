## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject requested the access and the erasure of their personal data from the list of insolvent persons. The data was initially handled by the data controller, but there was a posterior change of control. Even though the data subject affirmed that their requests were not properly addressed by the initial controller, the company stated that all the answers were timely provided, including the change of control over the data.

### Holding

The DPA dismissed the complaint of the data subject. Since the controller did provide timely and relevant information to the data controller and they have an outstanding debt with the controller, the complaint should not be upheld.

## Comment

The Spanish DPA highlighted that, whenever possible, alternative mechanisms should be enforced over administrative sanctioning.
