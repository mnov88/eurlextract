## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject was denied boarding to an EasyJet flight. To ascertain why, he requested all the personal data that EasyJet held on him under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"). This email was sent on the 28/12/2021.

On 30/12/2021, EasyJet replied stating that it would take them time to reply to the access request as their staff was on holiday.

On the 16/03/2022 the data subjecty sent EasyJet an email stating that he would file a complaint with the DPA given that he had still not received a reply.

EasyJet replied to the data subject stating that his original request had never come to the relevant team's attention as he had apparently sent the email to the wrong department. They asked the data subject to send it again so that they could resolve it promptly. When the data subject repeated the request, EasyJet stated on 01/04/2022 that they could not give him information related this boarding as claims relating to denied boarding are not related to the GDPR.

### Holding

First, EasyJet told the DPA that they responded to the complainant by 01/04/2022. The DPA pointed out that [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") requires controller's to reply to access requests within one month. EasyJet took almost four months after the data subject had submitted his request (on 12/28/2022) to reply.

Second, while it is true that on 30/12/2021 EasyJet responded to the complainant's e-mail, the e-mail limited itself to providing a generic response confirming receipt of the e-mail. The e-mail mentioned that the complaint would be forwarded to the corresponding team for consultation. Thus, EasyJet already in December indicated an agreement to initiate the access request. The data subject was not provided an adequate response until April 2022.

Third, on the information related to the boarding, the DPA agreed that it was not related to the GDPR. For this reason, the DPA limited itself to focusing on [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and the time that the controller took to reply to the access request.

The Spanish DPA initially fined EasyJet €10,000 for a breach of [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"). However, given that EasyJet voluntarily paid it and accepted responsibility for the infraction, it was reduced to €8,000.

## Comment

It is the controller's responsibility to ensure that access requests are forwarded to the relevant department. EDPB guidelines ([https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2022-01/edpb\_guidelines\_012022\_right-of-access\_0.pdf](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2022-01/edpb_guidelines_012022_right-of-access_0.pdf) at para 157) state that it is not the data subject's job to prove that their request arrived on the responsible person's desk. In fact, the controller does not even need to have taken notice of the request to be responsible. For the purposes of Article 15, the data subject only needs to prove that they sent the request through an official channel and that the controller has not replied within the one month deadline.

From the procedure instructed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based

to the following:

                                  BACKGROUND

The reasons on which the claim is based are the following:

"Good morning.

On December 28, I requested access to my data in exercise of my right to

access, to the company Easyjet, in the framework of a claim for breach of
Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, to all data relating to me in your possession,
in addition to those related to said file. I received only a mere acknowledgment of

       electronic addresses \*\*\*EMAIL.1 and \*\*\*EMAIL.2, with the subject “Claim
       Regulation (EC) nº261/2004-Right of Access Request”. Its content does

       allusion to a claim presented by the complaining party in relation to
       the fact that he was denied boarding on a company flight, as well as,
       to the request to exercise their right of access.

    - Email from the address \*\*\*EMAIL.2, dated 12/30/2021, in which

       indicates that the previous email will be forwarded to the competent team for
       query, but that, due to the holiday period, the answer may
       be delayed.

    - Email from the address \*\*\*EMAIL.3, dated 03/18/2022, whose
       content is as follows:

    - Email from the complaining party, dated 03/18/2022, sent to the
       email address \*\*\*EMAIL.3 and \*\*\*EMAIL.4, in which he answers “here you have
       the receipt of the request by your team (…)”.

SECOND: In view of the reported events, on 04/21/2022 this Agency agreed
to the website \*\*\*URL.1, being verified that the privacy policy indicates

as contact address \*\*\*EMAIL.2. However, to “exercise any of its
rights in relation to the data that easyJet holds about you” a
specific form.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/19

In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, of
Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter

LOPDGDD), on 06/03/2022, said claim was transferred to EASYJET, so that
proceed to its analysis and inform this Agency within a period of one month, of the
actions carried out to adapt to the requirements provided for in the regulations of
Data Protection.

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the rules established in Law 39/2015, of

October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of Administrations
Public (hereinafter, LPACAP), was collected on 06/06/2022 as stated in the
acknowledgment of receipt that appears in the file.

THIRD: On 06/21/2022, in accordance with article 65 of the LOPDGDD,

The claim presented by the complaining party was admitted for processing.

FOURTH: On 07/05/2022, this Agency received a written response in the
which states the following:

“\[…\]

Second.- Notwithstanding the above and in relation to the content of your request, it has been
meaning that on the Easyjet website there is a specific form so that
Users can exercise the rights of the RGPD of access, information, rectification
and deletion, as shown below.

Likewise, the email address that is made available to the
users for any issue related to GDPR rights is the
following: \*\*\*EMAIL.2. (…).

Third.- However, as can be deduced from the information provided by the
complainant in its annex nº2 it seems that the emails requesting
access were sent to a different email, specifically to \*\*\*EMAIL.3, as well as to
customer service address: \*\*\*EMAIL.4.

On the other hand, in the communications sent to my client they have confused

claims related to the compensation required as a result of the
alleged denial of boarding suffered by the claimant together with the demand for
right of access to personal data, which is why it could have been altered
the system for handling this type of requests.

Fourth.- Having explained the above and regarding the questions raised to this part in
your request, we will answer them correlatively:

    1. (…) A request was received that was not clear and clarification was requested from the
       interested.

    2. (…) The claimant was asked to adequately inform what his
       specific request and see what specific element in your case you wanted to rectify
       to proceed accordingly.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/19

\[…\]”

FIFTH: On 03/09/2023, the Director of the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against EASYJET, in accordance with the
provided in articles 63 and 64 of the LPACAP, for the alleged violation of article
15 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

This initiation agreement, which was notified in accordance with the rules established in the
LPACAP through electronic notification, was collected by EASYJET on 03/16/2023.

SIXTH: On 03/30/2023, EASYJET presented a written document, in a timely manner, before
this Agency in which it stated the following:

“\[…\]

First.- That in this procedure an initial agreement has been issued by which
It is agreed to set an initial penalty of €20,000 as a result of the facts and
infringement contemplated therein.

Second.- That following the provisions of the initiation agreement and in accordance with the
provided in article 85 of LPACAP, this party shows its willingness to avail itself of
the 40% reduction in the amount of the penalty, showing express recognition
of compliance responsibility as well as the payment of the fine of

voluntarily, waiving the filing of any action or resource
administrative matter where applicable.

\[…\]”

SEVENTH: On 05/05/2023, EASYJET presented a new document to this Agency
in which he stated the following:

“\[…\]

Second.- Attention to the exercise of the Claimant's right of access

As can be seen from the schedule included in the previous Allegation, the Company
attended to the exercise of the Claimant's right of access on April 1, 2022,
sending you all the information about you that it kept in its systems,
as well as the information required by article 15 of the GDPR.

For these purposes, a copy of the email through the
which the corresponding response is sent to the Claimant, along with all the
information that is made available to you (see Annex I).

In accordance with the above, the Company is interested in highlighting that the request for
exercise of the right of access sent by the Complainant to the Company, was
attended to by the latter prior to receipt of the Information Request (15
June 2022) and, therefore, upon receipt of the Startup Agreement (March 17,
2023).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/19

Third.- Other considerations

Likewise, the Company is interested in highlighting that:

    (i) Although the claim was initially filed by the interested party on the day
           December 28, 2021, this only included in its penultimate paragraph a
           mention of the exercise of your right of access in accordance with the RGPD. Yes ok
           It is true that the Society treated the Complainant's message initially

           as a mere claim for damages and not as an exercise of rights
           of data protection, the Complainant also did not mention the
           exercise of his right in the subsequent conversations he had with
           the Company's customer service team. In fact, he didn't do it again.
           reference to the exercise of your right of access until March 17,

           2021, when he demanded payment of the compensation that had been awarded to him
           presumably recognized by AESA.

    (i) Throughout the management of the exercise of the Claimant's right of access,
           the Company, as can be seen from the emails exchanged between
           the Company and the Claimant, a copy of which is attached as Annex I, has

           received, from the Claimant, a multitude of warnings about the
           initiation of legal action, including a mention of the possibility of
           desist from them if he receives payment of the amounts claimed.
           In the opinion of the Society, these messages and the lack of cooperation by
           part of the Complainant when the data protection team of the

           Society contacted him to address his right, denote a
           little concern about this matter, and it can be concluded that his
           exclusive intention was the collection of the economic amounts claimed,
           nothing related to the protection of their fundamental right to
           Data Protection.

    (ii) Once the claimant's claim is received on March 17, 2021,
           The Company contacted him on two occasions (17 and 22
           March 2021) to apologize for the delay in responding to your
           Exercise of the right of access. Along with apologies, the team

           Data Protection Company attempted to confirm with the Complainant his
           claim to exercise the right of access, clarify the scope of its
           request, ask if you wish to exercise any other rights, and
           notify you that your management was being processed, since, from the request
           initial exercise of the right of access included within the writing of

           damage claim, the extent of the damage was not clear with certainty.
           same.

    (iii) On April 1, 2021, only 9 business days after receiving the

           confirmation by the Claimant of his desire to exercise his right to
           access and receive all the data that the Company maintains in its
           systems, it attended to said right and transferred the requested information
           (see attached Annexes I and II).

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of article 4.1 of the RGPD, there is
the processing of personal data, since EASYJET carries out the
collection and conservation of, among others, the following personal data: name and
surnames

EASYJET carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller, given

                                 Allegations alleged

In relation to the allegations alleged to the agreement at the beginning of this
sanctioning procedure, we proceed to respond to them.

EASYJET claims to have responded to the complaining party on 04/01/2022

Sending you all the personal information that appears in their systems and the necessary information
to address the right in question. It emphasizes that the access request was attended to

of access.

In this regard, this Agency wishes to point out that article 12.3 of the RGPD grants the
responsible for the treatment one month from receiving the access request to give
response to the right exercised, without prejudice to the fact that it may be extended for another two
months if necessary, and the interested party must be informed of this. However, in the

complaining party until 04/01/2022, almost four months after there was

submitted your application on 12/28/2021.

Although it is true that on 12/30/2021 EASYJET responded to the email from the
complaining party in which it exercised its right of access, it is no less true that the
entity limited itself to giving him a generic response in which it confirmed receipt of the

email and that it would be forwarded to the corresponding team for consultation. So that,
As already indicated in the agreement to initiate this sanctioning procedure,
It is evident that it was not possible for the complaining party to access their data
nor was an adequate response provided until April.

EASYJET alleges that it has received a multitude of warnings from the complaining party regarding

the initiation of legal actions, including a mention of the possibility of withdrawing
of the same if he received payment of the amounts claimed in relation to the
denial to board a company flight.

In this regard, this Agency wishes to point out that it is not competent to resolve issues

that are not related to the matter of protection of personal data.

                                  Right of access

Article 15 “Right of access of the interested party” of the GDPR establishes:

"1. The interested party will have the right to obtain from the data controller
confirmation of whether or not personal data that concerns you are being processed and, as such
case, right of access to personal data and the following information:

    c) if possible, the expected period of conservation of the personal data or, if possible,
        If not possible, the criteria used to determine this period;

    d) the existence of the right to request rectification or deletion from the person responsible
        of personal data or the limitation of the processing of personal data
        relating to the interested party, or to oppose said treatment;

        available information about its origin;

    g) the existence of automated decisions, including profiling, to

        foreseen consequences of said processing for the interested party.

2. When personal data is transferred to a third country or to an organization
international, the interested party will have the right to be informed of the guarantees
appropriate under Article 46 relating to transfer.

3. The person responsible for the treatment will provide a copy of the personal data subject to

4. The right to obtain a copy mentioned in section 3 will not negatively affect

For its part, article 13 “Right of access” of the LOPDGDD provides that:

"1. The right of access of the affected person will be exercised in accordance with the provisions of the
article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

When the person responsible processes a large amount of data related to the affected person and this

data, the person responsible may request, before providing the information, that the affected person
specify the data or processing activities to which the request refers.

2. The right of access will be understood to be granted if the person responsible for the treatment

will provide the affected person with a remote, direct and secure access system to the data

effects, the communication by the person responsible to the affected party of the way in which the latter may

right.

However, the interested party may request from the person responsible the information regarding the
extremes provided for in article 15.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that are not
included in the remote access system.

3. For the purposes established in article 12.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

4. When the affected person chooses a means other than the one offered that entails a cost
disproportionate, the request will be considered excessive, so said affected person
will assume the excess costs that its choice entails. In this case, it will only be

the person responsible for the treatment is required to satisfy the right of access without
undue delays.”

In the present case, it is clear that the complaining party requested EASYJET access to
your personal data, on 12/28/2021, via email sent to
the addresses \*\*\*EMAIL.2 and \*\*\*EMAIL.5. Not only did it indicate in the subject of the email

“Complaint Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004-Request Right of Access” (the
emphasis is from the Agency), but also, at the end of the content, it says
textually “that this writing serves as a formal request for the purposes of the
General Data Protection Regulation or data protection regulations
corresponding, for the exercise of my right of access to all data relating

to my person in the hands of Easyjet.” In this sense, the electronic address to which
directed by the complaining party is one of the means that EASYJET makes available to
those affected to exercise their GDPR rights, along with a form
request specific. This is stated in the privacy policy of their website.
(\*\*\*URL.2).

For its part, EASYJET limited itself to sending you a generic response on 12/30/2021 in the
confirming receipt of your email and that it would be forwarded to the team
corresponding for your consultation. However, after the complaining party
communicate its intention to the claimed entity to file a claim with
this Agency in the absence of a response to your access request, on 03/17/2022, one day

Later, EASYJET responded indicating that it had not received the access request and
asking him to clarify his original request. It was not until 04/01/2022 when
EASYJET gave the complaining party access to the requested information.

In accordance with the evidence available at this time

proposed resolution of sanctioning procedure, it is considered that the facts
known could constitute an infringement, attributable to EASYJET, for
violation of article 15 of the RGPD.

                 Classification of the violation of article 15 of the GDPR

If confirmed, the aforementioned violation of article 15 of the RGPD could mean the
commission of the infraction classified in article 83.5.b) of the RGPD that under the rubric
“General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines” provides:

“Infringements of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20 000 000 or,

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72.1 “Infringements considered very

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

They have the power to impose an administrative fine in accordance with the
article 83 of the RGPD -article 58.2 i)-, or the power to order the person responsible or
processor that the processing operations comply with the
provisions of the GDPR, where applicable, in a certain manner and within a

specified period -article 58.2 d)-.

According to the provisions of article 83.2 of the GDPR, the measure provided for in article 58.2
d) of the aforementioned Regulation is compatible with the sanction consisting of a fine
administrative.

In the present case, taking into account the facts presented and without prejudice to what
results from the instruction of the procedure, it is considered that the sanction that
It would be appropriate to impose an administrative fine. The fine imposed must

a) the nature, severity and duration of the infringement, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as
such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that

have suffered;

b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

c) any measure taken by the person responsible or in charge of the treatment to
alleviate the damages and losses suffered by the interested parties;

d) the degree of responsibility of the person responsible or in charge of the treatment,
taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have been applied under
of articles 25 and 32;

e) any previous infringement committed by the controller or processor;

f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the
infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement;

certification approved in accordance with article 42,

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,
such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct or
indirectly, through infringement.”

For its part, in relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, in

its article 76, “Sanctions and corrective measures”, provides:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 will be applied taking into account the graduation criteria
established in section 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

c) The benefits obtained as a consequence of the commission of the infraction.

g) Have, when not mandatory, a data protection delegate.

h) The submission by the person responsible or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to
alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which

"There are disputes between those and any interested party."

These are aggravating circumstances:

    - The duration of the infringement (article 83.2.a) of the RGPD): However, and all

       once this aggravating circumstance was taken into account in the initial agreement
       of this sanctioning procedure due to EASYJET not having responded to the
       right of access, it is considered that the severity of the same is diminished
       when the attention of the right exercised by the complaining party is proven, if
       Well this took place almost four months after the deadline established in the
       regulations in force.

    - The linking of the offender's activity with the performance of treatment
       personal data (article 76.2.b) of the LOPDGDD): EASYJET is an entity
       that processes personal data systematically and continuously
       and that it must take extreme care in fulfilling its obligations in

       data protection matters.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated allows us to establish as an initial assessment a
fine of €10,000 (ten thousand euros) for violating article 15 of the RGPD.

In view of the above, the following is issued:
