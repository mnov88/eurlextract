## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject made an access request to an educational institution, asking for course programs, statistical data of the grades and number of students, information about how disproportionate results were corrected, a copy of their son past and future exams, as well as any works done by him, and a copy of the measures that have been implemented to help low-grades students overcome their difficulties.

When not complied with the petitioned, the data subject lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) that was dismissed, that gave rise to an administrative appeal.

The school argued that most of the request data were not personal data and were therefore not included in Article 15 GDPR. They claimed that such data (educational data) were regulated by different norms. They also remarked that the responsible for the students had met the data subject and shown them the exams and gave the appropriate explanations, according to the norms regulating the matter.

The claimant brought forward the [CJEU Nowak ruling](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=198059&text=&doclang=EN&pageIndex=0&cid=8338348), asking for a copy of the exams and other examinations, as well as psycho-pedagogic reports and psychometric tests, including teacher's reports.

### Holding

The AEPD noted that the right to access from the GDPR was different from the right to access to the educational record, that is regulated by a different norm, and that is also different from rights such as public transparency.

The authority recognized, anyway, that according to the CJEU case law, exams and examinations are considered personal data, and therefore the data subject has the right to access them and obtain a copy.

However, the AEPD held that the access request had not been made following the appropriate channel, as it has been made through an access to the educational record, and not as a GDPR access request. The AEPD therefore compelled the data subject to first make an access request through the educational institution's DPO, and to lodge a complaint if, once made, it was not properly answered.

The AEPD also remarked that, when lodging such complaint, it should be accompanied by a copy of the access request and by the documentation providing justification about the legitimacy to represent the actual data subject (the son of the complainant).

FIFTH: The exercise of the right of access, like the rest of the rights, is
a very personal right, consists of the right of the citizen to obtain

information about the treatment that is being made of your data, the possibility of
obtain a copy of the personal data that concerns you and that is being
object of treatment, as well as information, in particular, on the purposes of the
treatment, the categories of data, the recipients, the possible assignments, the term
planned conservation, the possibility of exercising other rights, the information

available on the origin of the data (if these have not been obtained directly from

without affecting third party data.

In the specific case, the complaining party has requested copies of documents
related to their children's school records and a copy of certain

documentation and information related to educational processes and activity
teacher.

Examining the documentation in the file, it is observed that the claim
of the complaining party is to obtain copies of documents, in this regard we must

point out that, in accordance with data protection regulations, the party
claimant can only request their own personal data, or of those persons
whose representation is, in particular, said documents may contain other
data that do not constitute personal data of the claimant.

The right of access is the right that those interested have to know what data
are being treated by public administrations or the Body
administrative responsible for the treatment, the data object of the treatment, the
purpose of this, the origin of the data and if they have or will be communicated to third parties.

The right of access is independent of the right of access to public information

that regulates Law 19/2013, of December 9, on transparency, access to
public information and good governance. It is also independent of the right of access
to documentation in an administrative procedure, regulated by Law 39/2015, of
October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the administrations
Public (LPACAP) or access to documents that are part of a file

school, except for those documents that contain health data, which enables the
obtaining them based on data protection regulations in correlation
with the Patient Autonomy Law (LAP)

Furthermore, it is observed that, in the various requests made by the
complaining party, no mention is made or the right of access to data is requested
personal data of your children with the prescriptive requirements in the RGPD, in its article 15

"Right of access of the interested party" regarding the processing of personal data
related to the person in charge, but rather to obtaining the documents of a
school record, which has its own regulations for obtaining said
documentation.

As recognized by the jurisprudence of the CJEU, access to copies of the examinations

if they are part of the content of the right of access to personal data,
However, as has already been said, the request was made by accessing the
educational record and not as one of the rights recognized in the RGPD, for
Therefore, the complaining party may make the request addressed to the Delegate for the Protection of
Data, using the means made available by the person in charge for the exercise

of the rights recognized in the RGPD, and the receipt of
requests through other contact channels other than those expressly
planned.

The rights may be exercised directly or through a legal representative or
voluntary. The supporting documentation must necessarily be provided that the

affected has expressly authorized the applicant to exercise on his behalf the
Rights.

When you cannot get your rights to be taken care of and you want the intervention of this
Agency shall, once the period of one month from receipt of the

request, file a new claim, providing a copy of the request
processed by a means that allows proof of shipment and, if possible, receipt

In relation to the guide of this Agency on the exercise of the right of access to

personal data, which implies, among others, the right to obtain a copy of
These, in this regard it should be noted that, refers to the provision of a copy of the data
that are subject to treatment and those data that are related to your
person, but not to obtain a copy of specific documents, except those already
specified ups above.

The rest of the questions raised by the parties do not result from the competence of
this Agency, having to settle and resolve by the corresponding instances.
