## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that the defendant had unauthorizedly used a picture of his/her wedding (taken by a third party) in order to make promotion and advertising of its business.

### Dispute

The defendant did not answer the AEPD investigation requests, so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that the defendant has infringed the lawfulness principle included at Article 6 GDPR, as it has processed the personal data of the Spanish citizen without his/her consent. Consequently, after considering some circumstances \[(i) there is an unintended negligent conduct by the defendant, and (ii) basic personal data are affected\], the AEPD decided to impose a fine of 4,000 € to the defendant.
