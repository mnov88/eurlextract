## English Summary

### Facts

On 26 October 2021, the data subject asked BBVA Bank (the controller) for an account holder attestation through the bank app. Instead, they received another customer's contract with their name, surname, ID number, home address, and IBAN number.

The data subject communicated the incident to the controller and manifested their concern for the protection of their own personal data. The bank representative apologised and stated that it was due to an “operational error” and that the data subject’s rights were protected. However, the data subject manifested that they still had access to the third-party's document through the chat. The controller's employee answered that technically it was not possible to delete or retrieve the submission of that document. Consequently, the data subject submitted a complaint before the Spanish DPA against the controller for having access to a third-party contract instead of the requested document.

The DPA started an investigation and notified the controller, who claimed that the chat tool was a secure channel for communications (a log-in mechanism), which allowed access to the chat history, ensuring transparency and traceability of operations. It also manifested that the bank clerk had made an isolated human error and that the controller requested the data subject to delete the document. The controller informed the data subject about the prohibition of its disclosure, reproduction, or distribution. Additionally, the controller eliminated access to the content via the link provided, therefore, additional downloads of the document were not possible.

### Holding

Firstly, the Spanish DPA analysed the reaction of the controller to the confidentiality data breach. It observed that the occurence of a data breach does not automatically suppose the imposition of a fine, but requires an analysis of the due diligence and security measures applied by the controller.

Secondly, the DPA highlighted the importance of complying with GDPR provisions regarding personal data integrity and confidentiality, [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"), and the security of processing, foreseen in [Article 32 GDPR.](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") The DPA found a violation of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") and considered as an aggravating circumstance the level of responsibility of the controller regarding its technical and organisational measures applied, as required by [Articles 25](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR "Article 25 GDPR") and [32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). In this case, the controller had to implement adequate measures to avoid the exposition of personal data to non-authorised third parties. In addition, the security breach was not corrected until February 2022 (lasting for 4 months), which showed that appropriate measures were lacking. The DPA also found a violation of [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). At the time of the data breach, the controller did not have appropriate technical and organisational measures to avoid the incident of disclosing personal data through the link, which was supposed to contain the data subject documentation.

Finally, the DPA fined the controller €50,000 for the violation of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and €30,000 for the violation of [Article 32 GDPR.](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") According to the national legislation ([Article 76(2)(b) LOPDGDD](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673)on sanctions and corrective measures), the DPA considered as an aggravating circumstance the controller's high number of data processing activities. According to the DPA, a bank should have enough experience in personal data handling and should have adequate knowledge regarding personal data processing. However, the controller benefited from two reductions of this amount, voluntary payment and the admission of guilt, and ended up paying €64,000 for both violations.

As aggravating factors:
           -The linking of the offender's activity with the performance of
           processing of personal data. (Art. 76.2.b).

           The activity of BBVA, a financial institution, and the high number of customers

nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and

appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which may include, among others:
       a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
       b) the ability to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;

       c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data
       quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
       d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness
       technical and organizational measures to guarantee the safety of the
       treatment.

2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration will be given to
take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data
personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or
unauthorized access to such data.

3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct pursuant to article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element

the Union or of the Member States.

In the present case, at the time the breach occurred, BBVA did not have
appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent the occurrence of the
circumstance of making available to a person a link that gave access to the
contract of a third party, thus exposing the client's personal data from the
October 21, 2021 through at least February 16, 2022.
