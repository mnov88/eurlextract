## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a sanction procedure started by the AEPD against the defendant due to a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen (the claimant), stating that two websites of the defendant did not comply with the data protection legislation.

### Dispute

After the pleadings by the defendant in order to declare that, as soon as it received the claim, it proceeded to amend the situation, the AEPD carried out the corresponding investigation over the websites and proved that: (i) as per first website, the cookies banner at the first layer provides unprecise information, and the second layer only provides generic information on cookies, but not specific information on the identity or time of the own cookies., (ii) as per the second website, the cookies banner at the first layer provides unprecise information, it does not allow the possibility to access the cookies policy without accepting such cookies, and (once the banner disappears) there is no direct link to the cookies policy anywhere, except from two slight mentions at the privacy policy and legal warning. The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Without prejudice to the results of the final investigations corresponding to the sanction procedure, the AEPD understood that the defendant could have breached Article 22(2) LSSI: there is no identification of the data controller, there is no possibility to give a separate consent for each purpose, and there is not enough information on cookies. Consequently, after considering some aggravating and mitigating circumstances \[(i) culpability by the defendant, (ii) period of time in which the infringements have been happening, (iii) collaboration by the defendant, that has almost amended the situation (at least, regarding the privacy policy)\], the AEPD understood that, in case the sanction procedure resulted in a successful decision, this infringement would be fined with 2,000 € to the defendant. In this sense, the AEPD offered the defendant the possibility to settle the issue before the decision takes place by agreeing to a voluntary payment of part of the fine with two possible discounts: (i) acknowledging of its liability (1,600 €) and early voluntary payment (1,200 €). The defendant agreed to the early voluntary payment (but it did not acknowledge its liability), so it paid 1,600 € and the sanction procedure was closed by the AEPD.
