## English Summary

### Facts

On 17 February 2022, Vodafone España, S.A.U (the controller), provided a duplicate of the data subject's SIM card to a third party who committed identity theft. The controller provided the SIM card without verifying the identity of said third party. By using the fraudulent SIM card, the third party accessed the bank account of the data subject's husband and made a transfer of an undisclosed amount. The data subject found out about the identity theft after receiving an SMS informing of the controller corroborating the correct activation of the new SIM card. Later on, the controller's fraud department contacted the data subject and proceeded to block the fraudulent SIM card. The data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA regarding this incident.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA held that the controller had no valid legal basis for duplicating the data subject's SIM card without their consent and without verifying the identity of the requesting third party. It also recalled Recital 40 GDPR, which emphasises that each data processing must be based on consent or another legitimate legal basis. Hence, the DPA concluded that the controller violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). The DPA questioned the due diligence of the controller in preventing fraud during SIM card replacement procedures.

The DPA considered the controller's infringement of [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") as “very serious” and imposed a €70,000 fine. The DPA took into account aggravating circumstances, such as the link between the controller's business activity and the processing of personal data of customers or third parties on a large scale. The DPA considered as a mitigating circumstance the timely handling and resolution of the incident by the controller.

The controller benefited from a Spanish administrative law provision, which allows for lowering the final amount of the fine, by voluntarily paying €56,000 in order to terminate the proceedings. The controller refused the DPA's offer of admission of guilt, which would have further reduced the amount of the fine to €42,000.

to the following

                                  BACKGROUND

FIRST: On September 23, 2022, the Director of the Spanish Agency
of Data Protection agreed to start a sanctioning procedure against VODAFONE
SPAIN, S.A. (hereinafter, the claimed party), through the Agreement that

            AGREEMENT TO START THE SANCTION PROCEDURE

Of the actions carried out by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and in

based on the following:

                                      FACTS

FIRST: Ms. A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claiming party) dated March 7,
2022 filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
claim is directed against VODAFONE ESPAÑA, S.A.U. with NIF A80907397 (in
forward, the claimed party or Vodafone). The reasons on which the claim is based
are the following:

The claimant states that on February 17, 2022, the entity claimed, without its
authorization, you provided a duplicate of your SIM card to a third party. He had knowledge of
the facts, after receiving an SMS from said entity informing them of the successful activation
of your new SIM.

Later he receives a call from the fraud department indicating that they had
detected a duplication of the suspicious SIM card and, after confirming the claimant
that she had not requested it, the new SIM card was blocked,
keeping the old one active.

On the other hand, it states that said third party, using the information contained in the
mobile phone, accessed her husband's bank account and made a transfer
through BIZUM for a value of X.XXX euros.

Along with the notification, the following relevant documentation is provided:

Screenshot of the SMS received regarding the activation of the SIM card.

Copy of the telephone bill showing a charge for the disputed duplicate

of the SIM card.

Complaint filed with the Ertzain-etxea of \*\*\*LOCALIDAD.1, on the 18th of
February 2022.

Claim filed with the bank, details of the movements

Complaint filed with the Kontsumobide-Basque Consumer Institute against
Vodafone.

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
forward LOPDGDD), said claim was transferred to the claimed party, for
to proceed with its analysis and inform this Agency within a month of the
actions carried out to adapt to the requirements established in the regulations of

Data Protection.

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of
October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Administrations
Public (hereinafter, LPACAP), was collected on April 26, 2022 as

It appears in the acknowledgment of receipt that is in the file.

On May 13, 2022, this Agency received a written response from
Vodafone stating the following: "A letter has been sent to the
claimant by means of which he has proceeded to inform him about the steps that
were carried out by Vodafone to solve the incident and that it was

is currently resolved.

In this sense, attached as Document number 1, a copy of said letter sent
to the claimant, through which she is informed, in particular, of the privacy policies
security available to Vodafone to prevent the making of duplicates of

SIM card and that what happened has been classified as fraud by the Department
Vodafone Fraud.

In addition, you are informed that you regained full control over the affected line on
same day February 17, 2022 and that the amount of 5 euros was reimbursed
that were charged as a result of the realization of the duplicate SIM in
question.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/13

After analyzing the claim and investigating what happened, Vodafone has been able to verify
that, on February 17, 2022, a SIM change was processed on the line
\*\*\*PHONE.1, associated with customer ID \*\*\*ID.1 belonging to the claimant.

Said SIM change was requested by telephone.

My client managed to solve the incident that is the object of the claim effectively
and completely on February 17, 2022, that is, prior to the receipt of the
present request for information by the Agency.

In order to prevent similar incidents from occurring, Vodafone works
continues to improve Security Policies for its change processes and
SIM duplicates as well as for any other process that carries potential risks

of fraud or irregular actions for our clients.

In this sense, since March 14, 2012, Vodafone acts under the Policy
Security for the Contracting of Individuals, which has been updated
progressively, and whose last modification has been implemented on the 4th of
January 2022. Through said Security Policy, my client establishes what
type of information must be required from the client for each requested management.

Likewise, it is included how to proceed in case a user does not pass the
Security Policy, as well as preventive actions in fraud situations.
The aforementioned Security Policy is mandatory for all
Vodafone After-Sales Services, who are in charge of applying and respecting it.

Attached as Document number 4 is a copy of the Security Policy for
Vodafone individuals. As far as SIM card duplicates are concerned, it should be

indicate that Vodafone's objective is that all duplicate or card changes
be done in person, since it is the safest way to guarantee that
produce irregular or fraudulent processes.

Likewise, with regard to the processing of a duplicate SIM, in accordance with
with said Policies, and as was already exposed before the Agency within the

File E/11418/2019, to make a SIM change by telephone, it is
necessary to carry out and overcome the Vodafone Security Policy in order to
such scenarios. Said Policy foresees three specific scenarios for which
The change of SIM card will proceed by telephone: (i) in those cases in which
that the platform in charge of managing the change of the SIM card fails in such a way
so that the SIM change cannot be made in our stores; (ii) if the client is

company and therefore prefers to make the change from the platform \*\*\*PLATAFORMA.1,
In these cases, the SIM card is sent to the address of the company that appears in
our systems; and (iii) if the customer is prepaid and therefore the shipment can be made
of the SIM card in cases of breakdown, loss/theft, incidence in the store and for
Clients petition.

Likewise, and prior to verifying whether the applicant is under
the scope of the three previous cases, the Customer Service Department of
Vodafone, in accordance with said Security Policy, must invite you to attend
to manage the change of SIM before a Vodafone After-Sales Service (“SPV”) to
give the maximum guarantee of security to the process. In case the client is
find yourself in one of the three scenarios considered above, the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/13

Vodafone Customer Service Department will check prior to
SIM change management that none of the following circumstances exist:
(i) there must not be any change of address in the last month; (ii) there must not have been

requested previous SIM card shipments. It can be said that, in accordance with
our Security Policies, non-compliance with any of the two
above requirements will lead to the need to process the change of SIM in a
in person in our stores. In those cases in which the applicant complies with
the requirements of the previous paragraphs, the processing of the SIM change will depend
of the following: (i) if the applicant calls from the same number on which he is going to

request the change of SIM you will be asked for the access code of the Customer Service
Client or ID; however, (ii) if the client does not call from the same number,
will request the telephone number associated with the SIM (“MSISDN”) together with the password
access to Customer Service or DNI.

Additionally, it should be noted that all employees in the Department of
Customer Service have received training on the steps to follow to carry out

SIM changes, through the guide available to all agents on the portal
called "REDPLANET", which includes all the processes and procedures
of Vodafone that are applicable to them and the steps to follow in each case, according to the
circumstances.

Therefore, if the processing of a SIM change and/or a change of ownership exceeds

the previous Vodafone Security Policies, we will proceed to carry out
such procedures in accordance with what is indicated in said Policies, when considering my
represented the change as authentic, real and truthful. Without prejudice of the previous,
since February 17, 2022, my client carried out the procedures
in order to protect the claimant as a Vodafone customer. In this
sense, my client, at the request of the interested party, proceeded to declare what happened

as a fraud, adopting the appropriate security measures on your account, and
to solve the different incidents that occurred with respect to the SIM card of the
line \*\*\*PHONE.1 affected.

As a consequence of the classification of the facts as fraudulent by part of
Vodafone and in order to prevent future fraudulent practices on the

services associated with the claimant, my client proceeded, on February 17
of 2022, to be noted in the claimant's client file that only
make modifications, sim changes, new registrations, portability and orders if the
The interlocutor calls from the line associated with the claimant and manages to exceed an additional
process of reinforced security measures on your client ID.

In addition, internal processes are being reviewed to ensure compliance with the

Defined Security Policies or introduce the necessary changes when
consider pertinent.

Specifically, my client is working on the continuous improvement of: • Review of
internal processes to ensure compliance with Security Policies and
verification controls that have been defined and incorporated, both in channel
face-to-face and by telephone, for duplicate SIM scenarios.

• Periodic reinforcement of communication of Security Policies and verifications
that have been defined by Vodafone for SIM duplicates and that must be
applied by agencies, commercial stores and agents.
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/13

• Sending periodic communications to the face-to-face and telephone channel, as well as to the
logistics operator, where it is alerted to the risk scenarios detected, its
characteristics and behavior patterns to prevent new cases. In these

communications include details of how these requests are produced, channels to
through which they are requested, documentation they provide, description of the
handling, geographic areas where the cards are being collected/delivered
Duplicate SIMs.

• Application -if applicable-, of the existing Penalty Policy for agents or
distributors who carry out any duplicate or change of a SIM card without having

required documentation or to carry out any SIM change management without
Follow all the steps defined in the Security Policy.

Regarding the carrying out of transactions of the entity "BIZUM" of
fraudulent nature revealed by the claimant in her claim, it is
opportune to express that the change of a SIM card only implies access to the
telephone line associated with it, and not the bank details of the holder.

Therefore, it does not seem possible that there is a correlation between the events that occurred in
relationship with my client and what happened with the bank of which he is a client
the claimant. In this sense, the bank movements that he alleges in his
claim do not have their origin, nor have they been caused by invoices for
Vodafone services that he had contracted, but are due to accesses
made through your bank account. Therefore, Vodafone cannot

be responsible for the accesses and banking movements that could have been
made fraudulently.

With all this, we can confirm that currently my client has carried out
all pertinent actions to resolve the claim, estimating that
has been correctly resolved prior to the receipt of this

written. Attached, as Document number 5, report of the investigations
internal actions carried out by Vodafone to solve this incident”.

THIRD: On May 30, 2022, in accordance with article 65 of the
LOPDGDD, the claim presented by the claimant party was admitted for processing.

                           FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

                                           Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each

control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "Procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/13

regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

                                            II

The defendant is accused of committing an infraction for violation of article 6
of the RGPD, "Legacy of the treatment", which indicates in its section 1 the assumptions in which
that the processing of data by third parties is considered lawful:

"1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following is fulfilled
conditions:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;
c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;

d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another

Physical person;

e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller;

f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said
interests do not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the

interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child. The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply.
application to processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their
functions”.

 The infringement is typified in article 83.5 of the GDPR, which considers as such:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 EUR or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9.”

The Organic Law 3/2018, of Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious” provides:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/13

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (U.E.) 2016/679,
are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the

following:

(…)

a) The processing of personal data without the fulfillment of any of the conditions
of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

                                               II

In the present case, it is proven that Vodafone provided a duplicate of the card
SIM of the claiming party to a third party, without their consent and without verifying the

identity of said third party, which has accessed information contained in the phone
mobile, such as bank details, passwords, email address and others
personal data associated with the terminal. Thus, the defendant did not verify the
personality of the person who requested the duplicate SIM card, did not take precautions
necessary for these events not to occur.

Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, the
diligence used by the defendant to identify the person who requested
a duplicate SIM card.

Well, it is accredited as recognized by the claimed party in its writ of
response to this Agency dated May 13, 2022, <<that after analyzing the
claim and investigate what happened, Vodafone has been able to verify that, as of

February 17, 2022, a SIM change was processed on the line \*\*\*TELEPHONE.1,
associated with the customer ID \*\*\*ID.1 belonging to the claimant.

Said SIM change was requested by telephone.

My client managed to solve the incident that is the object of the claim effectively
and completely on February 17, 2022, that is, prior to the receipt of the
present request for information by the Agency>>.

In accordance with the evidence available at this procedural moment and
without prejudice to what results from the investigation of the procedure, it is estimated that the
conduct of the claimed party could violate article 6.1 of the GDPR and may be
constituting the offense classified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned Regulation
2016/679.

In this sense, Recital 40 of the GDPR states:

"(40) For processing to be lawful, personal data must be processed with the
consent of the interested party or on some other legitimate basis established in accordance
a Law, either in this Regulation or under other Union law
or of the Member States referred to in this Regulation, including the
the need to comply with the legal obligation applicable to the data controller or the

need to execute a contract to which the interested party is a party or for the purpose of

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/13

take measures at the request of the interested party prior to the conclusion of a
contract."

                                              IV.

The determination of the sanction that should be imposed in the present case requires

observe the provisions of articles 83.1 and 2 of the GDPR, precepts that,
respectively, provide the following:

"1. Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
administrative proceedings under this article for violations of this

mind, through infraction.”

 Within this section, the LOPDGDD contemplates in its article 76, entitled "Sancio-

and corrective measures”:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of the Regulation
(UE) 2016/679 will be applied taking into account the graduation criteria
established in section 2 of said article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
may also be taken into account:

a) The continuing nature of the offence.

b) The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of data processing.

personal information.

c) The benefits obtained as a consequence of the commission of the infraction.

d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have led to the commission
of the offence.

e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the
violation, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.

f) The affectation of the rights of minors.

g) Have, when it is not mandatory, a data protection delegate.

h) Submission by the person responsible or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to
alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which
there are controversies between those and any interested party.

3. It will be possible, complementary or alternatively, the adoption, when appropriate, of
the remaining corrective measures referred to in article 83.2 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.”

In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the fine to

impose on the entity claimed as responsible for an infringement classified in the
article 83.5.a) of the GDPR and 72.1 b) of the LOPDGDD, in an initial assessment,
The following factors are considered concurrent in this case:

As aggravating factors:

- The evident link between the business activity of the defendant and the
      treatment of personal data of clients or third parties (article 83.2.k, of the
      GDPR in relation to article 76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD).

      The Judgment of the National Court of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006), in which,
      with respect to entities whose activity entails the continuous processing of
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/13

      customer data, indicates that "...the Supreme Court has understood that
      recklessness exists whenever a legal duty of care is neglected, that is
      that is, when the offender does not behave with the required diligence. And in the

      assessment of the degree of diligence, special consideration must be given to the
      professionalism or not of the subject, and there is no doubt that, in the case now
      examined, when the appellant's activity is constant and abundant
      handling of personal data must insist on rigor and exquisite
      Be careful to comply with the legal provisions in this regard.”

As mitigations:

The claimed party proceeded to resolve the incident that is the subject of the claim
effective and in full on February 17, 2022 as soon as it became aware of the
facts (art. 83.2 c).

It is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed on the defendant and set it at the amount of 70,000
€ for the alleged violation of article 6.1) typified in article 83.5.a) of the
