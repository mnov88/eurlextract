## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint filed by a Spanish citizen (the claimant) stating that at her workplace (nursery school) there are cameras inside the rooms recording the children. Their parents/tutors get access to those cameras through an App provided by the School, so they can observe, listen, record and take pictures of the children. The school provides all of the parents/tutors with a password (same password for everyone) and they can watch through this App any of the children inside of the rooms.

According to the claimant, she has never given her consent regarding the recordings and there are not any signs in place warning about the rooms being a video-recorded zone.

### Dispute

The work contrat between the nursery school and the claimant states the existence of the cameras but does not specify which is the purpose of the recording, and therefore, of the data processing.

Are the requirements of the Article 13 GDPR satisfied in that case?

### Holding

The AEDP held, that the contractual clause in the work contract informing about the existence of cameras does not specify neither the purpose of the processing, nor where are being storaged the images of the claimant. Therefore, the AEPD has imposed a warning to the nursery school, requiring them to add a specific clause in the upcoming work contracts, by which all of the requirements of the Article 13 GDPR are satisfied. Furthermore, the AEPD has also recommended setting up an individual password for each of the parents/tutors.

5/11Along with the registration of treatment activities, it is necessary to carry out abrief reflection. The level of risk that the data processing per-sonal (in this case, the capture or recording of images of natural persons), im-plican for those affected (parents, students and teachers).It is recommended that the result of the risk analysis be in writing.IIIIn the present case, we proceed to examine the claim dated 01/23/20 by means ofgave from which the following is briefly transferred as the main fact:“… There are cameras located inside the classrooms where thechildren. They have not requested your consent to carry out such recordings,considering the measure threatening their right to privacy; and there is noinformative posters of the installation of cameras ” (folio nº 1).The facts are therefore specified in the presence of a device (s) in thethe interior of the classroom where the complainant teaches, without, according tohas informed about the use of the images, nor has it been requested by theconsent, affecting your personal intimacy and privacy (folio nº 1).As a first question, it is necessary to analyze "the absence of an informative poster" toIn this regard, it should be noted that the denounced entity provides documentary evidence thatcertifies the presence of informational poster (s) inside the classroom (s), indicating thatIt is a video-monitored area, so it complies with the provisions of theArticle 22.4 LOPDGDD (LO 3/2018, December 5).The presence of video surveillance cameras is not something alien today,There are cameras in shopping centers, in small establishments or in Centerseducational, obeying in principle the presence of the same to a purpose offacility security.However, this type of device is fulfilling in Centers for minorsor nurseries, a different purpose such as to facilitate the possibility for parents (guardians)to share the child's adaptation to their new school environment, allowing them to beparticipate in this first contact with the educational system.This, however, may entail a certain collision with the rights of theemployees, who feel subject to permanent observation, including in theirteaching work, other fundamental rights come into play (art. 18 CE), with thelogical concern of the fear of being the object of recording, as well as the fate that inyour case will be given to them.This is related to the second question reported, relating to the lack ofinformation on the purpose of the treatment of the images (data) that where appropriateare obtained.A copy of the contract signed by the complainant is provided by the denounced party.you, where you are informed in one of the clauses "Attitude of staff towards work"C / Jorge Juan, 6www.aepd.es28001 - Madridsedeagpd.gob.es

7/1112. in the event of further processing for a different purpose, you must first entertrain you on that other purpose with the relevant additional information.If the clause of the contract provided in it is read, theembodies the following:“Each classroom is equipped with a webcam to which the parents ofthe children of the group and the management of the Center. The cameras are orientedform that they only collect the image of the area where the children develop theireducational activities, at no time is observed through the same areaschange and toilet "Therefore, the provided contract clause does not determine what they will be treated for.two data, where the images obtained from the employee of theCenter.The obligation to inform must be fulfilled without the need for an al-guno, and the person in charge must be able to prove later that he has fulfilledcha obligation.So that any employee of the Center, whose personal data istreaties, must be able to know the purposes of their treatment, in a waythat is understandable to him, the set of rights that he may exercise (art.15-22 RGPD) or the conservation criteria thereof as an example.The employer (entrepreneur) can install video surveillance cameras limit-based on the purposes set forth in the Workers' Statute since it attributesto the entrepreneur the power of management, which allows him to "adopt the measuresmost opportune surveillance and control measures to verify compliance by thejador of their obligations and labor duties ”.The employer must strictly respect the principle of proportionality , it isthat is, video surveillance cameras will be installed when there are no other measuresmore suitable, they will only record essential spaces to satisfy the finallabor control and will not be used for purposes other than those of the control itselflabor.In this case, we are dealing with the installation of a webcam in the classroom of thecomplainant, it does not obey a labor control purpose, but rather an objective of theThe “educational” policy of the Center, consisting of facilitating access to school activitiesres of minors in it, facilitating remote access by their parents(tutors) through a concerted password system.The issue of privacy (art. 18 CE) reported by the partycomplainant, it is not a matter that should be analyzed in depth by thisAgency, whose competence framework is limited to the issue of information due in the workdata processing thereof.The Constitutional Court, in its Sentence 292/2000, of November 30,2000 (BOE of January 4, 2001), has come to define the right to the protection ofC / Jorge Juan, 6www.aepd.es28001 - Madridsedeagpd.gob.es
