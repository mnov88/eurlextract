## English Summary

### Facts

The portability of the claimant's phone line was carried out without his consent. The telephone service was being provided by YOIGO, who transferrred the claimant's personal data to Telefonica. After this transfer, Telefonica carried out the change of ownership of the line.

Telefonica claimed that there was a human mistake, but the portability was not effectively carried out until six days after this error, leaving plenty of time for the claimant to contact the them. However, the claimant did not file any claim for cancellation of the portability process until one year after this event. During this time, the line was operating correctly at all times, without any incidents.

### Dispute

Should the unconsented portability of a telephone line be considered a violation of article 6 of the GDPR?

### Holding

AEPD considered that despite the existence of a human mistake (the petitioner of the portability and the owner of the line had different names and surnames), this does not prevent the actions of Telefonica from being considered as data processing without appropriate legal basis, in contravention of Article 6(1) GDPR. The unintentional negligent action by Telefónica, and the fact that the personal data affected (name and telephone line identification number) are basic personal identifiers were determining aggravating factors, setting the amount of the fine at EUR 75,000.

CLAIMANT was subsequently contacted to request their consent.
Regarding the presumed absence of consent for contracting, regulated in article 6.1 of Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 General Data Protection (hereinafter, "RGPD"), we must say that the aforementioned precept
of the RGPD does not require that consent be presented in writing or with certain formalities, but it does
require that the consent of those affected be "unequivocal", in this case it corresponds to my representative
to prove that the CLAIMANT has the consent. To this end, we refer to the recording dated November 2, 2018
that is already in the possession of the AEPD as conclusive evidence of the granting of said consent.
For all of the above and taking into account that our agent had committed the punctual human error
of starting the portability process prior to verification, from TME we consider that the CLAIMANT would have
lent his
proposing that the TELEFONICA MOVILES ESPAÑA, SAU with NIF

consent to carry out the portability of your line unequivocally days before the effective portability of the line.
Therefore, we insist that there has been no violation of the article

PROVEN FACTS
FIRST: Portability of the phone line has been carried out
\* \* \* TELEPHONE 1 of which the claimant is the owner, without his consent.
Until that day, the telephony service was provided by YOIGO, who, according to the claimant,
transfers his personal data without his authorization to the claimed company and it executes the action
changing the ownership of the line, causing the loss of said line.
SECOND: The claimed entity alleges that although the portability request is made on October 31, 2018, it is
not produced effectively until November 5, 2019, so the claimant has had six (6) days to contact the
requested party.
However, the claimant does not file any claim, nor request for cancellation of the portability process,
until September 18, 2019, almost a year later, and during all this time the line was working at all times
correctly and without any incidence type.
FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW
I
By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each control authority, and as
established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is
competent to initiate and resolve this process.
II
Article 4.11 of the RGPD defines the “consent of the interested party” as any expression of free will,
specific, informed and unequivocal by which the interested party accepts, whether by means of a declaration
or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that concerns him .
For its part, article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes that " The treatment will only be lawful if at least one
of the following conditions is met:
to) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data for one or more specific
purposes;
C / Jorge Juan, 6
28001 - Madrid

sedeagpd.gob.es
5/8
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party is a party or for
the application at its request of pre-contractual measures;
c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation applicable to the controller;
d) the treatment is necessary to protect the vital interests of the interested party or of another natural person;
and) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the public interest or in the
exercise of public powers conferred on the controller;
F) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a
third party, provided that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the interested party that
require the protection of personal data do not prevail over said interests, particularly when the interested be
a child. ”
III
In the present case, the portability of the telephone line is denounced
\* \* \* TELEPHONE 1 without their consent. of which the claimant is the owner, to the operator claimed because it is produced
Said operator recognizes human error in the protocol followed to carry out the portability of the line object of
this claim, since the agent must
transfer the call to the mobile portability verification entity prior to the insertion of the portability request that
triggers the Technical Specification approved by the National Commission of Markets and Competition
(hereinafter CNMC) for the change of operator, but Due to a punctual failure of the agent who processed the
discharge in the service, portability was inserted prior to verification by a third party contrary to the provisions
of the regulation.
From the locutions provided to this Agency by the defendant, it appears that in the recording of the
portability maintained between the holder of the call and the agent of the claimed, it is verified that the
identification data of the interlocutor with the agent of the operator do not match those of the claimant and line
owner.
Note at this point that although the claimed is aware that the applicant's high-portability data is
different from that of the line owner and claimant, it is heard in the recording of the third-party verification that
this verifier asks the agent of the operator claimed, if the applicant corresponds to the name and surname of
the complainant that the verifier provides and to which said agent responds "YES".

6/8
From this fact, it can be deduced that the requested one allows the verification to continue despite
knowing that the portability applicant's data does not coincide with the line owner's data provided by the
verifier.
Thus, in accordance with the available evidence, it is considered that the operator claimed has used the data
of the claimant, to carry
out portability, from the phone line \*\*\* TELEPHONE 1 of which he is the owner, without his consent to the
contracting, or any other cause that legitimizes the treatment of his data.
The one claimed in response to the transfer of this claim provides recordings from which it appears
that the portability of a line was carried out with the knowledge that the participants, that is, the portability
applicant and the owner of the line, had different names and surnames , which triggered an unsolicited
portability by the owner of the line, that is, the claimant, and the loss of the corresponding telephone line,
thereby contravening the provisions of Circular 1/2009 of the National Commission for Markets and
Competition in its Annex I, section “ Processing of mobile portability requests ”Point 4, which indicates that the
verifier will request the client to provide or confirm the personal data of the owner and the data related to the
line and operators.
Therefore, the known facts are considered to be constitutive of an infraction, attributable to the
respondent, for an alleged violation of article 6 of the RGPD, indicated in reason II.
IV

Regulation (EU) 2016/679, they are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the

following:
c) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions of lawfulness of the treatment in article
6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. ”
V

corrective powers indicated below:
