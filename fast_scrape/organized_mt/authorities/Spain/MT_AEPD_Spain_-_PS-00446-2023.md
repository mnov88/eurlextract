## English Summary

### Facts

An ex-employee of the controller filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Authority, alleging that the company, for which they provided services, compelled them to utilize their personal cell phone for work purposes. This requirement involved installing an application, specifically a company wallet card platform.

Despite the complaints raised, the controller's response was adamant that they would not provide the employee with a company cell phone. Subsequently, the ex-employee mentioned that even after leaving the company, their phone number remained part of two WhatsApp groups. Consequently, they continued to receive messages from former colleagues, appearing in those groups as a former member, with their phone number and name still visible.

### Holding

The Spanish Data Protection Authority ruled that the processing activities conducted by the controller violated Article 6.1 of the GDPR. As a result, the DPA imposed a fine of €2,000 on the controller.

administrative procedures."

                                           II
       The reported events materialize in the inclusion in WhatsApp groups
without basis of legitimation, which could violate the regulations on protection

of personal data.

       Article 58 of the GDPR, Powers, states:

       "2. Each supervisory authority will have all of the following powers

consent of the interested party or on some other legitimate basis established in accordance
a Law, whether in this Regulation or under other Union law

or of the Member States referred to in this Regulation, including the

need to execute a contract to which the interested party is a party or for the purpose of
take measures at the request of the interested party prior to the conclusion of a
contract."

       On the other hand, article 4 of the RGPD, Definitions, in sections 1, 2 and 11,
notes that:

                                           IV

       The infraction attributed to the defendant is classified in the
article 83.5 a) of the GDPR, which considers that the violation of “the basic principles
for processing, including the conditions for consent under the
articles 5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned
article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, “with administrative fines of €20,000,000 as

infractions the acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the

article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to the

       b) The processing of personal data without any of the
       conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the

       The claimant in his writing of 05/28/2023 stated that the claimant is obliged
its workers to use their personal mobile phone to work (through the
Soldo application) and, furthermore, that having stopped providing services for the same
continues to be included in two WhatsApp groups, with the company refusing to delete the

       The defendant in writing dated 09/13/2023 has stated that “To date,
They created WhatsApp groups to streamline the day-to-day life of the company, it was not a
mandatory requirement, but only verbal consent was requested, since 31

May 2023, written consent is requested from all workers.”

       Therefore, it is considered that the conduct of the defendant violates the principle of
legality enshrined in article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 a) of the
GDPR.
