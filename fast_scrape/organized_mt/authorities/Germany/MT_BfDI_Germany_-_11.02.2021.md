## English Summary

### Facts

The company mivolta GmbH used partners to call hundreds of consumers to make telephone advertising for supply agreements (electricity and gas) of his own product. Thereby the telephoners also acted without and against the consumers wishes. Partially the telephoners used a hidden telephone number. In some cases the telephoners told the consumers that they are from the consumers electricity provider to get necessary data to be able to initiate a change of the provider. So the consumers had to make revocations of contracts they never concluded.

### Dispute

### Holding

The President of the Bundesnetzagentur Jochen Homann held that it is not acceptable that consumers are concerned that way by impermissible telephone advertising and supposed conclusions of a contract.
