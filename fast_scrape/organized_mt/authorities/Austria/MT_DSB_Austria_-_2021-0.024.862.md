## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is a transport operating company which, among other things, operates railway bridges. Bridges that run over public traffic areas are occasionally damaged during passage by vehicles that exceed the vehicle height permitted for the respective bridge. The company planned occasion-related video documentations on selected bridges.

For this purpose, the company conducted a data protection impact assessment. It came to the conclusion that there was a high residual risk and that the consultation procedure pursuant to Article 36 of the GDPR should be carried out. On the details of the data protection impact assessment:

The company assumed that there was a sufficient legal basis for the data processing. It assumed that the data processing was necessary for the fulfilment of its maintenance and traffic safety obligations as well as for the initiation of criminal and civil (damages) proceedings and could therefore be based on [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR").

However, it concluded that there was a high risk for the data subjects because reliable information of the data subjects about the data processing was not ensured, although the data controller provided for measures to inform them: In the area of the bridges, the recording activity should be marked by appropriate signs. Information signs should contain references to height control, a pictogram for video surveillance, a reference to the controller as well as a link including a QR code with a reference to further information in the data protection declaration of the controller. A detailed description of the processing activity should be included in the data protection declaration. It would be available at any time on the website of the controller and could be requested at the company's headquarters.

### Holding

#### Conditions for the Prior Consultation

The DPA first states that [Article 36(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_36_GDPR#1 "Article 36 GDPR") provides for a duty to consult if two conditions are met. First, a data protection impact assessment under [Article 35 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR "Article 35 GDPR") must show that the processing operation entails a high risk. Second, the controller must not have taken appropriate measures to mitigate the risk.

With regard to the definition of "high risk", which is not provided for in the GDPR, the data protection authority refers to recital 89 and states in summary that, in addition to "technical" risks, basically all provisions of the GDPR that serve to protect the data subjects must be examined.

For the mitigation of the risk, the GDPR gives three examples of remedial measures. According to the DPA, if the controller takes appropriate measures, the identified risk must be reassessed. If it is then no longer classified as "high", no obligation to consultation is established. The determination of a possible remaining high residual risk has to be made taking into account all mitigation measures foreseen for the desired processing. When assessing the remaining residual risk, all planned measures to ensure GDPR-compliant processing must be taken into account. This is justified by a reference to the wording of [Article 35 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR "Article 35 GDPR"), which refers the risk "to the rights and freedoms of the data subject". Accordingly, an overall view of all measures and precautions taken - in the sense of an all-encompassing balancing of interests in the sense of Article 5 in conjunction with Article 6 of the GDPR - must be carried out for the assessment of the remaining risk.

In the specific case, the DPO assumed that the first condition is met, so to speak, on the basis of the data controller's submission. In this respect, an abstract potential breach of the duty to inform under [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") constitutes a "high risk".

However, the DPO assumed that the measures proposed by the controller were sufficient to contain the risk. Taking together the measures set out in [Article 35(7)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR#7d "Article 35 GDPR"), the existing risk was sufficiently contained (see below).

#### Requirements for the Information Obligation in case of occasion-related Video Documentation

The information system proposed by the controller complies with the information requirements of Article 13 of the GDPR.

In order to determine the scale of image processing operations, the DPA uses the two-layer information model established in the European Data Protection Board's Guidelines 3/2019 on processing of personal data through video devices.

The first-layer information should be provided by a warning sign. This shall be placed in such a way that the data subject can easily recognise the circumstances of the surveillance before entering the monitored area (e.g. at eye level). The data subject must be able to assess which area is being covered by a camera so that he or she can avoid the surveillance or adjust his or her behaviour if necessary. The first level information should normally contain the most relevant information (e.g. purposes of the processing, identity of the controller, rights of the data subject and other information of high importance). They must also refer to the more detailed second level of information as well as where and how to find it.

The second stage information must also be made available in a location that is easily accessible to the data subject, e.g. as a complete information sheet in a central location (e.g. information desk, reception or checkout) or on an easily accessible poster. It is best if the first level information links to the second level digital source (e.g. QR code or web address). However, the information must also be easily available by non-digital means. It should be possible to access the second level information without going into the monitored area. Another suitable means could be a telephone number that can be called. The information must contain all the details that are mandatory under [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

The DPA decided that the controller’s planned actions met these requirements. The controller provided for "marking of the application". The monitored area would be marked in a clearly visible manner near the secured bridges by appropriate signs. In addition to a pictogram depicting a video camera, the sign contains a QR code that refers to the website - also indicated on the sign - where the data protection declaration of the controller can be accessed. If there is a corresponding reason on the part of the controller, the sign should be clearly visible to approaching traffic in front of the bridge.

initiated procedure according to Art. 36 GDPR concerning an intended

Data processing ("test mode impact detection on bridges") as follows:

   - The request for prior consultation in accordance with Art. 36 GDPR is rejected.

Legal basis: Articles 5, 6, 13, 14, 35 and 36 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (data protection

                              REASON

A. Submissions of those responsible:

1. In a letter dated December 10, 2020, the controller initiated a procedure in accordance with

Art. 36 GDPR and stated as follows:

The person in charge intends to use "impact detection on bridges" for detection and

Video documentation of damage cases - those caused by the collision of a vehicle
to be caused with a bridge of those responsible - to build. The data protection

Impact assessment came to the conclusion that with regard to the assessed

could. The application was the "data protection impact assessment test operation impact detection

2. The person responsible specified - at the request of the data protection authority - with

Opinion of January 7, 2021 their application to the effect that they are at high risk for

recognize the data protection rights of the data subjects in the fact that due to the specific
Circumstances of processing although a viable legal basis for data processing

Information signs can also be perceived by persons concerned “in passing”.

In addition, the person responsible is not the maintainer of the motorways concerned, but only
the overpassing railway bridges, which the available space for

Could restrict information signs.

The specific circumstances of the processing therefore result in the risk that the

data subjects affected by data processing in the form of video surveillance in their

private or professional life can be recorded without going beyond the fact of

Processing and / or the identity of the person responsible to be informed. Manifest therein
pose a high risk to the data subjects' data protection rights, especially for

the right, protected by Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR, that personal data is only available in

processed in a way that is understandable for the data subjects.

The present data protection impact assessment therefore comes to the conclusion that the

planned technical and organizational measures alone cannot be sufficient,
to completely exclude these risks.

B. Factual Findings

       Detailed presentation of the planned processing operations

       In the area of selected railway bridges the responsible persons, which over
       public traffic areas become digital, permanently adjusted video cameras
       Installed. In addition, laser light barriers are installed in the area of the railway bridges
       installed as so-called "start-up triggers", which strike (trigger) as soon as a vehicle is reached
       happens that exceeds the permissible total height (cause of impact). Two different camera perspectives are provided for the camera system
each fulfill different recording purposes:

       (i) Recording of the structure's bottom view for the identification and documentation of
       any optical changes to the structure as well as more precise
       Analysis of the impact (nature of the vehicle part that is in contact with

       the bridge structure, speed at impact, etc.).
       The camera lens is aligned in such a way that no public
       Traffic areas (e.g. street, footpath, bike path) are recorded.

       (ii) Recording of the lane of the approaching road traffic in
       close proximity to the secured railway bridge for the purpose of
       Detection of impacting vehicles as well as their license plates and
       possibly the handlebars from the front.

Depending on the local conditions, the application is either as

       Responsible persons (not on third-party land) in the run-up to the secured bridge

       Cameras, but are only activated when an impact event is registered
       put into operation, thus when a vehicle which is permitted

       Exceeds the total height, one of the installed laser light barriers passes
       (Event recording).
       (ii) Occurrence memory system: In all other cases - ie where none

       suitable reason for those responsible for installing the laser light barriers
       is available in the run-up to the bridge - the laser light barriers are switched on

       However, the continuously recorded image data are only temporary
       backed up in a ring memory and regularly overwritten. The

       specific storage duration depends on the maximum expected

The pursued legitimate interests (if Art 6 para 1 lit f GDPR as
Legal basis is used)

The legitimate interests pursued by the person responsible through the application

can be summarized as follows:

       • Detection and analysis of crash incidents to ensure safety and security
       To be able to guarantee the functionality of the protected infrastructure and
       if necessary to take suitable remedial measures (e.g. necessary
       Repair work on parts of the bridge or barrier affected by an impact
       of tracks);

       • Gathering information on the ongoing fulfillment of maintenance
       and traffic safety obligations of those responsible with regard to their
       Railway bridges, in particular due to the better detection and
       Assessment of dangerous situations and their proactive elimination or

       Defusing;
       • Investigation of crash incidents including the identification of the
       Causer and appropriate evidence preservation, whereby in particular the

       Initiation of any (administrative) criminal proceedings enables and effective
       Enforcement of civil law claims of those responsible ensured
       shall be.
That the video documentation of damage cases in public road traffic via

se corresponds to a legitimate interest of the person responsible is undisputed (cf.
VwGH Ro 2015/04/0011).
The processing is also necessary to safeguard this legitimate interest,

because there is no more lenient means of avoiding the handlebars of a crashing vehicle

       • In the case of storage, data will only be unconditional

       depends on the maximum expected approach speed and the

       Sketch1). Data is continuously overwritten as far as there is none
       Accident happened. The combination envisaged by the person responsible
       from ring memory and start trigger by laser light barriers also fulfilled

       this requirement.

it is clear that the processing would result in a high risk, provided that the controller

does not take any measures to contain the risk.

A final definition of the "high risk" cannot be found in the GDPR.

However, it follows from Recital 89 that processing operations that involve “high risks”

bring themselves, especially those that use new technologies
or that are new and for which the person responsible has not yet

that the GDPR is complied with. Thus, technical, organizational such as

legal, in particular contractual measures intended to remedy the situation (instinct in

Knyrim, DatKomm Art 35 GDPR, margin no.116).

C.2. In the matter

1. The person in charge states that there is a high risk in relation to the issuance of the

reliable information to the data subjects about the data processing

is given to the effect that the data subjects affected by the data processing in the form
recorded by video surveillance in their private or professional life,

without being informed of the fact of the processing and / or the identity of the person responsible. Specifically, the person responsible defines the risk as part of their data protection

Impact assessment as a “risk \[o\] for the effectiveness of the fulfillment of the information obligations

by marking ". It is here - with regard to the previously recorded
Considerations - about a "risk" within the meaning of Art. 35 GDPR.

Since only those processing - which even after provision of the data protection
Impact assessment defined remedial measures remain high risks for natural

Rescue people - are to be subjected to the consultation mechanism (instinct in

Knyrim, Art 35, Rz 28 ff; Trieb in Knyrim, Art. 36 Rz 1), is to be checked in a next step,

whether the person responsible takes appropriate measures to contain the identified risk
has met.

2. As stated, the person responsible foresees a "marking of the application". The
The monitored area should be clearly visible in the vicinity of the secured bridges

appropriate signs (SKETCH 2) are marked. The information sign

contains a pictogram representing a video camera, a QR code,
which on the website - also listed on the sign - on which the

Data protection declaration of the person responsible is to be accessed, refers. If more appropriate

Reason the responsible person is present, the marking should be for the approaching

Traffic must be clearly visible in the apron of the bridge.

For image processing, see the guidelines 3/2019 of the European
Data protection committee for the processing of personal data by video devices

a two-stage model with regard to the information to be provided.

Accordingly, the information on the first level should be provided by a meaningful sign.

This information should be appropriate so that the data subject understands the circumstances of the

Surveillance can easily detect before it enters the monitored area (e.g. in

Eye level). The position of the camera itself does not have to be disclosed as long as no
There are doubts as to which areas are covered and the circumstances of the surveillance

clearly described. The person concerned must be able to assess

which area is covered by a camera so that they evade surveillance or
can adjust their behavior if necessary (see margin no. 113).

The information on the first level (sign) should usually be the most important
Contain information, e.g. B. Information on the purposes of processing, the identity of the

Responsible persons and the existence of the rights of the data subject as well as others

Information of great importance. For example, the legitimate interests

of the person responsible (or a third party) and (if applicable) the contact details of the
Data protection officers belong. They must also refer to the more detailed second level of information and point out where and how it can be found (ibid.

114).

Second level information also needs to be made easy for the data subject

be made available in an accessible location, e.g. B. as a complete information sheet

a central point (e.g. information desk, reception or cash register) or on an easy
accessible poster. As mentioned earlier, the first level warning must be clear

refer to the information on the second level. In addition, it is best when

the information of the first level on a digital source (e.g. QR code or

Internet address) of the second level. However, the information also needs to be on
not be readily available digitally. It should be possible to access the information of the

to access the second level without entering the monitored area, in particular

if the information is provided digitally (for example via a link). A
another suitable means could be a telephone number that can be called. The

However, information must contain all information that is mandatory according to Art. 13 GDPR

are (ibid. Rz 117).

3. The marking provided by the person responsible is both different from the one planned

local positioning as well as the content is a suitable measure to

to minimize identified risk. It corresponds to the model mentioned in the above
Guidelines is recommended. The argument of those responsible that it is not in every case -

due to local conditions - the selected measure is possible in the same way

implement and minimize the identified risk in the same way and therefore a high one
Residual risk remains, it must be countered that not only the - in the by the

Responsible in the course of the data protection impact assessment specifically the identified

Risk assigned - measure that also has to sufficiently minimize the specific risk.

Rather, the determination of a possibly remaining high residual risk has under
Consideration of all intended for the desired processing

Containment measures to be taken. When assessing the remaining residual risk

are therefore all planned measures to ensure GDPR-compliant
Include processing.

This can be justified by a reference to the wording of Art. 35 GDPR, which
refers to “the rights and freedoms of the data subject” in relation to risk.

Accordingly, there is also one for assessing the remaining risk
Overall view of all measures and precautions taken - in the sense of a

comprehensive weighing of interests within the meaning of Art. 5 in conjunction with Art. 6 GDPR - to

4. Based on the data controller in the data protection impact assessment

The assessment made is the admissibility of the data processing in question

and the data protection authority has weighed the interests of those responsible
nothing to oppose.

The “high residual risk” raised by the person responsible is in any case caused by the
planned recording, evaluation and deletion modalities so greatly reduced that in

Result no high residual risk for those affected can be recognized.

Contrary to the view of those responsible, it has therefore overall under review

of the measures set out in accordance with Article 35 (7) (d) GDPR, the existing risk

adequately contained.

The requirements for prior consultation in accordance with Art. 36 GDPR are therefore

not given due to the lack of high risk and the decision had to be made according to the ruling.
