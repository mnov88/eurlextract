## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is active in the field of address trading and direct marketing. It offers its customers the service to store (within a pre-determined period of time) incoming mails at one of its offices, which is close to the customer's residential or company address. The data subject ordered this service on-site by filling in a form at a touch-pad terminal which asked for his name, address and date of birth. The form also contained a note that the data can be transferred to third parties for the purpose of direct marketing and that the customer can forbid this transfer by unticking the pre-ticked box below. The text on the side of the pre-ticked box said "I do not object to the transfer of data".

Afterwards the data subject lodged a complaint with the Austrian DPA (DSB) arguing that the controller violated [Articles 4(11)](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#11 "Article 4 GDPR"), [6(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1a "Article 6 GDPR") and [7 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR "Article 7 GDPR") because the box was pre-ticked and, therefore, the consent to the processing was not given freely. The controller argued that it processes this data under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") and the purpose of the box is not to obtain consent from its customers but rather to give them the opportunity to object against the processing according to [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR"). It further stated that it did not transfer any information of the data subject to a third party since the data subject objected against the transfer.

### Holding

The DSB rejected the complaint because it did not find any violation of the GDPR by the controller. The DSB found that no transfer to third parties took place and that the controller did not violate [Articles 4(11)](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#11 "Article 4 GDPR"), [6(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1a "Article 6 GDPR") and [7 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR "Article 7 GDPR"), because the purpose of the pre-ticked box was to give the data subject the possibility to object against the transfer and not obtain its consent.

                                     S P R U C H

The DPA decides on Gustav A\*\*\*'s privacy complaints
(Appellant) of August 3, 2018 and June 25, 2019 (ha. received on June 27

2019) against N\*\*\* AG (respondent) for alleged infringement of the law

secrecy as follows:

       - The complaints are dismissed.

Legal bases: Art. 4 Z 11, Art. 7, Art. 51 (1), Art. 57 (1) lit. f and Art. 77 (1).

of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter: GDPR), OJ.

No. L 119 of 4.5.2016 p. 1; §§ 1, 18 para. 1 as well as 24 para. 1 and para. 5 of the
Data Protection Act (DSG), Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended.

                              REASON

A. Submissions of the parties and course of the proceedings

1. The complainant raised with his procedural submission of 3 August

2018 (ho. received on the same day) a complaint under Art. 77 GDPR because of the

"Unlawful obtaining of consent to data transfer (violation of Art. 7

GDPR)” and requested a declaration that his rights had been violated. The procedure was
led under the GZ: D123.289.

To justify this, he explained that when setting up a leave\* subject (basically)

the customer's consent to the transfer of address data to third parties is obtained and

this transfer the transmission to companies for direct marketing purposes and

Address publishers would include. The consent is part of the contract and
not clearly separated from other matters. It is essential here that in

the appropriate box is already ticked for approval. Should one

Passing on of the data is not desired, the customer must actively cross this
remove. This is also evident from the consent text, which states: “You are

entitled to prohibit the transmission to third parties for marketing purposes at any time and without giving reasons. If so, uncheck the box below

the cross or judge …”.

In addition, the complainant described that the contract processing at the counter via

an electronic terminal will be processed. The screen size of this terminal is

relatively small and will also be in this terminal the consent text with the
preselected cross is displayed. This will also make it more difficult to read the consent text

from the actual text of the contract. The customer's signature is successful

also on this terminal. Due to the small font size of contract and

In the case of a consent text, it is particularly difficult for people with visual impairments to read the text
to read correctly and could thereby the actual intention of the already set cross

be misunderstood, because only its removal requires the consent, with which the

Customer may decide contrary to his own motivation. Last include the
Consent to data transfer including data of possible co-users of the \*folder.

2. Within the framework of the statement issued by the data protection authority on
August 20, 2018, the Respondent initially stated for clarification that the

Complainant on the occasion of the conclusion of a "holiday \* subject agreement" of

have objected to the data transfer that is the subject of the complaint and

Respondent therefore does not receive any personal data of the complainant
use for marketing purposes.

With regard to the question of legally effective consent, the Respondent submitted that

that the form does not require active consent to the transfer of data to third parties

and there is no breach of data protection law in the procedure complained of. For one, act

the Respondent is the holder of a trade license
Address publisher and direct marketing company according to § 151 GewO. On the other hand

every person who applies for a leave\* subject, the one provided in accordance with the GewO

Information is given and the possibility is given of an otherwise permissible
To prohibit the use of data for third-party marketing purposes. So be the complainant

a prohibition not only immediately upon application to the office of

Respondent, but also later at any time and over several

contact possibilities were possible. Furthermore, § 151 GewO derogates as lex specialis
provisions of the GDPR and is not an active action/consent in this regard

intended.

The information is provided via touch pad in the accepting office

customer friendly. The fact that the information text is directly above the signature field serves the purpose

higher attention of the person concerned. All employees are instructed to
To support people who indicate that they would have difficulty reading or understanding the text. So be it for the complainant – so how

Any other customer – also been able to sign the application form before

printed out for you to read and only then to sign it. Also on one
Sufficient font size is respected, this amounts to both on the touch pad and

also on the physical form 10 \*\*, which is “the most possible under data protection law

'Reference size' of 8 \*\* exceeded."

In the present case, the Respondent assumes that the

Complainant read the information provided and he is correct

would have understood that by unticking the pre-ticked box he immediately
could have prohibited the use of data for marketing purposes. Even if he dies

Insufficient data information on the touch pad before his signature

perceived, the complainant still had a printout of the
signed form on paper and have it there or at any later time

point in time can prohibit the use of the data.

On the question of whether the requested "consent" was sufficiently separated from the text of the contract

the Respondent reiterated its view that this is not a

consent within the meaning of Art. 7 GDPR, but a (clearly defined by paragraph)

Information that is not part of the subject matter of the contract. If the
Complained information only after the signature of the customer and thus outside of the

Contractual text would be provided, the Respondent fears that this from the

affected customers would no longer be read or perceived.

With regard to the disputed rights of third parties, the Respondent

objected that the complainant's authority to represent under civil law only
with regard to the present contract and he also the data use of

have forbidden other recipients of the holiday\*folder for marketing purposes.

3. The Respondent's statement was sent to the Complainant upon completion

the data protection authority of March 24, 2021, GZ: DSB-D123.289/0002-DSB/2018, to

brought to his knowledge and at the same time given him the opportunity to comment on this
to take, which the complainant left unused.

4. As part of the filing of June 25 (starting another appeals process).
2019 (ha. arrived June 27, 2019), revised July 25, 2019, reiterated the

Appellant essentially his submissions of August 3, 2018 in the context of

Complaints procedure GZ: D123.289, with the difference that the copy of the complaint

enclosed "holiday \* subject agreement" was dated June 24, 2019 in this case. This
Procedure was logged for GZ: D205.235.,5. As part of the subsequent, essentially the submission of August 20, 2018

repeated statement of the Respondent of September 5, 2019

this also in this case the data due to an objection made by the
complainant had not been passed on. There is therefore a lack of

Complaint legitimacy.

6. The two complaints procedures D123.289 and D205.235 were set up in accordance with Section 39 (2) AVG

connected to the joint decision on GZ: D205.235 and the parties to the procedure

Completion of June 17, 2021 upon presentation of the investigation results, party hearing

granted.

7. After the extension of the deadline, the Respondent filed a submission dated July 22nd

2021 stipulates that the complainant's data will not be passed on to third parties for marketing purposes
had been passed on. The complainant has the right to object

in both cases already exercised in the Respondent's branch. the

The information texts at issue in the proceedings from the years 2018 and 2019 are up to date
no longer in use.

8. The complainant made no further statement.

B. Subject of Complaint

Based on the submissions of the complainant, it is clear that the subject of the complaint

the question is whether the Respondent thereby infringes the Complainant's right

Breached confidentiality by using the contract form to set up a
Holiday\*fold processed data of the complainant for marketing purposes.

C. Findings of Facts

1. The respondent is a tradesman in the field of address publishing and

Direct marketing company according to § 151 GewO.

Among other things, the Respondent offers its customers the opportunity
to, (within a predetermined period of time) arriving shipments at the

responsible office of the residential or company address. The establishment of a

Such \*fachs "holiday" can be ordered both online and on site in a branch.

If the order or the setting up of the \*box takes place in a branch of the Respondent

location, a touch pad terminal provided there will be used for this purpose.

Evidence assessment: The findings made are based on the relevant

matching information from the parties to the proceedings in their submissions of the 3rd and 20th

August 2018 and an official search by the data protection authority. The complainant commissioned the facility in the office of his place of residence

a \*fold "vacation" using the aforementioned touch pad terminal and was

agreement concluded between the parties to the proceedings, which the complainant – according to

according to his own statements - following his signing via touch pad terminal

was handed over and its authenticity by the Respondent to no one

timing was in doubt.

3. As part of placing the order or setting up the \* compartment using the touch pad

Terminals the complainant - when calling up the relevant page - (also) about

the use of data in connection with the "Vacation" \*subject to be set up

informed (formatting not reproduced in 1:1):

2.) The data protection authority has already stated that the rights of data subjects in

DSB/2018, according to which a breach of Art. 32 DSGVO by the person responsible leads to a

violation of § 1 para. 1 DSG).
