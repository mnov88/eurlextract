### Dispute

### Holding

The fine of 15000 EUR was imposed for infringements of Article 32(1) (b) and (c) of the BDAR, ie failure to ensure the integrity, availability and resilience of data processing systems and services as well as failure to restore the conditions and access to personal data in the event of a physical or technical incident within the legal deadline.

In determining the amount of the administrative fine, the VDAI took into account the factors mitigating the violation committed by the Center of Registers listed in Article 83(2) (b), (c), (e), (f) and (h) GDPR, i. e. the absence of intent, the efforts made to restore the damaged data, the absence of facts about the material damage suffered by the data subjects, the close cooperation with the VDAI and the absence of previous violations of a similar nature. The VDAI also took into account that the Center of Registers, when implementing security measures, is dependent on both the data controller, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Lithuania, and other institutions dealing with the consolidation of state IT resources, and ruled that the proposed fine was a proportionate sanction to ensure future compliance with the provisions of the GDPR.
