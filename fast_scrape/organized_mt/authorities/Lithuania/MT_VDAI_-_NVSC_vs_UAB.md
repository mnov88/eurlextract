The App concerned processed personal data using new technology as well as a systematic monitoring of data subjects in self-isolation. The App also aimed to process large datasets (data subjects throughout Lithuania and abroad). The processing was intended to be continuous and vulnerable data subjects were concerned.

The principle of transparency was also infringed (Article 5(1)(a)) . Finally, as neither entities recognised that they were data controllers, the accountability principle was not met (violation of Article 5(2)).

In summary, the DPA found that the National Center for Public Health breached Articles 5, 13, 24, 32, 35 and 58 (2)(f) GDPR and imposed a fine of €12,000 on the public body. In turn, the DPA found that UAB IT Solutions Success violated Articles 5, 13, 24, 32 and 35 GDPR and imposed a fine of €3,000.

The DPA also took into consideration that this concerned special categories of personal data. Finally, in addition, UAB IT Solutions Success did not comply with the DPA's request to suspend the processing and instead, deleted the personal data collected.

Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPA). Following an investigation, the SDPI found that a data protection impact assessment (PDAV) had to be carried out in order to process the data. Article 35 (1) of the BDAR provides that in cases where the nature of the processing, in particular the use of new technologies, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, the rights and freedoms of natural persons may be seriously jeopardized, , performs PDAV of the planned data processing operations before starting the data processing.

The processing of personal data by the app is considered as processing using a new technology, as well as as a systematic monitoring, as in this case the processing is carried out by data subjects using the app for self-isolation monitoring and control. Also, with the help of the app it was planned to process a large number of personal data of data subjects in the whole territory of Lithuania and abroad. In addition, according to the information collected during the VDAI investigation, it can be concluded that the processing of personal data was planned to be carried out on a continuous basis. Persons identified as vulnerable, ie patients, children, the elderly, etc., were treated. personal data, including but not limited to health data.

Among other things, in the opinion of VDAI, NVSC managed state information resources by performing the function of prevention and control of communicable diseases and processing personal data collected by the app, and violated the requirements of Articles 24 and 32 of the BDAR. on the implementation of appropriate organizational measures and the principle of integrity and confidentiality provided for in Article 5 (1) (f) BDAR (personal data must be processed in such a way as to ensure adequate security of personal data by appropriate technical or organizational measures, accidental loss, destruction or damage).

Violated principles. Taking into account that NVSC and the Company have not proved the lawfulness of the processing of personal data carried out by the app, VDAI established a violation of the principle of lawfulness provided for in Article 5 (1) of the BDAR. As neither NVSC nor the Company acknowledged that they were data controllers during the inspection, both denied their liability as data controllers and accordingly did not implement the accountability principle set out in Article 5 (2) of the BDAR. The gadget's privacy policy also violated the principle of transparency by providing incorrect information about data controllers and processors.

Failure to comply with the order. During the inspection of personal data processed by the app, it was important for VDAI to assess the actual scope and nature of personal data processing, therefore VDAI instructed the Company to temporarily suspend the processing of personal data through the app, but the Company deleted the data. By deleting the personal data processed by the app, the company did not properly implement the instruction given to it by VDAI and thus violated Article 58 (2) (f) of the BDAR. It should be noted that such non-compliance with the instructions of VDAI incurs the Company's liability provided for in Article 83 (5) (e) of the BDAR.
