### Holding

The DPA carried out an _ex officio_ investigation on UAB Diagnostikos laboratorija (the controller). The controller provided medical tests and processes the personal data of about 1 million individuals. The investigation focused on the handling of access requests.

## Comment

The DPA found that the controller did not have a specific storage period for the documents related to the processing of an access request. For this reason, the DPA held that the controller violated [Article 24(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR#1 "Article 24 GDPR").

Additionally, the DPA found that after receiving a request, the controller forwarded a confirmation receipt to the data subject. This receipt did not inform the data subject about the timeframe for processing the request. The DPA considered this a violation of [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR").

The DPA ordered the controller to address these shortcomings.

The DPA found no other issues with the processing of access requests. In particular, the content of the response was complete and appropriate, and the controller implemented correct criteria for assessing whether a request was manifestly unfounded or excessive.
