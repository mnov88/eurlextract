## English Summary

### Facts

At an unspecified date in the past, the controller installed video cameras within its company premises. Some of the cameras were directly pointed at employees' workspaces. The cameras recorded employees at work and these recordings were accessible to the controller, the manager of the employees, via a mobile phone and also through a website.

The data subjects were not able to access the recordings. There was no clearly visible notice of the video recording in progress placed at the entrance to the workplace. The controller placed a notice on the video recording well within the premises in an obscure place.

The notice of video recording did not contain information on the consequences of the recording, the contact details of the controller, whether information was passed on to third parties nor any of the required information under [Article 13(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#1 "Article 13 GDPR"). Moreover, the notice lacked any link to a website where this information could then be found.

The DPA then launched an ex officio procedure against the controller.

### Holding

The [Information Commissioner of the Republic of Slovenia (Informacijski pooblaščenec –IP)](/index.php?title=IP_\(Slovenia\) "IP (Slovenia)") held accountable the manager of the company as the controller but also the company as a whole, as represented by the controller.

IP held that the controller had violated [Article 76(4) of the Slovenian GDPR implementation law (Zakon o varstvu osebnih podatkov (ZVOP-2))](https://pisrs.si/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7959). This article clearly specifies requirements which a notice informing data subjects on video surveillance must contain such as the processing purposes, telephone number or e-mail address or web address for the purposes of exercising the individual's rights in the field of personal data protection or information on specific effects of processing, in particular further processing. None of the requirements were complied with.

All of these requirements were not complied with by the controller and further the IP established that the sole purpose of the video recording was simply to surveil the employees. It stated that if the recording had been for a legitimate purpose such as ensuring the security of the premises, the employees and the business, much less invasive camera placing would have sufficed. The IP explains that cameras at the entrance to the building and at cashier registers would have been adequate. The IP posited that the mere monitoring of employees does not constitute a legitimate ground for processing.

The transfer to the public website was seen to be in breach of [Article 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR") as there was no lawful basis for it. The company was fined with €25,000 and the manager was fined €1,750.
