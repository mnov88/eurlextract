## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject was a third-country national employed in Slovenia under a resident and work permit. In March 2024, he moved to Cyprus where he held a valid residence permit until 2026. After this move, the data subject’s Slovenian employer withdrew their application for renewal of his Slovenian work permit. In response, the Slovenian authorities recorded a removal order and entry ban against the individual in the Schengen Information System (SIS II).

Following an access request, the data subject sought the deletion of this information from the SIS II under Article 17 GDPR, as he had legally left Slovenia and held a residence permit in another EU Member State. The Police (the data controller) refused this request, arguing that the information could only be deleted if he could prove he had left Slovenia within a 10 day period following the issuing the recording of the removal order.

The data subject then complained to the IP (Slovenian DPA), arguing that his request for erasure of the information should have been actioned as he held a residence permit in Cyprus. During the course of the IP’s investigation, the Police argued that as Cyprus was not a Schengen member, they were not obliged under Regulation (EU) 2018/1861 (The Schengen Information Regulation) to consult with Cyprus to verify the data subject’s claims.

### Holding

The IP held that the Slovenian Police had misinterpreted their obligations under the consultation procedure under Regulation (EU) 2018/1861. This obligation requires that where an entry ban is issued against a third country national who holds valid residence in another Member State, the imposing country should consult them. If, as was the case here, the third country can confirm the existence of the residence, the entry ban should be removed from the SIS II.

The IP also rejected the Slovenian Police’s argument that Cyprus’ status as a non-Schengen country absolved them of their duty to consult under Regulation (EU) 2018/1861.

Accordingly, the IP found that the Slovenian Police had unlawfully refused the data subject’s request for erasure under [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR"). The IP ordered the deletion of the SIS II alert within three days.
