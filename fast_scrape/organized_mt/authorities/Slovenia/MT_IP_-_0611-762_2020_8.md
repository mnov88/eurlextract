## English Summary

### Facts

The IP was told that a controller, as a manager, had conditioned the the access of vehicles to a garage on obtaining information about their license plates. By recognizing the license plate numbers that the controller would maintain in the system, the camera would recognize it and provide access to the garage.

### Dispute

### Holding

An essential condition for the vehicle data (including the registration number) to become personal data is therefore that it is possible to identify the person precisely through them. In the specific case, other personal data (addresses, apartment numbers) are processed in addition to the registration plates, so that the individual is identified or can be identified. IP considers that the registration plates of vehicles should be treated as personal data due to their nature, their purpose and the possible identifiability of the individual.
