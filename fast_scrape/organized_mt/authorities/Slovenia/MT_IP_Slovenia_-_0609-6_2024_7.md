## English Summary

### Facts

A responsible person, while employed at a certain company, unlawfully processed the personal data of two individuals. This included their e-mail addresses and the traffic data of the e-mails sent to those addresses during a specified period. Despite the termination of the individuals' employment, the responsible person continued to process their personal data, directing e-mails sent to their addresses to her own e-mail address without proper legal basis or individual consent.

### Holding

The DPA held that the responsible person is found in violation of [Article 8(1) of the the Slovenian Data Protection Law ('ZVOP-1')](https://zakonodaja.com/zakon/zvop-1/8-clen-splosna-opredelitev) according to which the personal data may only be processed if so provided by law or if the processing is subject to the consent of the data subject.

Importantly, these offenses were committed within the scope of the responsible person's business activities and on behalf of the legal entity she represented. According [Article 91(1)(2) ZVOP-1](https://zakonodaja.com/zakon/zvop-1/91-clen-splosne-krsitve-dolocb-tega-zakona), such responsible personal must also be held liable for offences committed.

The DPA decided that the legal entity is also held liable for the same breach of [Article 8(1) of the Slovenian Data Protection Law](https://zakonodaja.com/zakon/zvop-1/8-clen-splosna-opredelitev) as the offence was committed within the scope of its business activities and on its behalf.

As a result, the DPA imposed a fine of €300 to the responsible person of the legal entity and another fine of €6,255 to the legal entity.
