## English Summary

### Facts

A police officer (controller) used his work computer and credentials to access personal data of five people in the police system. The data he accessed included names, surnames, addresses, car registration numbers and mentions in reports. He however did not need to access these data in the performance of his official duties.

### Holding

The DPA held that these data were originally collected to carry out tasks by the police for lawful purposes. However, the police officer processed the data in a manner incompatible with these purposes, in violation of [Article 5(1)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR").

As he did not have to deal with these data in the performance of his job, the controller could not rely on a legal basis under Articles [5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [6(1)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR").

The DPA consequently fined the controller €500

## Comment

Slovenia implemented GDPR very recently. Altough there was a national privacy law, this decision is one of the first ones based on GDPR. The activity apparently did not fall under Directive (EU) 2016/680 but the GDPR. The decision does not give explanation on this but it is probably because the police officer acted for his own personal agenda.
