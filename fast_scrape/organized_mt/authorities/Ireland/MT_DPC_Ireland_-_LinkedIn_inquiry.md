## English Summary

### Facts

On the 20 August 2018, the French non-profit organisation “La Quadrature du Net” filed a complaint against LinkedIn for intransparent data processing. The complaint had initially been made to the French DPA ([CNIL](/index.php?title=CNIL_\(France\) "CNIL (France)")) and was later taken over by the Irish DPA ([DPC](/index.php?title=DPC_\(Ireland\) "DPC (Ireland)")) as the lead supervisory authority for LinkedIn.

The inquiry analysed LinkedIn’s processing of personal data for the purposes of behavioural analysis and targeted advertising to its users. It focussed on the obligation to provide information to data subjects and whether LinkedIn could rely on a legal basis for under Article 6 GDPR for this processing.

### Holding

In a press realease, the DPC highlighted that LinkedIn had breached the overarching principles of fairness and transparency ([Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR")) all throughout the course of the processing.

The inquiry found that none of the legal basis invoked by LinkedIn justified the data processing at hand. Specifically, the consent of the LinkedIn users to this processing had not been freely given, sufficiently informed, specific or unambiguous. Further, LinkedIn’s legitimate interests were overridden by the interests and fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects and LinkedIn could not rely on contractual necessity for the processing.

In addition, the inquiry showed that the information provided to data subjects by LinkedIn regarding the lawful basis it claimed to rely on, namely [Article 6(1)(a), 6(1)(b) and 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") was insufficient.

The DPC held that LinkedIn could not rely on consent under [Article 6(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1a "Article 6 GDPR"), legitimate interests under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") nor contractual necessity under [Article 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1b "Article 6 GDPR") for its processing. In addition to [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), the DPC held that the information provided to data subjects violated Articles [13(1)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") and [14(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR").

Made up of three administrative fines, the DPC fined LinkedIn with a total of €310,000,000 for infringements of [Articles 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"), [6(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"), [6(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"), [6(1)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"), [13(1)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") and [14(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR"). In addition to the fine, the DPC issued a reprimand under [Article 58(2)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2b "Article 58 GDPR") and ordered LinkedIn to bring its processing into compliance as per [Article 58(2)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2d "Article 58 GDPR").
