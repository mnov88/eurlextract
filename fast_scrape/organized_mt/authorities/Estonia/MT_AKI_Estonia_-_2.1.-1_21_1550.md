## English Summary

### Facts

The processor, Viimsi Uudised OÜ, published a story on its website featuring information about the Complainant. The Complainant responded by lodging a complaint with the DPA. The DPA reached out to the processor and asked it to either to issue a copy of the personal data to the Complaintant or to refuse to issue data by providing a clear reference to the national law that permits restriction of the rights of a person under [Article 23 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_23_GDPR "Article 23 GDPR"). The processor sent a reply but did not comply with the requests of the DPA. The data subject now submits an Art 15 GDPR access request from the processor.

### Dispute

### Holding

The DPA clarified that data subject has the right to inspect the data collected about him / her pursuant to [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and to receive explanations on the circumstances of the processing. This provision entitles the data subject to request a copy of their personal information. There is a journalistic exception, but refusal to release personal data should be justified through description of how the data of the data subject would be detrimental to third parties if transferred to him or her.

Because the data subject can ask for personal data about himself / herself under Article 15, the processor must comply or else face a EUR 2000 fine.

CLAIMER'S EXPLANATION:
Excerpt from the complaint of 19.04.2021:
On 08.12.2020, the portal operator published a story on its website entitled “The title of Viimsi Locomotive 2020
                                                                              1
Andres Jaanus and Märt Puust received the XXX, the title of Viimsi Brake was awarded to XXX ”(Appendix 4). That story
page 4 of the pdf printout has the following text:
Viimsi Brake 2020 is XXX
According to the predominant opinion of the respondents (101 votes), the editorial board gave the title Viimsi Pidur 2020
alternate member of the council's Reform Party list for XXX. .Therefore, it is a valid law
means a person who possesses and possesses the information required by the publishers
exists.

The aforementioned posts were published by Ivo Rull. This has been proven
its when you move the mouse cursor by LAST NEWS onto which
then a link will open as shown in the adjacent image.

Summary. According to the text of the story on 08.12.2020, at least 101 different people had to be sent
toimetus@viimsiuudised.ee own "voice" and (some) also justifications. So Viimsi must
News OÜ has at least 101 different e-mails, to a greater or lesser extent (however
at least in the form of a name) the personal data of the data subject have been processed.

Viimsi Uudised OÜ is not a press release that does not approve personal data
based on the public interest and journalistic activity. But even without that fact
Viimsi Uudised OÜ should have issued information to the data subject regarding the processing of his or her personal data
of.

On 19.02.2021, the data subject sent to Viimsi Uudised OÜ through a contractual representative
a letter of demand, in which he demanded, among other things, that Viimsi Uudised OÜ issue
materials containing his personal data to the data subject (Annexes 5 and 6). Viimsi Uudised OÜ
received the letter of request but ignored it (Annex 7).

For the legal reasons below, the data subject finds that Viimsi Uudised OÜ violated it
requirements for the processing of personal data and asks the Data Protection Inspectorate to start Viimsi
Uudised OÜ and to oblige Viimsi Uudised OÜ to comply with the law
the obligation to provide the data subject with information on the processing of his or her personal data and to issue

Viimsi-piduri-tiitliga-parjati .... personal data collected about the data subject.

STATEMENT OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROCESSOR:
In response to 31.05.2021:
In response to your proposal made on 21.05.21, I will send the Harju County Court on 01.02.2021
court ruling in civil case 2-20-19232 and the court ruling of Tallinn Circuit Court of 17.02.21
in Civil Case 2-20-19232 (attached).

As you can see, there is a final court decision by which Viimsi municipal politician XXX
an attempt to interfere with the independent community portal Viimsi News in the activities of data processing
arguments have been rejected.

I regret that XXX, through his representative XXX, has now tried to do Data Protection
A tool for harassing a media channel independent of the Inspectorate.

01.06.2021 in the answer:
Have you started to contest the decision made and entered into force in the court system of the Republic of Estonia?

I would also like to ask you for further clarification on how XXX supports you before giving a substantive answer
recommend personal data is not compromised by respondents who have assumed anonymity
privacy?

Have I misunderstood anything if I assume that the Data Protection Inspectorate should not be granted
to defend the case not Viimsi's power politicians' interest in explaining to the reader in the survey
personal data of those who have shared critical values, but instead to protect those who
assumed your anonymity and privacy when participating in this survey?

I am also interested in whether the Data Protection Inspectorate has processed similar ones in the past
cases where, for example, someone is dissatisfied with the results of a Delfi or Postimees reader survey
the politician wants to know who has critically assessed his actions by name.

GROUNDS FOR THE DATA PROTECTION INSPECTORATE:

I Processing of personal data

First, we clarify that the General Regulation on the Protection of Personal Data (EDPS) applies to either personal data
fully or partially automated processing and non-automated processing of personal data
processing of such personal data if they form part of a data collection or if they are
intended to be included in the data collection. Thus, for example, only those that can be processed orally cannot be required

access or deletion of data.

Any processing of personal data must have a legal basis which is non-exhaustive
the list is set out in Article 6 (1) of the General Regulation on the Protection of Personal Data (EDPS)
the processing of personal data requires one of the grounds set out in Article 9 (2) of the CCIP.

Disclosure of personal data for journalistic purposes without consent can take place
on the basis of § 4 of the Personal Data Protection Act. However, it is clear that the processor has a position on the applicant

more information than the information disclosed in the article which is already known to the applicant and which
the applicant has not requested the filing. In the present case, the applicants are interested in that article
personal data collected about the applicant.

II The data subject's right to inspect his or her own data

The data subject has the right to inspect the data collected about him / her pursuant to Article 15 of the ICC
personal data and to receive explanations on the circumstances of the processing. This provision entitles the applicant

request a copy of your personal information, not other people's information. Nor does it mean the automatic right to receive a copy of a particular document. Article 15 of the
under paragraph 4, the right to obtain a copy is refused in so far as it is prejudicial to other persons
rights and freedoms. In addition, since the making of a media publication, it can be applied to the touch
                           2
also source protection for individuals.

In other words, the applicant is not entitled to receive other people's names or other information. He is right
to obtain data on one's own place, including any other claims or assessments of one's own place,
but without the name of another person. Only the fact that another person by the controller
the information provided about the complainant is in a derogatory and uncensored style, there is no basis for such

refusal to issue claims or assessments. To the applicant concerning himself
Refusal to disclose personal data should be justified by the way in which you provide your own data to him
would be detrimental to third parties.

It is the data controller 's own choice whether to provide the person with a copy of the original document / file, etc
detrimental to other persons) or to make a document only about the complainant's personal data

extract and provide a copy to the person.

We clarify that the processor has an obligation to respond to the person 's requirement of Article 15 of the CISA within one month, and
by failing to reply, the processor breached its obligation to reply. Nor did the processor perform
proposal of the Inspectorate and has not replied to the complainant within the time limit set there.

III Judicial proceedings vs. supervisory review proceedings

We also clarify that the initiated supervision procedure is a court proceeding
independent. 01.02.2021 In the ruling of Harju County Court no. 2-20-19232 the court has dismissed

the applicant's request to initiate a preliminary verification procedure. The court has ruled that the applicant
the purpose of initiating the pre-certification procedure is to identify the persons who provided his name
the title of Viimsi Brake 2020 nominee. In summary, the court has found that the person is known

the publisher, who is responsible for what has been published and against whom the complainant has the opportunity, if necessary, e.g.
To apply to a court on the basis of subsection 1046 (1) of the LPA. In doing so, the court has indicated that the applicant has
the possibility of ascertaining the relevant facts when the main proceedings have been instituted against the declarant.

In its proceedings, the court has only assessed whether a person has the right to apply to the court for that court
identify who has provided information about him to the media outlet. Submitted to the Inspectorate

in the application, the person asks for personal data about himself / herself under Article 15 of the CCIP, not others
people’s names, so these are different requirements that are not interdependent.
However, the court did not address the request for information about the applicant in the order.
