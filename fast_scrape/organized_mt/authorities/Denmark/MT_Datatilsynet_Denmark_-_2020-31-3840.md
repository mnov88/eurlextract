## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is Tryg Forsikring A/S, an insurance company, and the data subject is one of their policyholders. The data subject requested compensation from the company because of an injury. On 3 September 2020, the data subject lodged a complaint with the DPA against Tryg Forsikring. They claimed that the company had collected and retained their health data of a period dating back ten years, although they only consented for the company to collect health data for a period of five years prior to the injury.

Tryg Forsikring, on the other hand, argued that the health data had been obtained to determine whether the data subject was entitled to compensation. In their opinion, the processing of health data was necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims, and the exception laid down in [Article 9(2)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2f "Article 9 GDPR") was applicable. Moreover, the company stated that [Article 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1b "Article 6 GDPR") was the legal basis for the processing of the data subject's personal data, and therefore did not rely on the data subject's consent.

### Holding

The DPA concluded that Tryg Forsikring processed the data subject's personal data in accordance with the GDPR. More specifically, the medical records were obtained to determine a possible claim for compensation under the insurance agreement between the data subject and the company. Hence, the DPA found that Tryg Forsikring's processing of the data subject's health data was covered by the exception laid down in [Article 9(2)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2f "Article 9 GDPR").

Furthermore, the DPA found that the processing of the data subject's health information was based on legal ground set out in [Article 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1b "Article 6 GDPR"), because the processing was necessary for the performance of the insurance contract to which the data subject is a party.
