## English Summary

### Facts

In 2022 Denmark replaced it digital post system with a new system, the Next Generation Digital Post (_Næste generations Digital Post_). The system was operated by the Danish Agency for Digitalization (_Digitaliseringsstyrelsen_\- the controller).

The controller notified four data breaches to the DPA between 2022 and 2023. Additionally, the controller admitted a fifth breach in a statement explaining a system update.

In 2023 the DPA started an ex officio investigation. It found that all the breaches were caused by technical errors in the system’s implementation:

*   In March 2022 about 15,000 users were accidentally granted reading right to other people’s mailboxes. The breach was due to a misunderstanding between the providers of the new and old systems during the migration of the database.
*   In February 2023 a coding error caused the incorrect revocation of reading rights for a small number of users;
*   Another migration error caused users to lose reading rights. The error affected about 7,000 users with reading rights for a large number of mailboxes;
*   In November 2022 yet another migration error caused 42,000 citizens to be enrolled by mistakes. This sometimes prevented them from responding to official communication carried out via the digital post system.
*   Finally, a bug in a 2023 system update resulted in the removal of more than 116,000 natural persons and 1,700 companies from the system and in the accidental enrolment of about 30,000 Greenland residents.

### Holding

The DPA reprimanded the controller for the unsecure processing of personal data, in violation of [Article 32(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1 "Article 32 GDPR").

The DPA emphasized that an official digital post system should be held to high security standards. Such systems process a large amount of data, including sensitive data and the content of communications between authorities. Furthermore, the system carries official communications and the delivery of the communication sometimes has legal value (e.g. when a defendant is notified of a legal proceeding).

## Comment

According to the literal tenor of the decision, the DPA issued a "serious criticism" of the controller's operation. The formulation is in line with the vocabulary of Danish law, where the DPA has the power to "criticize" under the GDPR (rather than to "reprimand").

The Danish Agency for Digitization receives serious criticism for inadequate security measures

Date: 24-06-2025

Decision Public authorities Serious criticism Reported breach of personal data security Supervision / self-management case Processing security

The Danish Data Protection Agency expresses serious criticism of the Danish Agency for Digitization's insufficient security measures in the transition to Next Generation Digital Post in 2022 and a system update in 2023.

Journal number: 2023-442-0197.

Summary
On 24 March 2022, 8 April 2022, 10 November and 27 February 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitization reported a total of four breaches of personal data security to the Danish Data Protection Agency. The security breaches occurred as a result of a number of errors in connection with the transition to Next Generation Digital Post (NgDP), which was put into operation on March 21, 2022.  

The reported security breaches consisted of:

Inadvertent activation of read rights to other people's mailboxes due to misunderstandings in connection with a data migration from the former Digital Post to NgDP. Incomplete and incorrect revocation of read rights to mailboxes caused by a coding error in the functionality that enabled the revocation of read rights. Users with read rights to a large number of mailboxes lost read rights to these mailboxes due to a system error in NgDP. Inadvertent registration of citizens to NgDP due to errors in the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP and a subsequent loading of data from the Central Personal Register (CPR).

In addition, the Danish Digitalisation Agency published operational updates on digitalisér.dk on 29 August 2023 and 31 August 2023, which indicated that a new release of the Digital Post solution on 23 August 2023 had resulted in unintended changes to the registration status of a number of citizens and companies, which led the Danish Data Protection Agency to choose to initiate a case of its own motion against the Danish Digitalisation Agency.

The Danish Data Protection Agency issues serious criticism

The Danish Data Protection Agency has made a joint decision in the five cases. In the decision, the Authority has found reason to issue serious criticism that the Danish Digitalisation Agency had not taken appropriate technical and organisational measures prior to the commissioning of NgDP and the system update on 23 August 2023. In this connection, the Danish Data Protection Agency has, among other things, emphasised that the NgDP at the national level constitutes the primary communication channel between authorities, citizens and companies, in which a large amount of personal data is processed, and where the sending and receiving of messages can have legal effect. Therefore, insufficient security measures can have significant consequences for a large number of data subjects, and any errors can have a serious impact on the rights of the individual data subject.

In this context, it is the general view of the Danish Data Protection Agency that the requirement for appropriate security will normally entail higher requirements for data controllers who offer public systems and solutions to a large number of users - especially when these users in many cases do not have the opportunity to opt out of the solution.

Decision

The Danish Data Protection Agency hereby returns to the cases in which the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has reported a breach of personal data security to the Danish Data Protection Agency on 24 March 2022, 8 April 2022, 10 November 2022 and 27 February 2023.

The Danish Data Protection Agency also returns to the case that the Authority started on its own initiative on 5 December 2023 regarding an unintentional change in the registration status of citizens in the Next Generation Digital Post, for which the Danish Agency for Digitalisation is the data controller. The Danish Data Protection Agency started the case on its own initiative based on the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's operational updates of 29 August 2023 and 31 August 2023, in which the Agency announced that there had been unintentional changes in the registration status of citizens and businesses in the Digital Post solution.

The cases have the following case numbers and reference numbers:

Case number 2023-442-0139 Case number 2023-442-0211 Case number 2023-442-0147 Case number 2023-442-0197 Case number 2023-432-0024 (In-house operation case)

1. Decision

After reviewing the cases, the Danish Data Protection Authority finds that there is a basis for expressing serious criticism that the Digitisation Agency's processing of personal data has not been in accordance with the rules in Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation\[1\].

Below is a detailed review of the cases and a justification for the Danish Data Protection Authority's decision.

2. Case presentation

The Danish Digital Agency has stated in the case that the agency is the data controller for NgDP, and that Netcompany A/S is the data processor for NgDP.

On March 21, 2022, the Danish Agency for Digitalization – which is the data controller for the Digital Post solution – changed supplier, and Netcompany A/S – which replaced e-Boks A/S – became the new supplier of the solution.

The new Digital Post solution, which replaced the former Digital Post (hereinafter Digital Post), was introduced under the name “Next Generation Digital Post” (hereinafter NgDP).

Prior to the launch of NgDP on March 21, 2022, a move of data was made from Digital Post to NgDP. It was in connection with the data migration and transition from e-Boks A/S to Netcompany A/S that a number of errors occurred, which led to a breach of personal data security.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has reported four breaches of personal data security to the Danish Data Protection Authority on 24 March 2022, 8 April 2022, 10 November 2022 and 27 February 2023.

On 5 December 2023, the Danish Data Protection Authority initiated a case on its own initiative regarding unintentional changes to registration status, which occurred in connection with a system update in NgDP on 23 August 2023.

The case presentation for each case will be described separately below.

2.1.

Unintentional activation of read rights to other people's mailboxes in NgDP due to misunderstandings in connection with a data migration from Digital Post to NgDP (2023-442-0139)

On March 24, 2022, the Danish Agency for Digitalization reported a security breach to the Danish Data Protection Agency, which was due to the fact that read rights to digital mailboxes – 143 citizen mailboxes and 313 business mailboxes – had not been revoked, even though the rights had expired.

In the notification, the Danish Agency for Digitalization stated that the error occurred in connection with the migration of data from the former Digital Post to NgDP, and that the error occurred on March 21, 2022, when NgDP was put into operation.   

The error was discovered on March 22, 2022 and attempted to be corrected on March 22, 2022 and March 28, 2022, but the error was not finally corrected for all affected users until May 9, 2022, when the Digitization Agency discovered that the previous corrections did not solve the problem for all affected users.

In their statement of May 30, 2022, the Digitization Agency stated that the error occurred in connection with the migration of data from the former Digital Post to NgDP from Friday, March 18, 2022 at 5:00 p.m. to and including March 21, 2022 at 9:00 a.m. The Digitization Agency has stated in the case that the cause of the incident was a human error when mapping the read permission types in connection with the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated in its statement of 30 May 2022 that a total of 6425 users logged in and accessed corporate mailboxes while they had incorrect rights. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation further stated that a total of 15,097 users logged in and accessed civil mailboxes while they had incorrect rights.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated in its statement of 9 September 2022 that messages were opened in 118 civil mailboxes and 341 corporate mailboxes by users who should not have read rights to the mailboxes. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that the owners of these mailboxes have been notified of the security incident.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated in its statement of 9 September 2022 that the basis for the data migration – including read rights – was based on a dialogue between the current supplier, Netcompany A/S, and the transferring supplier, e-Boks A/S. There has subsequently been a misunderstanding in the communication between the suppliers.

The design for data migration was prepared based on the assumption that only active read rights would be provided by the submitting supplier. In this connection, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that for this reason it had not analyzed or designed according to a scenario with migration of non-active read rights. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has further stated that for the same reason there is no documentation for a mapping or filtering that takes into account a read rights status that is either active or non-active.

In their statement of 7 November 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that the misunderstanding between the submitting and receiving supplier was specifically due to the fact that in connection with the data migration it was assumed that a certain marking by the submitting supplier meant that there was an active read right, which was not the case. The assumption and any test cases were therefore based on the erroneous understanding of how the migrated data from the submitting supplier should be understood.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has further stated that the breach occurred due to a human error that could not be detected through testing, because the test would be based on the same misunderstanding between the parties.

In their statement of 7 November 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that in connection with the development of NgDP, a test environment was set up, consisting of QA, Test, Pre-Prod and Prod environments prior to implementation.

2.2.

A coding error in a functionality in NgDP led to missing and incorrect revocation of read rights to mailboxes (2023-442-0211)

On 27 February 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation reported a security breach that concerned errors in the functionality that enabled the revocation of read rights in NgDP. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that a citizen can create reading rights for their digital mailbox, which gives another person the opportunity to access the citizen's mail from public senders. Citizens can, by physically attending a citizen service, revoke a reading right that the latter has previously granted to another person. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated in the notification that the coding in the functionality that enabled the revocation was flawed.

In their statement of 11 April 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that the error had been present since NgDP was put into operation on 21 March 2022. When developing NgDP, a module for rights management called “Administrative Access” was developed. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that the error occurred when a citizen service employee via the “Administrative Access” system – at a citizen’s request – revoked a read right. In some cases, the action resulted in the read right that was revoked being for a different citizen’s mailbox than the intended citizen who had been searched for in the system. The error meant that a number of citizens who physically appeared at the citizen service with the matter in question did not have a read right revoked for their own mailbox. Instead, it meant that the person with the read right had a read right revoked for another citizen’s mailbox.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that during a subsequent and larger regression test it was discovered that if a person had read rights to multiple mailboxes, it was always the top read right in the overview that was removed, regardless of whether it was the read right that the citizen service employee had searched for and chosen to remove. It appears from the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's statement that this specific scenario had not been identified in connection with the commissioning of NgDP, which is why this had not been tested earlier. If this specific scenario had been considered in their tests earlier, the error would also have been identified earlier.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has further stated in their statement of 11 April 2023 that the incident has had the consequence that 12 read rights – which 9 citizens and 1 company were granted – to 12 citizens' mailboxes have continued to be active, even though they should have been closed down upon request to the citizen service. Users who had unauthorized read access to a mailbox could thus continue to read (new) mail in the mailbox after the date on which the read access should have been revoked. Logs show that there were unauthorized logins in 10 of the mailboxes during the period in which the error occurred.

Another consequence of the error was that 23 authorized read access rights to 20 different citizens' mailboxes and 1 company's mailbox were deleted. The read access rights were assigned to 14 citizens and one company. The error meant that 14 citizens and one company did not have access to the mailboxes that they rightfully should have had access to.

The error has been corrected, and those affected have been notified of the breach.

In their statement of April 11, 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalization stated that the agency had set requirements for the functionality and had tested that the solution met the requirements and acceptance criteria before NgDP was put into operation. The functionality went through a QA (quality control) and test, where it was tested that the functionality, which enabled the revocation of read access, met the requirements and acceptance criteria.

It is further stated in the statement that before the functionality was put into use, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation ensured that all acceptance criteria were covered by automatic tests. In addition, the functionality underwent “end-to-end tests”. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has elaborated that this software testing method tests the application flow from start to finish, and the purpose of the test form was to simulate the real user scenario and validate the tested system as well as its components for integration and data integrity.

After the commissioning of “Administrative Access”, regression tests were carried out at each release (launch of a new version of software) to ensure that it was possible for a citizen service employee to assign and subsequently remove a read right to a citizen’s mailbox. Regression testing is performed to verify that code changes in the software do not affect the existing functionality of the product, and to ensure that the product works with new functionality, bug fixes or any changes to the existing functionality.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that regression testing was performed in connection with a new version of the software. Such tests are performed in an internal test environment (the QA environment) and in an externally directed test environment (which is available to, for example, authorities that need to test their own systems against the NgDP) before it was put into the production environment. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that 67 regression tests were carried out in the internal environment since 3 January 2022 and 74 regression tests in the external corrected test environment since 5 January 2022.

In their statement of 11 April 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that the reason why the coding error was not identified through the tests carried out was because the regression tests carried out only took into account ensuring that in the user interface for the citizen who owns the mailbox, it was the correct read access that was removed in situations where the citizen had given read rights to multiple users. The user interface thus showed the correct number of read rights to the citizen who owned the mailbox. However, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that in the user interface in "Administrative Access" it was not possible to see how many read rights the user otherwise had to other citizens' mailboxes. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that this was, among other things, due to: was the reason that the error was only identified about a year after the NgDP was put into operation.

The Danish Agency for Digitization has finally stated that the reason that the error was only detected on 24 February 2023 – about a year after NgDP was put into operation on 21 March 2022 – was due to the fact that no changes were made to the functionality since the system was put into operation. The function had therefore been covered by a regression test, which includes the normal functionality with the assignment and revocation of read rights, but not the special constellation where a user had several active read rights. The Danish Agency for Digitization has stated that the error was found during a particularly thorough regression test in connection with a major upgrade in underlying components.

2.3.

A system error in NgDP led to users with read rights to a large number of mailboxes losing access to them (2023-442-0147)

On April 8, 2022, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation reported a breach of personal data security regarding errors in NgDP, where end users could not access their own mailboxes or mailboxes to which they had read rights. In the notification, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that upon login, the user was greeted with a blank page or a page that kept loading. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation also stated that the error only occurred upon login for users with read rights to multiple mailboxes. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that the error occurred in connection with the transition from the former Digital Post to NgDP. It is further stated in the notification that the error has been present since 21 March 2022, when NgDP was put into operation, and that the error was detected on 25 March 2022.

It is apparent from the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's follow-up notification of 17 May 2022 that the error occurred in connection with the mapping of rights, which resulted in a system error. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that the design and specification of the interface between the viewing clients (Rettighedsportal, e-Boks, mit.dk, Virk and borger.dk) and NgDP was not sufficient to handle some of the users who had many rights across mailboxes. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that if a user (citizen or company) had many rights, for example read rights to many citizen or company mailboxes, then NgDP could not handle the large amount of data associated with these users, as NgDP had to both retrieve and display data at the same time.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has further clarified that the error affected 7,166 end users and that the handling of the incident took place over several phases, and the error was finally fixed on 3 May 2022.

It is apparent from the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's statement of 29 June 2022 that the agency resolved the problems for the users who contacted the agency. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has further stated that 2,642 out of the 7,166 affected users did not attempt to log in to NgDP, and the users thus did not discover the lack of access. In the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's first notification of 8 April 2022, the agency stated that the public has been informed about the incident through virk.dk.

It is further apparent from the statement of 29 June 2022 that the error occurred for users who had many reading rights. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has subsequently stated that individual users had up to 400 and 700 reading rights. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has also stated that it was not well known that some citizens and employees had so many reading rights to other people's mailboxes, which is why this use case (condition) was not covered in the quality assurance of the NgDP and viewing clients projects (Rettighedsportal, e-Boks, mit.dk, Virk and borger.dk).

It also appears from the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's statement that the users affected by the incident were primarily citizens and companies who manage a mailbox on behalf of others, and there was a large group of guardians and lawyers who typically have many reading rights. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that the likely consequences of the breach were that these guardians were prevented from managing their NgDP administration on behalf of others due to the error. In addition, citizens under guardianship who could not handle NgDP themselves were possibly prevented from acting on notifications from authorities.

2.4.

Unintentional registration of citizens in NgDP as a result of a data migration from Digital Post to NgDP and a subsequent loading of data from CPR (2023-442-0197)

On 10 November 2022, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation reported a breach of personal data security, in which 42,834 citizens were mistakenly registered with NgDP.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation discovered the error on 4 November 2022, when a number of citizens who had left Denmark had contacted ATP because they had not been paid their pension. This was because the citizens had not completed and returned their annual life certificates from ATP Livslang Pension, which had been sent digitally to the citizens via NgDP instead of by physical mail, as they had been mistakenly registered with NgDP.

It appears from the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's follow-up notification of 1 December 2022 and the Agency's statement of 31 August 2023 that the error occurred in connection with the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP and with a subsequent entry of data from the CPR. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that the registration lists from the submitting supplier (e-Boks A/S) did not contain all citizens with the relevant status (i.e. registered or exempt). It is also stated that in connection with the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation was not aware that information was missing in the data submitted by the submitting supplier (e-Boks A/S).

A subsequent entry of data from the CPR resulted in a subset of citizens who were not migrated from e-Boks A/S being mistakenly entered into NgDP with the status "registered".

In their statement of 31 August 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation explained that the logic in NgDP, which handled “new” citizens from the CPR, was not correctly set up to handle citizens who were entered from the CPR. This was because the logic assumed that citizens were already known in the former Digital Post and either had the status “registered” or “exempt”.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has also stated that neither before the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP nor before the entry of data from the CPR was a control comparison made between the data that was handed over from e-Boks A/S and the data that was entered from the CPR.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that before the breach occurred, technical and organisational measures in the form of controls had been implemented. In their statement of 31 August 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that checks were carried out to ensure that new citizens were correctly created in NgDP, including, among other things: checking the correct creation of mailboxes and registration status when these citizens were created on the basis of data from the CPR. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that these checks were carried out during the development phase of NgDP.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated in its statement that NgDP was not developed to handle the fact that citizens were missing from the data transferred from e-Boks A/S. Therefore, these citizens were registered as new citizens who had to be registered with NgDP in connection with the entry of information from the CPR. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation had therefore not carried out further checks in connection with the entry of data from the CPR into NgDP.

However, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that in connection with the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP, checks were carried out to determine whether the data transferred from e-Boks A/S contained the relevant master data in order to be able to enter, for example, exemption status. It also appears from the statement that both machine and manual random checks were carried out after the data transferred from e-Boks A/S was entered into NgDP. These checks were carried out by the Danish Agency for Digitalisation to ensure that documents, powers of attorney and registration status were correctly entered into NgDP.

In their follow-up notification of 17 January 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that a total of 42,834 citizens were mistakenly registered in NgDP. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that these citizens will be deregistered from NgDP. It also appears from the case that the Danish Agency for Digitalisation sent notification letters to the affected citizens.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that authorities that have sent notifications in NgDP to citizens have been informed of the error regarding the erroneous registrations.

2.5 

Own operational case regarding unintentional change of registration status in NgDP as a result of a new release on 23 August 2023 (2023-432-0024)

On 29 August 2023 and 31 August 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation published an operational update on www.digitaliser.dk, in which it was announced that unintentional changes had occurred in the registration status of citizens and businesses in NgDP. Based on these operational updates, the Danish Data Protection Agency sent a hearing to the Danish Agency for Digitalisation on 5 December 2023. In this connection, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation sent a statement in the case to the Danish Data Protection Agency on 8 January 2023.

It appears from the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's statement of 8 January 2023 that the release updated the way in which users' NemSMS was processed. The release was to enable voluntary registration for NgDP for citizens residing in Greenland. However, the release triggered two errors in NgDP in relation to these changes.

One error was that a user's update or confirmation of contact information in NgDP caused the user's registration in NgDP to be removed. The error resulted in the removal of 116,674 citizens' and 1,778 companies' registrations in NgDP.

The second error was that 20,963 citizens residing in Greenland were inadvertently registered in NgDP as a result of the release. In this connection, the Digitization Agency has stated that 393 of these citizens had received mail from public senders. The Digitization Agency has further stated that these citizens were neither covered by the Digital Post Act nor had voluntarily joined Digital Post. The Digitization Agency has therefore stated that messages sent to these citizens via NgDP had no legal effect for the citizens.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated in the case that the errors have been corrected and that those affected have been notified of the incident.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that the agency has assessed that it is unlikely that the breaches have had consequences for the rights or freedoms of natural persons.

The affected users, who had their registration in NgDP removed by mistake, received their notifications by physical mail. As far as citizens who were mistakenly registered in NgDP are concerned, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has assessed that this has also had no consequences for those affected, as the sending authorities were informed of the error and because the authorities had the opportunity to contact citizens in other ways.

It is clear from the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's statement of 8 January 2023 that the agency tests the content of each release. It is further clear from the statement that a release goes through both manual and automated test cases before it is put into operation in the production environment.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated in its statement that the registration status in NgDP was migrated from the former Digital Post, and these are continuously updated based on changes in the CPR and manual exemption of users. Prior to the incident, no measures had been established to ensure that the registration status was not inadvertently changed in connection with a new release, as the Danish Agency for Digitalisation had not previously considered this to be a possibility. 

Prior to the incident, no specific checks were made to see whether changes in NemSMS subscriptions could have an impact on users' registration in NgDP, but the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that this will be done going forward.

3. Reasons for the Danish Data Protection Agency's decision

In summary, the Danish Data Protection Agency's decision concerns a number of errors in NgDP, which consisted of:

Inadvertent activation of read rights to other people's mailboxes as a result of misunderstandings in connection with a data migration from Digital Post to NgDP. A coding error in a functionality in NgDP that led to the missing and incorrect revocation of read rights to mailboxes. A system error in NgDP led to users with read rights to a large number of mailboxes losing access to them. Unintentional registration of citizens to NgDP as a result of an error in connection with data migration from Digital Post to NgDP and a subsequent loading of data from CPR.

In addition, the decision concerns a system update in NgDP on 23 August 2023, which resulted in a number of citizens and companies being incorrectly deregistered or registered with NgDP.

3.1. Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation

It follows from Article 32(1) of the Data Protection Regulation that the data controller must take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks posed by the data controller's processing of personal data.

The data controller is therefore obliged to identify the risks that the data controller's processing poses to the data subjects and to ensure that appropriate security measures are implemented to protect the data subjects against those risks.

It also follows from Article 32(1)(b) and (d) that the data controller must, in this connection, inter alia, implement relevant measures with a view to maintaining the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and robustness of processing systems and services, and implement procedures for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of processing.

The Danish Data Protection Authority's assessment of the specific cases follows below.

3.1.1.

Unintentional activation of read rights to other people's mailboxes in NgDP as a result of misunderstandings in connection with a data migration from Digital Post to NgDP (2023-442-0139)

The Danish Data Protection Authority is of the opinion that the requirement, cf. Article 32(1) on appropriate security will normally mean that, prior to a data migration between larger systems, great care is taken, among other things, in mapping different types of rights, as otherwise this could lead to errors that could have consequences for the data subjects, e.g. in the event that their information can be accessed by unauthorized persons. Furthermore, the Danish Data Protection Authority is of the opinion that, given the risks associated with data migration, there must be the necessary clarity and understanding of what the migrated data includes, as otherwise it will not be possible to identify all likely error scenarios and carry out qualified tests in order to ensure that data migration does not lead to unintended changes in the system in question. 

The basis for the design of a data migration, including what the migrated data includes, should be in a task and solution description or similar. This makes it easier for the parties involved to identify any ambiguities or misunderstandings, and ensure that these are clarified before the data migration is carried out.

The Danish Data Protection Authority believes that activating read rights to other people's mailboxes in NgDP, where the read right had expired, entails a risk of abuse, as mail messages – including mail received after the read right expired – can thereby be accessed by unauthorized persons. The Danish Data Protection Authority notes that citizens who assign read rights to their mailbox may be particularly vulnerable citizens – e.g. citizens under guardianship, children, patients or the elderly – which means that the risk to the data subjects in the event of any errors may be greater. The data subjects may, among other things, have difficulty in understanding and protecting themselves against any potential harm that may be associated with unauthorized persons accessing their mailbox and reading new messages that the data subject received after the read right expired.

On this basis, the Danish Data Protection Authority finds that the Digitisation Agency – by not having ensured that, in connection with the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP, the necessary care had been taken when mapping the reading rights in the sending and receiving postal solution system, and by not having ensured a correct understanding of what a certain marking by the sending supplier meant, including what the data submitted comprised – has not acted in accordance with the rules in Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

The Danish Data Protection Authority has emphasized that the Digitisation Agency did not have sufficient knowledge of what the data received comprised during the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP. The Danish Data Protection Authority has further emphasized that the Danish Digital Agency should have investigated what the marking at the submitting supplier meant rather than relying solely on an assumption of what the marking in the submitting system meant, and that the agency had not sufficiently taken into account the risk of misunderstandings arising in the communication between the suppliers in connection with the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP.

3.1.2.

A coding error in a functionality in NgDP led to the missing and incorrect revocation of read rights to mailboxes (2023-442-0211)

The Danish Data Protection Authority is of the opinion that the requirement, cf. Article 32(1), for appropriate security will normally entail that before a new system or a system in which system changes have been made is put into operation, the system must be tested for errors or vulnerabilities. Such tests must, among other things, cover common user scenarios in the system in question. This ensures that all functionalities and user scenarios in the system in question are not affected by errors or vulnerabilities, which could, for example, lead to a breach of personal data security. In this context, all usage scenarios, rights and functions in the system must be identified in order to be able to define all relevant tests of the system.

It is the assessment of the Danish Data Protection Agency that the Danish Digital Agency – by not having carried out sufficient testing of the “Administrative Access” function and thereby having identified the coding error before commissioning NgDP – has not acted in accordance with the rules in Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

The Danish Data Protection Agency has therefore emphasized that only regression tests were carried out, which included the normal functionality of granting and revoking read access, and that these tests did not take into account the special constellation where the user with read access had several active read rights. The Danish Digital Agency should have been aware that there were users with active read rights to multiple mailboxes, and that revoking read rights for users with multiple active read rights was a common user scenario in NgDP, which the agency should have tested before NgDP was put into operation.

The Danish Data Protection Agency has also emphasized that the error had been present for a longer period since NgDP was put into operation on 21 March 2022, and that the agency only discovered the error on 24 February 2023.

Finally, the Danish Data Protection Agency has emphasized that the error would have been identified earlier if the thorough regression test that discovered the coding error had been performed earlier.

3.1.3.

A system error in NgDP led to users with read rights to a large number of mailboxes losing access to them (2023-442-0147)

The Danish Data Protection Authority is of the opinion that the requirement, cf. Article 32(1), for appropriate security normally implies that testing of systems must, among other things, be based on usage scenarios and functions before the system is put into operation. This also applies to usage scenarios that are only relevant to a small proportion of the users in a system, or functions in a system that are not used frequently. It is therefore necessary to map all common usage scenarios, rights, functions, etc. in order to be able to carry out relevant tests that can identify whether there are errors in the system with regard to all usage scenarios, rights, functions, etc. The requirement for appropriate security will also entail carrying out a load test with regard to users with many rights in a system. In this way, it is ensured that there is no overload in the system that could make the system inaccessible.

In this specific case, the Danish Data Protection Authority's assessment is that a user's lack of access to their own mailbox or to a mailbox to which a user has reading rights can have a significant impact on the data subjects and can entail a significant risk to the data subjects' economic or social rights

Public authorities can, with acquiescent effect, send mail to a citizen's digital mailbox, which the citizen is obliged to read. Mail from public senders typically contains messages regarding important agreements or response deadlines, and the citizen can be blamed if these are not met. It is therefore the Danish Data Protection Authority's assessment that the lack of access by citizens - including any representatives - constitutes a significant risk of a significant loss of rights for the citizens concerned.

The Danish Data Protection Authority therefore finds that the Danish Digital Agency – by not having tested NgDP sufficiently and thereby discovering a system error that resulted in users with read rights to multiple mailboxes losing access to mailboxes to which they had read rights – has not acted in accordance with the rules in Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

In its assessment, the Danish Data Protection Authority has emphasized that the Danish Digital Agency was not aware that some users had a large number of read rights to other users' mailboxes, and were therefore not covered by the quality assurance of NgDP, which resulted in the agency not conducting sufficient testing of NgDP based on the use scenario where users have read rights to multiple mailboxes. The Danish Digital Agency has stated that it was not known to the agency that there were users with so many read rights. In this context, the Danish Data Protection Authority believes that the Danish Digital Agency should have identified whether there were users with a large number of rights across mailboxes before the implementation of NgDP, especially when the solution, among other things, it was possible to have read rights to multiple mailboxes.

The Danish Data Protection Agency notes that it is a normal usage scenario that a user, for example a guardian, lawyer or employees of a company, can have read rights to a large number of mailboxes – which was also possible in the former Digital Post and NgDP – and it was therefore a scenario that the Danish Agency for Digitalisation should have known about and tested for.

The Danish Data Protection Agency has also emphasized that the Danish Agency for Digitalisation did not conduct a sufficient load test before NgDP was put into operation, as the Danish Agency for Digitalisation should have conducted a load test focusing on whether NgDP acted unexpectedly due to an excessive load on the system that affected the availability of mailboxes in NgDP for users with many rights across mailboxes.

The Agency should also have informed the suppliers of the viewing client projects (Rettighedsportal, e-Boks, mit.dk, Virk and borger.dk) about the possibility that users could have read rights to multiple mailboxes, so that these suppliers also had the opportunity to test for this user scenario.

Finally, the Data Protection Authority has emphasized that the error had been present for a longer period of time since NgDP was put into operation on 21 March 2022, and that the Agency only finally corrected the error on 3 May 2022.

3.1.4.

Unintentional registration of citizens in NgDP as a result of a data migration from Digital Post to NgDP and a subsequent loading of data from CPR (2023-442-0197)

It is the Data Protection Authority's opinion that the requirement, cf. Article 32(1) on adequate security will normally mean that, before a data migration, it is ensured that there is the necessary clarity about what the transferred data includes. The requirement for adequate security in connection with a data migration will mean that it is checked whether a transferring supplier has transferred sufficient data to a receiving supplier before the data migration is carried out. It also follows from the requirement for adequate security that a system is tested for all likely error scenarios and vulnerabilities before commissioning.

In this specific case, the Danish Data Protection Authority's assessment is that the incorrect registrations of citizens in Digital Post entail a high risk to the social and economic rights of the citizens concerned. Incorrect registration of Digital Post may contribute to a citizen overlooking important mail from authorities, as citizens expect to receive mail physically, but due to an unintentional change in their registration status in NgDP instead only receive mail from authorities digitally.

The Danish Data Protection Authority must note that regardless of whether the Danish Digital Agency has stated that the sending authorities were informed of the error, it cannot be ruled out that such an error may have had consequences for those affected, as the error could, among other things, lead to the postponement of any agreements or meetings with authorities. In addition, there may be situations where any delay in postal notifications from authorities may have far-reaching consequences for a citizen. This may, for example, be the case with mail from health authorities regarding invitations for checks or operations.

It is against this background that the Danish Data Protection Agency's assessment is that the Danish Digital Agency - by not having checked, in connection with the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP, whether the data submitted by Digital Post included all citizens with relevant status (registered/exempted), and by not having tested, before loading data from the CPR, whether the NgDP was correctly set up to handle new citizens from the CPR - has not acted in accordance with the rules in Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

The Danish Data Protection Agency has emphasized that the agency was not aware that the registration lists submitted by e-Boks A/S (the submitting supplier) did not contain information about all citizens with relevant registration status. The Danish Data Protection Authority has also emphasized that the logic in NgDP, which handled the citizens who were entered from the CPR, was not correctly set up to handle the citizens who were entered from the CPR, as the logic assumed that citizens were already known in the former Digital Post and either had the status "registered" or "exempt".

The Danish Data Protection Authority has also emphasized that no further check was carried out in connection with the subsequent entry of data from the CPR into NgDP, and that no check comparison was carried out of data from e-Boks A/S and the CPR, and that the error had been present over a longer period, since NgDP was put into operation on 21 March 2022, and the agency only discovered the error on 4 November 2022.

3.1.5.

Own operation case regarding unintentional change of registration status in NgDP as a result of a new release on 23 August 2023 (2023-432-0024)

The Danish Data Protection Authority is of the opinion that the requirement, cf. Article 32(1), for appropriate security will normally entail that, before putting changes to a system into operation, all likely error scenarios are identified and the changed system is tested for any inadequacies that the change may have caused. In order to determine which parts of the system are to be tested, the processing activities that are affected by the system changes must be identified. It must also be identified whether the system changes in question could affect parts of the environment or associated processes and functions in the system that are not directly subject to the system change itself.

Based on the above, the Danish Data Protection Agency finds that the Danish Digital Agency – by not having sufficiently tested NgDP before the new release was put into operation – has not acted in accordance with the rules in Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

The Danish Data Protection Agency has emphasized that the Danish Digital Agency had not sufficiently tested in connection with the release whether the changes to NemSMS subscriptions could result in users being mistakenly registered in NgDP with a status of “registered”, which could lead to those affected in the interim period – from the time the error occurred until the error was detected and reported to the authorities – having received mail from authorities without their knowledge and without the sending authorities being aware that their letters had been sent via an incorrect communication channel. During that period, the sending authorities could rightly expect that postal messages sent via NgDP would be sent with legal effect. In addition, it should be noted that any re-sending of notifications by the sending authorities, extension of deadlines or allocation of new appointment times as a result of the incident could still lead to delays that may have an impact on the social, economic or health rights of citizens.

The Danish Data Protection Agency has also emphasized that prior to the incident, no measures had been established to ensure that the registration status was not unintentionally changed in connection with a new release.

Regardless of whether the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has claimed that the breach did not pose a high risk to those affected, this cannot lead to a different result, as the erroneous registrations entailed a risk to those affected, regardless of whether the sending authorities were made aware of the error and the postal notifications did not have legal effect against the recipients.

3.1.6. Summary

At national level, NgDP constitutes the primary form of communication between authorities, citizens and companies, where a large amount of personal data is processed, and where sending and receiving messages can have (serious) legal effects. Insufficient security measures in large public systems such as NgDP can thus have significant consequences for a large number of data subjects, and any errors caused by insufficient security measures can have a serious impact on the rights of the individual data subject.

In addition to the Danish Data Protection Authority's overall assessments, which appear above under each individual case, it is generally the Danish Data Protection Authority's view that the requirement for appropriate security will normally entail higher requirements for data controllers who offer public systems and solutions – such as NgDP – to a large number of users, especially when these users in many cases do not have the opportunity to choose the solution.

The Danish Data Protection Authority therefore finds that overall there is reason to express serious criticism that the Danish Digital Agency has not acted in accordance with the rules in Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation. 1.

The Danish Digital Agency receives serious criticism for inadequate security measures

Date: 24-06-2025

Decision Public authorities Serious criticism Reported breach of personal data security Supervision / self-management case Processing security

The Danish Data Protection Agency expresses serious criticism of the Danish Digital Agency's inadequate security measures in the transition to Next Generation Digital Post in 2022 and a system update in 2023.

Journal number: 2023-442-0197.

Summary

On 24 March 2022, 8 April 2022, 10 November and 27 February 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation reported a total of four breaches of personal data security to the Danish Data Protection Authority. The security breaches occurred as a result of a number of errors in connection with the transition to Next Generation Digital Post (NgDP), which was put into operation on 21 March 2022.  

The reported security breaches consisted of:

Inadvertent activation of read rights to other people's mailboxes due to misunderstandings in connection with a data migration from the former Digital Post to NgDP. Missing and incorrect revocation of read rights to mailboxes caused by a coding error in the functionality that enabled the revocation of read rights. Users with read rights to a large number of mailboxes lost read rights to these mailboxes due to a system error in NgDP. Unintentional registration of citizens to NgDP, which was due to errors in the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP and a subsequent loading of data from the Central Register of Persons (CPR).

In addition, the Danish Digitalisation Agency published operational updates on digitalisér.dk on 29 August 2023 and 31 August 2023, which indicated that a new release in the Digital Post solution on 23 August 2023 had resulted in unintentional changes to the registration status for a number of citizens and companies, which led to the Danish Data Protection Agency choosing to initiate a case of its own motion against the Danish Digitalisation Agency.

The Danish Data Protection Agency issues serious criticism

The Danish Data Protection Agency has made a joint decision in the five cases. In its decision, the Danish Data Protection Agency has found reason to express serious criticism that the Danish Digital Agency had not taken appropriate technical and organizational measures prior to the commissioning of NgDP and the system update on 23 August 2023. In this context, the Danish Data Protection Agency has, among other things, emphasized that NgDP at the national level constitutes the primary communication channel between authorities, citizens and companies, in which a large amount of personal data is processed, and where sending and receiving messages can have legal effect. Therefore, inadequate security measures can have significant consequences for a large number of data subjects, and any errors can have a serious impact on the rights of the individual data subject.

In this context, the Danish Data Protection Agency is generally of the opinion that the requirement for appropriate security will normally entail higher requirements for data controllers who offer public systems and solutions to a large number of users - especially when these users in many cases do not have the opportunity to opt out of the solution.

Decision

The Danish Data Protection Agency hereby returns to the cases in which the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has reported a breach of personal data security to the Danish Data Protection Agency on 24 March 2022, 8 April 2022, 10 November 2022 and 27 February 2023.

The Danish Data Protection Agency also returns to the case that the Agency started on its own initiative on 5 December 2023 regarding an unintentional change in the registration status of citizens in Next Generation Digital Post, for which the Danish Agency for Digitalisation is the data controller. The Danish Data Protection Agency started the case on its own initiative based on the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's operational updates of 29 August 2023 and 31 August 2023, in which the Agency announced that there had been unintentional changes in the registration status of citizens and companies in the Digital Post solution.

The cases have the following case numbers and reference numbers:

Case number 2023-442-0139 Case number 2023-442-0211 Case number 2023-442-0147 Case number 2023-442-0197 Case number 2023-432-0024 (In-house case)

1. Decision

After reviewing the cases, the Danish Data Protection Authority finds that there is grounds for expressing serious criticism that the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's processing of personal data has not been in accordance with the rules in Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation\[1\].

Below is a detailed review of the cases and a justification for the Data Protection Authority's decision.

2. Case presentation

The Danish Agency for Digitization has stated in the case that the agency is the data controller for NgDP, and that Netcompany A/S is the data processor for NgDP.

On March 21, 2022, the Danish Agency for Digitization – which is the data controller for the Digital Post solution – changed supplier, and Netcompany A/S – which replaced e-Boks A/S – became the new supplier of the solution.

The new Digital Post solution, which replaced the former Digital Post (hereinafter Digital Post), was introduced under the name "Next Generation Digital Post" (hereinafter NgDP).

Prior to the launch of NgDP on March 21, 2022, a migration of data was carried out from Digital Post to NgDP. It was in connection with the data migration and the transition from e-Boks A/S to Netcompany A/S that a number of errors occurred that led to breaches of personal data security.

On 24 March 2022, 8 April 2022, 10 November 2022 and 27 February 2023, the Danish Digital Agency reported four breaches of personal data security to the Danish Data Protection Authority.

On 5 December 2023, the Danish Data Protection Authority initiated a case on its own initiative regarding unintentional changes to registration status, which occurred in connection with a system update in NgDP on 23 August 2023.

The case presentation for each case will be described separately below.

2.1.

Unintentional activation of read rights to other people's mailboxes in NgDP due to misunderstandings in connection with a data migration from Digital Post to NgDP (2023-442-0139)

On March 24, 2022, the Danish Agency for Digitalization reported a security breach to the Danish Data Protection Agency, which was due to the fact that read rights to digital mailboxes – 143 citizen mailboxes and 313 business mailboxes – had not been revoked, even though the rights had expired.

In the notification, the Danish Agency for Digitalization stated that the error occurred in connection with the migration of data from the former Digital Post to NgDP, and that the error occurred on March 21, 2022, when NgDP was put into operation.   

The error was discovered on March 22, 2022 and attempted to be corrected on March 22, 2022 and March 28, 2022, but the error was not finally corrected for all affected users until May 9, 2022, when the Digitization Agency discovered that the previous corrections did not solve the problem for all affected users.

In their statement of May 30, 2022, the Digitization Agency stated that the error occurred in connection with the migration of data from the former Digital Post to NgDP from Friday, March 18, 2022 at 5:00 p.m. to and including March 21, 2022 at 9:00 a.m. The Digitization Agency has stated in the case that the cause of the incident was a human error when mapping the read permission types in connection with the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated in its statement of 30 May 2022 that a total of 6425 users logged in and accessed corporate mailboxes while they had incorrect rights. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation further stated that a total of 15,097 users logged in and accessed civil mailboxes while they had incorrect rights.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated in its statement of 9 September 2022 that messages were opened in 118 civil mailboxes and 341 corporate mailboxes by users who should not have read rights to the mailboxes. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that the owners of these mailboxes have been notified of the security incident.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated in its statement of 9 September 2022 that the basis for the data migration – including read rights – was based on a dialogue between the current supplier, Netcompany A/S, and the transferring supplier, e-Boks A/S. There has subsequently been a misunderstanding in the communication between the suppliers.

The design for data migration was prepared based on the assumption that only active read rights would be provided by the submitting supplier. In this connection, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that for this reason it had not analyzed or designed according to a scenario with migration of non-active read rights. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has further stated that for the same reason there is no documentation for a mapping or filtering that takes into account a read rights status that is either active or non-active.

In their statement of 7 November 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that the misunderstanding between the submitting and receiving supplier was specifically due to the fact that in connection with the data migration it was assumed that a certain marking by the submitting supplier meant that there was an active read right, which was not the case. The assumption and any test cases were therefore based on the erroneous understanding of how the migrated data from the submitting supplier should be understood.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has further stated that the breach occurred due to a human error that could not be detected through testing, because the test would be based on the same misunderstanding between the parties.

In their statement of 7 November 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that in connection with the development of NgDP, a test environment was set up, consisting of QA, Test, Pre-Prod and Prod environments prior to implementation.

2.2.

A coding error in a functionality in NgDP led to missing and incorrect revocation of read rights to mailboxes (2023-442-0211)

On 27 February 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation reported a security breach that concerned errors in the functionality that enabled the revocation of read rights in NgDP. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that a citizen can create reading rights for their digital mailbox, which gives another person the opportunity to access the citizen's mail from public senders. Citizens can, by physically appearing at the citizen service, revoke a reading right that the latter has previously granted to another person. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated in the notification that the coding in the functionality that enabled the revocation was flawed.

In their statement of 11 April 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that the error had been present since NgDP was put into operation on 21 March 2022. During the development of NgDP, a module for rights management called "Administrative Access" was developed. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that the error occurred when a citizen service employee via the "Administrative Access" system - at a citizen's request - revoked a reading right. In some cases, the action resulted in the read permission being revoked for a different citizen's mailbox than the intended citizen who had been searched for in the system. The error meant that a number of citizens who physically appeared at the citizen service with the relevant matter did not have a read permission revoked for their own mailbox. Instead, it meant that the person with the read permission had a read permission revoked for another citizen's mailbox.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that during a subsequent and larger regression test it was discovered that if a person had read permission for several mailboxes, it was always the top read permission in the list that was removed, regardless of whether it was the read permission that the citizen service employee had searched for and chosen to remove. It appears from the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's statement that this specific scenario had not been identified in connection with the commissioning of NgDP, which is why this had not been tested earlier. If this specific scenario had been considered in their tests earlier, the error would have also been identified earlier.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has further stated in their statement of 11 April 2023 that the incident had the consequence that 12 read rights – which 9 citizens and 1 company were assigned – to 12 citizens' mailboxes have continued to be active, even though they should have been closed after a request to the Citizens' Service. Users who had unauthorized read rights to a mailbox could thus continue to read (new) mail in the mailbox after the date on which the read rights should have been closed. Logs show that there were unauthorized logins in 10 of the mailboxes during the period in which the error occurred.

Another consequence of the error was that 23 authorized read rights to 20 different citizens' mailboxes and 1 company's mailbox were deleted. The read rights were assigned to 14 citizens and one company. The error meant that 14 citizens and one company did not have access to the mailboxes that they rightfully should have had access to.

The error has been corrected, and those affected have been notified of the breach.

In their statement of April 11, 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalization stated that the agency had set requirements for the functionality and had tested that the solution met the requirements and acceptance criteria before NgDP was put into operation. The functionality went through a QA (quality control) and test, where it was tested that the functionality, which enabled the removal of read access, met the requirements and acceptance criteria.

It also appears from the statement that before the functionality was put into use, the Danish Agency for Digitalization ensured that all acceptance criteria were covered by automatic tests. In addition, the functionality underwent “end-to-end tests”. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has explained that this software testing method tests the application flow from start to finish, and the purpose of the test form was to simulate the real user scenario and validate the tested system as well as its components for integration and data integrity.

After the commissioning of “Administrative Access”, regression tests were carried out at each release (launch of a new version of software), to ensure that it was possible for a citizen service employee to assign and subsequently remove a read right to a citizen’s mailbox. Regression tests are carried out to check that code changes in the software do not affect the existing functionality of the product, and to ensure that the product works with a new functionality, bug fixes or any change to the existing functionality.

The Danish Agency for Digitization has stated that regression tests were performed in connection with a new version of the software. Such tests are performed in an internal test environment (the QA environment) and in an externally directed test environment (which is available to, for example, authorities that need to test their own systems against the NgDP) before it was put into the production environment. The Danish Agency for Digitization has stated that 67 regression tests were performed in the internal environment since January 3, 2022 and 74 regression tests in the externally directed test environment since January 5, 2022.

In their statement of April 11, 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitization has stated that the reason why the coding error was not identified through the tests performed is because the regression tests performed only took into account ensuring that in the user interface for the citizen who owns the mailbox, the correct read access was removed in situations where the citizen had granted read rights to multiple users. The user interface thus showed the correct number of reading rights for the citizen who owned the mailbox. However, the Danish Agency for Digitization has stated that in the user interface in “Administrative Access” it was not possible to see how many reading rights the user otherwise had for other citizens’ mailboxes. The Danish Agency for Digitization has stated that this was, among other things, the reason why the error was only identified about a year after the NgDP was put into operation.

Finally, the Danish Agency for Digitization has stated that the reason why the error was only detected on 24 February 2023 – about a year after NgDP was put into operation on 21 March 2022 – was because no changes were made to the functionality since the system was put into operation. The function had therefore been covered by a regression test, which includes the normal functionality with the assignment and revocation of reading rights, but not the special constellation where a user had several active reading rights. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that the error was found during a particularly thorough regression test in connection with a major upgrade of underlying components.

2.3.

A system error in NgDP led to users with read rights to a large number of mailboxes losing access to them (2023-442-0147)

On 8 April 2022, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation reported a breach of personal data security regarding errors in NgDP, where end users could not access their own mailboxes or mailboxes to which they had read rights. In the notification, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that upon login, the user was greeted with a blank page or a page that kept loading. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has also stated that the error only occurred upon login for users with read rights to multiple mailboxes. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that the error occurred in connection with the transition from the former Digital Post to NgDP. It is further stated in the notification that the error has been present since 21 March 2022, when NgDP was put into operation, and that the error was detected on 25 March 2022.

It is apparent from the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's follow-up notification of 17 May 2022 that the error occurred in connection with the mapping of rights, which resulted in a system error. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that the design and specification of the interface between the viewing clients (Rettighedsportal, e-Boks, mit.dk, Virk and borger.dk) and NgDP was not sufficient to handle some of the users who had many rights across mailboxes. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that if a user (citizen or company) had many rights, for example read rights to many citizen or company mailboxes, then NgDP could not handle the large amount of data associated with these users, as NgDP had to both retrieve and display data at the same time.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has further clarified that the error affected 7,166 end users and that the handling of the incident took place over several phases, and the error was finally fixed on 3 May 2022.

It is apparent from the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's statement of 29 June 2022 that the agency resolved the problems for the users who contacted the agency. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has further stated that 2,642 out of the 7,166 affected users did not attempt to log in to NgDP, and the users thus did not discover the lack of access. In the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's first notification of 8 April 2022, the agency stated that the public has been informed about the incident through virk.dk.

It is further apparent from the statement of 29 June 2022 that the error occurred for users who had many reading rights. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has subsequently stated that individual users had up to 400 and 700 reading rights. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has also stated that it was not well known that some citizens and employees had so many reading rights to other people's mailboxes, which is why this use case (condition) was not covered in the quality assurance of the NgDP and viewing clients projects (Rettighedsportal, e-Boks, mit.dk, Virk and borger.dk).

It also appears from the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's statement that the users affected by the incident were primarily citizens and companies who manage a mailbox on behalf of others, and there was a large group of guardians and lawyers who typically have many reading rights. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that the likely consequences of the breach were that these guardians were prevented from managing their NgDP administration on behalf of others due to the error. In addition, citizens under guardianship who could not handle NgDP themselves were possibly prevented from acting on notifications from authorities.

2.4.

Unintentional registration of citizens in NgDP as a result of a data migration from Digital Post to NgDP and a subsequent loading of data from CPR (2023-442-0197)

On 10 November 2022, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation reported a breach of personal data security, in which 42,834 citizens were mistakenly registered with NgDP.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation discovered the error on 4 November 2022, when a number of citizens who had left Denmark had contacted ATP because they had not been paid their pension. This was because the citizens had not completed and returned their annual life certificates from ATP Livslang Pension, which had been sent digitally to the citizens via NgDP instead of by physical mail, as they had been mistakenly registered with NgDP.

It appears from the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's follow-up notification of 1 December 2022 and the Agency's statement of 31 August 2023 that the error occurred in connection with the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP and with a subsequent entry of data from the CPR. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that the registration lists from the submitting supplier (e-Boks A/S) did not contain all citizens with the relevant status (i.e. registered or exempt). It is also stated that in connection with the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation was not aware that information was missing in the data submitted by the submitting supplier (e-Boks A/S).

A subsequent entry of data from the CPR resulted in a subset of citizens who were not migrated from e-Boks A/S being mistakenly entered into NgDP with the status "registered".

In their statement of 31 August 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation explained that the logic in NgDP, which handled “new” citizens from the CPR, was not correctly set up to handle citizens who were entered from the CPR. This was because the logic assumed that citizens were already known in the former Digital Post and either had the status “registered” or “exempt”.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has also stated that neither before the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP nor before the entry of data from the CPR was a control comparison made between the data that was handed over from e-Boks A/S and the data that was entered from the CPR.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that before the breach occurred, technical and organisational measures in the form of controls had been implemented. In their statement of 31 August 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that checks were carried out to ensure that new citizens were correctly created in NgDP, including, among other things: checking the correct creation of mailboxes and registration status when these citizens were created on the basis of data from the CPR. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that these checks were carried out during the development phase of NgDP.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated in its statement that NgDP was not developed to handle the fact that citizens were missing from the data transferred from e-Boks A/S. Therefore, these citizens were registered as new citizens who had to be registered with NgDP in connection with the entry of information from the CPR. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation had therefore not carried out further checks in connection with the entry of data from the CPR into NgDP.

However, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that in connection with the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP, checks were carried out to determine whether the data transferred from e-Boks A/S contained the relevant master data in order to be able to enter, for example, exemption status. It also appears from the statement that both machine and manual random checks were carried out after the data transferred from e-Boks A/S was entered into NgDP. These checks were carried out by the Danish Agency for Digitalisation to ensure that documents, powers of attorney and registration status were correctly entered into NgDP.

In their follow-up notification of 17 January 2023, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that a total of 42,834 citizens were mistakenly registered in NgDP. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that these citizens will be deregistered from NgDP. It also appears from the case that the Danish Agency for Digitalisation sent notification letters to the affected citizens.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation stated that authorities that have sent notifications in NgDP to citizens have been informed of the error regarding the erroneous registrations.

2.5 

Own operation case regarding unintentional change of registration status in NgDP as a result of a new release on 23 August 2023 (2023-432-0024)

On 29 August 2023 and 31 August 2023, the Danish Digitalisation Agency published an operation update on www.digitaliser.dk, in which it was announced that unintentional changes had occurred in the registration status of citizens and companies in NgDP. Based on these operation updates, the Danish Data Protection Agency sent a hearing to the Danish Digitalisation Agency on 5 December 2023. In this connection, the Danish Digitalisation Agency sent a statement in the case to the Danish Data Protection Agency on 8 January 2023.

It appears from the Digitization Agency's statement of January 8, 2023, that the release updated the way in which users' NemSMS was processed. The release was supposed to enable voluntary registration for NgDP for citizens residing in Greenland. However, the release triggered two errors in NgDP in relation to these changes.

One error was that a user's update or confirmation of contact information in NgDP caused the user's registration in NgDP to be removed. The error resulted in the registrations of 116,674 citizens and 1,778 companies in NgDP being removed.

The second error was that 20,963 citizens residing in Greenland were inadvertently registered in NgDP as a result of the release. In this connection, the Digitization Agency has stated that 393 of these citizens had received mail from public senders. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has subsequently stated that these citizens were neither covered by the Digital Post Act nor had voluntarily joined Digital Post. The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has therefore stated that messages sent to these citizens via NgDP had no legal effect for the citizens.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated in the case that the errors have been corrected and that those affected have been notified of the incident.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that the agency has assessed that it is unlikely that the breaches have had consequences for the rights or freedoms of natural persons.

The affected users, who had their registration in NgDP removed by mistake, received their messages by physical post. As far as the citizens who were mistakenly registered in NgDP are concerned, the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has assessed that this has also had no consequences for those affected, as the sending authorities were informed of the error and because the authorities had the opportunity to contact the citizens in other ways.

It is clear from the Danish Agency for Digitalisation's statement of 8 January 2023 that the agency tests the content of each release. It is also clear from the statement that a release goes through both manual and automated test cases before it is put into operation in the production environment.

The Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated in the statement that the registration status in NgDP was migrated from the former Digital Post, and these are continuously updated based on changes in the CPR and manual exemption of users. Prior to the incident, no measures had been established to ensure that the registration status was not inadvertently changed in connection with a new release, as the Danish Agency for Digitalisation had not previously considered this to be a possibility. 

Prior to the incident, it was not specifically checked whether changes in NemSMS subscriptions could have an impact on users' registration in NgDP, but the Danish Agency for Digitalisation has stated that this will happen in the future.

3. Reasons for the Danish Data Protection Agency's decision

In summary, the Danish Data Protection Agency's decision concerns a number of errors in NgDP, which consisted of:

Inadvertent activation of read rights to other people's mailboxes as a result of misunderstandings in connection with a data migration from Digital Post to NgDP. A coding error in a functionality in NgDP that led to the missing and incorrect cancellation of read rights to mailboxes. A system error in NgDP led to users with read rights to a large number of mailboxes losing access to them. Inadvertent registration of citizens to NgDP as a result of an error in connection with data migration from Digital Post to NgDP and a subsequent loading of data from the CPR.

In addition, the decision concerns a system update in NgDP on 23 August 2023, which resulted in a number of citizens and companies being incorrectly deregistered or registered with NgDP.

3.1. Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation

It follows from Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation that the data controller must implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the data controller's processing of personal data.

The data controller is therefore obliged to identify the risks that the data controller's processing poses to data subjects and to ensure that appropriate security measures are implemented to protect data subjects against those risks.

It also follows from Article 32(1)(b) and (d) that the data controller must, in this connection, inter alia, implement relevant measures with a view to maintaining the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and robustness of processing systems and services, as well as implement procedures for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of processing.

The Danish Data Protection Authority's assessment of the specific cases follows below.

3.1.1.

Inadvertent activation of read rights to other people's mailboxes in NgDP as a result of misunderstandings in connection with a data migration from Digital Post to NgDP (2023-442-0139)

The Danish Data Protection Authority is of the opinion that the requirement, cf. Article 32(1), for appropriate security will normally mean that, prior to a data migration between larger systems, great care is taken, including the mapping of different types of rights, as otherwise this may lead to errors that may have consequences for the data subjects, e.g. in the event that their information can be accessed by unauthorized persons. Furthermore, the Danish Data Protection Authority believes that, given the risks associated with data migration, there must be the necessary clarity and understanding of what migrated data includes, as otherwise it will not be possible to identify all likely error scenarios and conduct qualified tests to ensure that data migration does not lead to unintended changes in the system in question. 

The basis for the design of a data migration, including what the migrated data includes, should be in a task and solution description or similar. In this way, it is easier for the parties involved to identify any ambiguities or misunderstandings, and ensure that these are clarified before the data migration is carried out. 

The Danish Data Protection Authority believes that activating read rights to other people's mailboxes in NgDP, where the read right had expired, entails a risk of abuse, as mail messages - including mail received after the read right expired - can thereby be accessed by unauthorized persons. The Danish Data Protection Authority notes that citizens who grant read rights to their mailbox may be particularly vulnerable citizens – e.g. citizens under guardianship, children, patients or the elderly – which means that the risk to the data subjects in the event of any errors may be greater. The data subjects may, among other things, have difficulty in understanding and protecting themselves against any harmful effects that may be associated with unauthorized persons accessing their mailbox and reading new messages that the data subject received after the expiry of the read right.

On this basis, the Danish Data Protection Agency finds that – by not having ensured that the necessary care was taken in mapping the read rights in the sending and receiving postal solution system in connection with the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP, and by not having ensured a correct understanding of what a particular marking by the sending supplier meant, including what the data provided included – it has not acted in accordance with the rules in Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation. 1.

The Danish Data Protection Agency has emphasized that the Digitisation Agency did not have sufficient knowledge of what the received data included in the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP. The Danish Data Protection Agency has further emphasized that the Digitisation Agency should have investigated what the marking at the submitting supplier meant rather than relying solely on an assumption of what the marking in the submitting system meant, and that the agency had not sufficiently taken into account the risk of misunderstandings arising in the communication between the suppliers in connection with the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP.

3.1.2.

A coding error in a functionality in NgDP led to the missing and incorrect revocation of read rights to mailboxes (2023-442-0211)

The Danish Data Protection Agency is of the opinion that the requirement, cf. Article 32(1) of the Regulation on appropriate security will normally mean that, before a new system or a system in which system changes have been made, the system must be tested for errors or vulnerabilities. Such tests must, among other things, cover common user scenarios in the system in question. In this way, it is ensured that all functionalities and user scenarios in the system in question are not affected by errors or vulnerabilities, which, for example, could lead to a breach of personal data security. In this connection, all usage scenarios, rights and functions in the system must be identified in order to be able to define all relevant tests of the system.

It is the assessment of the Danish Data Protection Agency that the Digitalisation Agency – by not having carried out sufficient testing of the “Administrative Access” function and thereby having identified the coding error before the commissioning of NgDP – has not acted in accordance with the rules in Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation. 1.

The Danish Data Protection Agency has emphasized that only regression tests were conducted that included the normal functionality of granting and revoking read access, and that these tests did not take into account the special constellation where the user with read access had multiple active read rights. The Danish Digital Agency should have been aware that there were users with active read rights to multiple mailboxes, and that revoking read rights for users with multiple active read rights was a common user scenario in NgDP, which the agency should have tested before NgDP was put into operation.

The Danish Data Protection Agency has also emphasized that the error had been present for a longer period since NgDP was put into operation on March 21, 2022, and that the agency only discovered the error on February 24, 2023. 

Finally, the Danish Data Protection Agency has stated that the error would have been identified earlier if the thorough regression test that discovered the coding error had been performed earlier.

3.1.3.

A system error in NgDP led to users with read rights to a large number of mailboxes losing access to them (2023-442-0147)

The Danish Data Protection Authority is of the opinion that the requirement, cf. Article 32(1), for appropriate security normally implies that testing of systems must, among other things, be based on usage scenarios and functions before the system is put into operation. This also applies to usage scenarios that are only relevant to a small proportion of the users in a system, or functions in a system that are not used frequently. It is therefore necessary to map all common usage scenarios, rights, functions, etc. in order to be able to carry out relevant tests that can identify whether there are errors in the system with regard to all usage scenarios, rights, functions, etc. The requirement for appropriate security will also imply that a load test is carried out with regard to users with many rights in a system. This ensures that there is no overload in the system that could make the system inaccessible.

In this specific case, the Danish Data Protection Authority believes that a user's lack of access to their own mailbox or to a mailbox to which a user has read rights can have a significant impact on the data subjects and can entail a significant risk to the data subjects' economic or social rights.

Public authorities can, with acquittal effect, send mail to a citizen's digital mailbox, which the citizen is obliged to read. Mail from public senders typically contains messages regarding important agreements or response deadlines, and the citizen can be blamed if these are not met. It is therefore the Danish Data Protection Authority's belief that the lack of access by citizens - including any representatives - poses a significant risk of a significant loss of rights for the citizens concerned.

The Danish Data Protection Authority therefore finds that the Danish Digital Agency – by not having tested NgDP sufficiently and thereby discovering a system error that resulted in users with read rights to multiple mailboxes losing access to mailboxes to which they had read rights – has not acted in accordance with the rules in Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

In its assessment, the Danish Data Protection Authority has emphasized that the Danish Digital Agency was not aware that some users had a large number of read rights to other users' mailboxes, and were therefore not covered by the quality assurance of NgDP, which resulted in the agency not conducting sufficient testing of NgDP based on the use scenario where users have read rights to multiple mailboxes. The Danish Digital Agency has stated that it was not known to the agency that there were users with so many read rights. In this context, the Danish Data Protection Authority believes that the Danish Digital Agency should have identified whether there were users with a large number of rights across mailboxes before the implementation of NgDP, especially when the solution, among other things, it was possible to have read rights to multiple mailboxes.

The Danish Data Protection Agency notes that it is a normal usage scenario that a user, for example a guardian, lawyer or employees of a company, can have read rights to a large number of mailboxes – which was also possible in the former Digital Post and NgDP – and it was therefore a scenario that the Danish Agency for Digitalisation should have known about and tested for.

The Danish Data Protection Agency has also emphasized that the Danish Agency for Digitalisation did not conduct a sufficient load test before NgDP was put into operation, as the Danish Agency for Digitalisation should have conducted a load test focusing on whether NgDP acted unexpectedly due to an excessive load on the system that affected the availability of mailboxes in NgDP for users with many rights across mailboxes.

The Agency should also have informed the suppliers of the viewing client projects (Rettighedsportal, e-Boks, mit.dk, Virk and borger.dk) about the possibility that users could have read rights to multiple mailboxes, so that these suppliers also had the opportunity to test for this user scenario.

Finally, the Data Protection Authority has emphasized that the error had been present for a longer period of time since NgDP was put into operation on 21 March 2022, and that the Agency only finally corrected the error on 3 May 2022.

3.1.4.

Unintentional registration of citizens in NgDP as a result of a data migration from Digital Post to NgDP and a subsequent loading of data from CPR (2023-442-0197)

It is the Data Protection Authority's opinion that the requirement, cf. Article 32(1) on adequate security will normally mean that, before a data migration, it is ensured that there is the necessary clarity about what the transferred data includes. The requirement for adequate security in connection with a data migration will mean that it is checked whether a transferring supplier has transferred sufficient data to a receiving supplier before the data migration is carried out. It also follows from the requirement for adequate security that a system is tested for all likely error scenarios and vulnerabilities before commissioning.

In this specific case, the Danish Data Protection Authority's assessment is that the incorrect registrations of citizens in Digital Post entail a high risk to the social and economic rights of the citizens concerned. Incorrect registration of Digital Post may contribute to a citizen overlooking important mail from authorities, as citizens expect to receive mail physically, but due to an unintentional change in their registration status in NgDP instead only receive mail from authorities digitally.

The Danish Data Protection Authority must note that regardless of whether the Digitisation Agency has stated that the sending authorities were informed of the error, it cannot be ruled out that such an error may have had consequences for those affected, as the error could, among other things, lead to the postponement of any agreements or meetings with authorities. In addition, there may be situations where any delay in postal notifications from authorities may have far-reaching consequences for a citizen. This may, for example, be the case with mail from health authorities regarding summonses for checks or operations.

It is against this background that the Danish Data Protection Authority assesses that the Digitisation Agency – by not having checked in connection with the data migration from Digital Post to NgDP whether the data provided by Digital Post included all citizens with the relevant status (registered/exempted), and by not having tested before loading data from the CPR whether the NgDP was correctly set up to handle new citizens from the CPR – has not acted in accordance with the rules in Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation. 1.

The Danish Data Protection Agency has emphasized that the agency was not aware that the registration lists submitted by e-Boks A/S (the submitting supplier) did not contain information about all citizens with relevant registration status. The Danish Data Protection Agency has also emphasized that the logic in NgDP, which handled the citizens who were entered from the CPR, was not correctly set up to handle the citizens who were entered from the CPR, as the logic assumed that citizens were already known in the former Digital Post and either had the status "registered" or "exempt".

The Danish Data Protection Authority has also emphasized that no further checks were carried out in connection with the subsequent entry of data from the CPR into NgDP, and that no check comparison of data from e-Boks A/S and the CPR was carried out, and that the error had been present for a longer period since NgDP was put into operation on 21 March 2022, and the agency only discovered the error on 4 November 2022.

3.1.5.

Own operation case regarding unintentional change of registration status in NgDP as a result of a new release on 23 August 2023 (2023-432-0024)

It is the Danish Data Protection Authority's opinion that the requirement, cf. Article 32(1), for appropriate security will normally entail that, before putting changes into operation in a system, all likely error scenarios are identified and the changed system is tested for inappropriateness that the change may have caused. In order to determine which parts of the system are to be tested, the processing activities that are affected by the system changes must be identified. It must also be identified whether the system changes in question could affect parts of the environment or associated processes and functions in the system that are not directly subject to the system change itself.

Based on the above, the Danish Data Protection Agency finds that the Danish Digital Agency – by not having sufficiently tested NgDP before the new release was put into operation – has not acted in accordance with the rules in Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation. 1.

The Danish Data Protection Agency has emphasized that, in connection with the release, the Digital Agency had not sufficiently tested whether the changes to NemSMS subscriptions could result in users being mistakenly registered in NgDP with a status of “registered”, which could lead to those affected in the interim period – from the time the error occurred until the error was detected and reported to the authorities – receiving mail from authorities without their knowledge and without the sending authorities being aware that their letters had been sent via an incorrect communication channel. During that period, the sending authorities could rightly expect that postal messages sent via NgDP would be sent with legal effect. It should also be noted that any re-sending of messages, extension of deadlines or allocation of new appointment times by the sending authorities as a result of the incident could still lead to delays that could have an impact on the social, economic or health rights of citizens.

The Danish Data Protection Agency has also emphasized that prior to the incident, no measures were established to ensure that the registration status was not inadvertently changed in connection with a new release.

Regardless of whether the Danish Digital Agency has claimed that the breach did not pose a high risk to those affected, this cannot lead to a different result, as the erroneous registrations posed a risk to those affected, regardless of whether the sending authorities were made aware of the error, and the postal notifications did not have legal effect on the recipients.

3.1.6. Summary

At the national level, NgDP constitutes the primary form of communication between authorities, citizens and companies, where a large amount of personal data is processed, and where sending and receiving messages can have (serious) legal effect. Insufficient security measures in large public systems such as NgDP can thus have significant consequences for a large number of data subjects, and any errors caused by insufficient security measures can have a serious impact on the rights of individual data subjects.

In addition to the Danish Data Protection Authority's overall assessments, which appear above under each individual case, it is generally the Danish Data Protection Authority's view that the requirement for appropriate security will normally entail higher requirements for data controllers who offer public systems and solutions – such as NgDP – to a large number of users, especially when these users in many cases do not have the opportunity to opt out of the solution.

The Danish Data Protection Authority therefore finds that overall there is grounds for expressing serious criticism that the Danish Digital Agency has not acted in accordance with the rules in Article 32(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

 

\[1\] Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).
