Decision
A law firm was among the companies selected by the Danish Data Protection Agency for supervision in spring 2019. The Danish
Data Protection Authority's planned supervision focused on processing security, including in particular the encryption of emails, cf. Article 32
of the Data Protection Regulation, at the request of the Data Protection Authority in spring 2019. with the supervisory visit filled out a questionnaire and submitted this as well as additional material for the audit. The audit took place on April 8, 2019.
Following the supervision of the law firm, the Data Inspectorate finds a summary to conclude:
That the law firm - in accordance with Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation - uses end-to-end encryption when exchanging the S / MIME certificate over the tunnel mail community for transmission. of confidential and sensitive personal information over the Internet to municipalities, businesses and other recipients on the public tunnel list.
Furthermore, the law firm - in accordance with Article 32 of the Data Protection Regulation - uses encryption on the transport layer via forced TLS 1.2 for the transmission of confidential and sensitive personal data to clients and relatives etc. over the Internet.
That the law firm - in accordance with Article 5 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. 2, cf. Article 32 (1) (f), cf. 1 and 2 - has demonstrated that a risk assessment has been prepared which assesses the risks associated with the transmission of confidential and sensitive personal data over the Internet.
That the law firm is not aware of cases where confidential or sensitive personal data has been sent unencrypted over the Internet since January 1, 2019.
On this basis, the Danish Data Protection Agency considers the supervision closed and does not take any further action on this matter.
The following is a detailed review of the Danish Data Protection Agency's conclusions.
1. Using encryption when transmitting confidential and sensitive personal data over the Internet The
law firm has stated prior to the visit that the law firm sends confidential and sensitive personal information via e-mail over the Internet.
2. About the encryption solution The
law firm has stated that the encryption solution used works by sending all e-mail traffic through their data processor over a TLS 1.2 connection. Here the traffic will pass through two layers. The first layer scans for viruses and spam, and the second layer tries to encrypt the email in the following order of priority:
Via tunnel mail to the recipient's domain, so the email is sent end-to-end encrypted.
It is investigated whether the recipient has published an S / MIME certificate on the public tunnel mail list, in which case the e-mail is encrypted using that certificate.
It is being investigated whether the email can be sent with encryption on the transport layer via a forced TLS 1.2 connection.
The law firm's data processor has also stated that a "secure recipient's list" is used in addition - ie. a list of specific compatible recipient domains - to which end-to-end encryption automatically occurs.
3. E-mails to clients The
law firm has stated that communication with clients typically takes place by telephone and that e-mail correspondence with clients is very limited. To the extent that the law firm sends confidential or sensitive personal information to clients, the transmission is encrypted via a forced TLS 1.2 connection, if available. Emails sent encrypted to clients are typically emails with order confirmation / pricing information / privacy policy, which may also include information about the time of court hearings, etc. The
law firm has also stated that the law firm - in the rare case that an email does not can be sent encrypted to a client via the solution mentioned - makes a concrete assessment of whether the email contains information that could be sent via regular email.
Finally, the law firm has stated that the law firm sends confidential and sensitive personal information by regular mail to clients who cannot receive encrypted email.
3.1. Summary
On the basis of the information provided by the law firm, the Data Inspectorate assumes that the law firm uses compulsory TLS when emails containing confidential or sensitive personal data are sent to clients. Thus, the Data Inspectorate finds that the law firm uses adequate processing security when sending such emails.
4. E-mails to other recipients The
law firm has stated that communication with the media, relatives and potential clients is rarely carried out via e-mail, the communication being primarily by telephone. To the extent that the law firm communicates with these recipients via email, this is usually done via encrypted email.
The law firm has further stated that the law firm communicates encrypted with the police and the court via tunnel mail, and it may occasionally happen that the law firm communicates directly with judges via tunnel mail.
Finally, the law firm has stated that the law firm also sends emails via mobile phone. During a staff meeting on December 8, 2018, the employees were informed that encrypted e-mail could now be sent via the phone internally in the organization as well as to other domains that have tunnel mail. The law firm has stated that the law firm therefore assumes that employees only send emails with confidential and sensitive personal information from the phone if the recipient has tunnel mail.
4.1. Summary The Danish
Data Protection Agency assumes, on the basis of what the law firm stated, that the law firm primarily communicates with media, relatives and potential clients by telephone, and that if e-mail is used, it is encrypted.

The risk assessment also shows how this risk is reduced to an appropriate level by using tunnel mail or forced TLS if possible, and otherwise by assessing whether the email can be forwarded with opportunistic TLS or whether anonymization or forwarding should be used instead. by ordinary mail.
