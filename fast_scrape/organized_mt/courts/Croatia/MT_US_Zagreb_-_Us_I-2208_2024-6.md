## English Summary

### Facts

A controller brought an action before the Administrative Court of Zagreb seeking annulment of a decision made by the Agencija za zaštitu osobnih podataka (Croatian DPA) where they were fined €2,500.

The contested decision had found that controller had infringed [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") by using CCTV in and outside of their premises, a kebab shop, with signage only being visible upon entering the store. It was also found that an outdoor terrace had no signage at all.

The controller argued that the fine amount was excessive and requests annulment of the decision and its adoption without the fine. The controller further agued that in relation to the outdoor terrace, this area is only accessible through the shopping centre where there are existing signs highlighting that CCTV is in operation. The controller contended that a warning under Article 58(2)(1) GDPR in lieu of a fine would have been more appropriate in the circumstance.

The DPA argued that the decision was taking lawfully and based on a correct application of the law. The DPA noted that the small notices were not visible to data subjects before entering the recording perimeter and the notice published on the controller’s website was insufficient and did not include the contact details of the controller. The DPA further submitted that they were obliged to impose and administrative fine in the circumstances as a more lenient sanction in this case was not provided for under the law.

### Holding

The Court firstly highlighted an inconsistency in the contested decision. The DPA had at one point highlighted the existence of CCTV in the outdoor terrace, but further on in the decision, failed to include this area in the list of areas covered by CCTV. The Court further noted that although the decision found an infringement of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") on the part of the controller, there were no reasons for this provided in the decision.

The Court was further critical of the lack of clarity in the DPA’s decision as to the existence or the absence of a “side door” present in the terrace which would allow data subjects to enter the CCTV perimeter without having first been notified as to the existence of recording.

The Court also disagreed with the DPA’s determination that the notices displayed by the controller were insufficient. Although accepting that the notices seemed to be directed primarily at individual who wished to make a complaint about the food service (a requirement under Croatian national law), the Court highlighted that the existence of the CCTV use was also noted on the sign and the contact details of the controller were present. The Court rejected the DPA’s finding of an infringement of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") in respect of this sign and categorized the DPA’s decision as being “excessively formalistic”.

The Court further rejected the DPA’s findings that it was only upon entering the store that data subjects were informed of the processing and that the signs in question were too small. The Court commented that the lack of specificity of the decision precluded the upholding of the first finding, and that the DPA’s decision provided no details as to the size of the sign or any justification for their finding on that point.

Accordingly, the Court annulled the decision the DPA and ordered them to pay the controller’s costs.

REPUBLIC OF CROATIAADMINISTRATIVE COURT IN ZAGREBAvenija Dubrovnik 6, ZagrebRegistration number: Us I-2208/2024-6IN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIAJUDGMENTThe Administrative Court in Zagreb, presided over by the judge of that court, Ante Drezga, and Gordana Katarina Ronyi, recorder, in the administrative dispute of the plaintiff VALBO SNAGA d.o.o., Zagreb, Heinzelova 8, OIB: 69419352608, represented by the authorized representative Branko Kirin, attorney in Zagreb, Savska cesta 32, against the defendant the Agency for the Protection of Personal Data, Zagreb, Ulica grada Vukovara 54, OIB: 28454963989, for an administrative fine, 18 April 2025,judgment is given. The decision of the Personal Data Protection Agency, CLASS: UP/I- 034-01/24-01/7, REGULATION NUMBER: 567-04-01/04-24-1 of 15 February 2024 is annulled.II. The defendant is ordered to reimburse the plaintiff, within 15 days from the date of delivery of the final judgment, the cost of the administrative dispute in the amount of EUR 1,250.00 (in words: one thousand two hundred and fifty euros).Reasoning1. The contested decision of the defendant, CLASS: UP/I-034-01/24-01/7, REGULATION NUMBER: 567-04-01/04-24-1 of 15 February 2024, decided: 1. It is established that the controller is the company Valbo snaga d.o.o. from Zagreb, Ulica Vjekoslava Heinzela 8 (OIB: 69419352608), contrary to Article 27 paragraph 1 of the Act on the Implementation of the General Regulation on Data Protection, failed to indicate that Ali Kebab's catering facility at \[address\] in \[address\] (within the Supernova Garden Mali Shopping Center), i.e. a single room in it and the external surface of the facility is under video surveillance, in such a way that the sign is visible at the latest when entering the perimeter recording. 2. It is established that the controller is the company Valbo strength d.o.o. from Zagreb, Ulica Vjekoslava Heinzela 8 (OIB: 69419352608), contrary to Article 27, paragraph 2 of the Act on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation, failed to indicate that the Ali Kebab catering facility at the address \[address\] in \[address\] (as part of the Supernova Garden Mali Shopping Center) or individual rooms therein are under video surveillance and failed to highlight all relevant information in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation, in particular information about the data controller and contact information through which the data subject can exercise his or her rights. For the violations described in points 1 and 2 of the operative part of this decision, in accordance with the provisions of Article 51, paragraph 1, indent 1 of the Act on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation, an administrative fine of: 2,500.00 Euros (in words: two thousand five hundred Euros) is imposed on the company Valbo snaga d.o.o. from Zagreb. The personal data processor Valbo snaga d.o.o. from Zagreb, Ulica Vjekoslava Heinzela 8, is obliged to pay the imposed administrative fine in favor of the state budget within 15 days from the date of entry into force of this decision in favor of the account number: \[bank account number\], model HR64 and reference to the approval number - 6092-25860- 69419352608 with the indication - "administrative fines imposed by the AZOP". 4. If the personal data processor Valbo snaga d.o.o. from Zagreb, Ulica Vjekoslava Heinzela 8, fails to pay the imposed administrative fine within 15 days from the date of entry into force of this decision, the Personal Data Protection Agency will, in accordance with Article 46, paragraph 2 of the Act on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation, notify the Regional Office of the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance in whose territory the registered office of the aforementioned company is located, in order to collect the administrative fine by force in accordance with the regulations on forced tax collection. 5. Personal data processing manager Valbo snaga d.o.o. from Zagreb, Ulica Vjekoslava Heinzela 8, is obliged to submit proof of payment to the Personal Data Protection Agency within 15 days of the payment being made. "2. The plaintiff in the complaint essentially states that notices with a camera symbol are displayed at the entrance to the facility, while the data on the controller and contact details are available on the plaintiff's website. He points out that there are no other irregularities identified, and that he cooperated during the inspection, did not act with the intention of violating the regulations and has not been previously punished. He believes that the penalty is too severe and contrary to Article 83 of the General Regulation because the purpose has already been achieved by eliminating irregularities during the procedure, and other measures were possible. The plaintiff requests the annulment of the contested decision and the adoption of a decision without imposing a fine. 3. The defendant in the response to the complaint essentially states that he acted in the procedure in accordance with Article 57, paragraph 1 and Article 58, paragraph 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation, as well as with the Act on the Implementation of that Regulation and the Act on the General administrative procedure, and that the contested decision was made lawfully, based on the established facts and the correct application of the law. He states that small-format notices were displayed on the building that were not clearly visible before entering the perimeter of the recording, and that there was no notice at all at the second entrance, and that the plaintiff thereby violated the obligation under Article 27 of the Act. He points out that publishing information only on the website is not sufficient, but that a physical display of the so-called first layer of notice (short and clear information about the surveillance) is also required, which was not fulfilled. He also refers to the guidelines of the European Data Protection Board. He points out that the subject of the surveillance related exclusively to informing respondents via video surveillance, so the claims about the compliance of the business operations as a whole are not decisive. The defendant points out that he was obliged to impose an administrative fine, because the law does not provide for more lenient measures in this case. He points out that the amount of the fine was determined taking into account all mitigating circumstances and that the controller had sufficient time (since 2018) to comply with the regulations. He believes that the decision was made lawfully, objectively and based on relevant facts and proposes to dismiss the complaint as unfounded.4. Assessing the legality of the contested decisions, the Court reviewed the court file and the defendant's file and held a hearing on 15 April 2025 in the presence of the parties' attorneys. The plaintiff's attorney disputes the allegation in the response to the complaint that the area of the outdoor terrace was not marked in accordance with Article 27 of the Act on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation, because: 1. the outdoor terrace was not the subject of surveillance camera recording, which was confirmed by the decision of the supervisory authority, and 2. that the terrace is accessed exclusively from the interior of the shopping center, where visual and verbal signs about video surveillance are displayed in several places. In relation to the imposed administrative measure (fine), he considers it to be too strict, because the defendant could have imposed a precautionary measure pursuant to Article 58 of the General Regulation. He states that, pursuant to Article 83 of the General Regulation, a fine is applied only when other measures are not possible. He emphasizes that The identified omissions were not of such gravity as to justify imposing a fine, and all irregularities were eliminated during the supervision. It proposes the annulment of the defendant's decision. The defendant's attorney maintained the allegations in the response to the complaint.5. The claim is well-founded.6. In the proceedings preceding the adoption of the contested decision, it was established:- that there are eight video surveillance cameras in the catering facility, which are located in the food service area, kitchen and hallway;- that there is a small-format notice about video surveillance at the entrance to the shopping center, which is not clearly visible before entering the recording perimeter;- that there is no notice about video surveillance at the other entrance (from the terrace/parking lot);- that the existing notice does not contain information about the controller and contact information through which the data subject can exercise his or her rights.7. Based on the above facts, it was established that the plaintiff's actions as the controller were contrary to Article 27, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Act on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (Official Gazette, No. 42/18.), which prescribe: a clear and visible video surveillance sign before entering the recording perimeter and the provision of all relevant information to the respondents in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016). The defendant decided to impose an administrative fine of EUR 2,500.00, because it assessed that such a measure was: proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement, effective because it indicates the obligation to comply with the law, dissuasive both for the specific controller and for other entities applying video surveillance. The penalty was imposed pursuant to Articles 44, 45 and 51 of the Act on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation and Article 58 paragraph 2. point (i) and Article 83. paragraph 2. of the General Data Protection Regulation.8.1. According to the provision of Article 27. paragraph 1. of the Act on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation, the controller or processor is obliged to mark that the facility or individual room therein and the external surface of the facility is under video surveillance, and the mark should be visible at the latest when entering the recording perimeter.8.2. According to the provision of Article 27. paragraph 2. of the Act on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation, the notification from paragraph 1. of this Article should contain all relevant information in accordance with the provision of Article 13. of the General Data Protection Regulation, and in particular a simple and easily understandable image with text providing the data subjects with the following information:- that the area is under video surveillance- data on the controller- contact details through which the data subject can exercise their rights.9. It follows from part of point I. of the operative part of the contested decision that the plaintiff, among other things, failed to mark that the external surface of the facility is under video surveillance, but from the reasoning of the contested decision, as well as the data in the case file, it follows that the surveillance determined where the cameras were placed (food serving area, kitchen and hallway), but it was not determined whether the cameras only covered the food serving area, kitchen and hallway or whether the subject of the surveillance cameras was the outdoor terrace. In view of the above, there is a contradiction between that part of the operative part of the contested decision, on the one hand, and the reasoning of the contested decision and the information in the case file, on the other.10. It follows from part of point II. of the operative part of the contested decision that the plaintiff did not highlight all relevant information in accordance with the provisions of Article 13.of the General Data Protection Regulation. However, the reasoning of the contested decision in relation to that part of the operative part does not contain any reasons at all.11. As a result of the above, the contested decision is flawed in the form of contradictions between the operative part and the reasoning, while in part there is no reason at all, which implies that the defendant did not take into account the rules of procedure, i.e. that the provisions of Article 98 of the General Administrative Procedure Act (Official Gazette, No. 47/09 and 110/21) were violated.12. According to the defendant, there should have been a sign stating that there was video surveillance at the point of access from the terrace to the interior of the catering facility.13. According to the position of this Court, in the application of Article 27, paragraph 1 of the Act, the notice of video surveillance must be visible at the latest upon entering the recording perimeter – therefore, not only at the main entrance to the facility, but at every physical access to the monitored area.14. The defendant correctly established that the entrance to the interior of the building is from the direction of the terrace, which area is undoubtedly under camera surveillance and that there is no notice of video surveillance at that location.15. If the respondent can access the interior area (which is under video surveillance) without first passing the notice of video surveillance, then it can be considered that the legal obligation under Article 27, paragraph 1 of the Act has not been fulfilled. In this context, the key question is whether this access leads to the recording perimeter without prior visual information about the existence of video surveillance.16. If the entrance to the terrace is closed and can only be accessed from the interior of the building, then anyone coming from the direction of the terrace has previously received information about the existence of video surveillance when entering the catering facility. However, if the terrace can also be accessed from the parking lot of the shopping center, then anyone coming from the direction of the terrace to the area under video surveillance from the direction of the terrace has not been properly informed about entering the monitored area of the interior of the catering facility.17. From the Report on the conducted surveillance, CLASS: 042-03/23-01/85, NUMBER: 567-12/04-23-03 of October 11, 2023, it only follows that this is a "second side entrance (from the direction of the terrace/parking lot)". However, based on this formulation from the Report, it is not possible to conclude with certainty that this is a second variant, i.e. a situation in which the interior of the catering facility can be accessed from the parking lot, thus entering the perimeter of the recording without prior notice. The expression "from the direction of the terrace/parking lot" is indefinite because it is not known whether the terrace has physical open access from the parking lot or not (e.g. the terrace is completely fenced off, etc.), or whether there is physical access to the interior of the catering facility that allows avoiding the main entrance to the catering facility. The law requires that the subject, before entering the recording perimeter, familiarize himself with the fact that the area is under surveillance - which means that there must be a concrete possibility for someone to enter from the direction of the parking lot without being previously informed about entering the area under video surveillance. If this is not clearly proven, it cannot be claimed that a violation has occurred. 18. The inspection did not clearly establish whether there are separate accesses to the terrace that allow avoiding the main entrance to the restaurant. The very wording "second side entrance (from the direction of the terrace/parking lot)" does not allow a clear conclusion about the variant in which there would be a violation of the obligation from Article 27 of the Act. The defendant should have clearly determined whether there is a real possibility of entering the recording perimeter without prior notice. 19. During the conducted surveillance, it was established that there is a video surveillance notice at the entrance to the shopping center. The notice in question is in nature a sticker with a figurative camera sign, the verbal sign "The premises are under video surveillance", and contains other verbal signs, including the sign: "Fast food and simple quick service facility "MN", \[address\], Valbo snaga d.o.o., Heinzelova 8, 10000 Zagreb, OIB: 69419352608" and "Notice on the method of submitting a written complaint" which also contains the plaintiff's contact e-mail address.20. Although the "Notice on the method of submitting a written complaint" primarily refers to the fulfillment of the plaintiff's obligation as a caterer to inform about the guest's right to submit a written complaint in a catering establishment pursuant to the Catering Activities Act, in this case it can be assessed that the requirements from Article 27, paragraph 2 of the Act Z have been substantially fulfilled - the notice in question contains information that the premises are under video surveillance (contains: a figurative sign and the text "The premises are under video surveillance"), the data on the controller are clearly stated (the name of the legal entity: Valbo snaga d.o.o., address and OIB are stated), and the contact address exists and can be used to exercise rights, although it is not formally designated as a "contact for personal data protection". Therefore, the defendant's determination that the notice in question does not contain the information prescribed by law can be assessed as excessively formalistic. In view of the above, the defendant's determination that the existing notice does not contain all the information prescribed by law cannot be accepted.21. The defendant assessed that the existing notice of video surveillance is small in size and is not clearly visible before entering the recording perimeter. First of all, it cannot be concluded from the data in the case file that the respondent first enters the recording perimeter, and only after entering the recording scope does he recognize the fact that the area he has already entered is under video surveillance based on the sign. Furthermore, if the sign precedes entering the recording perimeter, then the defendant's assessment of the visibility of the warning sign, i.e. the determination that the notice is "small in size" and that the sign is not "clearly visible", remains completely unspecified and without specification. The defendant did not specify the size of the existing notice, nor did he provide specific reasons, given this information, why the respondent could not understand that he was entering a monitored area based on the existing visual elements. Without this, it cannot be assessed whether a violation actually occurred in that part.22. In view of the above, this Court cannot, at least for the time being, accept the defendant's determination that the plaintiff violated the provisions of Article 27 of the Act.23. Accordingly, the Court found that the contested decision was unlawful.24. In view of all the above, it was decided as in point I of the operative part of this judgment, applying the provisions of Article 117, paragraph 1 of the Administrative Disputes Act (Official Gazette, No.: 36/24, hereinafter referred to as the ZUS).25. According to the provisions of Article 147, paragraph 1 of the ZUS, the party that loses the dispute shall bear all the costs of the dispute in full, unless otherwise prescribed by law. The defendant lost the dispute and, pursuant to Article 147, paragraph 1 of the ZUS, is obliged to reimburse the plaintiff for justified expenses incurred during the dispute, which include the attorney's fee. The plaintiff should be granted the cost of drafting the complaint and representing the party at the hearing as justified expenses within the meaning of Article 144, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the ZUS. Bearing in mind that in accordance with Article 144, paragraph 3 of the ZUS, the value of the subject matter of the dispute is considered inestimable, applying the Tariff on fees and reimbursement of expenses for the work of lawyers (Official Gazette, No. 138/23), deciding within the limits of the claim, the plaintiff is entitled to compensation in the amount of EUR 500.00 for each action, increased by VAT, a total of EUR 1,250.00. Accordingly, pursuant to Article 148, paragraph 4 of the ZUS, it was decided as point II. of the operative part of this judgment. In Zagreb, 18 April 2025. Judge: Ante Drezga Instructions on legal remedy: An appeal against this judgment is allowed to the High Administrative Court of the Republic of Croatia. The appeal shall be filed through this court within 15 days from the date of delivery of the judgment. DNA: 1. Attorney Branko Kirin, Savska cesta 32, \[address\] Zagreb 2.
