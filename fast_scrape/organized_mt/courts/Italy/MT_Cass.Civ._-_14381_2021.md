## English Summary

### Facts

The case follows back to a pre-GDPR [decision](https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/5796783) of the Italian DPA (Garante), that declared unlawful the processing of personal data for an automated system that would assess the reliability of the members of an association. The members would voluntarily provide the data for the creating of such profiles, and the processing of data would be therefore based on consent.

The authority, however, among other lines of reasoning, considered that consent could not be freely given in that case, as it would be provided because of fear to possible negative consequences (e.g. losing a contract or ending a contractual relationship). The Garante also mentioned the high number of persons implicated, the lack of adequate security measures, the lack of necessity and proportionality, the unreliability of the system, etc.

Additionally, the Garante remarked that there were doubts about the appropriateness of entrusting to an automated system all decisions on particularly delicate and complex aspects such as those relating to the reputation of the individuals involved. Not only because of the difficulty of effectively assessing reliability, but because the data used for it could also be inaccurate _ex ante_.

Therefore, the Garante prohibited the controller to continue with the processing.

This decision was appealed before the Roman Civil Court of Appeal, that in its [judgment](https://www.it.mevaluate.com/documents/20194/141047/Sentenza+Tribunale+Roma+Sez.1+n.5715+del+2018+\(Accoglimento+del+Ricorso+Mevaluate+contro+Garante+Privacy\)/68923e5a-e96c-44c7-8e10-187215eacbf0) partly upheld the appeal, as it considered that knowledge of the logic underlying the operation of the algorithm was not a prerequisite for the validity of the consent, but rather related to a subsequent and possible assessment of the market in which the algorithm in question could have been deemed inadequate, imperfect or malfunctioning.

### Holding

The Italian Cassation Court considered that consent is not valid if the algorithm is not transparent, as the data subject cannot be truly aware of a consent to the processing of personal data without knowing exactly how it will be used to reach a certain decision.

The Court concluded that consent is only valid when expressed freely and specifically in reference to a treatment that is clearly identified. In a case in which a system is processing personal data to create reputational profiles of individuals and scoring reliability, the requirement of "informed consent" can not be considered to be satisfied if the executive scheme of the algorithm and the elements of which it is composed remain unknown or not known by the interested parties.

     II.- The first four reasons, to be examined jointly, u
are well founded.
     It must be said that contrary to what is maintained by the PG n

     IV. - Except that this C orte has already had a way of
consider that, for the purposes of the lawfulness of the treatment based on

consent, art. 23 of Legislative Decree no. 196 of 2003 (so-called privacy code)
presupposes not only consent, but also that consent is
validly loaned (see Cass. n. 17278-18, Cass. n. 16358-18).

     Specifically, art. 23 provides that (a) the treatment of i
personal data from private individuals or public economic bodies is i
admitted only with the express consent of the interested party; (b) the u

consent may concern the entire treatment or one or more n
operations of the same; (c) the consent is validly given
only if it is expressed freely and specifically in reference to i

     The assessment of the lawfulness of such treatment, based on the

     VIII. - The sentence must therefore be quashed, with absorption of the
remaining grounds for appeal.
     The case must be referred back to the m edesim or tribunal of

Rome, in different composition, for new examination.
