## English Summary

### Facts

Toplofikacia Sofia EAD, the controller, is a Bulgarian company that provides heating services to its customers, both individuals and companies, in the Sofia metropolitan area. The controller submitted a request to the Ministry of Regional Development for access to several registers of personal data of the Bulgarian population. The reasoning for the request was that the access will facilitate the execution of the contracts between the controller and its customers.

The Ministry of Regional Development refused to provide access to the registers that keep significant amount of personal data, including inheritance information, and advised the controller for the optional procedure under Article 125(3) of local Energy Act to seek permission from the Bulgarian Data Protection Authority.

In May 2022 the controller submitted a request to the DPA asking for revocation of the Ministry's decision. In its request the company referred to the legal bases of (i) the performance of contract ([Articles 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR")), (ii) the compliance with a legal obligation ([Article 6(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR")), and (iii) a task carried out in the public interest ([Article 6(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR")) for the requested access to the registers.

The DPA carried out a corresponding analysis for each of these legal bases and decided that none of them is applicable for the controller. The DPA refused to grant permanent access to the registers and instructed the company to provide a solid justification for any future request to the Ministry.

In July 2022, the controller appealed the decision of the DPA before the Administrative Court of Sofia.

The Administrative Court of Sofia upheld the decision confirming the analysis of the DPA and on top of it pointing out that the registers provide information for the entire population of Bulgaria, while the company operates only in the Sofia region.

Subsequently, the controller appealed the decision to the Supreme Administrative Court.

### Holding

The Supreme Administrative Court of Bulgaria upheld the decision by the lower court in its entirety. The Court repeated the justification of the DPA and the lower court about why the controller cannot rely on the specified legal basis, respectively:

*   [Article 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") is not applicable because Article 125(3) of the local Energy Act specifies the data needed for conclusion of contract;
*   [Article 6(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") is not available as a legal basis because the processing is not necessary to comply with a legal obligation under a law;
*   [Article 6(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") is not applicable because the collection of receivables of a company is not a public interest.

## Comment

The company's main objective was to obtain information from the registers about the heirs of its deceased customers who had outstanding debts. It is much easier for a Bulgarian creditor to start a debt collection procedure if he has this information at hand, rather than having to go to court to find out who the heirs are and where they live.
