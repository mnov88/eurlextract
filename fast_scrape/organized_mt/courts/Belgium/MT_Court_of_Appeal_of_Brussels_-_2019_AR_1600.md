## English Summary

### Facts

In August 2018, the DPA received a complaint from a customer (the data subject) regarding a liquor store (the controller). According to the complaint, the store had required this person to let them scan their electronic ID in order to issue a customer card. After an investigation, the DPA concluded that the controller had breached the GDPR. More specifically, according to the DPA the controller:

1\. Did not have a valid legal basis for processing. Consent was not freely given because no alternative was offered to the complainant, in violation of [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR");

2\. Did not provide the complainant with enough information prior to the processing, in violation of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR");

3\. Processed more personal data than necessary, including national ID number, date of birth and gender, in violation of [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR").

### Dispute

The appeal against the DPA's decision was based on 9 points, among which was the claim that the DPA violated [Article 52(1)](/index.php?title=Article_52_GDPR#1 "Article 52 GDPR"), [Article 54(2)](/index.php?title=Article_54_GDPR#2 "Article 54 GDPR") and [Article 82(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR#2 "Article 82 GDPR"). Most importantly, the controller challenged two of the three findings of the DPA, which had led to the fine: the absence of a valid legal basis for personal data processing and the breach of the data minimization principle. They did not contest the lack of information.

### Holding

The Court annulled the DPA’s decision as it was insufficiently reasoned and based on a legislation that was not applicable at the time of the complaint. The Court did not have the power to order the DPA to pay back the fine, as that falls outside of its jurisdiction, but it did quash the decision imposing the fine.

The Court held that, first, the DPA had no evidence to support the finding that the controller was actually processing the national ID number of the data subject. Second, the controller was not obliged to give the data subject an alternative way of creating a discount card because the relevant provision of the e-ID law was not applicable at the time. Thirdly, the Court found that no personal data processing took place because the complainant had refused to have her e-ID scanned. Fourth, the Court considered that the DPA’s finding that the data subject’s date of birth was not used to verify their age, was a mere assumption. Fifth, the DPA should not have assumed that the data subject would have suffered an undeniable disadvantage by missing out on discounts available via the client card. The Court found that this is not a disadvantage because only potential benefit was lost in this case.

Hence, the Court upheld the appeal against and annulled the DPA's decision.

              website of the Data Protection Authority, albeit after anonymisation.

The appellant gives the following factual account:

        1.     The Appellant, the applicant, is a beverage company established at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. It is a

       family business with more than 40 years of experience. It has offices at \_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_ and
       \_\_\_\_\_.

        2.     In the past, the Apellant used paper loyalty cards in order to obtain benefits.
       know to customers. Recently, the appellant has switched to an electronic

       Cash register software system that also allows the electronic identity card (elD card}
       of a customer to be read electronically using the barcode and on this basis

       granting advantages on purchases.

       The present case concerns the administrative procedure launched by the GBA.

       against the appellant following the complaint of a (1} client of the appellant. The name of
       this customer is otherwise irrelevant and is therefore not mentioned. The customer is hereinafter referred to as

       referred to as 'person concerned'.

       3.     On 28 August 2018, the party concerned lodged a complaint with the
       Data protection authority because she did not want her elD card to be read in
       to grant discounts on its purchases (section A.1}. The complaint was as follows:

              Presentation of the facts
              On Friday 8 June, I went to buy drinks from the appellant,\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

              \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. With a few bottles of spirits it was a high
              amount. At the checkout - arrived they asked me if I would not like a loyalty card.
              I wish. I_ia "They asked my identity card to read it in. l_
              replied that I didn't want to give my identity card, but that I would feel free to give the
              the data needed to create a loyalty card on paper for a short while
              wanted to put. I was refused the loyalty card - they only make

              customer cards by reading the identity card.

              This/this scenario happened again on Saturday 30 June - this time in the shop
              of drinks trade appellant at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Because that day we
              having a BBQ with a grate group, the bill for booze was again a hefty

              amount. When I arrived at the checkout they asked me if I would not like a loyalty card.

                                                              �

             L \_JCourt of Appeal Brussels -2019/AR/1600- p. 4

              I said 'yes'. They asked me to read my identity card and I answered.

              dot I didn't want to give my identity card, but dot I feel free to give the data that I need
              wanted to put the goods on paper before creating a loyalty card. The
              customer card was refused to me - one creates enke/ k/anten cards by
              of reading the identity card. At dot moment there were
              different people at the deck mass. One of them also made the remark
              dot it cannot dot for a customer's card the identity card must be read in/receive
              warden. The lady at the checkout said dot she had nothing to do with this and now dot this

              was a mani�on of work.

              Maybe a k/eine remark: I'm 51 years old and I really don't look like a/s anyone
              of 16 years of age:)

       In other words, the person concerned agreed to the processing of her personal data

       information by the appellant to receive a loyalty card. However, it did not wish these
       Processing took place by means of reading her elD card.

       4.     On 26 September 2018 Mr. Willem De Beuckelaere of

       President of the GBA Dispute Settlement Chamber, the Inspector General of the
       ln section of the GBA as follows:

       10. On 3 June 2019, the Disputes Chamber informed the appellant of the decision to withdraw the

       on its possibilities such as requesting a copy of the file as well as the
       submission of defences. It was only at this point that the appellant was given the opportunity to

       to take note of the content of the Complainant's complaint against the processing of
       personal data by the appellant.

       On the same day, the GBA Oak sent a registered letter to the person concerned. This

        the person concerned was refused a loyalty card from the beverage trade, although they would like to

           a loyalty card:

               "For the Dispute Chamber, the following is paramount, Data processing

               e/ektronic identity card, which is irrelevant. The

       In other words, the Chamber of Disputes 'assumes' that the appellant has not received the

The Law of 19 July 1991 on population registers, identity cards, the
Alien cards and residence documents now state in Article 6 § 4 second and third
Member:
       The National Register number and the Joto of the holder may only be used if

This text was added by the law of 25 November 2018 and entered into force on 23 December.

2018. This law is therefore not applicable to the facts giving rise to the current dispute.
since the complaint dates from 28 August 2018.

At the time of the complaint, the text was as follows:
       "Any automated check of the card by optical or other/eesprocessing means must
       be the subject of a royal decree, no opinion of the sectoral committee of the

       National Register referred to in section 15 of the Act of 8 August 1983 on the regulation of an
       National Register of Natural Persons, ..,

The motives of the inspectorate - which the GBA states serve as a basis for the
decision - are unlawful. A law that was absolutely inapplicable at the time of the complaint and
a "recommendation" which has no legal force cannot serve as a basis for the

assessment of conduct as contrary to the legislation in force.

It has not been demonstrated, nor has it been conclusively proven, that at the time of the complaint a
The alternative had to be offered.

The contested decision is also under consideration:

       "The Chamber of Disputes also notes the processing of customer data.
       (surname, first names, address, date of birth, gender, date of birth, date from which the person concerned is a customer)
       and the amount of purchases) the starting/of minimum data processing not

       The fact that the defendant's hand/method in relation to the creation of loyalty cards
       the beginning/of minimum data processing does not n,,eeft, the Dispute/Chamber is consequently
       of the opinion that the infringement of Article 5.1. c)AVG has been proven.

No EID card was offered by the complainant in this case, so there is no processing at all
of its data. Therefore, the GBA does not show any actual infringement in relation to

personal data.

             I PAGE 01- 00001582885-0027-0033-01-01-�

             L \_JCourt of Appeal Brussels 2019/AR/1600-p. 28

At that time, the complainant was not (yet) legally obliged to offer alternatives. This is different since
23 December 2018, but that regulation could not have been applied retroactively by the GBA.

In addition, the Dispute Carner is wrongly based on a number of unsubstantiated assumptions:
- that a loyalty card of a beverage company would not have been used to check the

    a ban on the sale of alcohol to minors;
- that the complainant would suffer an undeniable disadvantage as a result of the creation of a

    loyalty card, discounts would run riot. This is not a disadvantage because only a
    possible additional advantage is lost (the Court emphasises). The situation is different when the EID card
    request a legal or contractual right (e.g. the right to a guarantee) to

    to be shortened or retained.

A breach of Article 5.1. c)AVG has not been proven in this specific case.

The appellant's sixth plea is well-founded on this point.

8.2. Infringement opart. 6.1. AVG:

The GBA shall further base its decision on a breach of Article 6.1. AVG, namely that the

the lawfulness of the processing is subject to the data subject's consent for the
softening of his personal data for one or more specific purposes or the processing thereof
is necessary in order to safeguard the legitimate interests of the
controller or of a third party, except where interests or fundamental rights
and fundamental freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data,

outweigh those interests, especially when the person involved is a single child.

       processing necessity/justification could be necessary for the protection of his legitimate interest.

To the extent that the GBA again refers to the lack of an alternative, it refers again (see
point 8.1 above) to a secondary legislation which is not applicable.

The Market Court refers to what was stated above under point 8.1.
The infringement of Article 6.1. AVG has therefore not been proven. The seventh ground of appeal of the

reasons for the contested decision are incompatible with the documents in the file and with the

9.     The sanction

In addition to the fact that the contested decision does not contain an adequate statement of reasons (see point 8.3.
for this), the penalty imposed, namely a fine of €10,000, is in turn inadequate
motivated.

lndien with the GBA may have argued that it is not every possible sanction of Article 83.2 AVG
it should be overflowing and it should not justify why some sanctions were not considered,

this does not detract from the fact that the choice of the sanction imposed is adequate
must be substantiated. When determining the sanction in concrete terms, the following should be taken into account
general criteria should be leading:

     the seriousness of the infringement;
     the duration of the infringement;

     the necessary deterrent effect to prevent further infringements.

The GBA shall determine the manner in which it considers that a sanction is appropriate.

However, as stated above, a decision of the GBA with regard to (the amount of) an
financial penalty is not binding on the Market Court.

The Market Court shall assess the extent of a possible sanction in such a way that, on the one hand, in
is appropriate to the circumstances and proportionate to the infringement found
and to the capacity of the party committing the infringement.

The mere statement that the infringement relates to a fundamental legal principle of

and the fact that no alternative was available was not a valid legal basis on

For that reason alone, the contested decision should be annulled. Oak the Eighth
middeI of the appellant is well-founded.

The reasons currently put forward by the GBA in conclusion (No 106) to post factum the imposed and
sanctions implemented cannot be taken into account. The
