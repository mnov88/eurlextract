## English Summary

### Facts

In this case, the first controller is a collection agency which obtained an enforcement order from a court against a person with the same name as the data subject. During the enforcement procedure the debtor could not be found at the address which was originally stored with this first controller. As a result, the first controller asked a second controller to find out where the debtor lived. After its research, the second controller gave the first controller the personal information belonging to the data subject, thinking it was the actual debtor's data. This information included the data subject's name, date of birth and address. It turned out that the data subject and the debtor were father and son, and had the same first name and surname.

The data subject (the father) requested and erasure of his data to both controllers since he was not the actual debtor they were searching for. He also requested injunctive relief to stop the controllers from processing his data in the future. Furthermore, he filed a complaint with Regional Court of Hannover (Landgericht Hannover - LG Hannover) claiming damages in the amount of €10,000 for potentially being registered as a debtor in Schufa's database, which is Germany's biggest credit agency.

The controllers argued that they were allowed to process the data and obliged to retain it according to German tax law. Furthermore, they stated that the storage of the data was justified in order to avoid future confusions, which was not only in their own interest, but in the data subject's interest as well. Additionally, one of the controllers noted that the data subject was sufficiently protected from being held liable for his son's debt, since the data is marked as invalid in their database.

The LG Hannover rejected the data subject's claim, who in turn appealed this decision with the Higher Regional Court of Dresden (Oberlandesgericht Dresden - OLG Dresden).

### Holding

The OLG Dresden overturned this decision, and ordered the deletion of the data, as well as granting the request for injunctive relief. However, it did not grant the damages claimed by the data subject.

The court reasoned that the data stored is personal data according to [Article 4(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#1 "Article 4 GDPR"), and that the data subject had a right to erasure pursuant to [Article 17(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1d "Article 17 GDPR"). According to the OLG Dresden, the data could not be lawfully processed under [Article 6(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1c "Article 6 GDPR") since there was no legal obligation to retain the name, address and date of birth under German tax law. The court also held that processing was not justified under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") either, since storing the data was not indispensable for the collection of the debt.

Moreover, the OLG Dresden stated that despite being marked as invalid, the possibility that the data would be processed in the future, or be sent to third parties could not be excluded. According to the court, the fact that the data subject could get confused with his son again as a result of the deletion of the data, was a risk he took according to his own free will.

Additionally, the OLG Dresden stipulated that the data subject had a right to injunctive relief according to § 823(1) in conjunction with § 1004 of the German Civil Code (_Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch - BGB_). The court reasoned that the right to injunctive relief applies in addition to the rights of the GDPR, as this is the only way to ensure full legal protection of a data subject whose data has been processed unlawfully. According to the court, it cannot be presumed that the GDPR excludes a right to injunctive relief under national law, just because it does not contain such a right itself. On the contrary, in the court's view, this gap in legal protection must be closed on the basis of national law, because without the right to injunctive relief, the protection of the data subject's fundamental rights would be insufficient.

In this case, the court established that the two requirements for injunctive relief (the violation of the claimant's right and the risk of repetition) were met. The unlawful processing violated the data subject's right to informational self-determination under Article 1(1) in conjunction with Article 2(1) of the German Constitution (_Grundgesetz für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland_ _\- GG_). The court also held that the violation suggests that there is a risk of repetition of this unlawful behavior by the controllers in the future, and that they did not provide any submission to challenge this presumption. Lastly, the OLG Dresden decided that the data subject was not entitled to damages pursuant to [Article 82(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR#1 "Article 82 GDPR") because the data subject had not conclusively demonstrated a material or immaterial damage. An inquiry at the Schufa showed that there was no negative entry related to the data subject, and therefore the court held that the assertion that he had been discredited as a result of the unlawful processing was unfounded.

## Comment

This case shows another small ambiguity in the GDPR. What happens after the data subject has enforced its right to erasure. Can the controller just collect the same data again and process it in the same manner, or can the data subject achieve protection against identical future violations of the controller by means of an injunctive relief?

The question whether the data subject has a right to injunctive relief is disputed among German Regional Courts. Under the old data protection law (pre-GDPR) this was the case.

The majority of German courts answer this question in the affirmative (other decisions are: Landgericht Darmstadt, 13 O 244/19; LG München, 3 O 17493/20, https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=LG\_M%C3%BCnchen\_-\_3\_O\_17493/20).

The VG Regensburg (RN 9 K 19.1061 - [VG Regensburg - RN 9 K 19.1061](/index.php?title=VG_Regensburg_-_RN_9_K_19.1061 "VG Regensburg - RN 9 K 19.1061")) takes another stance. It decided that a claim for an injunction is inadmissible. [Article 79(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_79_GDPR#1 "Article 79 GDPR") at the end speaks of "that his or her rights under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing of his or her personal data in non-compliance with this Regulation". The VG Regensburg is of the opinion that "rights" refers to the explicit rights of the data subject under the GDPR, especially Chapter III GDPR, and must be differentiated from the non-compliance with the GDPR. This, however, would mean that the data subject at first would have to exercise one of his rights against the controller, and only if the controller does not comply, the data subject could go to court enforcing these rights (and only them).

The opinion of the VG Regensburg is also in contrast to the majority view of the scholars. According to them, the term "rights" does not only refer to the explicit rights in Chapter III GDPR but to any provision that protects each individual data subject directly. E.g. The "rights" of a data subject are violated every time its personal data is unlawfully processed. However, its rights are not violated if the controller only infringes objectives provisions such as [Articles 35](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR "Article 35 GDPR") or [37 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR "Article 37 GDPR").

According to this regulation, the processing is to protect the legitimate
interests of the person responsible or a third party, unless the
Interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject who
require the protection of personal data prevail. The concept of
legitimate interests is to be understood broadly. It includes both legal and
also economic and non-material interests (cf. Schantz in Simitis/Hornung/
Spiecker \[editor\] in data protection law, 2019, Art. 6 (1) para. 98). To the
legitimate interests of the defendant to 2) include the interest in a

efficient receivables management (cf. AG Hamburg - St. Georg, judgment of
08/25/2020 - 912 C 145/20, para. 37 - juris). The bad debts of the creditors
should be kept as low as possible, the necessary liquidity of
Business enterprise preserved and the debtor subject to reimbursement so
be charged as little as possible with further costs (according to AG Hamburg - St.
Georg, loc.cit.). In view of this, the defendant to 2) has an interest in
