The regional court of Rostock (LG Rostock) held that tracking cookies can only be placed with the user's active consent. A preset permission that is only to be confirmed via an "OK" button is not sufficient.

Further, the court held that the use of Google Analytics results in joint controllership of the website provider using this tool and Google.

## English Summary

### Facts

The German consumer organisation _Bundesverband der Verbraucherzentralen und Verbraucherverbände - Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband e.V._ (vzbv, the claimant) filed a lawsuit against _advocado GmbH_ (advocado, the defendant), a German-based company that runs an online platform where attorneys can offer their services. The defendant's website had used a cookie banner with pre-ticked boxes for the use of marketing and analytics cookies. This included the use of tools such as Google Analytics that entail a data transfer to third countries.

The claimant argued that the data processing in connection with the placed cookies was unlawful under Article 6(1) GDPR: A user's consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR could not be considered valid under Articles 4(11) and 7 GDPR, especially since the boxes were pre-ticked. Moreover, the claimant claimed that the defendant had violated Articles 5(1)(a), 13/14, 26 and 44 et seqq. GDPR as it had failed to properly inform users of the scope of intended processing activities, joint controllers and international data transfers in connection with the use of cookies.

The defendant stated that it had based the use of cookies on legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR until the CJEU issued its [decision C-673/17 on 01.10.2019 ("Planet 49")](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C-673/17_-_Planet49 "CJEU - C-673/17 - Planet49"). Afterwards, the defandent argued that they changed the legal basis for processing to consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR, which it considered valid under Articles 4(11) and 7 GDPR. The defendant also stated that it was the sole controller for the processing activities - there were no joint controllers involved, only processors.

(Furthermore, the claimant had also argued that some provisions in the defendant's general terms and conditions were unlawful from a civil law / consumer protection law perspective. This will not be discussed further in this summary.)

### Dispute

*   Was it necessary to ask for the users' consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR or could the processing activities in connection with the use of marketing and analytics cookies be based on legitimate interest under Artilce 6(1)(f)?
*   Was the consent given by users' when interacting with the defendant's cookie banner valid under Articles 6(1)(a), 4(11) and 7 GDPR?
*   Did the defendant violate GDPR provisions on transparency?
*   Was the defendant the sole controller regarding the processing activities in connection with the use of marketing and analytics cookies or were there any joint controllers?

### Holding

#### Legal basis and validity of consent

The court held that the marketing and analytics cookies used by the defendant can only be placed with the users' consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR: § 15(3) Telemediengesetz that deals with such cookies must be interpreted in light of Article 5(3) e-Privacy Directive, which requires consent for cookies not strictly necessary for technical reasons.

Taking into consideration the design of the cookie banner and the lack of information provided to a website user, the court held that consent given could not be considered valid under Articles 6(1)(a), 4(11) and 7 GDPR. The banner featured pre-ticked boxes and a big "OK" button. The option "use only necessary cookies" was designed to not look like an interactive button but rather a link. Consent could therefore not be considered "freely given" and was invalid.

#### Transparency

The court further held that the defendant violated Article 13 GDPR by mentioning an incorrect transfer mechanism under Articles 44 et seqq. GDPR for data transfers in connection with the use of cookies.

#### Sole or joint controllership when using Google Analytics?

Lastly, the court held that the use of Google Analytics results in joint controllership of the website provider using this tool and Google. Google does not qualify as the website provider's processor under Article 4(7). This is because Google does not process the data solely for the purpose of use by the website provider. Rather, Google, like other third-party providers, expressly reserves the right to process the data for its own purposes as well. The fact that the defendant and Google entered into a data processing agreement under Article 28 GDPR does not change this assessment. The court's legal view is in line with the [official opinion of the "Datenschutzkonferenz"](https://www.datenschutzkonferenz-online.de/media/dskb/20200526_beschluss_hinweise_zum_einsatz_von_google_analytics.pdf), a gathering of all German DPAs.

The defendant refers to the General Terms and Conditions submitted as Annex K15 when mediating legal services to consumers via the aforementioned internet platform. This states, inter alia, in clause 10:
"Advocado reserves the right to unilaterally amend these GTCs - insofar as they are introduced into the contractual relationship with the customer - at any time, insofar as this is necessary to eliminate subsequent equivalence disruptions or to adapt to changed legal or technical framework conditions and these do not unreasonably disadvantage the user. advocado shall inform the customer of any changes by e-mail, stating the content of the amended provisions. This e-mail shall contain the amended GTC as well as a reference to the right of objection, the objection period and its consequences in the event of failure to object."
In a letter dated 30 April 2019 (K16), the plaintiff demanded that the defendant cease and desist.

The plaintiff submits that due to the scripts and similar third-party technologies implemented in the defendant's website, which, for example, place third-party cookies on users' end devices, store personal data therein, read out and evaluate user information, personal data such as the IP address and browser information of website visitors are processed across websites for the purposes of advertising, the creation of user profiles and for comparable commercial purposes. However, this processing is not lawful. Thus, even taking into account the cookie banner, there was no effective consent of the consumers within the meaning of Art. 4 No. II, 6 para. I sentence I lit. a), 7 DSGVO. On the one hand, in view of the pre-filled checkboxes, there was no effective expression of consent. Furthermore, there was no possibility to refuse the setting of third-party cookies or to select or deselect individual providers. In addition, the cookie banner did not contain the necessary information for informed consent pursuant to Art. 4 No. II DSGVO. There was also no other legal basis for the processing of the data within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 DSGVO. The cookie banner used in the meantime was also not suitable for providing effective consent. The plaintiff is further of the opinion that the defendant's data protection declaration violates the information obligations under Art. 12 et seq. DSGVO and the principles of transparency and good faith. Furthermore, there is a breach of the information obligations under Article 26(2) sentence 2 of the GDPR, since the defendant and the third party providers are to be regarded as joint controllers with regard to the processing of personal data taking place, about which the defendant does not provide information. There is a lack of an agreement between the defendant and the third party providers, which is necessary in this respect, and the transparent publication thereof vis-à-vis consumers. Finally, the plaintiff is of the opinion that the clause in clause 10 of the General Terms and Conditions of Business and Use is invalid.
The plaintiff requests,
Order the defendant, upon avoidance of a fine to be fixed by the court for the case of infringement - in lieu of which, order imprisonment - or order imprisonment for a term of up to six months, (order fine in the individual case not exceeding EI-JR 250,000.00, order imprisonment for a total term not exceeding two years), to be enforced on its managing directors

This e-mail shall contain the amended GTC as well as a reference to the right of objection, the objection period and its consequences in the event of failure to object."

The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff EUR 214.00 plus interest at five percentage points above the respective base rate since 19 June 2019.
The defendant requests that the action be dismissed.
It submits that the plaintiff itself uses the Matamo analysis tool on the website it operates, so that the action against the defendant is an abuse of rights. Moreover, the application under I. is inadmissible for lack of sufficient specificity. It further submits that it did not use the
cookie banner and the privacy policy on 01.10.2019 due to the ruling of the ECJ of 01.10.2019 (Ref.: C-673/17 ). Until then, also taking into account the publications of the Conference of the Independent Data Protection Authorities of the Federation and the Länder (DSK), the legal opinion held by the DSK that there is a legitimate interest pursuant to Art.
6 para. I lit. f) DSGVO in the collection and processing of data could not be objected to. Consequently, it had also provided comprehensive and comprehensible information about the data collection, citing the relevant legal basis. The processing of personal data in dispute was covered by the users' consent. The consent was voluntary within the meaning of Art. 4 No. Il DSGVO. The users would be enabled to make an informed decision. Even more extensive information, as demanded by the plaintiff, would not be practically feasible. The plaintiff does not explain to what extent a violation of the information obligations pursuant to Art. 12 et seq. GDPR should exist. There is no joint responsibility within the meaning of Article 26 (2) sentence 2 of the GDPR. The defendant was the sole responsible party and had commissioned the third-party providers with the processing of the data. The third party providers had no decision-making powers with regard to data processing and were bound by instructions. Data processing not in accordance with the defendant's specifications was inadmissible. There was thus commissioned data processing pursuant to Article 4(8) of the GDPR. The objectionable adjustment clause was admissible. It contained the requirements and the scope of the permissible changes. In addition, it had to be taken into account that the defendant did not offer any paid services to its clients. It merely referred the clients to the appropriate lawyers.
Reasons for decision
l.
The action is largely admissible.
However, to the extent that the applicant requests under point 2 that the defendant refrain from offering telemedia without providing users, at the beginning of the usage process, with information pursuant to Article 14 GDPR relating to the processing in a precise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible form in clear and simple language, the action is inadmissible for lack of sufficient specificity of the claim.
1 .
The plaintiff has standing to sue.
a)
With regard to the applications under I., 2. and 3., the right to bring an action follows from § 3 para. Section 2(1) sentence 1, (2) sentence 1 no. 11 UKlaG in conjunction with Section 15(3) sentence 1 TMG. Section 15 para. 3 p. 1 TMG.
The hitherto disputed continued application of SS 11 et seq. TMG (cf. e.g. OLG Hamburg, WRP 2020, 505; OLG Stuttgart, WRP 2020, 509; also plaintiff's statement of 28.06.2018 at: https://www.vzbv.de/sites/defauIt/fiIes/downIoads/2018/06/29/18-06-28\_vbv-steIIungnahme\_ dsk\_ tmg-dsgvo.pdf) has been confirmed by the Federal Court of Justice to the effect that the consent requirement for cookies continues to be assessed pursuant to Section 15 (3) sentence I TMG in a Directive-compliant interpretation according to the ePrivacy Directive, and not according to the GDPR.
However, the continued applicability does not only refer to the consent requirement itself, but also to the information and clarification obligations existing in connection with the processing of personal data by means of cookies "for purposes of advertising, market research or for the needs-based design of telemedia" (cf. Section 15 para. 3 p. 1 TMG). Art. 5 para. 3 p. 1 of the ePrivacy Directive (RI- 2002/58/EC) states: "Member States shall ensure that the storage of information or access to information already stored in a subscriber's or user's terminal equipment is only allowed if the subscriber or user concerned is informed, on the basis of clear and comprehensive information provided in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, inter alia, about the purposes of the processing.The interpretation of the provision of Section 15 (3) sentence 1 of the German Telemedia Act in conformity with the Directive as stipulated by the Federal Court of Justice therefore also requires the inclusion of all information duties. The plaintiff also expressly invokes Section 15 (3) sentence I TMG.
A stay of proceedings against the background of the preliminary ruling procedure of the
Court of Justice of the European Union in the legal dispute before the Federal Court of Justice, Ref.: I ZR 186/17, in the matter of Bundesverband der Verbraucherzentralen und Verbraucherverbände - Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband e.V. ./. Facebook Irland Limited - is therefore not indicated.
With regard to the application under 4, the right to bring an action exists pursuant to 3 para.
2.
However, the second request is partially inadmissible for lack of sufficient specificity of the claim.
a)  
Pursuant to section 253 (2) no. 2 ZPO, an application for an injunction - and pursuant to section 313 (I) no. 4 ZPO, a judgment based on it - may not be worded so vaguely that the subject matter of the dispute and the scope of the court's power of review and decision (s. 308 (I) ZPO) are not recognisably delimited, the defendant is therefore unable to defend himself exhaustively and the decision as to what the defendant is prohibited from doing is ultimately left to the enforcement court. For this reason, applications for injunctions that merely repeat the wording of a law are generally to be considered too vague and thus inadmissible. A different approach may apply if the statutory prohibition is unambiguous and specific, its scope of application is clarified by an established interpretation or the plaintiff makes it sufficiently clear that he does not claim a prohibition in the scope of the wording of the law but orients his request for injunctive relief to the specific act of infringement. In such cases, however, the specificity of the request for an injunction generally requires that there is no dispute between the parties that the conduct complained of fulfils the element of the offence in question (see BGH GRUR 2017, 422 - ARD-Buffet).
Sufficient definiteness is also to be affirmed if the interpretation of the request on the basis of the plaintiff's factual submission clearly shows what is sought (see BGH GRUR 2015, 1237 - Erfolgsprämie für die Kundengewinnung).
b)
The request under point 2 is thus inadmissible to the extent that the defendant is to refrain from offering telemedia without providing users with information pursuant to Article 14 GDPR relating to the processing in a precise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form in clear and plain language at the beginning of the usage process.
  The request to 2. refers to the omission of the offer of telemedia without providing users with information pursuant to Art. 13, Art. 14, Art. 7 para. 3 sentence 3 as well as Art. 21 para. 4 GDPR, which relate to the processing, in a precise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible form in clear and simple language at the beginning of the usage process.
(2)	The plaintiff has substantiated his claim by complaining about the lack of information about the rights of access, deletion, rectification and appeal to the supervisory authority pursuant to Article 13 (2) of the GDPR. In addition, the plaintiff has cited the lack of information pursuant to Article 13(I)(f) of the GDPR on transfers of personal data to a third country as well as the lack of a justification pursuant to Article 45 et seq. of the GDPR. GDPR. Furthermore, the plaintiff cited the lack of information about the right of withdrawal pursuant to Art. 13(2)(c) of the GDPR on the cookie banner as a violation. Finally, he alleges a violation of the information in a "precise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible form in a clear and simple language" by the fact that several legal bases are stated with regard to data processing by means of third-party cookies, although only the relevant legal basis should be stated pursuant to Art. 13(1)(c) GDPR,
(3)	Insofar as the application refers to Article 7 (3) sentence 3 and Article 21 (4) of the GDPR, this is sufficient, as the standards themselves define in a sufficiently clear and concrete manner the requirement to inform the data subject about the right of withdrawal with regard to consent given or the general right to object to data processing.
c)
On the other hand, the plaintiff did not elaborate on the violations of Art. 14 GDPR (information obligations if the personal data are not collected from the data subject) mentioned in the application in the statement of grounds. Since the infringement is already not described, the application, which only consists of a reference to the statutory provision, is not to be considered sufficiently specific.
d)
Apart from that, however, the applications are sufficiently specific and thus admissible. Insofar as the defendant expressly cites the insufficient definiteness of the application under No. I, the Chamber does not follow this objection.
(1)	The action to be refrained from is sufficiently defined in the request to I . The defendant is to refrain from using technologies for tracking users for analysis and marketing purposes, which transmit users' personal data to third parties, unless the users have given their informed and voluntary consent. In this respect, there is no need to specifically name individual technologies ("cookies") to which the injunction is to apply.
(2)	Whether and which technologies the defendant uses unlawfully from the plaintiff's point of view is solely relevant to the merits of the action. The plaintiff does not have to limit himself to only prohibiting the defendant from using technologies already in use, nor does he have to specifically name all conceivable technologies. In this respect, it is sufficient that, on the one hand, the objectionable mode of action of the technologies used is defined, in this case the transmission of personal data to third parties through the tracking of users for analysis and marketing purposes and, on the other hand, the absence of effective consent as a further prerequisite.
(3)	Insofar as the application uses terms from the wording of the GDPR with regard to consent, which - as the case law of the last few years shows - were quite contentious in detail, it is necessary, with reference to the statement of grounds for the action and in accordance with the decisions of the ECJ of 1 October 2019 and the Federal Court of Justice of 28 May 2020 on the necessity and form of effective consent in the use of cookies (cf.2019 and the BGH of 28 May 2020 on the necessity and design of effective consent in the use of cookies (see ECJ GRIJR 2019, 1198 - Planet 49; BGH GRUR 2020, 891 - Cookie Einwilligung II), it can be assumed that these terms are also sufficiently specific.
3.
An abuse of rights by the plaintiff in the prosecution of the defendant is not apparent. Insofar as the defendant refers to the use of the analysis tool "Matamo" for its objection, this reference is already unsuitable because with this technology there is precisely no transmission of data to third-party providers (cf. only the entry "Matamo" at WIKIPEDIA).
Il.
The action is completely unfounded with regard to the application under I 3. and 4. and with regard to the (partially) admissible application under 2. also only partially unfounded.
The plaintiff is entitled to claim damages against the defendant pursuant to § 2 para. Art. 5 para. 3 ePrivacy-RL in conjunction with. The defendant is entitled to injunctive relief pursuant to section 15 para. 3 sentence I of the German Telemedia Act (TMG) in accordance with the operative part of sections I., 2. and 3. and pursuant to section I para. I UKlaG and sections 8 para. I, 3 para. I, 3a UWG in accordance with the operative part of section 4.
1.
The plaintiff has a claim against the defendant for an injunction against the use of technologies in telemedia for tracking users for analysis and marketing purposes, which transmit personal data of users to third parties and thereby track the behaviour of users across websites, if no informed and voluntary consent of the users has been given pursuant to Art. 5 para. 3 ePrivacy Directive in conjunction with Art. 15 para. Section 15 (3) sentence I of the German Telemedia Act (TMG) for this processing.
The provisions of the GDPR are not directly applicable due to the blocking effect of Article 5 (3) of the ePrivacy Directive pursuant to Article 95 of the GDPR. However, the content of the information and education obligations is nevertheless derived from the provisions of the GDPR. This is because Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive refers to the Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC), which in turn is to be understood as a legal consequence reference to the GDPR pursuant to Article 94(2) of the GDPR. Therefore, the norms of the GDPR, specifically Art. Art. 4 No. I I , Art. 6 para. 1 sentence l lit a), Art. 7, Art. 12, Art. 14 and Art. 26 para. 2 sentence 2 DSGVO. Insofar as the provisions of the GDPR are referred to in the following, this is done in the aforementioned sense.
a)
The defendant unauthorisedly processed personal data by transmitting it to third parties without the effective consent of the users pursuant to S 15 para. 3 sentence I TMG.
(1) Pursuant to Article 5 (1) (a) of the GDPR, personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly and in a manner that is comprehensible to the data subject. The processing of personal data is lawful if at least one of the conditions set out in Art. 6 (I) of the GDPR is met.
aa)	According to Art. 4 No. I GDPR, "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Thus, the dynamic IP address that is stored by a provider of online media services when a person accesses a website that this provider makes generally accessible also counts as a personal data for the provider (cf. BGH NJW 2017, 2416 with reference to ECJ NJW 2016, 3579).
bb)	According to Art. 4 No. 2 GDPR, "processing" means any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, filing, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction. The provision or disclosure to a third party is indisputably "processing" within the meaning of the GDPR.  
(2)	The defendant uses technologies on its website that place third-party cookies on users' end devices. The use of the cookies referred to in Annexes KI I - K13 is undisputed.
The plaintiff further argued, naming various tracking cookies, that personal data, such as the IP address, was transferred across websites. With regard to the implemented tool "Google Analytics", the defendant denied that the IP address was forwarded to the third party provider. In all other respects, however, it merely denied in general terms that data is transmitted across websites.
This is insufficient in this respect, as the defendant bears the burden of presentation and proof that the design of the website complies with data protection law, as follows from Art. 5(2) and Art. 24(1) DSGVO (cf. BeckOK DatenschutzR/Schantz, 32nd ed. 1.5.2020, DS-GVO Art. 5, marginal no. 39 with further references). Since the tracking technologies specifically named by the plaintiff (cf. written statement of 04.06.2020, p. 7) are not only capable in principle, but are also regularly used precisely to collect personal data and transmit it to third-party providers, the defendant would therefore have to specifically state and demonstrate that the cookies mentioned do not transmit any personal data to other websites. It did not meet this burden of proof.
Moreover, in its privacy policy (Annexes KII - K13), the defendant itself described the function of the cookies in the description of the cookies to the effect that they serve to track the user  across several websites and also to identify the user across visits and devices.
(3)	The consent required for the use of these cookies could not be obtained at the time of the warning with the cookie banner used by the defendant (Annex K6).
be issued effectively.
aa)	The use of the cookies in dispute here requires consent. The necessity of consent results from Section 15 sub-section 3 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG), which, in view of the provision in Article 5 sub-section 3 sentence I of Directive 2002/58/EC (E-Privacy Directive), is to be interpreted in conformity with the Directive to the effect that the service provider may only use cookies to create user profiles for the purposes of advertising or market research with the consent of the user (see BGH
GRUR 2020, 891 - Cookie Consent Il).
bb)	The users could not give effective consent to the data processing specifically objected to here with the cookie banner provided by the defendant (Annex K6) due to the selected default setting - all cookies selected (so-called opt-out). With the decision of the Federal Court of Justice of 28 May 2020 on the necessity and the design of effective consent in the use of cookies (see Federal Court of Justice GRUR 2020, 891 - Cookie Consent Il), it is clear that the opt-out variant chosen by the defendant is not suitable for this purpose.
b)
The presumption of the existence of a risk of repetition based on the infringement to be established is not rebutted by the submitted change of the banner. At the oral hearing, the board corrected its initial indication in this respect in the summons of 14 April 2020. In the board's view, the defendant had not (yet) eliminated the infringement. The cookie banner now used by the defendant also does not fulfil the requirements for effective consent.
 According to Art. 4 No. Il GDPR, "consent" of the data subject means any freely given specific, informed and unambiguous indication of his or her wishes in the form of a statement or other unambiguous affirmative act by which the data subject signifies his or her agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.
The BGH stated in the aforementioned decision:
According to Article 4(II) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, consent is any freely given specific, informed and unambiguous indication of wishes in the form of a statement or other unambiguous affirmative act by which the data subject signifies his or her agreement to personal data relating to him or her being processed. According to Recital 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, consent should be given by an unambiguous affirmative act indicating voluntarily, for the specific case, in an informed manner and in an unambiguous manner, that the data subject consents to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. Consent is given for the specific case if the content, purpose and scope of the declaration are sufficiently specific (cf. BeckOK.DatenschutzR/Schild, 31st edition \[as of 1 February 2020\], Art. 4 DS-GVO marginal no. 125; Buchner/Kühling in Kühling/Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, 2nd edition, Art. 4 DS-GVO marginal no. 8).
(2) Effective consent is therefore also not possible with the cookie banner now used. This is because all cookies are pre-selected and are "activated" by pressing the green "Allow cookie" button. Thus, the design of the cookie banner basically corresponds to the design in the case decided by the BGH. Although the consumer has the option of having the details displayed
 
and to deselect individual cookies. In fact, however, the consumer will regularly shy away from the effort of such a procedure and therefore press the button without prior information about the details. In this way, the consumer does not know the consequences of his declaration.
The fact that with the cookie banner now used, the user also has the option of limiting his consent to technically necessary cookies via the "Only use necessary cookies" area does not change the assessment. In this respect, it should be noted that this button is not even recognisable as a clickable button. In addition, it also takes a back seat to the "Allow cookie" button, which is highlighted in green and thus appears to be pre-assigned. This option will therefore not be perceived as an equivalent consent option by a large number of consumers. The introductory text does not change this, as it does not explain which cookies are pre-assigned and how, and thus which cookies are "activated" by which button.
2.
The plaintiff has a claim against the defendant to cease and desist from offering telemedia without providing users with information at the beginning of the usage process on the justification ground pursuant to Art. 45 et seq. DSGVO for the transfer of personal data to a third country pursuant to Art. 13 para. 1 lit f) DSGVO.
However, the further application under point 2 is unfounded.
a)
The defendant - based on the failure to recognise the necessity of the user's consent - provided the wrong justification ground under Art. 45 et seq. DSGVO for the transfers of personal data to a third country pursuant to Art. 13 (I) (f) DSGVO. In this respect, the indication of several legal grounds is also not "precise" in the sense of Art. 12 (I) sentence 1 GDPR.
Moreover, the information provided by the defendant in No. 5 of the data protection statement on the basic possibility of transferring data to third countries and the basis for this is sufficient. This No. contains the - then incorrectly implemented - information that a transfer only takes place if the special requirements of Art. 44 et seq. DSGVO are met. The defendant has also named the relevant agreement within the meaning of Art. 45 para. I DSGVO (cf.: Google Analytics - No. 162; Google Re/Marketing Services - No. 172, Facebook Pixel - No. 18, 2nd paragraph; Facebook Social Plugins - No. 192; Newsletter- No. 21.4; LinkedIN No. 25, 6th paragraph).
b)
However, the plaintiff does not have a claim against the defendant for an injunction against the offering of telemedia without providing users with information at the beginning of the usage process pursuant to Art. 13 of the German Telemedia Act.
Paragraph 2 of the GDPR on the rights of access, erasure, rectification and complaint to the supervisory authority. A violation of these information requirements by the defendant is not apparent.
(1)	The plaintiff complains that "in the disputed email of 10.04.2017 (see Annex K 3), the legally required mandatory information is not even rudimentarily fulfilled. For example, there is no information about the rights of the data subjects, such as the right to information,
rights of cancellation, rectification and complaint to the supervisory authority in accordance with Att 13(2) GDPR."
(2)	It is already not apparent which email the plaintiff wants to refer to. A corresponding email is not the subject matter of the dispute and is (consequently) not available. In this respect, the argument regarding the violation of information obligations in or through this email is not relevant for the present legal dispute.
(3)
Notwithstanding this, it must be noted that the defendant's data protection statement does not contain the information pursuant to Alt. 13 para. 2 lit. b) DSGVO about the existence of a right of access on the part of the controller to the personal data concerned as well as to rectification or erasure or to restriction of processing or a right to object to processing as well as the right to data portability, as well as the existence of a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority pursuant to Art. 13 para. 2 It. d) DSGVO. In this respect, reference should be made to the data protection statement of the defendant (Annex KIO), the paragraphs 6.1. for the right of access, 6.2. for the right of rectification, 6.3. for the right of erasure, 6.4. for the right of transfer - not referred to by the plaintiff - and 6.5. for the right of complaint.
c)
The plaintiff also has no claim against the defendant for an injunction to refrain from offering telemedia without providing users with information on the right of revocation or objection at the beginning of the usage process in accordance with Art. 7 para. 3 sentence 3 and Art. 21 para. 4 of the GDPR. A violation of these information requirements by the defendant is also not evident.
(1)	According to Art. 7 para. 3 sentence 3 DSGVO, information must be provided about the possibility of revoking consent to data processing. The defendant's data protection statement contains this information in section 7. Insofar as the plaintiff objects that the information should have been provided in the cookie banner itself, so that there is a violation of Art. 13 para. 2 lit c) GDPR, the Board does not share this view. Such a link is not necessary to safeguard the user's rights and, moreover, is not practicable in view of the overall scope of the information to be provided. Moreover, the user does not expect to receive all information on data protection in a first display window, but to be able to call it up clearly arranged on a separate page. In this respect, the information in the privacy policy is sufficient.
(2)	According to Art. 21(4) of the GDPR, the (general) right to object to the processing of personal data must be pointed out. The defendant's data protection statement contains this information in section 8.
3.
The plaintiff is entitled to an injunction against the defendant not to make the essence of the agreement between the joint controllers available to users in the event of joint responsibility for a data processing pursuant to Art. 26 para. I sentence I DSGVO, contrary to Art. 26 para. 2 sentence 2 DSGVO.
The defendant violated this obligation by transferring personal data to third-party cookies by integrating them and by the third-party providers (also) processing these data for their own purposes, as in the case of the integration of the "Google Analytics" cookie of the provider Google.
a)
Contrary to the view of the defendant, this is a joint responsibility for data processing within the meaning of Art. 26 GDPR and not a commissioned processing pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR.
  According to the case law of the ECJ, the classification as a controller or processor always depends on the circumstances of the individual case (ECJ WRP 2018, 805 - Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein) and must be assessed on the basis of the criterion of the decision-making power over the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. Whether a decision-making power exists is measured by the extent to which the party involved has a concrete possibility to influence the data processing process, i.e. whether he can actively shape the process and bears responsibility for the processing. The ECJ considers the person who influences the data processing out of self-interest to be the controller (ECJ NZA 2018, 991 - Jehovah's Witnesses). This does not require an equal influence on the decision-making, so that the actual contribution to a decision can be structured differently. It is also not relevant how a contractual regulation describes the activity of those involved in data processing. Rather, what is decisive is how the intended and practised legal relationships present themselves in reality. What matters is the "actual influence" of the participants on the data processing operation (cf. BeckOK DatenschutzR/Spoerr, 32nd ed. 1.5.2020 marginal no. 13f, DS-GVO Art. 26 marginal no. 13c-13f with further references).
(2)	In its argumentation, the plaintiff refers to the "Fashion ID" decision of the ECJ (see ECJ WRP 2019, 1146). The ECJ affirmed joint responsibility in the event that the operator of a website embeds a plugin which causes the browser of the visitor to the website to request content from this plugin and transmits personal data of the visitor to this provider for this purpose. In the case decided, an integrated plugin ("Like" button from Facebook) automatically transmitted the requested content to the website when the website was called up by the browser, transmitting the user's IP address and further technical data to Facebook. The ECJ considered Facebook's own responsibility and thus, as a result, a joint responsibility of the owner of the website and Facebook to be given, since the operator of the website has no influence on what information the browser transmits and what the third-party provider (Facebook) does with this data.
(3)	In contrast, the defendant claims that when Google Analytics is integrated, the processing of the data is determined by the owner of the website, as itself. Google only processes the transmitted data according to the owner's specifications and makes the analysis results obtained available to the owner.
(4)	However, this does not correspond to the actual circumstances. Google does not process the data solely for the purpose of use by the website operator. Rather, Google, like other third-party providers, expressly reserves the right to process the data for its own purposes.
Accordingly, the data protection authorities of the Federation and the Länder have now also issued a corresponding assessment. In this respect, reference should also be made to the resolution of the Data Protection Conference of 12 May 2020 (cf. www.datenschutzkonferenz-onI i ne.de/medialdskb/20200526\_beschluss\_hinweise\_zum\_einsatz\_von\_googIe\_analytics.pdf). It states:
"In the view of the data protection supervisory authorities, the processing in conjunction with the
 
Google Analytics is not a commissioned processing pursuant to Art. 28 of the GDPR. According to Art.
4 No. 7, Art 28 (10) DSGVO, the controller must determine the purposes and means of the processing itself. From this follows the obligation of the processor to process the data exclusively on the instructions of the controller (Art. 29 DSGVO). When using Google Analytics, the website operator does not determine the purposes and means of data processing alone. Rather, these are partly specified exclusively by Google, so that Google itself is responsible in this respect and contractually accepted by the website operator. The processing when using Google Analytics represents a uniform fact of life in which the various aspects of the processing only make sense as a whole. As a result, the parties involved within a processing activity cannot change their role as processor and/or controller. While Google continues to offer a contract for commissioned processing, it additionally clarifies in the "Google Measurement Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms" that Google and the user (website operator) are separately responsible for certain processing operations. Furthermore, Google clarifies in the terms of use that Google processes the data for its own purposes, in particular also for the purpose of providing its web analysis and tracking service. According to Article 28 (10) of the GDPR, Google is thus no longer a processor.
Taking into account the current case law of the ECJ, Google and the Google Analytics user are jointly responsible for the data processing, so that the requirements of Art. 26 DS-GVO must be observed."
4.
The plaintiff is entitled to a claim against the defendant for injunctive relief against the use of the clause:
"Advocado reserves the right to unilaterally amend these GTC - insofar as they are introduced into the contractual relationship with the customer - at any time, insofar as this is necessary to eliminate equivalence disruptions that arise subsequently or to adapt to changed legal or technical framework conditions and these do not unreasonably disadvantage the user. advocado shall inform the customer of any changes by e-mail, stating the content of the amended provisions. This e-mail shall contain the amended GTC as well as a reference to the right of objection, the objection period and its consequences in the event of failure to object. "
in its General Terms and Conditions pursuant to § I para. 1 UKlaG in conjunction with § 307 para. Section 307 (1) of the German Civil Code (BGB).
a)
The validity of a clause permitting an amendment of the General Terms and Conditions is to be examined on the basis of § 307 para. 1 BGB (cf. BeckOGK/Weiler, 1.6.2020, BGB § 308 no. 4, marginal no. 28 with further references; also: MüKoBGB/Wurmnest, 8th ed. 2019, BGB § 308 4, marginal no. 6 -for the case that amendment of the entire General Terms and Conditions also includes the (main) performance obligations). Pursuant to Section 307 (I) BGB, provisions in general terms and conditions are invalid if they unreasonably disadvantage the contractual partner of the user contrary to the requirements of good faith. An unreasonable disadvantage can also result from the provision not being clear and understandable.
Amendment clauses are permissible in principle. However, since they interfere with the legal principle dominating contract law, i.e. the binding of both contracting parties to the agreement made and the resulting possibility of amendment only by mutual consent, weighty reasons are required to justify them (fundamental: BGH NJW 1984, 1182). What is required are serious reasons - which cannot be influenced by the user - which lead to an unforeseeable change in the contractual equivalence relationship and therefore require a change, taking into account the interests of the contracting party. Thus, for foreseeable changes in the contractual circumstances, an amendment of the GTC via an amendment clause is excluded. An amendment clause is also inadmissible for those cases in which the law contains a provision for the case of a change of the contractual structure (BeckOGK/Zschieschack, 1.9.2020, BGB § 307 Änderungungs- und Anpassungsklausel, marginal no. 17).
b)
In the present case, there is already no restriction of the reasons for an amendment to reasons that cannot be influenced by the defendant as user. This is because the right of amendment is also intended to exist in order to be able to make adjustments to changed technical framework conditions. Apart from the fact that it is clear to the customer which general conditions are meant and which changes can fall under them, these changes can (also) be triggered by the defendant itself. This is because the defendant determines on which technical platform and which technologies it provides its services. However, it cannot be ruled out that it is precisely these changes that make it necessary to adapt the GTC because they no longer "fit". However, this very possibility should not exist.
The plaintiff has a claim against the defendant for reimbursement of the warning costs pursuant to § 5
UKlaG in conjunction with. Section 12 (I) sentence 2 UWG. Insofar as the warning - in accordance with the above - went too far in part, this does not affect the fundamental justification of the claim or the amount of the warning costs. The warning costs of EUR 214.00 are not dependent on the value in dispute and are also not objectionable with regard to the justified warning.
IV.
The decision on costs is made pursuant to § 92 (1) ZPO. The plaintiff's partial defeat with regard to part of the application under 2. is to be valued at EUR 2,500.00. The decision on provisional enforceability follows from § 709 ZPO and § 708 no. 11, 711 ZPO.
The amount in dispute is determined in accordance with § 3 ZPO, whereby the claims 1 - 3 are to be valued at EUR 5,000.00 each and the claim 4 with regard to the general terms and conditions clause at EUR 2,500.00.
