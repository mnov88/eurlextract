## English Summary

### Facts

The controller was a regional tax authority in Bavaria, the Bayerisches Landesamt für Steuern (BayLfSt). The BayLfSt held tax dossiers concerning the tax case of the data subject. These dossiers contained internal correspondence, third party statements, notes, and handwritten comments from itself and other Bavarian tax authorities, namely the lower regional tax authority Finanzamt Neu-Ulm and the higher regional tax authority Bayerisches Staatsministerium der Finanzen für Landesentwicklung und Heimat (BayStMFLH). These dossiers also included a complaint via email by the data subject against the BayStMFLH from 2016 and complaints, a challenge on grounds of bias and a demand for a penalty against employees of the Finanzamt Neu-Ulm from 2019.

The data subject requested access to dossiers from the Finanzamt Neu-Ulm on 28.10.2019. The BayLfSt received a request to access under [Article 15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") on 07.11.2019. The data subject wanted to access information on which department processed the dossiers. The data subject specifically requested a colour copy with the aim to differentiate between notes of responsible employees.

On 17.12.2019, the data subject received a reply from BayLfSt. The BayLfSt confirmed that it held information about the complaints, the correspondence between the data subject and the authorities, and the correspondence between both authorities. The BayLfSt also confirmed the existence of internal notes and internal correspondence between the two authorities (Finanzamt Neu-Ulm and BayLfSt) concerning the data subject's access request in the dossiers. No further information was disclosed. The reply included instruction on the right to appeal.

On 13.01.2022, the data subject filed a lawsuit against the Finanzamt Neu-Ulm and the BayStMFLH in regard to the notice of rejection from 17.12.2019. The court registered the lawsuits separately. The case under consideration is the law suit against the BayLfSt. The data subject based his demands on the suspicion that the tax dossiers were manipulated. The data subject claimed that an auditor of his tax case made a false statement. Further false statements had led to a criminal investigation against the data subject. There were also alleged false statements in the reply to his complaints.

The data subject explained further that he wanted to know who led the investigation in the BayLfSt, who falsified the facts and held back the correct dossiers. He expressed his suspicion that there was still falsified information in the dossiers. Consequently, the data subject requested a colour copy of all dossiers.

The controller requested to dismiss the request and stated that the data subject's right to access was properly facilitated. It claimed that there was no obligation for a copy.

### Holding

The Financial Court Munich (FG München) dismissed the case. The BayLfSt already facilitated the data subject's right to access under [Article 15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1 "Article 15 GDPR") with its reply from December 2019.

The Court first held that the BayLfSt was a controller within the meaning of [Article 4(7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#7 "Article 4 GDPR").

Next, the Financial Court differentiated between personal data as information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person under [Article 4(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#1 "Article 4 GDPR"), and dossiers. The Court pointed out that the prior version of the German Data Protection Law defined personal data as individual data ([§ 3(1) BDSG](https://www.datenschutz-wiki.de/3_BDSG) prior version) and not dossiers or sets of dossiers (see Recital 15 GDPR).

The data in the controller's database were structured into different categories. In those categories, data entries that referred to the data subject (such as tax number, date of birth or name) could be differentiated from data entries that did not refer to the data subject. The Financial Court pointed out that it was much more difficult to determine if a piece of text or whole documents were personal data. Although a document or a file could relate to a data subject, human interpretation was necessary to link it to a data subject in an electronic file system or paper records. This act of human interpretation is defined as “extracting” data. Only after data is extracted, is the content of a dossier considered personal data. Before the extraction, there is no intention to store the data in a specific data field with a personal data “designator”, i.e. a filing system. The Court also held that a specific “designator” was necessary to fulfill the criteria “processing by automated means”.

Hence, the Court held that documents, notes and correspondence between public authorities in tax dossiers did not constitute personal data so long as they were not selected for specific processing. In addition, even if they did, the Court held that they would not satisfy the material scope under [Article 2(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_2_GDPR "Article 2 GDPR") as they were not processed by wholly or partly automated means and did not form or were not intended to form part of a filing system. Consequently, [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") did not grant the data subject the right to access to such information.

## Comment

The Court seemed to adopt a restrictive interpretation of the meaning of "personal data wholly or partly by automated means and other than by automated means which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system."
