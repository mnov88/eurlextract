## English Summary

### Facts

Meta (the controller) is the operator of "Instagram". The controller is also the developer of so-called "Meta Business Tools". The data subject is a private user of Instagram since 2012 and claims that she regularly visits websites on which the business tools can be found. Meta Business Tools are integrated by most high-reach websites and apps in Germany. The main purpose of these business tools is to increase and measure the effectiveness of advertisements from third-party companies on the platforms offered by the controller, such as Instagram or Facebook. As soon as a user of Instagram or Facebook visits the homepage of a company that uses such business tools, the third-party companies transmit "**Standard technical data**" (e.g. IP address, operating system, browser, if a touchscreen is used, language, date of access) and "**other personal data**", e.g. "event data" on current and past activity on the homepage (clicks on articles or buttons, keyboard or form entries ) to the controller via the business tools.

The average user cannot see whether the website in question has been equipped with a meta business tool. Instagram users can influence how the data received by the controller is further used by deciding whether they allow the use of "meta cookies on other apps and websites" in Instagram's settings. The data subject did not consent to the use of "meta cookies on other apps and websites".

The standard technical data transferred to the controller via the business tools are processed by the controller, by assigning the data to an existing personal profile (identifying) if possible and storing it, regardless of the data subject's consent to the transmission to the controller or to processing by the controller. Other personal data is also stored and combined with any other data available about the respective user to form a personal profile if the user's personal data is stored in a database and has consented to the use of "optional cookies". If not, the controller does not use the data for unspecified "certain processing operations" and otherwise only "for limited purposes, such as security and integrity purposes".

The data subject claims that not only the "technical data", but also extensive "other personal data" is always transmitted to the controller via the Meta Business tools, regardless of her consent. Only after receiving does the controller evaluate whether it has a legal basis to process it. The data subject further claims that the data would then be passed on by the controller to the parent company in the USA and to other companies and used in the Meta Group e.g. for advertising purposes without her consent.

The data subject therefore feels at the mercy of the controller due to its market power and is very concerned that the controller knows too much about her and will analyze her interests, stimuli, hopes and concerns, which can be used to manipulate her.

The data subject requested that the court - inter alia -

1.  establishes by way of declaratory judgement that the controller processed extensive personal data of the data subject without legal basis
2.  orders the controller to cease and desist this processing
3.  orders the controller to pay the data subject non-material damages of at least €5,000

The controller requests, to dismiss the action. The controller claims that the collection and transmission of the standard technical data to the controller as described above is immanent to the contemporary use of the Internet and cannot be prevented by the controller. The controller claims that the collection and transfer of "other personal data", such as the course of the website visit, depends on which cookies the users have agreed to and how the respective companies have set up the business tools. The third-party companies had obliged to only activate these business tool functions with the user's consent. However, this is not controlled by the controller.

### Holding

##### Injunction regarding data that is always tracked

Regarding the claim for injunctive relief, the court differentiated between data that is always processed and personal data, that is only processed in certain instances i.e. with consent and by certain business tool.

Regarding collection, forwarding, storing and processing of data that is always tracked such as when a data subject visited a website and which URLs/Apps she visited/used the court confirmed the data subject's claim for injunctive relief. The court stated, that the controller's general practice of always collecting this data, even without consent, impairs the right to informational self-determination of the data subject. The court held, that there is no justification pursuant to [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") as there is no consent of the data subject for this form of data processing. Furthermore, the court dismissed the controller's argument that this is a widespread practice and is ultimately due to the current functioning of "the internet". While the court stated that this might be true for standard technical data to properly use functionalities from third-party providers consent must still be obtained in advance in accordance with the GDPR. However, the business tools are not even used to offer any content to users, but exclusively to record the usage behavior for advertising purposes.

The court confirmed that the controller is responsible, as it provides the business tools it has developed, has configured the data collection on which this is based itself, even without the controller's consent, and has the data transmitted to it by the third-party providers for its own economic benefit. The court disregarded the controller's argument that the data is ultimately collected by the third-party operators and then forwarded because the controller is in any case jointly responsible.

Finally, the court found that the resulting infringements are also a sufficiently concrete and immediate threat for the data subject. In contrast to the data that is only collected in certain circumstances, the collection of the data in question does not depend on further parameters but takes place in every visit of a page or app independently of the data subject's consent. In view of the widespread use of these tools, this risk is extremely obvious without the need for further demonstration by the data subject. Moreover, the court found the controller's unsubstantiated reference to "security and integrity purposes" unconvincing. Notably, the court based the claim on both the GDPR and in any case national law ([§ 1004 (1) sentence 2 German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch - BGB) analogously](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p4705), [§ 823(1) BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p4209), [Art. 2(1) Basic Law (Grundgesetz - GG)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html)).

As for data that is not always processed, the court held, that the data subject failed to demonstrate which specific apps or websites it had used, what type of business tool was used and which specific types of data points were tapped and transmitted to the controller. The court argued, that the mere possibility of impairment is not sufficient for an injunctive relief claim.

##### No damages

The court dismissed the data subject's claim for non-material damages under [Article 82 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR "Article 82 GDPR").

The court found that the data subject was individually affected considering that every Instagram or Facebook user was very likely affected by surveillance measures by the business tools. However, the court stated, that this only applies to standard technical data. Regarding other personal data, the court held, that there is no such sufficient probability, as the collection dependent on numerous parameters (e.g. specific pages visited, business tools integrated, consents obtained from the third-party site operators).

In any case the court could establish no damage. It found that, no negative psychological affects were substantiated. The court did not rule out a loss of control, however, it held that regarding the amount of the damage, the data subject must (at least approximately) demonstrate which type of data points are affected in what magnitude. In the absence of such a substantiated submission the court concluded that any estimate of damages would be arbitrary. The court also stated, that [Article 82 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR "Article 82 GDPR") has a blocking effect regarding damage claims based on the violation of the general right of personality under national law.

In an obiter dictum the court stated that case law denying damages can appear problematic as the controller's tangibly unlawful business practices are not adequately sanctioned. However, the court held, that this is an inevitable consequence of the fact the sanctioning of general "business practices" is a matter for public law and the competent national and European authorities - not civil law.

##### No legal interest in declaratory judgement

The court held, that the data subject had no interest in a declaratory judgement required by [§ 256(1) Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung - ZPO)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_zpo/englisch_zpo.html) as there is no legal uncertainty beyond the data subject's claims for damages and injunctive relief.

## Comment

_Interestingly, the court held, that the questions raised in the reference of the Federal Court of Justice (BGH, decision of 26.9.2023 - VI ZR 97/22) are not relevant. The court held, that the GDPR's aim is to guarantee a high level of protection and to ensure the practical effectiveness of the GDPR. Therefore, it argues, it's impossible that there could be neither a claim based on GDPR law nor a national claim._

_Interestingly, the court critically examined whether German civil procedural law makes it unreasonably difficult for the data subject to enforce its rights, by demanding the data to substantiate which data points were tapped when. However, the court did not see any unreasonable difficulty for the data subject in this respect as the data subject could have taken step-by-step action by first bringing a claim for information._

Court: LG Lübeck 15th Civil
Chamber Date of decision: 10.01.2025 File
number: 15 O 269/23
ECLI: ECLI:DE:LGLUEBE:2025:0110.15O269.23.00
Document type: Judgment

Norm: Art 82 TEU 2016/679
Guiding principle
It follows from the general regulatory objective of the GDPR that the legal system must, in
principle, provide the possibility for persons affected by unlawful data processing operations
to take action against them by means of an injunction. In any case, it must be ensured that
impending legal impairments due to violations of the GDPR can also be averted by means of
injunctive relief.
The defendant's general practice of always collecting standard technical data, even without
consent, which allows the defendant to identify the respective user with a probability of over
99%, as well as the date that and when the third-party site in question was visited, via so-
called business apps and then storing it in its own systems and further processing it into
personality profiles, impairs the data subjects' right to informational self-determination.
This practice of the defendant is also unlawful as this data collection is indisputably carried
out in every case and irrespective of whether the data subjects have consented to this or not.
The defendant is also responsible for the data collection of the business tools designed by it
within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR, since it makes the business tools developed by it
available, has configured the data collection on which this is based itself even without the
defendant's consent and also uses the data transmitted to it by the third-party providers itself
and for its own economic advantage according to its own submission.
Tenor
1. The defendant is ordered to cease and desist from any further
infringements of this provision on pain of a fine of up 250.000.00 to
be imposed by the court for each case of infringement, alternatively
imprisonment to be enforced on its legal representative or
imprisonment to be enforced on its legal representative for up to six
months, in the event of repeated infringement up to two years, to
refrain from collecting the following personal data of the plaintiff on
third-party websites and apps outside the defendant's networks using
the Meta Business Tools, forwarding it to the defendant's servers,
storing the data there and subsequently using it:
- the URLs of the websites visited by the plaintiff, including their
subpages;
- Page2 from25 -
- the names of the apps used by the plaintiff;
- the time of the visit to the respective website or app.
2. The remainder of the action is dismissed.
3. The plaintiff shall bear the costs of the legal dispute.
4. The judgment is provisionally enforceable for the plaintiff against
security in the amount of EUR 1,500.00 and for the defendant against
security in the amount of 110% of the amount to be enforced in each
case.
The amount in dispute is set at 15,500.00€ .
Facts of the case
1 The defendant is the operator of the "Instagram" network. This network enables users
to create personal profiles and to make contact with other users to the extent of their
presence on this network.
2 The defendant is also the developer of so-called "Meta Business Tools", namely
"Meta Pixel", "App Events via Facebook SDK" and "Conversions API" as well as "App
Events
API" (hereinafter referred to as "Business Tools"). These Business Tools are integrated by
numerous third-party companies on their websites, servers or apps. In particular,
numerous high-reach websites and apps in Germany are affected, such as numerous
large news sites and apps (spiegel.de, bild.de, welt.de, faz.net, stern.de), large travel
sites and apps such as tripadvisor.de, hrs.de, holidaycheck.de, kayak.de, momondo.de),
sites and apps that offer medical assistance (e.g. apothe- ken.de, shop-apotheke.de,
docmorris.de, aerzte.de, helios-gesundheit.de, jameda.de), dating and erotic sites
(parship.de, amorelie.de, orion.de, lovescout24.de), but also sites with content from the
innermost private sphere (krebshilfe.de, tfp-fertility.com (Sa- menbank), nie-wieder-
alkohol.de, nvve.nl (euthanasia in the Netherlands with German-language offer)). A
complete overview of the websites concerned has not been and is not published by the
defendant. According to the plaintiff's - not substantiatedly disputed - presentation, the
other 466 large websites listed in Annex K 2 are demonstrably affected in Germany.
3 The general purpose of these business tools is, among other things, to increase and
measure the effectiveness of advertisements from third-party companies on the
platforms offered by Meta, such as Instagram or Facebook. As soon as a user of the
Instagram or Facebook network visits the homepage of a company that uses such
business tools, the third-party companies transmit the following data in particular to the
defendant via the business tools integrated in this way - regardless of whether the user
has activated the Instagram or Facebook app at that time :
4 - always such technical data that allows the defendant to identify the respective
user within the metasystems with a probability of more than 99% (hereinafter:
"standard technical data"), as well as the date that and when the third-party
service in question was accessed.
- Page3 from25 -
was visited with these technical parameters. Standard technical data in this
sense includes the IP address associated with the user device, the operating
system of the device, the type of browser used (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari,
etc.), its software version, the language used by the customer and whether the
customer's device has a touchscreen and the parameters of this touchscreen;
5 - further data (hereinafter referred to as "further personal data"), in particular on
current and past activity on the homepage, such as clicks on individual articles
or buttons, keyboard entries, form entries, etc. (so-called "event data"), -
whereby the type and scope of the transmitted data depends on which of the
aforementioned business tools the third-party company has integrated and how
they use this tool in detail.
6 The average Internet user cannot see whether the website in question has been
equipped with a meta business tool.
7 Instagram users can use the settings options there to influence how the data received
by the defendant in this way is further used. In the settings section under "optional
cookies", users can decide whether they allow the use of "meta cookies on other apps
and websites".
8 The data transferred from the apps and homepages to the defendant via the business
tools are processed by the defendant as follows - and in part depending on the
existence of the consent given in the settings:
9 - By means of the transmitted standard technical data, a person already
recorded by Meta is identified - as far as this is regularly possible (see above).
The circumstance of the visit to the website or app transmitting the data and the
corresponding time is then assigned to the personal profile of this person and
stored and this personal profile accordingly with this personal information. This
process is indisputably always and in particular and expressly without delay
(see minutes of October 11, 2024, p. 2 below and p. 3 above) even if the data
subject has not consented to data transmission to the defendant vis-à-vis the
third-party provider and has not consented to data processing vis-à-vis the
defendant;
10 - The other personal data is also stored and combined with any other data
available about the respective user to form a personal profile if the user's
personal data is stored in a database.
the user has given their consent to the use of "optional cookies" in the settings
(see above). If the user has not given this consent, the defendant does not use
the data for unspecified "certain processing operations" and otherwise only "for
limited purposes, such as security and integrity purposes", including "for the
purpose of monitoring attempted attacks on Meta's systems".
- Page4 from25 -
11 The plaintiff himself has been using the Instagram network exclusively privately under
the user name "XXX" since September 1, 2012. In the Instagram settings shown, the
plaintiff did not consent to the processing of the data in dispute.
12 In a pre-litigation lawyer's letter dated 26.09.2023 (Annex K 3), the plaintiff requested
the defendant to acknowledge that data processing regarding activities outside the
social network was not permitted without effective consent, to undertake to
anonymize or delete data upon request, to acknowledge that full information would be
provided upon request, to refrain from processing data relating to activities outside the
network and to pay € 5,000.00. The defendant replied to this lawyer's letter with a
letter dated 08.10.2024 (Annex B 8). With regard to the further content, full reference
is made to both letters.
13 The plaintiff claims that the defendant's business tools are active on 30-40% of all
websites worldwide and a large number of popular apps.
14 The plaintiff claims that not only the "technical data", but also extensive "other personal
data" is always transmitted to the defendant via the Meta Business tools, regardless of
whether the visitors consent to this or not. In particular, the information in the
statement of September 26, 2024, there. p. 25 et seqq. (p. 175 et seqq. of the file).
Only there does the defendant evaluate whether it has the legal authorization to the
data received.
15 The plaintiff further claims that the data would then be passed on by the defendant to
the parent company in the USA and to other companies and used in the Meta Group for
advertising purposes, for example, even if the users do not consent to this.
16 The plaintiff claims that it regularly visits websites on which the business tools can be
found, in particular the XXX pages. She feels at the mercy of the defendant due to its
market power and is very concerned that the defendant knows too much about her and
is afraid that with the help of AI it will be possible to analyze her interests, stimuli,
hopes and concerns, which can be used to manipulate her. With regard to the plaintiff's
submission on this in detail, reference is made to the reply of September 26, 2024, p.
37 et seq. (p. 187 et seq. of the file).
17 The plaintiff originally filed an action consisting of five motions and a further four
auxiliary motions - the latter by way of a step-by-step action (see detailed statement of
claim). In a written submission dated September 26, 2024, it amended the action to six
motions and, in particular, omitted the auxiliary motions. In addition to the following
motions, it requested that the claims to be filed under the following motion
1) one month after the legally binding conclusion of the proceedings and anonymize or
optionally delete the data mentioned under 1b) and c). With regard to the details,
reference is made to the aforementioned pleading. The plaintiff then withdrew the
aforementioned motions following a court order with the consent of the defendant at the
hearing on October 11, 2024.
- Page5 from25 -
18 The plaintiff now requests,
19 1. it is established that the parties' user agreement for the use of the
network "Instagram" under the user name "XXX" does not permit the
collection with the help of the Meta Business Tools, the transfer to the
defendant's servers, the storage there and the subsequent use of the
following personal data:
20 a) personal data of the complaining party generated on third-
party websites and apps, whether transmitted directly or in
hashed form , i.e.
21 - E-mail from the complaining party

50 2. the defendant is ordered to refrain from collecting the personal
data of the plaintiff on third party sites and apps outside the
defendant's networks with the help of the meta business tools in
accordance with application no. 1, on pain of an administrative fine of
up to EUR 250,000.00 to be determined by the court for each case of
infringement, or, alternatively, an administrative detention of up to
six months to be enforced on its legal representative, or up to two
years to be enforced on its legal representative. of the request under
1. with the help of the Meta Business Tools, to forward it to the
defendant's servers, to store the data there and then to use it.
51 3. the defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff non-material

trial legal costs in the amount of EUR 1,295.43
53 The defendant requests,
54 dismiss the action.
55 The defendant claims that the collection and transmission of the standard technical
data to the defendant as described above is immanent to the contemporary use of the
Internet and cannot prevented by the defendant. With regard to the details
- Page7 from25 -
reference is made to the statements in the pleading dated October 8, 2024, there. para.
23 (p. 308 et seq. of the file).
56 The defendant claims that the collection and transfer of "other personal data", such as
the course of the website visit, depends on which cookies the users have agreed to and
how the respective companies have set up the business tools. The third-party
companies had undertaken to only activate these business tool functions if they had
obtained the user's consent beforehand. However, is no control as to whether this has
been implemented by the third-party companies. However, the defendant does check
whether the transmitted data contains particularly protected personal data.
57 For the further submissions of the parties, reference is made to the mutual written
submissions and, in particular, the statements made at the hearing.
58 With the consent of the parties on October 11, 2024, the court ordered the written
procedure by order of the same day.
Reasons for the decision
59 I. With the exception of application 1), the action is admissible and well-founded in the
tenor of the claim , but otherwise unfounded.
1.
60 The part of the action still pending after amendment and partial withdrawal of the
action is admissible with the exception of application 1).
61 a. The Regional Court of Lübeck has international, factual and local jurisdiction.
62 (1) The international jurisdiction of the German courts follows from Art. 79 para. 2
sentence 2 GDPR, since the plaintiff has its habitual residence in Germany.
63 (a) Pursuant to Section 79 (2) GDPR, the courts of the Member State in which the
controller or processor has an establishment have jurisdiction for actions against a
controller at the point of origin. According to sentence 2 of the provision, such actions
may also be brought before the courts of the Member State in which the data subject
has his or her habitual residence, unless - which is not the case here - the controller or
processor is an authority of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers.
The purpose of this jurisdiction rule is to ensure (and facilitate) effective legal protection
by giving data subjects the option of bringing an action at their place of residence,
whereby this does not mean the "actual" but the "habitual" place of residence, as the
wording of the English language version ("habitual residence") makes clear
(Spindler/Dalby, in: Spindler/Schuster, Recht der elektronischen Medien, 4th ed. 2019,
GDPR Art. 79 para. 19).
64 These requirements are met. The defendant is a controller or processor within the
meaning of the GDPR. According to Art. 4 No. 7, 8 GDPR, controllers are natural or legal
persons, public authorities, agencies or other bodies which are solely responsible for
the processing of personal data.
- Page8 from25 -
or jointly with others decide on the purposes and means of the processing of personal
data. Processors are natural or legal persons, authorities, institutions or other bodies
that process personal data on behalf of the controller. In the present case, as the
operator of the platform, the defendant alone has to decide on the purposes and means
of processing personal data, so that it is to be regarded as the controller within the
meaning of the GDPR (see ECJ, judgment of June 5, 2018 - C-210/16 -, para. 30, juris;
see also below for details); it is also not an authority of a Member State that acted in
the exercise of its sovereign powers. As the person concerned, the plaintiff is domiciled
in XXX in the XXX district, meaning that German jurisdiction is international.
65 (b) It can be left open whether Article 79(2) GDPR supersedes the general jurisdiction
provisions of the Brussels I Regulation in its scope of application in the present case
(in this sense, for example, Bergt in: Kühling/Buchner, DS-GVO BDSG, 3rd ed. 2020,
DS-GVO
Art. 79 para. 15 with further references, Albrecht/Jotzo, Das neue Datenschutzrecht der
EU, Teil 8: Rechts- behelfe, Haftung und Sanktionen para. 29) or the provisions remain
applicable in addition (in this sense, Gola/Heckmann/Werkmeister, Datenschutz-
Grundverordnung - Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, 3rd ed. 2022, GDPR Art. 79 para. 15).
Even according to the provisions of the Brussels I Regulation, no deviating exclusive
jurisdiction within the meaning of Art. 24 Brussels I Regulation is established, but rather
the international jurisdiction of the German courts follows in the present case from both
Art. 7 No. 1 lit. b) and Art. 18 para. 1 Alt. 2, Art. 17 para. 1 lit. c) Brussels I Regulation
(see (see BGH, judgment of July 29, 2021 - III ZR 179/20
-, BGHZ 230, 347-389, para. 24). According to Art. 18 Brussels I Regulation, a
consumer may bring an action against a contracting party which directs its activities to
the Member State in which the consumer is domiciled before the court of his domicile.
66 In the present case, the plaintiff, as a private individual, uses the defendant's platform,
which acts commercially (ECJ, judgment of June 5, 2018 - C-210/16 -, para. 60, juris) and
has also geared its activities specifically to the territory of the Federal Republic of
Germany and users resident here, e.g. through corresponding language options.
Moreover, due to the nature of the matter, the defendant's service, namely the provision
of the usage and communication options, would have to be provided at the debtor's
place of residence,
so that the international jurisdiction of German courts already arises from Art. 7 No. 1
lit. b) 2nd indent Brussels I Regulation.
67 (2) The adjudicating court has jurisdiction over the subject matter pursuant to Sections
23 No. 1, 71 (1) GVG if the value of the matter in dispute exceeds the sum of
5,000.00€ .
68 (3) The local jurisdiction of the Regional Court follows both from Section 44 (1)
sentence 2 BDSG and from Art. 7 No. 1 lit. b) Brussels I Regulation.
69 (a) Art. 79 para. 2 sentence 1 GDPR only regulates international jurisdiction, not local
jurisdiction (BR-Drs. 110/17, Annex, 111; Paal/Pauly/Frenzel, 3rd ed. 2021, BDSG
Section 44 para. 1). In this respect, Section 44 (1) sentence 2 BDSG stipulates that
actions brought by the data subject against a controller or processor for a breach of
data protection provisions within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or the rights
of the data subject contained therein may also be brought before the court of the
place where the data subject has their habitual residence.

place of residence. These requirements are met since the plaintiff has its habitual
residence in the local court district.
70 (b) Furthermore, local jurisdiction also follows from Art. 7 No. 1 lit. b) Brussels I
Regulation, which - unlike Art. 17, 18 Brussels I Regulation, which, like Art. 4 Brussels I
Regulation, only regulate international jurisdiction - also contains a provision on local
jurisdiction (Geimer in: Zöller, Code of Civil Procedure, 34th ed. 2022, Article 7 (Article
5 Lugano Convention), para. 1).
71 b. Otherwise, there are no concerns regarding the pending applications with the
exception of the application for a declaratory judgment under 1.
72 The interest in a declaratory judgment required for application no. 1 does not exist.
73 An interest in a declaratory judgment within the meaning of Section 256 (1) ZPO exists if
the plaintiff's subjective right is threatened by a current risk of uncertainty due to the
fact that the defendant seriously disputes it or claims a right against the plaintiff and if
the judgment sought is suitable to eliminate this risk due to its legal force. If an action
for performance is possible and reasonable for the plaintiff and if it exhausts the legal
protection objective, there is generally no interest in a declaratory judgment because
the plaintiff can clarify the matter in dispute in a lawsuit in order to obtain better legal
protection. This is to be assessed differently if the claim for damages is still in the
development stage with regard to the position of the damage (Gre- ger in: Zöller,
Zivilprozessordnung, 35th edition 2024, Section 256 ZPO). An interest in a declaratory
judgment can be affirmed despite a possible action for performance if the declaratory
proceedings already lead to a meaningful and appropriate settlement of the issues that
have arisen from the point of view of procedural economy, for example because it can
be expected that the defendant will already pay in response to the declaratory
judgment (BGH 5.10.2021 - VI ZR 136/20, VersR 2022, 1184).
74 With regard to the interest in a declaratory judgment, the plaintiff stated that the
special feature was that no positive clause review was to take place, but rather a
negative determination of what content the defendant's general terms and conditions
could not have. This was due to the fact that the defendant had designed its general
terms and conditions in such an incomprehensible and confusing way that no sufficient
legal certainty could be gained from the determination of the invalidity of certain
clauses of the general terms and conditions.
75 The plaintiff's statements are not capable of justifying an interest in a declaratory
judgment. In the present case, there is no interest in a declaratory judgment due to the
priority of the action for performance. In particular, it should be noted that the plaintiff
is not merely seeking a declaratory judgment, but is already simultaneously asserting
claims for performance, such as the payment of money and a request for injunctive
relief. There no legal uncertainty beyond the asserted claims for performance. The
applications for performance already filed exhaust the plaintiff's legal protection
objective in that she is to be paid money on the basis of past data processing and the
data collection at issue is to be discontinued.
2.
76 The action is well-founded to the extent tenorously stated, but otherwise unfounded.
- Page10 from25 -
77 a. The claim for injunctive relief is justified to the extent tenorously asserted, but
otherwise unfounded. In detail:
78 (1) Insofar as the plaintiff refers its application for injunctive relief to the data points
listed below from the plaintiff's application, the action is unfounded.
79 - E-mail from the complaining party
80 - Telephone number of the complaining party
81 - First name of the plaintiff
82 - Surname of the plaintiff
83 - Date of birth of the claimant
84 - Gender of the plaintiff
85 - Place of the plaintiff
86 - External IDs of other advertisers (called "external\_ID" by Meta Ltd.)
87 - IP address of the client
88 - User agent of the client (i.e. collected browser information)
89 - internal click ID of Meta Ltd.
90 - internal browser ID of Meta Ltd.
91 - Subscription ID
92 - Lead ID
93 - anon\_id
94 - the advertising ID of the Android operating system (called "madid" by Meta
Ltd.)
95 and from websites:
96 - the referrer (the website from which the user came to the current website),
97 - the buttons clicked by the plaintiff on the website and
98 - other data referred to by the Meta as "events", which document the
interactions of the claimant on the respective website
99 and from third-party mobile apps:
100 - the buttons clicked by the plaintiff in the app
- Page11 from25 -
101 - as well as the data called "events" by the Meta, which document the
interactions of the claimant in the respective app
102 It is irrelevant whether the asserted claim for injunctive relief arises from Art. 17, 18
GDPR or from other provisions of the GDPR, or from
§ 1004 para. 1 sentence 2 BGB analogously, § 823 para. 1 BGB, Art. 2 para. 1 GG or
whether the GDPR does not recognize injunctive relief of the kind required here and yet
bars recourse to national law. In detail on this:
103 (a) In the latter case, the dismissal of the action would be self-explanatory, since under
this hypothesis the plaintiff's claim would already be void for lack of a suitable basis for
the claim .
104 (b) Even assuming the possibility of recourse to § 1004 para. 1 sentence 2 BGB
analogously, § 823 para. 1 BGB, Art. 2 para. 1 GG, no claim could be considered as a
result.
105 The prerequisite for a claim to arise in this case would in any case be that the asserted
legal risk - in this case the alleged processing of the aforementioned personal data
points by the defendant - is sufficiently imminent (risk of repetition or at least initial risk,
see also MüKoBGB/Raff, 9th ed. 2023, BGB § 1004 para. 295-297). The mere possibility
of impairment is not sufficient; the concern must be based on facts and not just on
subjective fears. However, it can be assumed in favor of the claimant that a previous
infringement will be repeated (loc. cit., para. 300).
106 The Chamber is not able to establish such a sufficiently imminent danger. The Chamber
bases its decision on the fact that the individual data points listed above do not
constitute "standard technical data" in the above sense, but rather "other personal data"
as defined above. However, such data is not collected, forwarded and processed by the
defendant via the business tools at issue every time a website is visited or an app is
used. Rather, it depends, among other things - and this is undisputed - on the type of
business tool used and its configuration by the third-party website operator as to
whether and which data is collected and transmitted to the defendant. Accordingly,
according to the general rules of civil procedure, it would be incumbent on the plaintiff
to show which specific apps or websites it has visited or used in the past, what type of
business tool was used there and which specific data points of the type listed by the
plaintiff were tapped there and transmitted to the defendant. Such a submission is -
naturally
- almost completely. It is true that the plaintiff, in response to the last judicial notice,
claimed to regularly use the XXX website. However, there is no submission as to
whether the data points referred to by the plaintiff were accessed there and transferred
to the defendant. The same applies analogously to the requirements for a possible risk
of first infringement. There is also no admissible claim to the effect that the plaintiff will
visit a specific site in sufficient temporal proximity that could retrieve the data points
listed by the plaintiff without his consent.
- Page12 from25 -
107 In particular, the Chamber critically examined whether the application of common
German civil procedural law in this way makes it unreasonably difficult for the plaintiff to
enforce its rights. In doing so, the Chamber took particular account of the fact that the
plaintiff is naturally unlikely to be able to substantiate when in the past which data
points were tapped on which side. However, the Chamber does not see any
unreasonable difficulty for the plaintiff in this respect. In particular, the plaintiff would
have been free to take action against the defendant by way of a step-by-step action in
order to obtain certainty in the first stage by means of a claim for information as to
which specific data points from which source were collected by the defendant. In this
way, it would then have been possible to specifically check at the second or third stage
whether there is a risk of repetition in this respect. Incidentally, this would also lead the
legal dispute back to specific questions of fact and law that correspond to the logic of
civil proceedings, instead of the path sought here by the plaintiff's side of putting the
defendant's business model to the test in a generally binding manner, as it were, almost
without any specific reference to the plaintiff in individual cases - an undertaking for
which civil proceedings do not provide the appropriate instruments.
108 (c) Nothing else would apply under the hypothesis that a claim for injunctive relief could
be derived from the GDPR itself, whether from Art. 17, 18 GDPR or from other provisions
of the GDPR. No matter how such a claim could be dogmatically substantiated and
structured in detail, it would in any case be necessary for the Chamber to be convinced
that - as is also the case under German law - a somehow tangible risk of first occurrence
or repetition can be assumed. However, this is not the case for the aforementioned
reasons.
109 (d) A stay of the proceedings in order to await the decision of the ECJ on the questions
raised by the BGH (BGH, decision of 26.9.2023 - VI ZR 97/22 (OLG Frankfurt in
Darmstadt) is not appropriate in this respect. As explained, the plaintiff's claim is ruled
out under every conceivable premise.
110 (2) Insofar as the plaintiff, on the other hand, requests the defendant refrain from using
the business tools at issue on third-party websites and apps to determine when the
plaintiff has visited which websites or which apps it has used, and then to transfer this
data to itself, store it there and use it, the action is well-founded.
111 (a) Such a claim arises from Art. 17, 18 GDPR or from other provisions of the GDPR,
but in any case from § 1004 para. 1 sentence 2 BGB analogously, § 823 para. 1 BGB,
Art. 2 para. 1 GG.
112 (b). It follows from the general regulatory objective of the GDPR that the legal system
must fundamentally provide a possibility for persons affected by unlawful data
processing operations to take action against them by means of injunctive relief. In this
respect, the ECJ states in its decision of October 4, 2024 - Case C-21/23
- that the general regulatory objective of the GDPR is to guarantee a high level of
protection for data subjects in the European legal area and to ensure the practical
effectiveness of the GDPR:
113 "On the other hand, in order to ensure effective protection data subjects with
regard to the processing of their personal data, it is necessary to
- Page13 from25 -
data and on the practical effectiveness of the substantive provisions of the
GDPR, it must be held that, although (...) an action for an injunction brought by
a competitor of the alleged infringer of rules on the protection of personal data
does not serve that objective but is intended to ensure fair competition, it
undeniably contributes to compliance with those rules and thus to strengthening
the rights of data subjects and ensuring a high level of protection for them (cf. in
that sense, judgment of April 28, 2022, Meta Platforms Ireland, CEU:C:2022:322,
para. 74). (...) Moreover, such an action for an injunction by a competitor, similar
to actions brought by associations for the protection of consumer interests,
could prove to be particularly effective in ensuring that protection, since it
makes it possible to prevent numerous infringements of the rights of individuals
affected by the processing of their personal data." (loc. cit., para. 46 et seq.).
114 Against this background, the Chamber is convinced that it must be ensured in any
case that impending legal impairments due to violations of the GDPR can also be
averted by way of injunctive relief. Whether this arises from the GDPR itself or via the
possible application of national law in this respect can be left open in the present
case, as follows.
115 (c) If national German law is taken as a basis (for this see, among others: BeckOGK/T.
Her- mann, 1.11.2024, BGB § 823 para. 1285), a claim for injunctive relief follows from
§ 1004
para. 1 sentence 2 BGB analogously, § 823 para. 1 BGB, Art. 2 para. 1 GG.
116 (aa) The plaintiff can initially demand that the defendant refrain from collecting the
aforementioned data points on third-party websites and apps.
117 The defendant's general practice of always disclosing, even without consent, standard
technical data that the defendant has a probability of more than 99
The collection of data via the business apps that allows the identification of the
respective user within the metasystems, as well as the date that and when the third-
party site in question was visited with these technical parameters, impairs the right to
informational self-determination of the data subjects. This fundamental right, which is
essential under the conditions of a modern mass society that is deeply influenced by
digital systems
118 ("Anyone who is unable to assess with sufficient certainty what information
concerning him is known in certain areas of his social environment, and who is
unable to assess the knowledge of possible communication partners to some
extent, may be substantially inhibited in his freedom to plan or decide on the
basis of his own self-determination" (BVerfGE 65, 1 \[43\]
= NJW 1984, 419). (BVerfG, decision of November 6, 2019 - 1 BvR 16/13 -, juris))
119 protects the holders of fundamental rights, including vis-à-vis private individuals, in
their right to for themselves which data to disclose to third parties - and which not.
120 The defendant's practice is also unlawful. Aspects that could make this specific form of
data processing by the defendant appear lawful have not been presented and are not
apparent.
- Page14 from25 -
121 In particular, there is no justification pursuant to Art. 6 (1) GDPR.
122 In particular, there is no consent of the data subjects for this form of data processing, as
is undisputed between the parties. Rather, this data collection takes place in every case
and regardless of whether the data subjects have consented to this or not when
accessing the website or app in question. The Chamber is unable to comprehend the
defendant's representative's oral submission at the hearing that the plaintiff given its
consent. defendant itself stated in its statement of defense that there was no consent
(p. 52, para. 99,
p. 105 of the file). This remained undisputed below. In contrast, the defendant's
representative's assertion in the hearing of the plaintiff (p. 13 of the minutes) that the
plaintiff had not deselected the cookie settings is in vain because the letter "dated
April 8, 2024, para. 79" referred to does not exist in this procedure and such a
paragraph number cannot found in the statement of defense with the alleged content.
Furthermore, it is also in the of
This obviously contradicts the pre-trial correspondence of the defendant, in which the
defendant also writes that the plaintiffs did not give their consent (Annex B 8, p. 8, p.
133 of the file). In this respect, the Chamber assumes a mere confusion on the part of
the defendant's representative and treats the lack of consent as undisputed. This
applies all the more since the defendant side again argues the opposite in its pleading
of December 6, 2024 (p. 22) and now again argues that the plaintiff side did not
consent.
123 The defendant's argument that this is a widespread practice beyond meta-products and
is ultimately due to the current functioning of "the internet" is also unconvincing. The
Chamber is still able to understand that such data transmissions may be necessary, in
particular for standard technical data, in order to be able to properly load and display
embedded functionalities from third-party providers - whereby consent must also be
obtained in advance in accordance with the GDPR, otherwise access to the embedded
functionality cannot be established. Above all, however, it is not clear to the Chamber
what this technical circumstance has to do with the implementation of the business
tools at issue here. These are not used by the third-party companies and the defendant
- as far as can be reconstructed from the defendant's extensive submission - to offer
any content on third-party sites, but exclusively to record the usage behavior of users
for advertising purposes. If the defendant did not offer these tools, the websites
accessed would be usable without any changes from the user's point of view.
Disadvantages would arise for the defendant itself, namely for its efforts to create
personality profiles on a mass scale in its own business interests in order to use them
commercially for advertising purposes.
124 The defendant is also responsible for the data collection of the business tools it has
designed within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR. In this respect, the "controller" within
the meaning of the GDPR is each
A natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly
with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
According to established ECJ case law, it is also sufficient for the person in question to
influence the means and purposes of data processing in their own interest (BeckOK
DatenschutzR/Spoerr, 50th ed. 1.8.2024,
- Page15 from25 -
GDPR Art. 26 para. 18-25). According to ECJ case law, the necessary contribution to
data processing can already lie in enabling the collection of data and influencing the
categories of data to be collected. Accordingly, the Chamber has no doubts as to the
responsibility of the defendant, as it provides the business tools it has developed,
has configured the data collection on which this is based itself, even without the
defendant's consent, and the data transmitted to it by the third-party providers also
itself and for its own economic benefit. The defendant cannot convincingly counter that
the data is ultimately collected by the third-party operators and then forwarded to them.
This is because it is in any case jointly responsible - possibly alongside the third-party
operators. In this respect, reference can be made to the following statements of the ECJ
(judgment of July 29, 2019 - C-40/17 -, Juris):
125 "By integrating such a social plugin into its website, Fashion ID has also
decisively influenced the collection and transmission of personal data of visitors
to that site for the benefit of the provider of that plugin, in this case Facebook
Ireland, which would not take place without the integration of that plugin. In
those circumstances, and subject to the verifications to be carried out by the
referring court, must be held Facebook Ireland and Fashion ID jointly decided
on the means underlying the collection of personal data of visitors to Fashion
ID's website and their disclosure by transmission.(...) Consequently, Fashion ID
must be regarded as jointly responsible with Facebook Ireland for the operations
of collection of personal data of visitors to its website and their disclosure by
transmission within the meaning of Article 2( d) of Directive 95/46".
126 The facts of the case dealt with in the judgment of the ECJ can be compared with the
present case. Here too, data is forwarded to the defendant by a "tool" of the
defendant, namely a business tool installed by a third party.
127 Finally, the resulting infringement of the rights of those affected by the business tools
also a sufficiently concrete and immediate threat for the plaintiff party, which it can
counter with an individual claim for injunctive relief. As above, the starting point here is
also that the plaintiff must specifically demonstrate that the asserted infringement is
sufficiently imminent and imminent for them (risk of repetition or at least risk of first
infringement, cf. e.g. MüKoBGB/Raff, 9th ed. 2023, BGB § 1004 para. 295-297). In
contrast to the above, this is to be assumed for the infringement of rights dealt with
here. This is because, as explained and in contrast to the above, the collection of data
does not depend on further parameters and settings, but takes place automatically and
in every case of a page or app call and completely independently of the plaintiff's
consent. This means that there is always a risk of infringement when a page or app
that has implemented the business tool is accessed. In view of the very widespread use
of these tools on countless apps and websites, this risk is extremely obvious without
the need for further presentation by the plaintiff. The mere fact that the tools are
implemented on the sites listed in the non-confidential facts creates the obvious risk
that the plaintiff may also be personally affected by the implemented tools in the
future. This risk is underpinned by the 466 exemplary German-language websites listed
in Annex K 2, which also contain the business tools.
- Page16 from25 -
implemented. The Chamber also classifies this submission as undisputed, as the
defendant did not dispute this information in a comprehensible manner, but merely
stated diffusely that there were "no indications" of this (statement of defense, p. 40,
para. 70= p. 93 of the file).) - an inadmissible marginal remark that obviously leaves
open whether the defendant wishes to deny this with ignorance - which would probably
be inadmissible - or possibly merely spares the effort to verify the information and
therefore leaves it at suggesting unverified doubts - which would be just as possible in
civil proceedings as it would have no consequences.
128 (bb) Furthermore, the plaintiff can also demand that the defendant refrain from
transferring the data points collected in this way to its own servers. Reference can
be made in full to the above statements in this respect. This process also always takes
place regardless of whether the data subjects have consented to it or not.
129 (cc) Nothing else applies to the claim to refrain from subsequently storing and further
using the corresponding data points. In particular, it should be emphasized once again
that it remained undisputed between the parties, even after express judicial inquiry at
the hearing, that the defendant adds the data points in question to the personality
profile of the data subjects even if no consent was given for this. The unlawfulness of
this practice can be grasped with hands and also cannot be reconciled in any way with
the defendant's own submission that it relies on the consent given to it by the users with
regard to the data processing carried out - which does not exist (see above).
130 Moreover, the defendant's reference to "security and integrity purposes", which is not
further explained, is also unconvincing. The submission is largely unclear, is also not
explained in a comprehensible manner and is clearly not admissible and therefore
irrelevant.
131 (d) Nothing else would apply if the basis for the claim were not German law but a claim
derived from the GDPR. Even after detailed consultation, the Chamber is not aware of
any further substantive points of examination that could result from this that deviate
from the above examination scheme. Rather, it seems obvious to the Chamber that in
this case, too, it would be necessary to examine who is responsible, whether an
infringement within the meaning of the GDPR is being asserted and whether this is
sufficiently imminent. The question raised in the order for reference of the Federal Court
of Justice (BGH, decision of 26.9.2023 - VI ZR 97/22) regarding any European law
requirements for the determination of a risk of recurrence is not relevant, as it is
undisputed between the parties that such a risk exists here (see above).
132 (dd) For the aforementioned reasons, a suspension of the is also out of the question in
this respect. In particular, following the most recent decision of the ECJ, it appears to
the Chamber that there could be neither a claim based on GDPR law nor a national
claim.
133 b. The plaintiff is not to claim damages, neither under Art. 82 GDPR (aa.) nor
under Section 823 (1) BGB in conjunction with Art. Art. 1, 2 GG (bb.).
- Page17 from25 -
134 (1) There is no claim under Art. 82 GDPR.
135 (a) The Chamber still assumes that the plaintiff is also individually affected - even if
only partially - by the data processing at issue by means of the so-called business
tools.
136 As already stated in the note dated November 27, 2024, the Chamber no longer
assumes that the plaintiff always needs to provide more substantiated information on
individual pages visited. Rather, the extent of the duty to substantiate depends on the
reasonableness in each individual case. The duty to substantiate is limited by the
subjective knowledge of the party and the reasonableness of further explanations (see,
for example, Mertins, Substantiation in Civil Proceedings, NJ 2009, 441 with reference to
BGH, judgment of 27.11.1985 - IV a ZR 97/84 -, NJW 1986, 1162).
137 The Chamber concludes from this that, in the present case, it is generally not reasonable
to expect the plaintiff to provide more detailed information on the individual homepages
visited and provided with the defendant's business tools during the period in question
and that it is therefore generally sufficient for the plaintiff to submit that every
Instagram or Facebook user was very likely affected by surveillance measures by the
business tools used. On the one hand, no one can naturally reconstruct with reasonable
effort which homepages he or she visited at what time in the past and no one is obliged
to keep corresponding history logs on their computers. On the other hand, even if this
knowledge were available, the plaintiff would not be able to make a more substantiated
submission, since the plaintiff does not even a rudimentary complete overview of which
of the defendant's business tools were contained on which homepages at what time. In
fact, the plaintiff would be forced to disclose its entire internet usage behavior - which
would obviously be in blatant contradiction to the purpose of the GDPR.
138 Incidentally, the Federal Constitutional Court has also ruled accordingly on the question
of how substantiated a complaint must be in constitutional complaint proceedings
regarding the violation of the right to informational self-determination by intelligence
measures. The Federal Constitutional Court stated verbatim:
139 "To justify the possibility of personal and present concern through a statutory
authorization for secret measures, in which the concrete
If the impairment only occurs as a result of enforcement, but the persons
affected do not usually become aware of the acts of enforcement, it is sufficient
if the complainants demonstrate that they are likely to be affected in their own
fundamental rights by measures based on the challenged legal norms (see
BVerfGE 155, 119 <160 para. 75>). (...) The likelihood of being personally
affected is supported by a wide range of surveillance measures, i.e. if the
measure is not aimed at a narrowly defined group of persons, in particular if it
can also affect a large number of third parties by chance (BVerfGE 162, 1 <53
para. 98>)." (BVerfG, decision
of 08.10.2024 - 1 BvR 1743/16, 1 BvR 2539/16 -, BeckRS 2024, 30241, para.
89).
- Page18 from25 -
140 The Chamber is convinced that these principles are transferable to the issue at hand.
Here too, the monitoring of users in dispute takes place in such a way that they do not
understand when visiting third-party sites whether and which data concerning them is
sent to Meta and what happens to this data there. In addition, the measures are
indisputably very wide-ranging, are not aimed at a limited group of people and
potentially and inevitably cover a very large number of people. The defendant's defense
options are also not unreasonably restricted by this. Since it is undisputed that the
defendant further processed the data received, it should be able to fully and
comprehensibly check in its systems whether the plaintiff was possibly and contrary to
all probability not affected at all - and thus be able to present and, if necessary, prove
this.
141 For the present proceedings, however, it does not follow from this that the Chamber can
generally assume that the plaintiff is also individually affected by all of the defendant's
data processing operations at issue. This is because, as already explained above in the
context of the action for injunctive relief, there is a high probability of individual concern
only with regard to the collection of standard technical data. With regard to the other
personal data beyond this, there is no such sufficient probability, as the collection of
these data points is heavily dependent on which specific pages are visited, which
business tools are integrated on these, how these are configured and which consents
are obtained from the third-party site operators with which consequences in the absence
of consent. Insofar as the plaintiff also wishes to justify its individual involvement with
these data points, it would therefore - as already explained above - have to take the
step-by-step action with an action for information at the first stage. In this respect, and
still provisionally after reviewing a large number of screenshots of information available
online in the Instagram app, the Chamber assumes that the information provided there
is so incomplete and diffuse that the plaintiff cannot be referred to it. In particular, it is
regularly stated there by default that "\[here\] not all of your activities may be displayed",
so that for this reason alone no reliable picture emerges. As a rule, no information is
provided with the justification "There are currently no activities" - without any indication
as to which period is to be described as "current" and why no information is provided
with regard to "previous" periods.
142 (b) Despite the fact that the plaintiff is thus individually affected, at least with regard to
the processing of the standard technical data, there is no claim for damages as a result.
The Chamber is unable to establish any damage suffered by the plaintiff.
143 In principle, Art. 82 para. 1 GDPR allows for compensation for material and non-material
damage. The plaintiff has not alleged any material financial loss. It is relying solely on
the existence of non-material damage. According to the established case law of the
Chamber, the fears and concerns described by the plaintiff as well as the violation of the
right to informational self-determination or the associated loss of control are
conceivable as connecting factors for immaterial damage within the meaning of Art. 82
GDPR. In detail:
- Page19 from25 -
144 (aa) In the present case, damage within the meaning of Art. 82 GDPR cannot be justified
by the plaintiff's fears and concerns.
145 After it was largely unclear until the end of 2023 whether the fears and concerns of
data subjects caused by data protection breaches already constituted sufficient
damage within the meaning of Art. 82 GDPR, the Court of Justice of the European Union
clarified for the first time in its ruling of December 14, 2023 that
146 "the mere fact that a data subject fears that his personal data may be misused
by third parties as a result of a breach of the GDPR may constitute 'non-
material damage' within the meaning of that provision." (ECJ, judgment of
December 14, 2023 - C- 340/21 -, Juris).
147 The Court of Justice then expanded on this case law in its ruling of January 25, 2024
and once again ruled that
148 the term "non-material damage" covers a situation in which the person
concerned has a well-founded fear - which is a matter for the national court
seized to examine - that some of their personal data will be disseminated or
misused by third parties in the future (ECJ, judgment of January 25, 2024 - C-
687/21 -, Juris),
149 However, the Court of Justice has - to this extent restrictively - assigned the national
courts the task of examining whether this fear
150 "can be regarded as justified in the particular circumstances and with regard to
the person concerned." (ECJ, judgment of December 14, 2023 - C-340/21 -,
Juris).
151 This is not the case, for example, if the risk of unlawful data disclosure proves to be
purely hypothetical (ECJ, judgment of January 25, 2024 - C-687/21 -, Juris).
152 In the subsequent ruling of December 21, 2023, it then expressly stated that Art. 82
GDPR does not have a de minimis limit with regard to the degree of fear or concern to
be required:
153 "Thus, it cannot be assumed that, in addition to these (...) conditions, further
conditions may be imposed for liability under Art. 82 I GDPR, such as that the
detriment must be tangible or the impairment must be objective.
Consequently, Art. 82 I GDPR does not require that, after a proven breach of
the provisions of this regulation, the "non-material damage" claimed by the
data subject must exceed a "de minimis threshold" in order for this damage to
be compensable (ECJ, judgment of December 14, 2023 - C-340/21 -, Juris).
154 In this context, the Court repeatedly uses the formula "however minor it may be" with
regard to the intensity of the damage (ECJ, loc. cit.).
155 However, the Chamber - again in accordance with established case law - that the
concerns or fears justified in this way must be causally traceable to the violation of
legal interests in question. In the constellation at hand, this is of course not the case.
- Page20 from25 -
The Chamber is convinced that the fears and concerns expressed must also have a
convincing causal link to this specific processing. The Chamber is convinced that this
means that the fears and concerns expressed must also have a convincing causal
connection to this specific processing. This requirement also rules out the possibility that
any diffuse ideas on the part of the plaintiff about the defendant's business model can be
used as grounds for damages under the heading of "fears and worries". Rather, it is
necessary that the plaintiff has formed at least a layman's approximate precise idea of
the defendant's processing procedures with regard to the standard technical data, which
alone justify the personal involvement, and that this idea is at least a contributory cause
of the fears and concerns described.
156 The Chamber is unable to establish such a situation even after a detailed personal
interview with the plaintiff. Rather, it follows from the personal hearing that the plaintiff
is merely "somehow" concerned about the processing of various data by the defendant
in a very general and largely diffuse manner - and this mainly in relation to its use of the
"Facebook" platform, which is not the subject of the dispute. Several of the exemplary
data collection processes named by her (alleged interception of conversations, spam
emails, strange calls, "fishing" of search terms, etc.) have no connection whatsoever to
the data collection processes at issue here, let alone to the processing of standard
technical data, which alone justifies her personal involvement. In this completely diffuse
overall situation, it is impossible for the Chamber to determine the extent to which this
point, which is the sole basis for the action, has any influence at all on the fears and
concerns described and what amount of damages could be appropriate.
157 (bb) Furthermore, damage cannot be based on the aspect of the violation of the right
to informational self-determination or the mere loss of control. It is true that the
Chamber assumes, in consistent and perennial case law, that the mere loss of control
and thus the resulting violation of the right to informational self-determination is
already sufficient to justify damage (see most recently in detail, for example, LG
Lübeck, judgment of October 4, 2024
- Az. 15 O 216/23 -, Juris and Landesrechtsprechungsdatenbank Schleswig-Holstein) and
also sees itself confirmed in this by the most recent decision of the Federal Court of
Justice (BGH, judgment of November 18, 2024 - IV ZR 10/24 -, Juris). In this respect, the
Chamber does not consider it to be ruled out in principle that the plaintiff could be
entitled to compensation for damages to the extent that the defendant has unlawfully
processed, stored and passed on the third party sites on which the plaintiff has stayed
(see above), at least with the help of the standard technical data, and has thereby
caused the plaintiff to lose control over this data. However, the Chamber assumes that,
with regard to the amount of damage, it is necessary for the plaintiff to demonstrate
and prove, at least approximately, which type of data points are affected and in what
numerical order of magnitude. Obviously, it is of considerable relevance for the
determination of the amount of damage whether the defendant has only processed a
few visits to a common website over the course of several years, or whether it recorded
dozens of different and sometimes highly personal Internet movements every day and
processed them unlawfully into a precise personality profile. Since no approximately
substantiated submission - let suitable evidence - is available in this regard, any
estimate of damages would be completely unfounded and
- Page21 from25 -
thus arbitrary. The submission in the pleading of November 14, 2024 (p. 440 of the file)
does not change this either, since the statement that the plaintiff "regularly" visits the
sites mentioned there does not provide sufficient starting points for even a reasonable
estimate of damages and the defendant has also subsequently objected without dispute
that any business tools are embedded on three of the five sites mentioned (p. 458 et
seq. of the file).
158 (2) Nor does a claim arise from the violation of the general right of personality, Section
823 (1) BGB in conjunction with Art. 1, 2 GG. Art. 1, 2 GG. The court is convinced that
the provision of Art. 82 GDPR a blocking effect in this respect. The Regional Court of
Nuremberg-Fürth convincingly this:
159 "It is true that control over one's own data, for example in questions of storage,
is guaranteed by the right to informational self-determination, which a
manifestation of the general right of personality, and is protected as another
right by the claim for damages under Section 823 (1) BGB (Grüneberg, BGB,
82nd ed,
§ Section 823 para. 132). However, Art. 82 GDPR has created a uniform and
conclusive basis for claims for damages for personal data, which takes
precedence over national law (OLG Frankfurt of 30.03.2023, Ref. 16 U 22/22,
juris para. 58f.). This is already supported by Recital 9 GDPR, which speaks of the
creation of a uniform level of protection in
the Union. It would run counter to the desired full harmonization if there were
different additional claims for damages in the national legal systems, so that the
GDPR has a blocking effect in this respect. This is also not contradicted by the
fact that recital 146 p. 3 GDPR declares that compensation for damages under
the GDPR applies without prejudice to claims for damages based on violations of
other provisions of Union law or the law of the Member States. Accordingly,
further claims for damages remain in principle (Ehmann/Selmayr/Nemitz, GDPR,
3rd edition, Art. 82 para. 11). This also includes the general claim for damages
under German law on the basis of Section 823 (1) BGB in conjunction with Art. 2
para. 1, Art. 1 para. 1 GG (violation of the general right of personality), which
remains applicable (Simitis/Hornung/Spiecker gen. Döhmann, Data Protection
Law, Art. 82 GDPR para. 32). However, this does not mean that claims for
damages based on GDPR infringements can be pursued on other grounds than
Art. 82 GDPR. This should therefore also prevent the classification of GDPR
standards as a protective law within the meaning of Section 823 (2) BGB
(Borges/Keil, Big Data, 1st edition, Section 7 Liability for data and analyses para.
267)." (Nuremberg-Fürth Regional Court: judgment of 28.11.2024 - Ref. 6 O
5782/23 -).
160 The court here agrees with this. The above explanations are particularly convincing
because the claim for damages under Section 823 (1) BGB in conjunction with Art. Art.
1, 2 GG was developed in its genesis in the first place in order to protect data subjects
from non-transparent processing or use of their personal data via the fundamental right
to informational self-determination recognized by the Federal Constitutional Court, thus
closing a legal protection gap that otherwise exists in German law (cf. in particular also
BeckOGK/T. Hermann, 1.11.2024, BGB § 823 para. 1285). Such a legal protection gap
exists after the validity of the
- Page22 from25 -
However, Art. 82 para. 1 GDPR no longer applies, as it claims to all material and
immaterial damages. Therefore, within the scope of application of Art. 82 GDPR, it is no
longer necessary to resort to the claim for monetary compensation for non-material
damage, which arises from the protection mandate of Art. 2 para. 1 GG, Art. 1 para. 1
GG (loc. cit., para. 1287)
161 c. There is also no entitlement to compensation for pre-litigation legal costs. Pre-trial
legal fees are generally covered by the claim for damages under Art. 82 para. 1 GDPR
(BeckOK, Datenschutzrecht, 49. Ed. 1.8.2024, DS-GVO6 O 5782/23 - Page 32 Art. 82
para. 29 with reference to OLG Schleswig judgment of July 2, 2021, Ref. 17 U 15/21,
BeckRS 2021, 16986 para. 53). However, the pre-trial proceedings of the plaintiffs'
representatives did not constitute appropriate legal action. The plaintiffs'
representatives must have been aware - as was the court - from the large number of
mandates they had handled that the defendant was not prepared to comply with any
extrajudicial requests. In any case, the plaintiff's representatives had to assume and
explain to the plaintiff that a mandate initially limited to out-of-court assertion was not
expedient and would only cause unnecessary costs. It was obvious that the plaintiff's
claims could only be realized by filing a lawsuit, so that the plaintiff's representatives
must have felt compelled to immediately obtain an unconditional mandate to file a
lawsuit (see also Regional Court of Nuremberg-Fürth, judgment of 2 November 2023,
Ref. 6 O 2382/23, BeckRS 2023, 32830, para. 31).
162 d. Moreover, the Chamber does not fail to recognize that, in the context of the above
explanations, a thoroughly problematic overall picture can emerge of a case law that
does not adequately sanction a business practice of the defendant that is, at least in
part, tangibly unlawful (see above) under civil law. However, the Chamber is convinced
that this is an inevitable consequence of the fact that civil proceedings and the rules
created for them are designed to compensate for or prevent concrete and
individualizable legal disadvantages. The sanctioning of general "business practices", on
the other hand, is a matter for public law and the competent authorities at national and
European level. If individual plaintiffs wish to have individual legal issues dealt with
under civil law, they must make the considerable effort to present their own specific
situation - which, in the constellations presented here, is probably not possible in the
overall case for the reasons outlined.
This is likely to make it necessary, at the very least, to proceed by way of complex step-
by-step actions. Moreover, the Chamber also takes the liberty of pointing out, with all
due restraint, that in this respect and in accordance with the logic of civil proceedings, it
may also be more expedient to consider precisely which concrete and individualizable
infringements of rights can be asserted with a prospect of success by which specific
measures before bringing an action - instead of de facto large parts of the defendant's
general business practice, numerous different tools and functionalities as well as a wide
variety of processing operations from data collection to data transfer to the USA
"somehow" become the subject of the proceedings and thus of a set of civil instruments
not created for this purpose.
II.
163 The decision on costs follows from Section 92 (2) No. 1 ZPO. According to this, the may
order one party to pay the entire costs of the proceedings if the additional claim of the
other party was relatively minor and no or only minor costs were incurred.
- Page23 from25 -
has caused minor costs. A case of insignificance can be assumed in particular if the
unsuccessful part includes up to 10% of the amount in dispute (MüKoZPO/Schulz, 6th ed.
2020, Section 92, para. 19; BGH Judgement v. 10.4.2019, Ref. VIII ZR 12/18,
para. 56). Such a case here. The defendant is only subject to a part of the claim for
injunctive relief, which is set at EUR 1,000 (alone) for the purpose of determining the cost
ratio, taking into account the large number of sub-items applied for, and thus at less
than 10% of the total amount in dispute of EUR 15,500.00.
III.
164 Provisional enforceability is governed by sections 709 sentence 1 and sentence 2,
269 (3) ZPO. IV.
165 The chamber set the value of the fees in dispute at 15,500.00€ .
166 1. the Chamber has based the assessment of the amount in dispute on the starting point in
accordance with
§ In accordance with Section 48 (1) sentence 1 GKG, the provisions of Sections 3, 6-9
ZPO on the value of the subject matter of the dispute applicable to the jurisdiction of
the trial court or the admissibility of the appeal are taken as a basis. In the specific
dispute, it must also be taken into account that a number of motions are the subject of
the proceedings and that the disputes to be classified partly as property law and
partly as non-property law, depending on the motion.
167 Whether a legal dispute is of a pecuniary or non-pecuniary nature determined by the
purpose of the respective claim. If the claim is directly aimed at a pecuniary benefit, it is
always a pecuniary dispute. Furthermore, claims that are based on or originate from
property law relationships as well as claims that essentially serve to protect economic
interests are to be qualified as property law claims. In all other cases, the legal
relationship from which the asserted claim is derived is decisive (see Elzer in:
Toussaint, Kostenrecht, 53rd ed. 2023, GKG Section 48 para. 7 with further
references).
168 In cases of non-pecuniary disputes, Section 48 (2) sentence 1 GKG stipulates that the
amount in dispute is to be determined at the discretion of the court, taking into
account all circumstances of the individual case, in particular the scope and
importance of the matter and the financial and income circumstances of the parties,
whereby the limits pursuant to Section 48 (2) sentence 1 GKG apply.
§§ Sections 34 (1), 48 (2) sentence 2 GKG are 500€ and 1 million€ . In principle, a value
of € 5,000 can be assumed in accordance with Section 23 (3) sentence 2 RVG in the case
of a non-property dispute and a lack of sufficient evidence for a higher or lower interest
(see, for example, BGH, decision of November 17, 2015 - II ZB 8/14 -, para. 13, juris).
Furthermore, when making the assessment, the overall context of the valuation of non-
pecuniary matters in dispute must not be lost sight of (see BGH decision of January 28,
2021 - III ZR 162/20 -, GRUR-RS 2021, 2286 para. 9 with further references).
169 2. measured against this, the chamber set the value in dispute at a total of
15,500.00€ . In detail:
- Page24 from25 -
170 a. The application under 1. concerns a non-pecuniary dispute. The application is aimed
at establishing that the collection of personal data with the help of Meta Business Tools,
the disclosure and storage as well as the subsequent use of this data by the defendant
was not permitted by the user agreement concluded between the parties.
171 The plaintiff's main concern - as it asserts in its further applications - is, on the one hand,
the future cessation of data collection, the forwarding of the collected data to the
defendant's servers and the storage and subsequent use of this data there, as the
plaintiff has stated in its application for a declaratory judgment. On the other hand, it
was concerned - until the partial withdrawal of the action in this respect - with the
deletion of precisely this data. The declaratory judgment sought with the application
under 1. is therefore of no economic added value for the plaintiff, as it can reasonably
achieve its request with the other applications (injunction, deletion). For this reason, no
separate value is to be set for the request for a declaratory judgment when assessing
the value in dispute. See also the above comments on the inadmissibility of the action
for a declaratory judgment due to the lack of interest in a declaratory judgment based
on the priority of the action for performance (I.1.b.).
172 b. The application for injunctive relief filed as application no. 2 concerns a non-property
dispute. The Chamber has set a disputed fee value of 5,000.00€ for this application for
injunctive relief .
173 As explained above, the amount in dispute of the application for injunctive relief as a
non-pecuniary matter in dispute must be determined on the basis of the interest
concerned, taking into account the respective circumstances of the individual case,
Section 48 (2) sentence 1 GKG. According to the case law of the Federal Court of Justice,
a value of € 5,000 can be assumed based on Section 23 (3) sentence 2 RVG in the case
of a non-pecuniary dispute and a lack of sufficient evidence for a higher or lower interest
(Federal Court of Justice, decision of November 17, 2015 - II ZB 8/14, WM 2016, 96
marginal no. 13). In its complaint, the plaintiff emphasizes, among other things, how
serious the defendant's interference is, particularly with regard to the right to
informational self-determination as part of the general right of personality. It quantifies
the claim for non-material damages itself at € 5,000.00, expressly emphasizing that in
its opinion this is an absolute minimum amount.
174 The Chamber therefore, in particular due to the lack of concrete evidence for a higher or
lower value, does not apply the idea of the general value rule of the
Section 23 (3) sentence 2 RVG, the value of the application for injunctive relief is
5,000.00€ .
175 c. The application under 3. concerns a pecuniary dispute; the amount in dispute
results from the immaterial (minimum) compensation amount of € 5,000.00
presented by the plaintiff.
176 d. With regard to the withdrawn application under 3. (see statement of 26.09.2024) for
an obligation to leave the data unchanged at the stored location and subsequent
deletion, a value of 5,000.00€ was also to be applied. Reference is made to the
explanations under 2.b. for justification.
177 With regard to the withdrawn application under 4. (cf. statement of 26.09.2024) for
anonymization and deletion, the Chamber has set a value in dispute of EUR 500.00.
- Page25 from25 -
ro was applied. This application essentially comprises the request already made with the
withdrawn application under 3.
