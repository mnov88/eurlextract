## English Summary

### Facts

In 2021, the data subject concluded a postpaid telecommunications contract with a telecommunications provider (controller), which included a discounted purchase of an expensive mobile phone .

The controller transferred  the data regarding the registration of the data subjects’ mobile phone contract to SCHUFA, a German credit reference agency. The data are considered “positive data” (i.e. non-adverse contractual information).

In September 2023, the contract was terminated.

In October 2023, SCHUFA deleted the data about the data subject.

The data subject brought legal proceedings against the controller before the court of first instance. They argued that the controller transmitted his data unlawfully as the transmission had occurred without their explicit consent and did not qualify for any other lawful basis under [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). They also asserted that the controller had not adequately informed them of the transmission. The data subject requested the following relief from the court:

a.     Non-material damages due to the transfer of their contract data to SCHUFA.

b. An injunction preventing future transmission of positive data to SCHUFA.

c.     A declaratory finding of liability for damages under [Article 82 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR "Article 82 GDPR").

d.    Reimbursement of legal expenses under GDPR as immaterial damages.

They also sought to refer the matter to the CJEU for clarification.

The court of first instance rejected the data subject’s claim.

In 2024, the data subject appealed the decision before the court of appeal (Oberlandesgericht Koblenz-OLG Koblenz).

### Holding

The court ruled the claim to be wholly unfounded.

First, the court decided that the controller lawfully transmitted the data subject’s data to SCHUFA. The controller pursued the legitimate interest of fraud prevention and ensuring creditworthiness assessments ([Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1#f "Article 6 GDPR")), serving the socio-economic interests of the telecommunications industry. More specifically, the court stated that the rights of the data subject at this case ‘do not outweigh the rights and interests of the defendant in participating in the solidarity-based fraud prevention system described in order to protect against economic damage’. It is irrelevant that the controller itself does not benefit from the subsequent registration of the data subject’s contract data.

The court pointed out that the controller was under no obligation to obtain consent from the data subject. Plus, the data subject could easily recognise from the contract documents that after the conclusion of the contract with the controller, the contract data in dispute might be transmitted by his contractual partner to SCHUFA.

Therefore, the court rejected the claim for damages under [Article 82 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR "Article 82 GDPR"). There was no GDPR violation, and no immaterial damage was found to arise from legal expenses or general discomfort.

Second, the court rejected the injunctive relief, as there was no active or future contractual relationship between the data subject and the controller, making the risk of future unlawful transmission purely hypothetical.

Thirdly, the court found the request for declaratory judgment unfounded in the absence of a data protection breach.

Lastly, the court denied the CJEU referral request. It found no need to revisit settled law, particularly as the data subject’s data had already been deleted and the legal basis was well-established.

## Comment

This ruling reinforces the principle that [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") provides a lawful ground for transmitting both negative and positive data to credit agencies such as SCHUFA, particularly when used for fraud prevention or credit scoring. The court emphasized that consent is not the only valid legal basis, especially where the controller's legitimate interest is balanced appropriately against the data subject’s rights. This judgment also narrows the potential for data subjects to use [Article 82 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR "Article 82 GDPR") for broad claims based solely on discomfort or procedural grievances without a clear GDPR violation. Furthermore, it pushes back against the trend in some regional courts (e.g., OLG Düsseldorf) that require consent for nearly all credit agency transmissions, suggesting a more permissive reading of GDPR for financial institutions and telecom operators. Whether this case will be appealed or reconciled with contradictory higher court rulings remains to be seen.

Guiding Principle
1. The transmission of so-called "positive data" by a telecommunications company to SCHUFA may, in individual cases, be justified pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR by a legitimate interest of the provider and third parties in fraud prevention by maintaining a reliable scoring system, which outweighs the other interests.

2. Damage within the meaning of Article 82 GDPR in the form of a loss of control over personal data may be precluded if the informed customer has not exercised their right to object to the registration of their "positive data" with SCHUFA.

Previous LG Bad Kreuznach, December 2, 2024, 2 O 83/24
Opinion
I. The plaintiff's appeal against the judgment of the single judge of the Regional Court of Bad Kreuznach dated December 2, 2024, Ref. No. 2 O 83/24, is dismissed.

II. The plaintiff shall bear the costs of the appeal proceedings.

III. The judgment is provisionally enforceable.

IV. The appeal is denied.

V. The value in dispute in the appeal proceedings is set at €6,000.00.

Reasons
I.

Paragraph 1
The plaintiff is suing the defendant, with whom he concluded a postpaid telecommunications contract with a discounted purchase of an Apple iPhone 12 Pro on September 17, 2021, which was terminated in September 2023 (see attachment to the pleading dated May 5, 2025, pages 102.1 et seq. eGA-OLG), for damages, a declaration of infringement, and an injunction due to the notification of his mobile phone contract to SCHUFA Holding AG (hereinafter referred to as "SCHUFA").

Paragraph 2
A further presentation of factual findings within the meaning of Section 540 (1) Sentence 1 No. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure is unnecessary because an appeal against this judgment is undoubtedly inadmissible, Sections 540 (2), 313a (1) Sentence 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure in conjunction with Section 540 (2). In conjunction with Sections 543 and 544 (2) No. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO).

II.

Paragraph 3
The plaintiff's appeal, which is admissible pursuant to Sections 511 and 517 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), is unfounded on the merits.

Paragraph 4
According to Section 513 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), the appeal can only be based on the fact that the contested decision is based on a violation of law (Section 546 of the Code of Civil Procedure) or that the facts to be taken into account pursuant to Section 529 of the Code of Civil Procedure justify a different decision. These requirements are not met here.

Paragraph 5
The action is admissible, but unfounded due to the lack of a data protection violation that caused the damage, insofar as the plaintiff asserts a claim for non-pecuniary damages due to the transmission of his contractual data to SCHUFA (A.). It is admissible in the injunction application, in particular sufficiently specific, but also unfounded, since the application also covers lawful data transfers under certain circumstances and, moreover, the contractual relationship with the defendant has already ended (B.). The admissible declaratory action under 3. is unfounded for the reasons set out in A. (C.), as is the claim for payment of pre-trial legal fees (D.).

Paragraph 6
A. The action is admissible, but unfounded insofar as it seeks payment of non-material damages.

Paragraph 7
The plaintiff has no claim to damages under Article 82 of the GDPR due to the defendant's lack of a violation of the GDPR by transmitting his contractual data to S, and in any event due to the lack of any damage caused by a possible violation.

Paragraph 8
1. The corresponding data processing by the defendant was justified in the present case pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR.

Paragraph 9
a) By disclosing the plaintiff's personal data to SCHUFA as a third party, specifically the name, address, date of birth, the start and end dates of the telecommunications contract concluded between the parties, the contract number, and the reporting attribute SK - Service Account for the telecommunications account, the defendant processed data as a controller within the meaning of Article 82 (1) and Article 4 (7) GDPR.

Paragraph 10
b) In doing so, it can rely on Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which is the only relevant justification in this case.

Paragraph 11
aa) According to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, the processing of personal data is lawful under three cumulative conditions: First, a legitimate interest must be pursued by the controller or a third party; second, the processing of the personal data must be necessary to achieve that legitimate interest; and third, the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject must not override the interests (ECJ, judgment of December 7, 2023 – C-26/22 –, para. 75, juris).

Paragraph 12
In this context, a broad spectrum of interests can, in principle, be considered legitimate (ECJ, judgment of December 7, 2023 – C-26/22 –, para. 76, juris). Recital 47 to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR states, among other things, that a legitimate interest may exist, for example, if there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller, e.g. if the data subject is a customer of the controller. The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary to prevent fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the respective controller.

Paragraph 13
The requirement that the processing of personal data is necessary to achieve the perceived legitimate interest requires an examination of whether the legitimate interest in processing the data cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means that are less intrusive with the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter (ECJ, judgment of December 7, 2023 – C-26/22 –, para. 77, juris). The requirement of necessity for data processing must be examined in conjunction with the so-called "data minimization" principle, which is enshrined in Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR and requires that personal data be "adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes of the processing" (ECJ, judgment of December 7, 2023 – C-26/22 –, para. 78, juris). Processing must be carried out within the limits of what is strictly necessary to achieve the legitimate interest (ECJ, judgment of December 7, 2023 – C-26/22 –, para. 88, juris).

Paragraph 14
Finally, a balancing of the respective conflicting rights and interests is required, which fundamentally depends on the specific circumstances of the individual case (ECJ, judgment of December 7, 2023 – C-26/22 –, para. 79, juris). In balancing the respective conflicting rights and interests, i.e., those of the controller and the third parties involved on the one hand, and those of the data subject on the other, particular account must be taken of the reasonable expectations of the data subject, as well as the scope of the processing in question and its impact on that person (ECJ, judgment of December 7, 2023 – C-26/22 –, para. 87, juris). According to Recital 47 of the GDPR, it must be examined whether a data subject, at the time the personal data are collected and in view of the circumstances in which they are collected, can reasonably foresee that processing for that purpose might take place. Based on this recital, the ECJ has stated that the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject may override the interests of the controller, in particular when personal data are processed in situations where a data subject does not reasonably expect such processing (ECJ, judgment of 7 December 2023 – C-26/22 –, para. 80, juris).

Paragraph 15
bb) Based on this, the registration of the plaintiff's first and last name, his date of birth, and the contract number with the registration code "SK" for the purpose of creating a so-called service account with SCHUFA with this data was justified, at least for the purpose of fraud prevention and protecting consumers from the identity theft that is often associated with it (see also Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf, judgment of October 31, 2024 – I-20 U 51/24, 20 U 51/24, juris paras. 53 et seq., 72 et seq.; Higher Regional Court of Bamberg, judgment of April 7, 2025 – 4 U 120/24 e, appendix to the written submission of May 7, 2025, p. 105.1 et seq. eGA-OLG).

Paragraph 16
aa) By registering the personal data, the defendant pursued the legitimate interest of fraud prevention in a solidarity-based system in which the trustworthiness of potential new contractual partners in contracts based on advance payment by the service provider and their economic reliability are assessed on the basis of the positive and negative data submitted by all traffic participants. The specific data processing therefore served the socio-economic interests of the telecommunications industry in particular, but ultimately also of the honest customers of telecommunications companies. It is irrelevant that the subsequent registration of the plaintiff's contract data is of no use to the defendant, as it does not necessarily have to pursue (only) its own interests.

Paragraph 17
The defendant has already plausibly explained in its defense that in cases where potential customers conclude numerous mobile phone contracts with different providers within a short period of time, there is a statistically increased risk of fraud. It has substantiated various fraud schemes using this approach, in which perpetrators – sometimes in an organized manner – use false identities, including the parcel agent trick or systematically by slightly altering the name or date of birth to obtain telecommunications equipment from various telecommunications service providers worth up to approximately €1,000 for the purpose of resale, pre-financed telecommunications services through international roaming, micropayments, or calls to premium rate numbers, or use the concluded postpaid contracts, for example, to distribute links to websites containing malware. With reference to Annex 23 (pages 194.15 ff. of the eGA-LG), it has also explained that SCHUFA maintains information and services specifically tailored to the telecommunications industry, which, by feeding the information into the telecommunications providers' fraud prevention system, enable the effective filtering of various fraud cases before a contract is regularly concluded online.

Paragraph 18
bb) It is also understandable that the specific data processing was necessary to prevent fraud. A milder, equally suitable means has not been demonstrated or is apparent, even taking into account the principle of data economy.

Paragraph 19
First of all, the transmission of first and last name, address, and date of birth is essential for the unambiguous identification of the market participant.

Paragraph 20
Nor were all contracts concluded with the defendant registered in a blanket manner; rather, at the time of the contract conclusion, the plaintiff registered only those contracts that involved significant advance payments by the defendant over a longer period of time and were therefore fundamentally suitable for the fraud schemes identified through a large number of contracts concluded with different providers. In this specific case, the postpaid telecommunications service contract with the plaintiff was concluded for a term of at least 24 months at a monthly basic fee of €54.99, combined with a discounted hardware purchase of an Apple iPhone 12 Pro 256 GB for €154.00.

Paragraph 21
Obtaining consent to the subsequent transmission of contract data was ruled out as an equally suitable means of fraud prevention, since, in view of Section 7 (4) GDPR, it would not have been voluntary and would therefore have been ineffective anyway if the telecommunications providers, including the defendant, had made the conclusion of the contract dependent on the granting of consent, since data processing is not necessary for the performance of the specific contract. However, to the extent that the conclusion of the contract was not dependent on consent, any customer with fraudulent intent would not have granted consent.

Paragraph 22
To the extent that the plaintiff names other providers who offer services specifically for the telecommunications industry, given his own assertion that the defendant has the most comprehensive database in Germany, it cannot be assumed that the economic trustworthiness of potential contractual partners can be assessed with comparably realistic and reliable accuracy as on the S database, which also collects positive data in addition to negative data and also offers specific services for the telecommunications industry.

Paragraph 23
Relying solely on negative data, for example, as a result of payment defaults, is also not equally effective because, due to the requirements of Section 31 (2) Sentence 1 No. 4 of the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), the notification of payment defaults can generally only be made after the conclusion of a contract and, moreover, with a significant delay.

Paragraph 24
While the video identification process may be suitable for identifying the specific party interested in concluding a contract with a particular provider, it is inherently unsuitable for detecting a large number of contracts concluded with different providers within a short period of time as a reason for suspicion of fraud. Furthermore, it is also impractical in the highly automated mass business of the telecommunications industry.

Paragraph 25
Finally, retention of title to the smartphone is not equally suitable, since in this case the contract with the fraudster has already been concluded, the hardware has already been provided, and the provider is exposed to the risk of enforcing claims for return and/or damages.

Paragraph 26
bb) In the present case, the reasons for the violation pursuant to Article 8 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 2(1) in conjunction with Article 2(1) of the European Court of Human Rights do not outweigh the risks. The plaintiff's rights and interests in the protection of the personal data at issue, protected in conjunction with Article 1(1) of the Basic Law, overlap with the defendant's rights and interests in participating in the described solidarity-based fraud prevention system for the purpose of protection against economic damage, protected under Article 15 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 12 of the Basic Law.

Paragraph 27
The plaintiff could easily recognize from the contractual documents that, after the conclusion of the contract with the defendant, the contract data at issue might be transmitted by his contractual partner to SCHUFA.

Paragraph 28
Under clause 6 of the contract, it was visually highlighted and pointed out in bold that "personal data collected within the framework of this contractual relationship regarding the application, implementation, and termination of this business relationship, as well as data regarding non-contractual or fraudulent behavior, will be transmitted to the following credit agencies." SCHUFA Holding AG was then named first. Furthermore, he was also informed that the data would be processed by the credit agencies for profiling (scoring) and that the profiling was based on recognized mathematical-statistical procedures, whereby address data may also be used. A further reference to the exchange of data with, among others, SCHUFA – not only in the event of the plaintiff's non-contractual conduct – can be found in connection with the declaration of consent to obtain information from SCHUFA regarding non-contractual conduct and the registration of negative data.

Paragraph 29
Furthermore, the plaintiff had undisputedly taken note of the information sheet Appendix B24, which was available to him upon conclusion of the contract. In it, the defendant pointed out in section 9, also under the heading "Data transmission to credit agencies," that it cooperates with SCHUFA, not only in connection with creditworthiness and identity checks and the registration of claims in the event of non-contractual conduct. The third subheading, "Creation of a Service Account (S)," states that to protect market participants from defaults and risks, personal data relating to the application, initiation, and termination of the telecommunications contract (name, address, date of birth, information on the conclusion of this telecommunications contract, reference to the contract) will be transmitted to SCHUFA if the contract provides sufficient relevance (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR). For a reliable assessment of creditworthiness, it is important to have the most comprehensive picture possible of existing financial obligations. The storage of contractual relationships in the telecommunications sector at SCHUFA contributes to this. It was also pointed out that one should write to ...@....com if one does not wish to have data transmitted to SCHUFA. A link with further information from SCHUFA on data protection was also provided.

Paragraph 30
Especially since his contract involved significant monthly advance payments by the defendant, including, among other things, the purchase of high-quality hardware at a discount, the plaintiff could reasonably expect that his contract data would be registered with SCHUFA for fraud prevention purposes.

Paragraph 31
Given the mass business with postpaid mobile phone contracts, the defendant considers itself exposed to a significant overall economic risk. In contrast, the registration of the plaintiff's contract data for the purpose of profile creation appears acceptable.

Paragraph 32
Name, address, and date of birth are information necessary for the plaintiff's identification, which must also have been communicated to SCHUFA by the other registering parties identified in the information dated August 16, 2023, such as PayPal, to whom the plaintiff stated that he had given consent to the transfer of data. It can therefore be assumed that his identity was already known to SCHUFA before the defendant registered him – with the plaintiff's consent. It should be noted in passing that even under the information ban he claimed was imposed due to his work at the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), the ... registered his current address on March 16, 2023.

Paragraph 33
The contract data is not sensitive, since, in principle, any mobile phone communication partner can see that the plaintiff has concluded a telecommunications contract and can deduce from the telephone number which company he is contracting with. The fact that the plaintiff, identified in the above manner, concluded a mobile phone contract is a fact affecting his social sphere, a fact concerning an everyday business activity, which applies equally to a large number of adults in Germany and, in any case, does not in itself have any significant negative significance, at most to the extent that someone (also) has liabilities arising from such a contract. Furthermore, the fact that the plaintiff contracted with the defendant, a telecommunications company established in Germany for decades, does not have a negative connotation. It is not understandable why the reported facts should have a significant negative impact on the plaintiff's credit score. The plaintiff has not provided any evidence that the SCHUFA algorithm would incorrectly weight facts that, under reasonable consideration, have no negative significance for the customer's creditworthiness and would lead to mathematically incorrect, distorted results regarding creditworthiness.

Paragraph 34
2. However, even if one were to classify the data processing as impermissible, it would not have caused damage to the plaintiff in this case.

Paragraph 35
a) In the absence of a reference in Article 82(1) GDPR to the domestic law of the Member States, the term "non-material damage" must be defined autonomously under EU law within the meaning of this provision. According to Recital 146, sentence 3 of the GDPR, the concept of damage should be interpreted broadly, in a manner that fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation. However, a mere violation of the provisions of the GDPR is not sufficient to establish a claim for damages; rather, the occurrence of damage (as a result of this violation) is also required – as an independent prerequisite for a claim – regardless of whether the damage has reached a certain degree of severity or significance. The burden of proof for material or non-material damage suffered lies with the party claiming it. The rejection of a materiality threshold does not mean that a person affected by a breach of the GDPR that has had negative consequences for him or her is exempt from proving that these consequences constitute non-material damage within the meaning of Art. 82 GDPR (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of 18 November 2024 – VI ZR 10/24 –, juris para. 28 et seq. with further references).

Paragraph 36
According to Recital 85 of the GDPR, the damage may include, for example, loss of control over personal data or the restriction of their rights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, unauthorized removal of pseudonymization, damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality of data subject to professional secrecy, or other significant economic or social disadvantages for the natural person concerned. Accordingly, the ECJ has clarified that even the loss of control over personal data – even temporary – may constitute non-material damage, without this concept of "non-material damage" requiring proof of additional appreciable negative consequences or misuse of the data in question to the detriment of those individuals (ECJ, judgments of October 4, 2024 – C-200/23, juris paras. 145, 156 in conjunction with 137). The fear of a data subject that his or her personal data could be misused by third parties, triggered by a breach of the GDPR, may in itself constitute "non-material damage" within the meaning of Art. 82 (1) (ECJ, judgment of 20 June 2024 - C-590/22 -, juris para. 32; Federal Court of Justice, judgment of 18 November 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris para. 30 et seq. with further references). However, the mere assertion of a fear without proven negative consequences is just as insufficient as a purely hypothetical risk of misuse by an unauthorized third party (see ECJ, judgments of June 20, 2024 - C-590/22, DB 2024, 1676 para. 35 - PS GbR; of January 25, 2024 - C-687/21, CR 2024, 160 para. 68).

Paragraph 37
The affected party seeking compensation for non-material damage must therefore conclusively assert (and, if necessary, prove) that the violation of the GDPR has had negative consequences for them, which constitute non-material damage (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris paras. 33 et seq. with further references).

Paragraph 38
b) Measured against this, the plaintiff has not suffered any damage as a result of the registration of the contract data with SCHUFA.

Paragraph 39
aa) There is no loss of control over the registered contract data.

Paragraph 40
A loss of control occurs if, as a result of the disclosure of the contract data, the data subject is placed in a situation in which he or she is uncertain about how the personal data concerning him or her will be processed (cf. General Court, judgment of January 8, 2025 – T-354/22, juris para. 197). These requirements are not met here.

Paragraph 41
It is true that, in the event of a data leak and publication on the internet or darknet, the plaintiff's identity data could facilitate identity theft and result in the alleged problems due to his or her work for the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) and travel to third countries. However, there are no indications of such an uncontrolled departure from the data protection framework, and this is not the case solely because of the transmission to SCHUFA and the possible further transmission to other telecommunications companies at their request. The data was therefore not published, i.e., it was made accessible to an indeterminate number of persons. However, the purely hypothetical risk of further misuse, for example through an uncontrolled leakage of data from S's business sphere, is not sufficient to justify damages according to the principles outlined above.

Paragraph 42
The plaintiff was informed that SCHUFA creates a profile with the registered contract data using a recognized mathematical-statistical procedure and that it provides its contractual partners with information, among other things, for assessing the creditworthiness of natural persons. He was also referred to various informative websites for further processing of the data for detailed information on the activities of the credit agencies. Furthermore, he was informed of his right to object to the registration of contract data with SCHUFA at any time. The plaintiff was therefore fully informed at all times and had the power to decide how his data was processed; he could have stopped the data processing by SCHUFA at any time during the ongoing contractual relationship, but tolerated it without objection. Against this background, there can be no question of positive data being processed against his will in the present case.

Paragraph 43
bb) A fortiori, based on the reasons for the contested decision, even taking into account the plaintiff's submissions during his personal hearing before the Regional Court, no damage to the plaintiff in the form of the burdens and disadvantages described can be established.

Paragraph 44
To the extent that the plaintiff here asserts concerns and fears as a result of the S-information regarding the defendant's registration, these cannot be reconciled in any way with this registration and, in the manner presented and in their extent, even reaching existential fears, lack a comprehensible basis, even taking into account the hearing results, especially since, according to the findings in the facts of the contested judgment, SCHUFA had undisputedly already deleted the plaintiff's registered data before the action was filed. Nor have any other – specific – disadvantages suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the registration in question been demonstrated. Rather, the S-report dated August 16, 2023, reveals that the plaintiff had moved a few months prior to the report and had also repeatedly taken out small loans and installment payment agreements, including with Pp, both of which, according to the information publicly provided by SCHUFA (https://www.schufa.de/scoring-daten/hilfe-ihrem-schufa-score/; https://www.schafa.de/scoring-daten/score-verbessern/#576026; see also https://www.schufa.de/newsroom/bonitaet/schufa-score-25-wahrheiten-berechnung-mehr/), are likely to worsen the score.

Paragraph 45
Reference is also made to the reasons for the decision of the contested judgment regarding damages.

Paragraph 46
B. The action is admissible, but also unfounded, insofar as the second claim seeks to prohibit the future transmission of positive data to SCHUFA without the plaintiff's consent.

Paragraph 47
1. The second claim is admissible; in particular, it is sufficiently specific within the meaning of Section 253 (2) No. 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Paragraph 48
a) A claim is sufficiently specific (Section 253 (2) No. 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure) if it specifically identifies the claim raised, thereby defining the scope of the court's decision-making authority (Section 308 of the Code of Civil Procedure), reveals the content and extent of the substantive legal force of the requested decision (Section 322 of the Code of Civil Procedure), does not shift the risk of the plaintiff losing the case to the defendant through avoidable imprecision, and allows for the expectation of compulsory enforcement of the judgment without a continuation of the dispute in the enforcement proceedings. In the case of an injunction, this means, in particular, that it must not be formulated so vaguely that the decision as to what the defendant is prohibited from doing is ultimately left to the enforcement court.

Paragraph 49
A sufficient degree of specificity is usually given in an injunction if a reference is made to the specific infringing act or if the specific form of infringement being challenged is the subject matter of the application, and the application, at least based on the pleadings in the action, clearly indicates which characteristics of the challenged conduct are the basis and connecting factor for the violation of law and thus the injunction. The use of terms requiring interpretation in the application is permissible if there is no dispute between the parties regarding their meaning and objective standards for delimitation exist, or if the plaintiff defines the term requiring interpretation sufficiently specifically and, if necessary, supports it with examples or aligns his request with the specific infringing act (see the entirety of the Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 – VI ZR 10/24 –, paras. 52 et seq., juris).

Paragraph 50
b) Measured against this, the present application for an injunction satisfies the requirements of specificity (cf. Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf, judgment of October 31, 2024 – I-20 U 51/24, 20 U 51/24, juris paras. 47, 50 et seq.).

Paragraph 51
The plaintiff defines his "positive data," the transmission of which is to be omitted, as information about the commissioning, execution, and termination of a contract. This is sufficiently specific in the sense of information about the conclusion and termination of a contract, regardless of the reason, as well as information about the course of the contractual relationship, with the exception of data resulting from breach of contract on the part of the plaintiff ("negative data"). Furthermore, in view of the grounds of the lawsuit, which revolve solely around registration with SCHUFA, it is sufficiently clear that transmission to SCHUFA is meant, and "namely" here means a "namely" that specifies the "credit agencies," which was also explained at the oral hearing on May 7, 2025, without the plaintiff's representative objecting. Furthermore, the registration of "positive data" should not take place without the plaintiff's consent.

Paragraph 52
2. The lawsuit is, however, unfounded.

Paragraph 53
Contrary to the plaintiff's opinion, consent pursuant to Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR cannot be considered the sole justification for such data processing under all conceivable circumstances.

Paragraph 54
Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, fraud prevention may be a justification within the meaning of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR for such future data processing (see also Cologne Higher Regional Court, judgment of November 3, 2023 – I-6 U 58/23, 6 U 58/23, juris paras. 40 et seq.). This was also the case here, as explained under paragraph A. The plaintiff cannot therefore in any case demand that the relevant data may only be passed on with his consent, as this would be contrary to the wording and regulatory system of Article 6 (1) (1) GDPR.

Paragraph 55
Moreover, the decision of the Data Protection Conference of September 22, 2021, on the processing of positive data of private individuals from contracts for mobile phone services and permanent trading accounts by credit agencies does not provide any other conclusion. The operative part of the decision merely states that the transmission and processing of so-called positive data to credit agencies cannot, in principle, be based on Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR and that the transmission and processing of so-called positive data generally requires the effective consent of the data subject, taking into account the high requirements for voluntariness.

Paragraph 56
Furthermore, it remains undisputed in the present case that the contractual relationship between the parties has already ended since 2023 and that the contract has been deactivated since September 25, 2023, and the plaintiff has not demonstrated that a new contractual relationship with the defendant is already in the process of being established. However, without a (continuing) legal relationship between the parties, a claim for injunctive relief – regardless of the legal basis discussed – is ruled out.

Paragraph 57
C. The action is admissible in the declaratory action under 3), but is also unfounded due to the lack of a data protection violation.

Paragraph 58
1. The declaratory action is admissible; in particular, it is sufficiently specific within the meaning of Section 253 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO). This sufficient specificity is not contradicted by the fact that the application generally refers to damages to be compensated for that the plaintiff suffers as a result of the unauthorized processing of personal data. In light of the reasons given, this wording should not be interpreted to mean damages caused by any unspecified future unauthorized processing of personal data. Rather, it is clearly evident from the reasons given that the unauthorized processing of personal data refers to the disputed data transfer of September 16, 2021.

Paragraph 59
The interest in a declaratory judgment is only a genuine procedural prerequisite for a judgment granting the judgment (cf. Federal Court of Justice, judgment of October 10, 2017 – XI ZR 456/16, para. 16 with further references). It can therefore be left aside if the action is unfounded – as is the case here.

Paragraph 60
2. Regarding the unfoundedness of the action for a declaratory judgment, reference is made to the comments in lit. A. in order to avoid repetition.

Paragraph 61
D. Finally, due to the lack of a claim in the main proceedings, the plaintiff is also not entitled to reimbursement of the costs of out-of-court legal proceedings pursuant to Art. 82 (1) GDPR.

III.

Paragraph 62
There is no reason to stay the proceedings pursuant to Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) (analogously) until the legal issues raised by the ECJ in the grounds of appeal have been clarified or until the case has been referred to the ECJ. All questions raised by the plaintiff have already been clarified in his favor by ECJ case law or are irrelevant to the present case. For the reasons set out in lit. B., it is irrelevant in this case which specific domestic or European legal provision could possibly support an injunction, or whether a risk of repetition is necessary and exists in this case. Therefore, there is no need to stay the appeal proceedings analogously pursuant to Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure, nor to refer the questions raised by the plaintiff in the grounds of appeal to the ECJ.

IV.

Paragraph 63
The decision on costs is based on Section 97 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Paragraph 64
The decision on provisional enforceability follows from Sections 708 No. 10, 711, and 713 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Paragraph 65
The appeal on points of law is not allowed. The legal matter is not of fundamental importance within the meaning of Section 543 (2) Sentence 1 No. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO). To the extent relevant to the decision, the legal dispute does not raise any legal question requiring clarification that may arise in an indefinite number of other cases. The development of the law or the safeguarding of uniform case law by the appellate court does not require leave to appeal, as the case does not give rise to any need to establish guidelines for the interpretation of statutory provisions or to fill legal gaps (Section 543 (2) Sentence 1 No. 2, Alternative 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure). There is also no reason to fear that differences in case law will arise or persist (Section 543 (2) Sentence 1 No. 2, Alternative 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure). All legal issues relevant to this case have been clarified at the latest by the Federal Court of Justice's judgment of November 18, 2024 – VI ZR 10/24 – as well as the ECJ decisions cited therein and the ECJ judgment of December 7, 2023 – C-26/22 – and only questions of subsumption remain in the individual case. The Senate also does not deviate from an abstract legal principle established in a settlement decision, which would, however, be a prerequisite for leave to appeal on points of law based on divergence (Federal Court of Justice, decision of October 16, 2018 – II ZR 70/16, para. 17, juris; Zöller/Feskorn, loc. cit., para. 16 with further references). A divergence cannot be justified merely by a different application of legal principles to the individual case, for example, regarding the question of the admissibility of the injunction (cf. MüKo-Krüger, Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), 6th ed., § 543, marginal no. 14).

Paragraph 66
The Senate assessed the value in dispute for the appeal proceedings based on the amount of the requested amendment to the contested judgment (§§ 43 para. 1, 47 para. 1 of the German Civil Code (GKG), § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure). In doing so, the first claim was assessed at €5,000.00, the second claim at €500.00, the third claim at €500.00, and the fourth claim at €0.00 in consideration of § 43 para. 1 of the German Civil Code (GKG). Since, in accordance with the findings in the facts of the contested judgment, SCHUFA undisputedly deleted the reported information on telecommunications contracts, including the plaintiff's entry, from October 20, 2023, and terminated the plaintiff's contractual relationship with the defendant in the same year and no new one was entered into or is in the process of being concluded, the plaintiff's interest in refraining from registering positive data with SCHUFA, as well as the application for a declaratory judgment, appear to be appropriately valued at €500.00 each.
