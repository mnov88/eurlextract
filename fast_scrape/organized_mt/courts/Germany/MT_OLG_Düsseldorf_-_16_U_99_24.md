## English Summary

### Facts

The case originated before the Regional Court of Düsseldorf (LG Düsseldorf, 12 O 171/22), where the plaintiff sought non-material damages under [Article 82 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR "Article 82 GDPR"), access to information under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"), and a cease-and-desist order.

The dispute concerned Platform A., a social media provider that, by default, allowed profile lookups through mobile phone numbers without requiring explicit user consent. This design enabled a 2019 automated data scraping attack, during which attackers randomly generated mobile numbers and matched them with publicly available user data, such as names and profile identifiers.

In 2021, the scraped dataset, including the plaintiff’s mobile number, was found on a publicly accessible online database. Platform A. acknowledged the breach publicly only in 2022.

In reaction to the incident and to mitigate further exposure, the plaintiff changed her mobile number between 2021 and 2024, and has pursued claims for loss of control over her personal data and ongoing concerns about potential misuse.

### Holding

The Court held that the unauthorized scraping and disclosure of the plaintiff’s mobile phone number that was linked with publicly available profile data, constituted a loss of control over personal data, and therefore a compensable non-material damage under [Article 82(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR#1 "Article 82 GDPR").

Under [Article 82(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR#1 "Article 82 GDPR"), the court reiterated that “loss of control” alone constitutes non-material damage, without requiring proof of actual or tangible misuse. This position aligns with recent ECJ rulings (C‑590/22, C‑340/21) and national precedent from the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH VI ZR 10/24), which held that temporary or one-time loss of control may suffice for damages.

In this case, however, the court only awarded €75 in damages, acknowledging that the scraped data was not highly sensitive. Further, the court rejected claims for declaratory relief regarding future harm, reasoning that no further material damage was likely due to the plaintiff’s change of phone number, and that she had failed to substantiate the possibility of future non-material damage, having herself stated that an exacerbation of such harm was “difficult to imagine.” The court also rejected the claim that spam messages received by the plaintiff could be causally linked to the scraping, even under the reduced evidentiary standard of §287 ZPO (which allows courts to accept a higher probability rather than full proof). Without a clear causal nexus, no additional compensation was granted on that basis.

The Court also awarded €159.94 in pre-litigation legal costs, and an additional €500 attributed to the plaintiff’s GDPR information request under Article 15.

## Comment

This judgment confirms a growing trend in privacy law: courts are increasingly recognizing that a mere loss of control over personal data, even without proven misuse, can justify compensation under Article 82(1) GDPR. Citing precedents like BGH VI ZR 10/24, which was also adopted by OLG Celle, the ruling strengthens the interpretation of “loss of control” as compensable harm and reinforces obligations like privacy by design and by default.

However, it also illustrates the practical limits of obtaining meaningful compensation. As large-scale scraping incidents become more frequent, such low awards may fall short of providing real deterrence or effective redress for fundamental rights violations.

```
tenor
On appeal by the plaintiff, the judgment of the 12th Civil Chamber of the Düsseldorf Regional Court ( 12 O 171/22 ) delivered on 13 March 2024 is partially amended and, in its entirety, reformulated as follows, while dismissing the further appeal:

The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff non-material damages in the amount of €75 plus interest at a rate of 5 percentage points above the base interest rate since August 19, 2022.

The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff pre-trial legal fees in the amount of €159.94 plus interest at a rate of 5 percentage points above the base interest rate since August 19, 2022.

Otherwise, the action is dismissed.

The plaintiff shall bear the costs of the legal proceedings in both instances.

The judgment is provisionally enforceable without the provision of security.

The appeal is not allowed.

Reasons
I.

In the appeal court, the plaintiff is pursuing claims against the defendant – after partially withdrawing its appeal to the extent of its request for information – for damages, for the determination of future liability to pay compensation, and for reimbursement of pre-trial legal costs due to alleged data protection violations by the defendant in connection with so-called data scraping in the social network A. operated by the defendant.

The plaintiff has been using an A. account for many years, linked to her email address "000000.de." When registering with A., she made use of the optional option to also store her mobile phone number there. A mobile phone number added to the profile in this way could be searched by all users registered on A., even if the A. user who set the phone number had not set it as "public" in the target group selection available to other users, and thus, in principle, as invisible to others. The default settings on the defendant's A. platform, in the so-called searchability setting, provided for searchability by "everyone" until a later change by the defendant. Furthermore, A. users had the option of finding and contacting contacts on A. who were also registered on the A. platform and provided their phone number via the so-called contact import function. This function made it possible to upload phone contacts from their smartphones to A.'s so-called messenger. In order to exclude or restrict searchability via the search function on the platform and via the contact import function, it was originally necessary to change the A. default settings.

The search function on the platform and the contact import function provided the technical ability to use a variety of digit sequences similar to common phone number formats to search for matching users on the A. platform. If a generated number matched a user's stored mobile phone number, their public user information was assigned to the entered number and retrieved. Starting in January 2018, unknown persons exploited this capability to mass-collect data from A. accounts, which also affected the plaintiff. In 2021, intercepted data appeared on the internet. The defendant confirmed to the plaintiff in a letter dated November 16, 2022 (Exhibit B16, pages 45-68 of the defendant's appendices) that, according to its information, the "user ID," first name, and last name had been extracted from the plaintiff's individual data through scraping.

A more detailed description of the facts of the case is omitted in accordance with Section 540 Paragraph 2, Section 313a Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, because an appeal against the decision is not admissible in accordance with Section 543 , Section 544 Paragraph 2 No. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

II.

Contrary to the defendant's overall opinion, the plaintiff's appeal is admissible and is partially successful to the extent apparent from the operative part.

1.

The international jurisdiction of the German courts, which must also be examined ex officio in the appeal court, follows from Article 82 (6) in conjunction with Article 79 (2) sentence 1 GDPR, because the plaintiff, as the data subject, has her habitual residence in Germany and, according to the parties' submissions, the General Data Protection Regulation is applicable in temporal, material and territorial terms.

The temporal scope of application of the General Data Protection Regulation, which entered into force on May 25, 2018, pursuant to Art. 99 (2) GDPR, has been opened. It was undisputed between the parties in the first instance pursuant to Section 138 (3) of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) that the plaintiff was only affected by possible data protection violations by the defendant through the harvesting of her own personal data in 2019, i.e., at the time the General Data Protection Regulation came into force. The defendant did not contest the plaintiff's corresponding arguments. Insofar as it disputes the point in time at which the plaintiff was affected for the first time at the end of the appeal, it can hereby no longer be heard pursuant to Section 531 (2) Sentence 1 No. 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), because it has not explained why it could not have made this argument in the first instance.

The material scope of application of the General Data Protection Regulation is also open. According to Art. 2 (1) GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation applies, among other things, to the automated processing of personal data. The plaintiff's data in focus here, which can be found in the so-called leaked data set ("000000,000000, 000000, 1/26/2018 12,00,00 AM"), which the plaintiff submitted in the course of the proceedings, constitutes such personal data because, according to the definition in Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR, it relates to an identified - data subject - person. This data, at least as far as the mobile phone number, A. ID, and name were concerned, was processed automatically by the defendant within the framework of the A. social network operated by the defendant.

Finally, the territorial scope of the General Data Protection Regulation is also opened up. According to Art. 3 (1) GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal data insofar as this occurs within the scope of the activities of an establishment of a controller in the European Union. The defendant is a company incorporated under the law of the Republic of Ireland with its registered office in Ireland, and thus with an establishment within the European Union. Since the defendant operates the social network A. for users in the European Union, it is also the controller within the meaning of Art. 4 (7) GDPR.

In addition to the GDPR, German law applies to the legal relationship between the parties pursuant to Art. 3 (1) and Art. 6 (2) Rome I Regulation, because the parties agreed to this in the defendant's terms of use.

2.

The first claim for compensation for non-material damages is admissible and partially justified. The plaintiff is entitled to damages from the defendant pursuant to Art. 82 (1) GDPR in the amount of €75 plus interest from the date of commencement of proceedings.

a)

Contrary to the defendant's view, the claim does not raise concerns about specificity. As the plaintiff has clarified, it does not base its claim on an impermissible accumulation of alternative causes of action or subject matters. Rather, it seeks compensation for non-material damage allegedly resulting from multiple data protection violations by the defendant. In this respect, the plaintiff refers to the one scraping incident it describes, which affected it in 2019. Thus, the asserted claim for damages is based on a clearly definable, single factual situation and thus a single subject matter (see Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 , juris, para. 18).

Since, in actions for compensation for non-material damages, it is not necessary to specify the amount of the claim, but rather it is sufficient for the plaintiff to state a minimum idea of ​​what the compensation should amount to, the plaintiff could also formulate her application, as she did, by stating a minimum amount.

b)

The admissible application is also partially well-founded in the main proceedings. Pursuant to Article 82 (1) GDPR, a claim for damages under this provision requires a breach of the General Data Protection Regulation by the controller, the occurrence of damage, and a causal connection between the breach and the damage (see also ECJ, judgments of May 4, 2023 - C-300/21 , ZIP 2023, 1244 , 1246, para. 32, and of January 25, 2024 - C-687/21 , DB 2024, 519 , 523, para. 58). Not only did the defendant breach the General Data Protection Regulation, but the plaintiff also suffered compensable non-material damage as a result. The plaintiff does not assert any material damage suffered as a result of the defendant's data protection violations.

aa)

The violation of the General Data Protection Regulation required by Art. 82 (1) GDPR for a claim for damages has been committed. It is irrelevant here whether every violation of substantive or formal provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation or only data processing contrary to the Regulation within the meaning of Art. 82 (2) sentence 1 GDPR can give rise to a claim for damages under Art. 82 (1) GDPR (see the dispute of opinion, OLG Stuttgart, judgment of November 22, 2023 - 4 U 20/23 , juris, paras. 381 et seq.). Since the defendant - as will be explained below - processed the plaintiff's personal data without the legal basis required by Art. 6 (1) GDPR, this constitutes not only a violation of the General Data Protection Regulation, but also data processing contrary to the Regulation.

(1)

According to Art. 4 No. 2 GDPR, the term "data processing" includes disclosure through transmission and dissemination as well as any other form of making personal data available. The previously technically possible search for the plaintiff's user profile on the defendant's A. platform using her mobile phone number—which is undisputed between the parties, despite the uncertainties regarding the exact course of the scraping incident—represented a form of making the plaintiff's personal data available enabled by the defendant. The search functionality or searchability enabled other users to find the plaintiff's user profile with her public profile data using the search or contact import function based on her mobile phone number. This functionality enabled the unknown "scrapers" to find the plaintiff's user profile using number sequences similar to telephone numbers, which initially did not constitute personal data due to a lack of knowledge of the telephone number characteristics of a specific person, and to identify the sequence of numbers triggering the search result as a mobile phone number, assign it to the plaintiff, and link it to her other public user profile data in the manner of the leaked data set.

(2)

According to Art. 6 (1) (1) GDPR, the processing of personal data is only lawful if one of the conditions or legal bases for processing specified therein is met. According to Art. 5 GDPR, the controller bears the burden of presentation and proof of lawful data processing (ECJ, judgment of July 4, 2023 - C-252/21 , juris, para. 95), in this case the defendant. Accordingly, the data processing was unlawful. For the functionality that enabled the searchability of the plaintiff's user profile based on the mobile phone number, the defendant failed to demonstrate any of the legality conditions under Art. 6 (1) (1) GDPR.

(a)

The defendant relies on Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR as the legal basis for the searchability of the plaintiff's user profile based on her mobile phone number. According to this provision, the processing of personal data is lawful if it is necessary to fulfill a contract. The defendant therefore takes the view that the searchability of the plaintiff's user profile based on her mobile phone number was necessary to fulfill the main purpose of the user agreement concluded with the plaintiff, which was to enable users to find each other for the purpose of networking. The defendant states the following verbatim in its response to the appeal (page 191 of the GA OLG):

"The user agreement concluded between the parties relates to the provision of the A. platform as a social network. It is inherent in such a social network that individual users (including the plaintiff) can find friends and people they generally know and network with each other. Such connections are established through the use of features such as the contact importer function, which, as explained in the help section and the data policy, require users' telephone numbers. The contact importer function is therefore an essential tool for users of the A. platform. The data is therefore collected for the fulfillment of the user agreement on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. Consent within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR is neither relevant nor a prerequisite for lawful data processing in this case."

Contrary to the defendant's view, however, the requirements of Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR were not met (see OLG Hamm, judgment of August 15, 2023 - I-7 U 19/23 , juris, paras. 94 et seq.). The justifications provided for in Art. 6 (1) (a) to (f) GDPR must be interpreted narrowly (ECJ, judgment of July 4, 2023 - C-252/21 , juris, para. 93). The processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR if the data processing is objectively indispensable to achieve a purpose that is a necessary component of the contractual performance, so that the main subject matter of the contract could not be fulfilled without the data processing. The fact that the data processing is mentioned in the contract or is merely useful for its performance is not sufficient. What is crucial is that the controller's data processing is essential for the proper performance of the contract concluded with the data subject and that, therefore, no practical and less intrusive alternatives exist (ECJ, judgment of July 4, 2023 - C-252/21 , juris, paras. 98 et seq. and 125).

According to these criteria, the searchability of the plaintiff's user profile based on her mobile phone number was not necessary within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR (see also OLG Hamm, judgment of August 15, 2023 - I-7 U 19/23 , juris, paras. 94 et seq., OLG Stuttgart, judgment of November 22, 2023 - 4 U 20/23 , juris, paras. 502 et seq.). The searchability of the user profiles based on the mobile phone number was not essential to fulfilling the main purpose of the user agreement cited by the defendant - mutual findability for the purpose of networking. Rather, users could also find each other, for example, by their names (see Higher Regional Court of Dresden, judgment of December 5, 2023 - 4 U 1094/23 , juris, para. 34; Higher Regional Court of Oldenburg, judgment of May 21, 2024 - 13 U 100/23 , juris, para. 29). Precisely for the sake of the corresponding search option, the user name is always publicly visible on the A. platform. The fact that, according to the defendant's own assessment, searchability via mobile phone number was not necessary is demonstrated by the fact that a telephone number was not among the mandatory information that had to be provided during initial registration with A. Rather, providing a telephone number was optional for A. users. Furthermore, the default setting for searchability by telephone number could be deselected by users. The defendant later also restricted the search functionality relating to telephone numbers.

(b)

The defendant does not cite the existence of other legal bases for the searchability of the plaintiff's user profile based on her mobile phone number. Nor are they apparent here (see Higher Regional Court of Hamm, judgment of August 15, 2023 - I-7 U 19/23 , juris, paras. 104 et seq.). In particular, the plaintiff did not give her informed and unambiguous consent to the data processing in question in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. This would have required the defendant to have transparently informed the plaintiff about the searchability of the user profile based on the mobile phone number. However, this is neither stated nor apparent. The defendant's amended terms of use dated April 19, 2018, to which the plaintiff was required to consent, contained no information about the searchability of the user profile based on the mobile phone number, nor did the data policy, to which the terms of use referred. Finally, the linking of the privacy settings in the terms of use, as well as the privacy tools and help pages of the platform, did not provide transparent information about the searchability of the mobile phone number. The plaintiff did not have to deal with these information options, but was entitled, due to Art. 25 (2) sentences 1 and 3 GDPR, to rely on the defendant having chosen the most data protection-friendly default settings, which ensured that her telephone number would be made accessible only to the smallest possible circle of recipients without her intervention (see Higher Regional Court of Oldenburg, judgment of May 14, 2024 - 13 U 114/23 , juris, paras. 22 et seq.).

bb)

In this context, it is also irrelevant for a claim for damages under Art. 82 (1) GDPR whether the defendant is responsible for further data protection violations beyond the one identified data protection violation due to the data processing operation involving the mobile phone number. The existence of multiple data protection violations through one and the same processing operation has no impact on the amount of any claim for damages (see ECJ, judgment of April 11, 2024 - C-741/21 , juris, paras. 64 et seq.).

c.c.)

As a result of the defendant’s data protection violation, the plaintiff also suffered non-material damage within the meaning of Article 82 (1) GDPR.

(1)

In the absence of a reference to the domestic law of the Member States contained in Article 82 (1) GDPR , the concept of "non-material damage" must be defined autonomously under EU law. Accordingly, the definition of the term as developed in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union is decisive. According to Recital 146, Sentence 3 of the GDPR, the concept of damage should be interpreted broadly, in a manner that fully complies with the objectives of the Regulation. However, according to the case law of the Court of Justice, a mere violation of the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation is not sufficient to establish a claim for damages. Rather, the occurrence of damage as a result of this violation is also required.

However, according to the case law of the Court of Justice , non-material damage giving rise to liability within the meaning of Art. 82 (1) GDPR may already arise from the loss of control over personal data – even a temporary one – without the concept of "non-material damage" requiring proof of additional, tangible negative consequences. In this respect, after re-examining the case law of the Court of Justice, the Senate agrees with the interpretation advocated by the Federal Court of Justice in this regard (see BGH, judgments of November 18, 2024 – VI ZR 10/24 , juris, para. 30, and of February 11, 2025 – VI ZR 365/22 , juris, para. 15). The Senate defines a loss of control as a situation in which the data subject can no longer control his or her personal data, for example because it has been disclosed to third parties unknown to him or her or without significant limitation. This is the case with scraping and the publication of data on the internet, but not yet – for example – with the disclosure of the telephone number to specific recipients or its use for two-factor authentication when using user accounts. In such a case, the data is not yet publicly published (see Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 , juris, para. 41).

(2)

The plaintiff has demonstrated a situation of loss of control with regard to her mobile phone number and its link to her A. ID and her first and last name. In this respect, it is sufficient for a data subject to submit that their data has been published online and to state that they have not previously published this data publicly in a comparable manner (see Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 , juris, paras. 39 et seq.). The plaintiff has made such a submission. A prior loss of control does not arise from the fact that the plaintiff stated during her informative hearing before the Regional Court that she was using her mobile phone number for two-factor authentication with PayPal. This does not equate to public publication. Moreover, the interception of the data was undisputed in the first instance, as was its publication online in 2021.

The plaintiff did indeed enter her first name and abbreviated last name ("Ha") on her publicly visible A. profile. The plaintiff's A. ID was also found on the relevant profile page. However, according to her submission, this did not apply to her mobile phone number. According to her submission, this was also not previously linked to the other data mentioned on the internet, visible to everyone. It follows that only for the first-mentioned data can a loss of control due to the data interception and publication, both individually and in its connection, be ruled out. This is because this data had already been published on the internet – by A. – in a generally accessible manner. Upon realistic consideration, the plaintiff not only realized this, but also clearly agreed to it within the meaning of consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR, because – as her behavior can be understood – she specifically wanted publication in the form of the A. profile she had created. The same applies to the other data in her user profile, to which, according to her claim, the data interception also extended.

The defendant denied that the plaintiff lost control of her mobile phone number and its link to the other data that she, the defendant, admitted to having been accessed only after the data was accessed. However, this argument did not meet the requirements for a qualified denial required in this case. The defendant should have refuted the plaintiff's assertion that it had not previously lost control of the data, and in particular that it had not already published it publicly, by providing specific evidence as to why a loss of control had already occurred (see, on this secondary burden of proof, the Federal Court of Justice (BGH), judgments of October 11, 2007 - IX ZR 105/06 , juris, para. 12, and of January 8, 2019 - II ZR 139/17 , juris, para. 31; also the Federal Labor Court (BAG), judgment of December 16, 2021 - 2 AZR 356/21 , juris, paras. 31 et seq.). The defendant did not make such a submission.

To the extent that the defendant disputes a causal connection between the data interception and the loss of control for the first time at the end of the appeal, it can no longer be heard. This argument is irrelevant pursuant to Section 138 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO). It contradicts its arguments in the first instance and the content of the letter of November 16, 2022, submitted by it in the first instance, which the defendant has not resolved. Nevertheless, this argument is also no longer admissible pursuant to Section 531 (2) Sentence 1 No. 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), because it was undisputed between the parties in the first instance that - at least - the plaintiff's data communicated in the defendant's letter of November 16, 2022, were affected by the data interception, and the defendant has not explained why it did not already argue the contrary in the first instance.

dd)

The amount of compensation to which the plaintiff is entitled under Article 82 (1) GDPR for the non-material damage suffered is determined in accordance with the principles of tort law under German law.

(1)

The General Data Protection Regulation does not contain any provision regarding the assessment of damages owed under Article 82 (1) GDPR. In particular, due to the different purposes of the provisions, the criteria set out in Article 83 GDPR cannot be applied. Rather, the assessment is based on the national provisions governing the extent of financial compensation, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 , juris, para. 93). In Germany, the procedural provision of Section 287 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) applies in particular .

However , when determining the damage to be compensated under Art. 82 (1) GDPR, domestic procedural autonomy is subject to the limitations arising from the principles of equivalence and effectiveness under EU law (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 , juris, para. 94). Given the compensatory function of the claim for damages provided for in this provision, monetary compensation based on Art. 82 (1) GDPR is to be regarded as "full and effective" within the meaning of Recital 146, Sentence 6, GDPR if it enables the damage actually suffered as a result of the violation of the General Data Protection Regulation to be fully compensated. The claim under Art. 82 (1) GDPR is not intended to serve a deterrent or punitive function. Consequently, when assessing monetary compensation, neither the seriousness of the breach of the General Data Protection Regulation that caused the damage in question may be taken into account, nor - as already explained - whether a controller has committed several breaches against the same person or whether he acted intentionally or negligently (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of 18 November 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 , juris, para. 96).

Ultimately, the compensation to be awarded should not fall short of full compensation for the damage, but it must also not be set at an amount that exceeds full compensation for the damage. Therefore, if the damage is minor, only a small amount of damages should be awarded (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 , juris, para. 97). This also applies considering the fact that the non-material damage caused by a breach of the protection of personal data is, by its nature, no less serious than bodily harm (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 , juris, para. 97).

(2)

When assessing the amount of compensation based on Section 287 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), if damage has only occurred in the form of a loss of control over personal data because further damage has not been proven, the potential sensitivity of the specific personal data affected and its typically intended use must be taken into account when estimating the damage. Furthermore, the nature of the loss of control, the duration of the loss of control, and the possibility of regaining control, for example by removing a publication from the internet or changing the personal data, must be taken into account. In cases where regaining control is possible with reasonable effort, the hypothetical - particularly financial - effort required to regain control can also serve as a guide for effective compensation (see, for the full text, Federal Court of Justice (BGH), judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 , juris, para. 99).

(3)

According to these criteria, the damages suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the loss of control are effectively compensated in the amount of €75 (see also the Senate judgment of March 13, 2025 - I-16 U 173/23 - on a comparable matter). This results in an overall assessment of the relevant circumstances in the plaintiff's case. According to these, a discount from the amount of €100 otherwise regularly awarded by the Senate for the mere loss of control was justified because the loss of control over the mobile phone number was resolved by a change of number in the period between the appearance of the intercepted data on the Internet in 2021 and January 24, 2024 - the date of the oral hearing before the Regional Court. When asked by the Senate at the oral hearing on April 11, 2025, the plaintiff's legal representative was unable to specify exactly when the plaintiff changed her telephone number during this period.

A loss of control is only established with regard to the mobile phone number and its link to the A. ID, the plaintiff's first name, and the abbreviated surname. Whether her telephone number was also linked to other data in her user profile – specifically, her place of residence – as she claims, however, is irrelevant. If this were true, it would have no impact on the amount of damages because, as already established, the plaintiff had consented to the publication of this data. Because of this self-disclosure, the plaintiff's alleged linking of this data with the mobile phone number no longer carries decisive weight in determining compensation. Rather, the decisive factor for the amount of damages is the fact, which the plaintiff also placed at the center of her submissions, that the defendant linked the mobile phone number to other profile data – which were already public, regardless of the type – to unknown third parties without her consent and provided a data set from it.

Although the loss of control began in 2019, there is no evidence of a deepening of the loss between the publication of the data on the Internet in 2021 and the subsequent change of telephone number. The plaintiff's interest in the data will now be limited simply because she changed her mobile phone number due to her family's change of provider. No one will be able to use her old number to contact her or send her spam SMS messages. Furthermore, the data affected by the loss of control does not constitute highly sensitive data of the plaintiff, such as health or similarly intimate data, the public dissemination of which could damage the plaintiff's reputation or advancement (see also Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 , juris, para. 42). Rather, the mobile phone number is regularly used to contact third parties and is made accessible to others for this purpose. This alone always creates the risk that the disclosure of a telephone number, which was controlled up to a certain point in time, can no longer be controlled at some point, because no one can have complete influence on how third parties handle the number.

(4)

When assessing the amount of damages, further inconveniences attributed by the plaintiff to the loss of control are not to be taken into account.

Admittedly, negative feelings associated with the loss of control, such as fears and anxieties, as well as the time and effort spent dealing with the scraping incident and protecting against future data misuse, represent circumstances that can deepen or aggravate non-material damage within the meaning of Art. 82 (1) GDPR that already occurred with the mere loss of control (cf. Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 , juris, paras. 31, 35, and 45). This applies at least if they go beyond the inconveniences directly related to the loss of control for everyone (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 , juris, para. 101). Any psychological stress caused by spam calls and spam SMS messages resulting from the loss of control can also aggravate the non-material damage.

However, the Regional Court did not find any such impairments to the plaintiff, despite hearing her for information purposes. The plaintiff did indeed acknowledge receiving spam calls and spam text messages. However, the Regional Court was unable to form a sufficient conviction regarding the causal relationship between the spam calls and spam text messages described by the plaintiff and the scraping incident. The Regional Court left open whether the standard of proof in Section 286 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) or that in Section 287 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) applies to the question of psychological consequences of the scraping incident. It did not consider proof to have been provided in either case. This assessment is ultimately unobjectionable, although, correctly, the standard of proof in Section 287 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) is the only relevant one. If the asserted claim for damages is established in principle, a substantial, soundly based probability is sufficient for the judge to form a conviction for the amount of damages pursuant to Section 287 of the Code of Civil Procedure (BGH, judgment of March 11, 2022 - V ZR 35/21 , juris, para. 30). This is the case here because the Senate - in contrast to the Regional Court - considers the mere loss of control to be the damage giving rise to liability. However, even applying the reduced standard of proof under Section 287 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Senate, in its own assessment - like the Regional Court - cannot establish any impairment of the plaintiff due to the loss of control that goes beyond the inconveniences that anyone suffers from such a loss of control. In particular, the hearing of the plaintiff before the Regional Court did not reveal any indications that could indicate a particular psychological impairment. Given the diverse and diverse causes of spam calls and spam SMS, it is also unobjectionable that the Regional Court was unable to establish a causal connection between the scraping incident and the spam harassment described by the plaintiff. From its own experience, the Senate is aware that spam calls and spam SMS can occur on mobile phones even when A is not being used.

Since the causality of the scraping incident cannot be established, it remains to be seen whether the receipt of spam calls and spam SMS without further consequences can constitute non-material damage or deepen it (dismissing OLG Hamm, judgment of 18 December 2024 - I-11 U 168/23 , juris, para. 33).

As regards the spam emails alleged by the plaintiff in her written submission, this cannot be taken into account when calculating the amount of damages because the plaintiff has not proven that the defendant lost control of her email address due to the data being accessed.

c)

The plaintiff's claim for interest on the principal amount from the date of pendency, which is also pursued by the plaintiff in claim 1, arises in terms of both its merits and amount from Section 291 in conjunction with Section 288 (1) Sentence 2 of the German Civil Code (BGB). In the absence of any other ascertainable date of service, it can be assumed that the action was served no later than the day on which the defendant notified its willingness to defend itself. The interest claim therefore arises from the following day, August 19, 2022.

3.

According to the plaintiff's clarifying statements in the first instance pleading of 2 December 2022, the second claim, which seeks, on the one hand, a determination of liability for future material damages and - following the extension of the claim in the appeal instance - on the other hand, a determination of liability for currently unforeseeable non-material damages, is inadmissible in its entirety due to a lack of interest in a declaratory judgment.

a)

As the Senate has already ruled in the past, the mere possibility of the future occurrence of the claimed damages is the benchmark for assuming the interest in establishing the facts required under Section 256 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure. A further probability of damage is not required. The possibility of future damages is sufficient in the present case because this is not a matter of purely financial losses, but of damages resulting from the plaintiff's alleged violation of her right to informational self-determination pursuant to Article 2 (1) in conjunction with Article 1 ( 1) of the Basic Law, and thus of her general right of personality as another absolutely protected legal interest within the meaning of Section 823 (1) of the German Civil Code. The provision primarily relied upon here, Article 82 (1) of the GDPR, also contains a violation of the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, insofar as - as here - unlawful data processing is also alleged . The possibility of compensable future damages can be readily affirmed if an absolute legal interest protected by tort law has been violated and damage has already occurred as a result (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of 18 November 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 , juris, para. 48).

b)

According to these criteria, there is no interest in establishing future material damages because the plaintiff changed her telephone number some time ago and there is therefore no possibility of future material damages.

Due to a lack of interest in a declaratory judgment, the motion is also inadmissible insofar as it seeks to establish any immaterial late damages. The plaintiff has not conclusively demonstrated the possibility of immaterial late consequences. In her first-instance pleading of December 2, 2022, she stated that "an exacerbation of immaterial damages is difficult to imagine." She has not subsequently changed this argument.

4.

As a result of the data protection violation committed by the defendant, the plaintiff is entitled to a substantive claim for reimbursement of pre-trial legal costs under Article 82 (1) GDPR in the amount stated in the operative part of the judgment, which is also subject to interest as stated.

a)

The costs of legal proceedings and therefore also the costs of a lawyer involved in the case, insofar as they were necessary and expedient for the protection of rights, are generally part of the damages to be compensated for due to a tort. The decisive factor in this regard is how the likely settlement of the damage case appears from the perspective of the injured party. If the responsibility for the damage, and thus the liability, is so clear from the outset in terms of reason and amount that, from the perspective of the injured party, there can be no reasonable doubt that the tortfeasor will readily fulfill their obligation to pay compensation, it will generally not be necessary to involve a lawyer even for the initial assertion of damages against the tortfeasor. In such simple cases, the injured party can generally assert the damages themselves, so that the immediate involvement of a lawyer may only prove necessary under special circumstances (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2014 - VI ZR 10/24 , juris, para. 79).

b)

According to these criteria, the plaintiff is to be reimbursed for the legal costs incurred in asserting the justified amount of damages of €75 out of court and in relation to the request for information further formulated in the pre-trial letter from the attorneys - to which the Senate assigns a value of €500.

Under the circumstances, particularly due to the confusing legal situation and for reasons of factual context, the plaintiff was entitled to consider the engagement of her legal representatives, even to the extent of the request for information based on Art. 15 GDPR, as necessary and expedient due to the defendant's data protection violation, which was still justified at the time due to the information not yet provided. The acknowledgment of the defendant's future liability to pay damages, which the plaintiff ultimately pursued unsuccessfully with her second claim, was not yet the subject of the pre-trial letter from her legal representatives and is therefore not to be taken into account when calculating the 1.3% fee pursuant to No. 2300 VV RVG for this reason alone. Finally, legal fees attributable to the request for an injunction formulated in the pre-trial letter are not reimbursable. The plaintiff did not appeal the dismissal of her applications for an injunction by the Regional Court. The dismissal of the action has become final and binding. The pre-trial legal activity in this regard was therefore neither necessary nor expedient.

c)

The interest claim on the amount to be reimbursed arises – in accordance with the provisions set out above under 2. c) – in terms of reason and amount from Section 291 in conjunction with Section 288 Paragraph 1 Sentence 2 of the German Civil Code (BGB).

III.

The decision on the costs of the legal dispute follows from a corresponding application of Section 92 Paragraph 2 No. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure in favour of the defendant.

The decision on provisional enforceability is based on Sections 708 No. 10, 711 , 713 ZPO.

There is no reason to admit the appeal. The requirements of Section 543 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure are not met. According to the Federal Court of Justice's judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 - the case is neither of fundamental importance nor does the development of the law or the safeguarding of uniform case law require a decision by the appeal court. In the Senate's opinion, deviations from decisions of other higher regional courts are based on differing factual assessments by the trial courts.

The proceedings are not to be stayed in accordance with Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as requested by the defendant in the non-supplementary pleading of 7 May 2025 . In contrast to the Erfurt Regional Court in its suspension order of 3 April 2025 - 8 O 895/23 - referred to by the defendant , the Senate considers the question of whether the mere loss of control over personal data can constitute damage within the meaning of Art. 82 (1) GDPR to have been clarified by the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (see ECJ, judgments of 20 June 2024 - C-590 / 22 , juris, para. 33, and of 4 October 2024 - C-200/23 , juris, para. 150), in line with the Federal Court of Justice and the Federal Labor Court (cf. BAG, judgment of 20 February 2025 - 8 AZR 61/24 , juris, para. 13). Furthermore, the Senate proceeds from a different set of facts than the Erfurt Regional Court because, according to the Senate's above findings, the responsibility under data protection law for linking the telephone number with the profile data of A. users lies with the defendant.

The value in dispute is set at €3,500 for the first instance and €2,000 for the appeal proceedings - also with recourse to Section 63 (3) Sentence 1 No. 2 GKG - (cf. BGH, decision of December 10, 2024 - VI ZR 7/24 , juris).
