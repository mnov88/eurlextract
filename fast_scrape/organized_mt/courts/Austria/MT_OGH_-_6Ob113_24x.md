## English Summary

### Facts

Austria’s main postal service is the controller for the case. In addition to providing postal services, the controller is also licensed as an “address publisher" and "direct marketing company”.

The controller collected data about Austrian residents (the data subjects) without their consent. In particular, the controller used certain socio-demographic circumstances (e.g. age, place of residence, level of education) for profiling. The profiling consisted in an estimation of the likelihood that a data subject fell within certains categories (e.g. "do-it-yourselfer", "night owl", "person with affinity for investments").

One of the data subjects claimed that the controller processed his data unlawfully and sought immaterial damages for €7,000 under [Article 82 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR "Article 82 GDPR"). The courts of first and second instance both denied his claim. In particular, the Court of Appeal held that the data subject failed to prove the occurrence of immaterial damage.

It is worth noting that the controller did not disclose the subject’s data. The controller also deleted the data at the request of the data subject, following [a 2021 Supreme Court ruling between the same parties](/index.php?title=OGH_-_6Ob127/20z "OGH - 6Ob127/20z").

### Holding

The Court upheld the previous findings of the Court of Appeal and denied compensation. In the Court’s view, the data subject showed failed to prove that he suffered him anxiety or annoyance as a result of the processing of his data. On these grounds, the Court concluded that non-material damages were not proven and could not be compensated.

The Court did not assess whether the subject's data were processed lawfully, as he would not have been able to claim damages either way.

## Comment

The CJEU has previously clarified that there is no minimum threshold for the compensation of non-material damages under [Article 82 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR "Article 82 GDPR") (see [CJEU - C-300/21](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C-300/21_-_%C3%96sterreichische_Post_\(Non-material_damage_in_connection_with_the_processing_of_personal_data\) "CJEU - C-300/21 - Österreichische Post (Non-material damage in connection with the processing of personal data)"), involving the same controller). While the Supreme Court acknowledged the lack of threshold for non-material damages, it concluded that the data subject in the case at hand had failed to prove any kind of non-material damages and that he was therefore ineligible for compensation.

Pertmayr, and Dr. Weber as additional judges, has heard the case brought by the plaintiff, Dr. L\*, Attorney at Law, \*, against the defendant Ö\* AG, \*, represented by Wolff Theiss Rechtsanwälte GmbH & Co. KG in Vienna, for EUR 7,000, regarding the plaintiff's appeal against the judgment of the Linz Higher Regional Court as a court of appeal of March 29, 2024, GZ 12 R 20/21d-31, which upheld the judgment of the Wels Regional Court of June 8, 2021, GZ 2 Cg 92/20m-23, in a closed session, correctly ruled:

Text

Reasons for the decision:

\[1\] The defendant is the nation's leading logistics and postal service provider, whose main business areas include the transport of letters, advertising mail, print media, and parcels. Furthermore, it holds a trade license as an "address publisher and direct marketing company" within the meaning of Section 151 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO). The defendant processed data on the plaintiff's attitudes toward the attributes of bioaffinity, night owl traits, DIY traits, life stage, investment affinity, distance selling affinity, and childlessness. For five of these seven attributes, the defendant's classification corresponds to reality; however, it is not clear which ones. The plaintiff did not consent to the processing of personal data. The data in dispute was not passed on by the defendant to third parties for marketing purposes. They were deleted by the defendant (cf. the judgment of the Supreme Court of February 18, 2021, between the same parties, 6 Ob 127/20z). The plaintiff subjectively considers that the processing of the aforementioned data has significantly affected his legal sphere, insofar as the classifications are correct, but only slightly affected with regard to the incorrect data. \[1\] The defendant is the country's leading logistics and postal service provider, whose main business areas include the transport of letters, advertising mail, print media, and parcels. In addition, it holds a trade license as an "address publisher and direct marketing company" within the meaning of Section 151 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO). The defendant processed data on the plaintiff's attitude towards the attributes of bioaffinity, night owl traits, do-it-yourself traits, life phase, investment affinity, distance selling affinity, and childlessness. For five of these seven attributes, the defendant's classification corresponds to reality; however, it is not clear which ones. The plaintiff did not give the defendant consent to process his personal data. The data in dispute were not disclosed to third parties for marketing purposes by the defendant. They were deleted by the defendant (see the Supreme Court judgment of February 18, 2021, 6 Ob 127/20z, between the same parties). The plaintiff considers his legal sphere significantly affected by the processing of the aforementioned data, insofar as it concerns correct classifications, but only slightly affected with regard to the inaccurate data.

\[2\] The plaintiff is seeking EUR 7,000 from the defendant for the unlawful processing of his personal data. He argued that he does not claim "to have suffered a heart attack or to have lost sleep for nights upon disclosure of the processed data." The "degree of his annoyance" is "naturally gradual." He considered his legal sphere significantly impaired by the processing of the five "correct" classifications, but only slightly impaired by the processing of the incorrect data.

\[3\] The defendant contested the claim and argued, in summary, that there was no unlawful data processing, possibly no fault on the part of the defendant, and no non-material damage caused to the plaintiff by it. A possible violation of law was not sufficient.

\[4\] The court of first instance dismissed the claim. The threshold of significance was not met.

\[5\] The appeal court upheld and allowed the appeal on the grounds of the requirements for a claim for damages under Art. 82 GDPR. Legally, it denied the occurrence of non-material damage. The plaintiff's argument that he subjectively considered his legal sphere impaired did not indicate even a minor psychological impairment; rather, the choice of words indicated a rational assessment of the legal situation. The alleged impairment does not go beyond the mere recognition of the violation and its legal qualification. The mention of a "graduated degree of annoyance" in the submission does not change this. The claim for compensation does not fail to meet the threshold of significance; rather, there is no damage at all. \[5\] The Court of Appeal confirmed and allowed the appeal on the grounds of the requirements for a claim for damages under Article 82 GDPR. Legally, it denied the occurrence of non-material damage. The plaintiff's argument that he subjectively sees his legal sphere impaired does not reveal even a minor psychological impairment; rather, the choice of words indicates a rational consideration of the legal situation. The alleged impairment does not go beyond the mere recognition of the violation and its legal qualification. The mention of a "graduated degree of annoyance" in the submission does not change this. The claim for compensation does not fail to meet the materiality threshold; rather, no damage has occurred at all.

Legal Assessment

\[6\] The plaintiff's appeal is admissible for the reason cited by the Court of Appeal; however, it is unfounded.

1. Qualification as Personal Data

\[7\] 1.1. The Supreme Court has already ruled that data such as that to be assessed in the present proceedings constitutes marketing information and classifications within the meaning of Section 151 (6) of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) (6 Ob 127/20z \[para. 24\]) and that such classifications assigned to a specific person are to be qualified as personal data. As such, they are subject to the GDPR regime even if they were (merely) calculated using statistical probabilities and thus (only) contain a probabilistic statement about certain interests and preferences of the data subject (6 Ob 127/20z \[Recital 2, in particular para. 19\] = RS0132655 \[T3, T4, T5\]; 6 Ob 19/23x \[para. 14 et seq.\]). Regarding the legal content of Section 151 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO), it has already been clarified in this context that Section 151(6) of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) regulates the use of marketing information and classifications, but does not change their classification as personal data covered by the GDPR (6 Ob 127/20z \[para. 24\] = RS0133524). \[7\] 1.1. The Supreme Court has already ruled that data such as that to be assessed in the present proceedings constitutes marketing information and classifications within the meaning of Section 151, Paragraph 6, of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) (6 Ob 127/20z \[para. 24\]) and that such classifications assigned to a specific person are to be qualified as personal data. As such, they are subject to the GDPR regime even if they were (merely) calculated using statistical probabilities and thus (only) contain a probabilistic statement about certain interests and preferences of the data subject (6 Ob 127/20z \[Recital 2, in particular para. 19\] = RS0132655 \[T3, T4, T5\]; 6 Ob 19/23x \[para. 14 et seq.\]). Regarding the legal content of Section 151 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO), it has already been clarified in this context that Section 151, Paragraph 6 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) regulates the use of marketing information and classifications, but does not change their qualification as personal data covered by the GDPR (6 Ob 127/20z \[Rz 24\] = RS0133524).

\[8\] 1.2. For the present case, this means that the requirements for the asserted claim for damages must be assessed in accordance with Article 82 of the GDPR. \[8\] 1.2. For the present case, this means that the requirements for the asserted claim for damages must be assessed in accordance with Article 82 of the GDPR.

2. Requirements for the claim for damages pursuant to Article 82 of the GDPR 2. Requirements for the claim for damages pursuant to Article 82 of the GDPR

\[9\] 2.1. The Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) has now consistently ruled that a mere violation of the GDPR is not sufficient to justify a claim for damages. What is required is the existence of material or immaterial damage, the existence of a breach of the GDPR and a causal link between the damage and the breach, whereby these three conditions are cumulative (ECJ C-300/21 of 4 May 2023, Österreichische Post \[para. 32\]; C-741/21 of 11 April 2024, juris \[para. 34\]; C-182/22 and C-189/22 of 20 June 2024, Scalable Capital \[para. 41\]; C-200/23 of 4 October 2024, Agentsia po vpisvaniyata \[para. 140\]). \[9\] 2.1. The Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) has now established its case law in interpreting Article 82, paragraph 1, GDPR to the effect that a mere violation of the GDPR is not sufficient to justify a claim for damages. What is required is the existence of material or immaterial damage, the existence of a breach of the GDPR and a causal link between the damage and the breach, whereby these three conditions are cumulative (ECJ C-300/21 of 4 May 2023, Österreichische Post \[para. 32\]; C-741/21 of 11 April 2024, juris \[para. 34\]; C-182/22 and C-189/22 of 20 June 2024, Scalable Capital \[para. 41\]; C-200/23 of 4 October 2024, Agentsia po vpisvaniyata \[para. 140\]).

\[10\]           The person claiming compensation for non-material damage on the basis of Article 82(1) GDPR must not only prove the infringement of the provisions of the GDPR, but also that that infringement has caused him or her such damage, which cannot be presumed on the basis of that infringement alone (ECJ C-200/23 of 4 October 2024, Agentsia po vpisvaniyata \[paragraph 141\]; C-182/22 and C-189/22 of 20 June 2024, Scalable Capital \[paragraph 41\], with reference to C-300/21 of 4 May 2023, Österreichische Post \[paragraphs 42 and 50\] and C-741/21 of 11 April 2024, juris \[paragraph 35\]). However, if the data subject has suffered non-material damage, the claim for compensation for non-material damage may not be made dependent on the damage reaching a certain degree of significance (ECJ C-300/21 of 4 May 2023, Österreichische Post \[para. 51\]). Furthermore, the controller's liability under Article 82 GDPR depends on the existence of fault attributable to it, which is presumed unless it proves that the act causing the damage is not attributable to it (ECJ C-182/22 and C-189/22 of 20 June 2024, Scalable Capital \[para. 28\]; C-667/21 of 21 December 2023, Krankenversicherung Nordrhein \[para. 103\]). \[10\]           The person claiming compensation for non-material damage on the basis of Article 82(1) of the GDPR must not only prove the infringement of the provisions of the GDPR, but also that that infringement has caused him or her such damage, which cannot be presumed on the basis of that infringement alone (ECJ C-200/23 of 4 October 2024, Agentsia po vpisvaniyata \[paragraph 141\]; C-182/22 and C-189/22 of 20 June 2024, Scalable Capital \[paragraph 41\], with reference to C-300/21 of 4 May 2023, Österreichische Post \[paragraphs 42 and 50\] and C-741/21 of 11 April 2024, juris \[paragraph 35\]). However, if the data subject has suffered non-material damage, the claim for compensation for non-material damage may not be made dependent on the damage having reached a certain degree of significance (ECJ C-300/21 of 4 May 2023, Österreichische Post \[para. 51\]). Furthermore, the controller's liability under Article 82 GDPR depends on the existence of fault attributable to it, which is presumed unless it proves that the act causing the damage is not attributable to it (ECJ C-182/22 and C-189/22 of 20 June 2024, Scalable Capital \[para. 28\]; C-667/21 of 21 December 2023, Krankenversicherung Nordrhein \[para. 103\]).

\[11\] 2.2. The ECJ recently had to rule on the occurrence of non-material damage in a case in which the personal data of the data subject had been unlawfully made available to third parties online in the commercial register of a Member State. The ECJ ruled that a natural person's fear that their data could be misused by third parties due to a breach of the GDPR could constitute non-material damage within the meaning of Article 82(1) GDPR (C-200/23 of 4 October 2024, Agentsia po vpisvaniyata \[paragraphs 143 et seq.\]; see C-340/21, Natsionalna agentsia za prihodite \[paragraphs 80, 86\] on the publication of personal data obtained through a cyberattack on the internet and the resulting fear of misuse by third parties). The loss of control may be sufficient to cause non-material damage, provided that the data subject proves that he or she has actually suffered such damage, however minor it may be (C-200/23 of 4 October 2024, Agentsia po vpisvaniyata \[paragraph 156\]). \[11\] 2.2. The ECJ recently had to rule on the occurrence of non-material damage in a case in which the data subject’s personal data had been unlawfully made available to third parties online in the commercial register of a Member State. The ECJ ruled that a natural person’s fear that their data might be misused by third parties due to a breach of the GDPR could constitute non-material damage within the meaning of Article 82(1) GDPR (C-200/23 of 4 October 2024, Agentsia po vpisvaniyata \[paragraphs 143 et seq.\]; compare C-340/21, Natsionalna agentsia za prihodite \[paragraphs 80, 86\], on the publication on the internet of personal data obtained through a cyberattack and the resulting fear of misuse by third parties). The loss of control may be sufficient to cause non-material damage, provided that the data subject proves that he or she has actually suffered such damage, however minor it may be (C-200/23 of 4 October 2024, Agentsia po vpisvaniyata \[para. 156\]).

\[12\] 2.3. The right to compensation under Article 82 of the GDPR does not have a punitive or deterrent function, but rather a compensatory one. Financial compensation based on this provision is intended to make it possible to fully compensate for the damage specifically suffered as a result of the breach of the GDPR (ECJ C-182/22 and C-189/22 of 20 June 2024, Scalable Capital \[paragraphs 22 et seq.\], with reference to C-300/21 of 4 May 2023, Österreichische Post \[paragraphs 57 and 58\] and C-741/21 of 11 April 2024, juris \[paragraph 61\]). \[12\] 2.3. The claim for damages under Article 82 GDPR does not have a punitive or deterrent function, but rather a compensatory one. Financial compensation based on this provision is intended to make it possible to fully compensate for the specific damage suffered as a result of the breach of the GDPR (ECJ C-182/22 and C-189/22 of 20 June 2024, Scalable Capital \[paragraphs 22 et seq.\], with reference to C-300/21 of 4 May 2023, Österreichische Post \[paragraphs 57 and 58\] and C-741/21 of 11 April 2024, juris \[paragraph 61\]).

3. The present case

\[13\] 3.1. In the present case, the actual process – the collection or (further) processing of data by calculating and storing marketing qualifications – was not discussed with the plaintiff. However, this need not be further addressed, as the Court of Appeal correctly denied the occurrence of non-material damage. The Court of Appeal unequivocally interpreted the finding regarding the plaintiff's reaction to the data processing as meaning that this constituted recognition and legal qualification as a violation of the GDPR, and that no further effects had occurred. The assessment based on this finding, that no damage caused by the alleged violation of law had occurred, is consistent with the ECJ's case law presented above.

\[14\] 3.2. The appeal arguments concerning the unlawfulness of the data processing and the necessity of civil law sanctions for the unlawful processing of personal data disregard the fact that the claim for damages under the GDPR does not pursue a sanctioning purpose, but serves exclusively to compensate for damage that has occurred (see, for example, ECJ C-182/22 and C-189/22 of 20 June 2024, Scalable Capital \[paragraphs 22 et seq.\]). However, no damage can be derived from the findings made. It has not been established that the plaintiff felt anger, as alleged in the appeal. \[14\] 3.2.

ECJ C-182/22 and C-189/22 of 20 June 2024, Scalable Capital \[para. 22 et seq.\]). However, no damage can be derived from the findings made.
