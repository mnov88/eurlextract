## English Summary

### Facts

In May 2018, a data subject, respresented by _noyb - European Centre for Digital Rights_, filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA. The latter referred the case to the Irish DPC as lead supervisory authority under [Article 56 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_56_GDPR "Article 56 GDPR") and a cooperation procedure under [Article 60 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_60_GDPR "Article 60 GDPR") was initiated.

On 11 January 2023, the DSB transmitted to the data subject the final decision by the DPC in accordance with [Article 60(7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_60_GDPR#7 "Article 60 GDPR") and informed her that the EDPB’s binding decision under [Article 65(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_65_GDPR#1a "Article 65 GDPR") would be published thereafter. Two days later, on 13 January 2023, the DSB transmitted the [binding decision of the EDPB of 5 December 2022](/index.php?title=EDPB_-_Binding_Decision_3/2022_-_%27Meta_\(Facebook\)%27 "EDPB - Binding Decision 3/2022 - 'Meta (Facebook)'") to the data subject. The DSB informed the data subject that the parts of the original complaint that were not addressed by the DPC's decision are still pending before the DPC.

On 7 February 2023, the data subject filed an appeal with the BVwG, claiming that the transmission of the DPC’s decision by the DSB should be considered a partially dismissing or rejection decision within the meaning of [Article 60(9) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_60_GDPR#9 "Article 60 GDPR"). Since the DPC and the EDPB failed to address some of the points raised in the complaint, the communications of the DSB, together with the decision of the DPC could not be interpreted as a positive decision in accordance with [Article 60(7).](/index.php?title=Article_60_GDPR#7 "Article 60 GDPR") In the complainant's view, the communication by the DSB therefore constitutes an official decisions within the meaning of [section 58 et seqq. of the Austrian General Law on Administrative Procedures (_Allgemeines Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz, AVG_)](https://ris.bka.gv.at/NormDokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10005768&FassungVom=2019-05-09&Artikel=&Paragraf=58&Anlage=&Uebergangsrecht=).

In its submissions, the DSB argued that [Article 60(7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_60_GDPR#7 "Article 60 GDPR") applied in this case and the DPC would still be handling the case.

### Holding

The BVwG first of all assessed whether the pronouncement of the DSB constituted a decision within the meaning of [section 58 et seqq. of the Austrian General Law on Administrative Procedures (_Allgemeines Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz, AVG_)](https://ris.bka.gv.at/NormDokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10005768&FassungVom=2019-05-09&Artikel=&Paragraf=58&Anlage=&Uebergangsrecht=). In this, the court took into account objective criteria and giving importance to the form and content of the decision. Further, it considered that attention should be given to the language used and whether this undoubtedly had a normative character, making reference to Austrian case law.

The BVwG held, with respect to the letters of the DSB of 11 and 13 January 2023, that they lacked the formal and content-related requirements to be considered a decision, instead, they merely constituted communications of the DSB to the data subject. If the court were to consider the DSB’s communications as decisions, this would mean that the BVwG would have to decide on the legality of a decision by the Irish DPC. In this context the BVwG referred to its case-law in asylum law matters, whereby the decisions of national authorities cannot be reviewed by the courts of another state as this would go against the principle of national sovereignty of international law. The BVwG held that this principle is transferable to data protection cases. Hence, the BVwG concluded that it cannot review the legitimacy of a decision by a lead supervisory authority in accordance with [Article 60(7)](/index.php?title=Article_60_GDPR#7 "Article 60 GDPR").

Further, the BVwG considered that it would violate the constitution and higher administrative case-law by carrying out a task that is not within its competences provided for by law.

The court specified that the DPC's decision constitutes a decision in accordance with [Article 60(7)](/index.php?title=Article_60_GDPR#7 "Article 60 GDPR") for which the DPC and not the DSB is the competent authority.

For these reasons, the court dismissed the appeal.

## Comment

It is worth noting that the data subject in this case believed that the communication of the DSB should be considered a decision in itself because the DPC and the EDPB failed to acknowlegde certain parts of the complaint in their respective decisions. In this way, the data subject would also be able to appeal the decision, which would otherwise not be possible.

This decision is not final as the data subejct will file an appeal with the Austrian Supreme Administrative Court.

II.3.1.3.Roman II.3.1.3. At the outset, it should be generally noted that the procedure for a complaint from a data subject in connection with (intra-community) cross-border data processing basically consists of three phases. In a first step, the supervisory authorities involved and their respective roles as lead or affected supervisory authorities are determined (Article 56 GDPR). Each supervisory authority basically determines its own role; However, as part of the general obligation to cooperate in accordance with Article 51 Paragraph 2 Sentence 2 of the GDPR, it is obliged to coordinate with the other supervisory authorities and strive for a consensus (cf. Polenz in Simitis, Hornung, Spiecker \[ed.\], Data Protection Law (2019 ) Art. 65 Rz 16). In a second step, the lead supervisory authority may conduct the consistency procedure in accordance with Art. 60 GDPR and issue a decision on the complaint - in the absence of an objection from another supervisory authority in accordance with Art. 60 (4) GDPR - which is binding for all supervisory authorities (Art. 60 Paragraph 6 GDPR). In the final step, this decision is issued by the supervisory authority to which the complaint was lodged with regard to negative or dismissive points made against it (Article 60 (8) GDPR). He will be informed about the content of other points by the supervisory authority to which the complaint has been submitted (Art. 60 Para. 7 GDPR). At the outset it should be noted in general that the procedure for the complaint of a data subject in connection with an (intra-Community ) cross-border data processing basically consists of three phases. In a first step, the supervisory authorities involved and their respective roles as lead or affected supervisory authorities are determined (Article 56, GDPR). Each supervisory authority basically determines its own role; However, as part of the general obligation to cooperate under Article 51, Paragraph 2, S 2 of the GDPR, it is obliged to coordinate with the other supervisory authorities and to strive for a consensus, see Polenz in Simitis, Hornung, Spiecker \[ed.\], Data Protection Law (2019) article 65, paragraph 16). In a second step, the lead supervisory authority may conduct the consistency procedure in accordance with Article 60, GDPR and issue a decision on the complaint - in the absence of an objection from another supervisory authority in accordance with Article 60, paragraph 4, GDPR - which is binding for all supervisory authorities (Article 60, Paragraph 6, GDPR). In the final step, this decision is issued by the supervisory authority to which the complaint was lodged with regard to negative or dismissive points against it (Article 60, Paragraph 8, GDPR). He will be informed about the content of other points by the supervisory authority to which the complaint was submitted (Article 60, paragraph 7, GDPR).

If the supervisory authorities involved do not agree on their respective jurisdiction or on the content of the decision, a dispute resolution procedure can be initiated as an interim step in accordance with Article 65 of the GDPR. In this case, the European Data Protection Board makes a binding decision on the disputed issue for the respective supervisory authorities (see also Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation, Art. 65 GDPR). If the supervisory authorities involved do not agree on their respective competence or on the content of the decision agree, a dispute resolution procedure can be initiated as an interim step in accordance with Article 65, GDPR. In this case, the European Data Protection Board makes a binding decision on the disputed issue for the respective supervisory authorities (see also Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Article 65, GDPR).

II.3.1.4.Roman II.3.1.4. In the present case, the complainant, through her representation, lodged a complaint pursuant to Art. 77 GDPR against the party involved on May 25, 2018. The relevant authority subsequently forwarded the complaint to the Irish Supervisory Authority (DPC) as the responsible lead supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56 (1) GDPR, which initiated a cooperation procedure in accordance with Article 60 GDPR. In the present case, the complainant, through her representation, filed a complaint pursuant to Article 77 of the GDPR against the party involved on May 25, 2018. The relevant authority subsequently forwarded the complaint to the Irish Supervisory Authority (DPC) as the relevant lead supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56, paragraph one, GDPR, thereby initiating a cooperation procedure under Article 60, GDPR.

On December 31, 2022, the Irish supervisory authority (DPC) issued a final decision on the complainant's data protection complaint lodged with the relevant authority on May 25, 2018, which was served on the complainant by the relevant authority on January 11, 2023. This decision (the decision of the Irish supervisory authority) was preceded by a procedure under Article 60 GDPR, in which several supervisory authorities from other Member States each raised a significant and reasoned objection to the draft decision (which was considered to be inadequate) by the relevant supervisory authorities. On December 31, 2022, the Irish supervisory authority (DPC) issued a final decision on the complainant's data protection complaint lodged with the relevant authority on May 25, 2018, which was served on the complainant by the relevant authority on January 11, 2023. This decision (the decision of the Irish supervisory authority) was preceded by a procedure under Article 60, GDPR, in which several supervisory authorities from other Member States each raised a significant and reasoned objection to the draft decision (considered to be substantively deficient) by the relevant supervisory authorities.

However, since the Irish supervisory authority (DPC) did not join in the objections of the other supervisory authorities, a consistency procedure within the meaning of Article 60 (4) GDPR in conjunction with Article 63ff GDPR was initiated, which ultimately resulted in a dispute resolution procedure in accordance with Article 65 (4) GDPR. 1 GDPR resulted. The result of this dispute resolution procedure is the decision of the European Data Protection Board dated December 5, 2022. However, since the Irish supervisory authority (DPC) did not join the objections of the other supervisory authorities, a consistency procedure within the meaning of Article 60, paragraph 4, GDPR in conjunction with Article 63 f, f, GDPR was initiated, which ultimately resulted in a dispute resolution procedure in accordance with Article 65, paragraph one, GDPR resulted. The result of this dispute resolution procedure is the decision of the European Data Protection Board dated December 5, 2022.

In her complaint dated February 7, 2023, the complainant stated that, on January 11, 2023, the authority concerned had sent her an English-language, final decision from the Irish supervisory authority (DPC), which acts as the lead supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56 (1) GDPR been. The authority concerned assumes that this is a decision in accordance with Article 60 (7) GDPR. In the complainant's opinion, when viewed objectively, this is not a decision according to Art. 60 Para. 7 GDPR, but rather a partially rejecting/rejecting decision within the meaning of Art. 60 Para. 9 GDPR. The complainant considers the two decisions of January 11, 2023 and January 13, 2023 by the data protection authority, in conjunction with the decision of the Irish supervisory authority and the decision of the European Data Protection Board of December 5, 2022, to be a decision within the meaning of Sections 58ff AVG; This is true even though the formal requirements of the (Austrian) administrative procedural regulations are not met. In her complaint dated February 7, 2023, the complainant stated that on January 11, 2023, the authority concerned had sent her an English-language, final decision from the Irish supervisory authority (DPC), which acts as the lead supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56, paragraph one, GDPR been. The authority concerned assumes that this is a decision in accordance with Article 60, paragraph 7, GDPR. In the complainant's opinion, when viewed objectively, this is not a decision according to Article 60, paragraph 7, GDPR, but rather a partially rejecting/rejecting decision within the meaning of Article 60, paragraph 9, GDPR. The complainant considers the two decisions of January 11, 2023 and January 13, 2023 by the data protection authority, in conjunction with the decision of the Irish supervisory authority and the decision of the European Data Protection Board of December 5, 2022, to be a decision within the meaning of paragraphs 58 f, f, AVG; This is true even though the formal requirements of the (Austrian) administrative procedural regulations are not met.

II.3.1.5.Roman II.3.1.5. It should be noted at this point that, from the point of view of the Senate, it was not to be assumed that there was a decision with regard to the complaint made by the data protection authority:

According to the established case law of the Administrative Court, when assessing whether an official enunciation constitutes a notice, the objective characteristics are first of all important. The lack of an express designation of an official resolution as a notice alone does not exclude the existence of a legally binding decision with the character of a notice. However, an official decision that is not designated as a notice must be subject to a strict standard with regard to its content as a notice. The acceptance of the nature of such a decision requires that, according to its content, the normative character and the intention of the authority to make a binding agreement on the matter are clear and recognizable to everyone. If the linguistic design does not clearly express a normative content, there is no decision. The reproduction of a legal opinion, facts, reference to the proceedings, legal instructions, etc. cannot be viewed as a binding settlement, i.e. not as a ruling within the meaning of Section 58 Paragraph 1 AVG (see, for example, VwGH of December 15, 2022 Ra 2020/08/0116 and VwGH of January 14, 2013, 2012/08/0299, mwN ).

If the linguistic design does not clearly express a normative content, there is no decision. The reproduction of a legal opinion, facts, reference to the proceedings, legal instructions, etc. cannot be viewed as a binding settlement, i.e. not as a ruling within the meaning of paragraph 58, paragraph one, AVG (see, for example, VwGH of December 15, 2022 Ra 2020/08/0116 and VwGH of January 14, 2013, 2012/08/0299, mwN) .

The quality of the decisions taken by the relevant authority on January 11, 2023 and January 13, 2023 was already negated due to the lack of the form and content requirements of a decision (see also Administrative Court of February 17, 2023, Ro 2023/08/0001). The letters were neither described as notices nor are they divided into rulings, reasons and information on legal remedies. Rather, the complaints made by the data protection authority are simply letters of communication in which the authority concerned, as stipulated in the last sentence of Article 60 (7) of the GDPR, is the supervisory authority to which the (data protection) complaint was submitted is, the complainant has been informed of the decision of the responsible lead supervisory authority (here: the Irish DPC). The quality of the notices issued by the relevant authority on January 11, 2023 and January 13, 2023 was negated due to the lack of formal and content requirements for a notice (see also Administrative Court of February 17, 2023, Ro 2023/08/0001). The letters were neither described as notices nor are they divided into rulings, reasons and information on legal remedies. Rather, the complaints made by the data protection authority are simply letters of communication in which the authority concerned, as stipulated in Article 60, Paragraph 7, last sentence of the GDPR, is the supervisory authority to which the (data protection) complaint was submitted is, the complainant has been informed of the decision of the responsible lead supervisory authority (here: the Irish DPC).

If, on the other hand, one assumes with the complainant that the actions of the data protection authority complained about (in conjunction with the decision of the Irish supervisory authority transmitted therein) are a decision from the data protection authority, this would mean that the Federal Administrative Court within the framework of its decision According to Article 130 Para. 1 Z 1 B-VG and Section 27 DSG, jurisdiction would have to assess the legality or illegality of the decision of the Irish supervisory authority. If, on the other hand, one assumes with the complainant that the actions of the data protection authority complained about (in conjunction with the decision of the Irish supervisory authority transmitted therein) are a decision from the data protection authority, this would mean that the Federal Administrative Court within the framework of its decision Jurisdiction under Article 130, paragraph one, number one, B-VG and paragraph 27, DSG would have to assess the legality or illegality of the decision of the Irish supervisory authority.

From the point of view of the ruling Senate, it seems conceivably possible that a national authority, such as the data protection authority and, downstream of it, the Federal Administrative Court, is called upon to exercise authority over the sovereign activities of an Irish supervisory authority in the context of a decision appeal procedure in accordance with Article 130 Para. 1 Z 1 B-VG - here the DPC - to make a review decision. From the point of view of the ruling Senate, it seems conceivably possible that a national authority, such as the data protection authority and, downstream of it, the Federal Administrative Court, within the framework of a decision appeal procedure according to Article 130, paragraph one, number one, B-VG is called upon to make a review decision on the sovereign activities of an Irish supervisory authority - here the DPC.

In this regard, reference should be made to the case law of the Administrative Court on asylum law; in the given context, this can be applied analogously to official activity in the area of ​​data protection law, according to which the authorities' own sovereign investigations abroad contradict general principles of international law. According to this, states are fundamentally obliged not to carry out any official acts in foreign territories without the permission of the territorial state. This principle is usually strictly applied and does not even allow sovereign activity that has no direct impact in the territorial state, such as police inquiries or official summonses (cf. VwGH March 27, 2023, Ra 2023/18/0082, mwN, VwGH dated October 6th. 2023, Ra 2023/18/0338). A review of resolutions of a responsible lead supervisory authority (Article 56 Paragraph 1 GDPR) within the meaning of Article 60 Paragraph 7 first sentence GDPR via the detour of the qualification of a simple letter of notification for information regarding a decision of a (foreign) supervisory authority in accordance with Art. 60 Para. 7 last sentence GDPR as a decision from the data protection authority is, from the point of view of the adjudicating Senate, out of the question for the reasons mentioned above. In this regard, reference should be made to the case law of the Administrative Court on asylum law; in the given context, this can be applied analogously to official activity in the area of ​​data protection law, according to which the authorities' own sovereign investigations abroad contradict general principles of international law. According to this, states are fundamentally obliged not to carry out any official acts in foreign territories without the permission of the territorial state. This principle is usually handled strictly and does not even allow sovereign activity that has no direct impact in the territorial state, such as police inquiries or official summonses see VwGH March 27, 2023, Ra 2023/18/0082, mwN, VwGH dated October 6, 2023, Ra 2023/18/0338). A review of decisions of a responsible lead supervisory authority (Article 56, paragraph one, GDPR) within the meaning of Article 60, paragraph 7, first sentence of the GDPR via the detour of the qualification of a simple notification letter for information regarding a decision of a (foreign) supervisory authority in accordance with Article 60 , Paragraph 7, last sentence of the GDPR as a decision from the data protection authority, is not considered by the Senate for the reasons mentioned above.

Furthermore, in the present context, reference should be made to Art 83 Para. 2 B-VG, which norms the right to proceedings before a statutory judge at the constitutional level (Mayer/​Kucsko-Stadlmayer/​Stöger Rz 1514). The Constitutional Court interprets this right - contrary to the wording and the systematic classification in the section "ordinary jurisdiction" - extensively and understands the "statutory judge" to mean any state authority (VfSlg 1443, 2048); This results in a constitutionally guaranteed right to protect and preserve the legally established authority's jurisdiction (VfSlg 2536, 12.111); see Muzak, B-VG6 Art 83 Rz 2). Furthermore, in the present context, reference should be made to Article 83, Paragraph 2, B-VG, which norms the right to proceedings before a statutory judge at the constitutional level (Mayer/​Kucsko-Stadlmayer/​Stöger Rz 1514). The Constitutional Court interprets this right - contrary to the wording and the systematic classification in the section "ordinary jurisdiction" - extensively and understands the "statutory judge" to mean any state authority (VfSlg 1443, 2048); This results in a constitutionally guaranteed right to protect and preserve the legally established authority's jurisdiction (VfSlg 2536, 12.111); see Muzak, B-VG6 Article 83, paragraph 2).

According to the Rsp of the Constitutional Court, Art 83 Paragraph 2 B-VG is in any case violated if an administrative authority or a court claims a competence that is not covered by the law (e.g. VfSlg 15.372/1998, 15.738/2000, 16.066/2001, 16,298/2001, 16,717/2002). This can be the case in various constellations, for example if there is no material basis for claiming administrative or judicial authority (VfSlg 11.073/1986, 15.240/1998, 17.387/2004); see Zußner in Kahl/Khakzadeh/Schmid, Commentary on Federal Constitutional Law B-VG and Fundamental Rights Art. 83 B-VG. According to the Rsp of the Constitutional Court, Article 83, Paragraph 2, B-VG is in any case violated if an administrative authority or a court claims a competence that is not covered by the law (e.g. VfSlg 15.372/1998, 15.738/2000, 16.066/2001, 16.298/2001, 16.717/2002). This can be the case in various constellations, for example if there is no material basis for claiming administrative or judicial authority (VfSlg 11.073/1986, 15.240/1998, 17.387/2004); compare Zußner in Kahl/Khakzadeh/Schmid, commentary on federal constitutional law B-VG and fundamental rights Article 83, B-VG.

In the given context, the material and local jurisdiction of a supervisory authority within the meaning of Article 51 GDPR is regulated by Union law, more specifically by Articles 56, 60, 63 and 65 GDPR. In the present case, the Irish supervisory authority, as the responsible lead supervisory authority (Article 56 (1) GDPR), after carrying out a dispute resolution procedure within the meaning of Article 65 GDPR, issued a decision in accordance with Article 60 (7), first sentence, GDPR. This decision was made in accordance with a binding decision in accordance with Article 65 Para. 1 lit Participate in the issuance of a resolution in accordance with Article 65 Paragraph 1 Letter a of the GDPR. Due to the relevant jurisdiction rules in Articles 56, 60 and 65 of the GDPR, the competent authority in question, which in the case was not the responsible supervisory authority, is responsible for issuing a binding decision, i.e. a notice that will conclude the procedure in a meritorious manner. In the given context, the material and territorial jurisdiction of a supervisory authority within the meaning of Article 51, GDPR, is regulated by Union law, more specifically by Articles 56, 60, 63 and 65 GDPR. In the present case, the Irish supervisory authority, as the responsible lead supervisory authority (Article 56, paragraph one, GDPR), after carrying out a dispute resolution procedure within the meaning of Article 65, GDPR, adopted a decision in accordance with Article 60, paragraph 7, first sentence of the GDPR. This decision was made in accordance with a binding decision in accordance with Article 65, paragraph one, letter a, GDPR of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), whereby the individual supervisory authorities have their seat and vote in the EDPB (Article 68, paragraph 3, GDPR) and thereby take part in the procedure participate in the issuance of a decision in accordance with Article 65, paragraph one, letter a, GDPR. Due to the relevant jurisdiction rules in Articles 56, 60 and 65 of the GDPR, the competent authority in question, which was not the responsible lead supervisory authority in the case, is responsible for issuing a binding decision, i.e. a decision that concludes the procedure in a meritorious manner.

II.3.1.6.Roman II.3.1.6. Result: If the complainant takes the legal view in her complaint dated February 7th, 2023 that the two resolutions of the relevant authority dated January 11th, 2023 and January 13th, 2023 in conjunction with the decision of the Irish supervisory authority (DPC) and the decision of the European Data Protection Board are considered as a whole From the point of view of the ruling Senate, it was not possible to qualify the decision within the meaning of §§ 58ff AVG in the light of the above statements. In this case, there is no suitable subject matter for the complaint within the meaning of Article 130 Paragraph 1 Z 1 B-VG and Section 7 VwGVG, which is why the complaint had to be rejected. Result: If the complainant represents the legal opinion in her complaint dated February 7, 2023, the two From this point of view, the decisions taken by the relevant authority on January 11, 2023 and January 13, 2023 in conjunction with the decision of the Irish Supervisory Authority (DPC) and the decision of the European Data Protection Board should be qualified as a decision within the meaning of paragraphs 58 f, f, AVG of the discerning Senate cannot be followed in the light of the above statements. In this case, there is no suitable subject matter for the complaint within the meaning of Article 130, Paragraph One, Number One, B-VG and Paragraph 7, VwGVG, which is why the complaint had to be rejected.

For the sake of completeness, the following should be noted with regard to the complainant's submission in her complaint dated February 7, 2023 that it is urgently suggested to combine the current complaint with the complaint regarding GZ W258 2232927-1, which is also pending at the BVwG:

The proceedings pending in court division W258 essentially concern questions of jurisdiction. Specifically, in the underlying decision dated May 26, 2020, the authority concerned essentially stated that no decision had yet been made by the lead supervisory authority, but only a preliminary legal opinion was being expressed. The Irish supervisory authority, as the lead supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56 (3) GDPR, decided to deal with the complaint dated May 25, 2018. If an investigation were to be carried out and a subsequent meritorious decision was made, the data protection authority would unjustifiably claim its jurisdiction and, since the requirements for a meritorious referral were not met, the application should have been rejected according to the ruling. The case is pending in court division W258 essentially about questions of jurisdiction.

The Irish supervisory authority, as the lead supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56, Paragraph 3, GDPR, decided to deal with the complaint dated May 25, 2018. If an investigation were to be carried out and a subsequent meritorious decision was made, the data protection authority would unjustifiably claim its jurisdiction and, since the requirements for a meritorious referral were not met, the application should be rejected according to the ruling.

In the case W258 2232927-1, an oral hearing took place before the BVwG on March 15, 2023. From the point of view of the adjudicating Senate, combining the proceedings is out of the question for both legal and factual reasons.

II.3.2.Roman II.3.2. Regarding the cancellation of an oral hearing:

Since the complaint had to be rejected in the present case, an oral hearing could not be held in accordance with Section 24, Paragraph 2, Paragraph 1, First Case VwGVG. Since the complaint had to be rejected in the present case, in accordance with Paragraph 24, Paragraph 2, Number One, first case VwGVG there is no need to hold an oral hearing.

II.3.3.Roman II.3.3. Regarding point B) – inadmissibility of the appeal:

According to Section 25a Paragraph 1 VwGG, the administrative court must state in its ruling or decision whether the appeal is permissible in accordance with Article 133 Paragraph 4 B-VG. The decision must be briefly justified. According to paragraph 25 a, paragraph one, VwGG, the administrative court must state in its ruling or decision whether the appeal is permissible in accordance with Article 133, paragraph 4, B-VG. The statement needs to be briefly justified.

The appeal is permissible in accordance with Article 133 Para. 4 B-VG because case law determining Section 27 DSG - which regulates the Senate's jurisdiction in the cases mentioned there - is missing in those cases in which - as in the present case - the existence of a In the decision of the data protection authority as part of the complaint to the Federal Administrative Court, this question therefore forms the core of the legal question to be assessed by the Federal Administrative Court. The appeal is permissible in accordance with Article 133, paragraph 4, B-VG, because case law determining paragraph 27, DSG - which regulates the Senate's jurisdiction in the cases mentioned there - is missing for those cases in which - as in the present case - this applies a decision from the data protection authority is alleged as part of the complaint to the Federal Administrative Court, this question therefore forms the core of the legal question to be assessed by the Federal Administrative Court.
