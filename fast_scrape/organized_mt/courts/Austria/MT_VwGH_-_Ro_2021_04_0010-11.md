## English Summary

### Facts

The controller, the Public Employment Service in Austria, supports workers in (re)integrating into the labour market by offering various services, including a counsellor that discusses labour market opportunities with the jobseeker.

In order to assess the jobseeker’s labour opportunities on the market, the controller used an algorithm to calculate the degree of probability for jobseekers to be employed for a certain number of days, based on: (1) age group, (2) gender, (3) country group, (4) education, (5) health impairment, (6) care responsibilities, (7) occupational group, (8) career history and (9) the regional labour market situation and the duration of cases at the controller. The algorithm did not include motivation, self-help potential of the jobseeker, addiction, debt or housing situation. Based on this, the algorithm divided jobseekers into the following three groups:

(1) Service jobseekers with high labour market opportunities,

(2) Care jobseekers with low labour market opportunities,

(3) Consultancy jobseekers with medium labour market opportunities.

The result was used as a starting point for counsellors to work with jobseekers to assess their potential and any obstacles in the labour market integration. The algorithm itself was not used for job placement, but only for targeted support and assistance, meaning, choosing the right support strategy based on which group the jobseeker was assigned to.

The controller claimed it had a legal basis under Austrian national law (the _Arbeitsmarktservicegezetz, AMSG_) to process data with the help of an algorithm. Under [Article 4(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#4 "Article 4 GDPR"), this processing of data is considered profiling. According to Austrian data protection law (see [Article 1 §2 DSG](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/eli/bgbl/i/1999/165/A1P1/NOR40139563)), processing for the performance of a public task needs to be authorised in Asutrian law. However, the DPA found that a legal basis for this processing could not be found in the AMSG. The DPA also held that the case at issue was a case of automated individual decision-making under [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR"). Although the results of the algorithm were not binding, as the final decision lies with the counsellor, the DPA noted that it could be ruled out that in individual cases, the decision will be based exclusively on profiling.

Therefore, the Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB) issued a ban due to lack of a sufficient legal basis for the processing.

The controller appealed this decision at the Federal Administrative Court (Bundesverwaltungsgerichts, BVwG).

The Federal Administrative Court upheld the controller’s appeal against the decision of the DPA. The Court held that the controller is allowed to carry out this processing of personal data in accordance with national law (  [§25(1) AMSG](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/NormDokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10008905&Artikel=&Paragraf=25&Anlage=&Uebergangsrecht=) ) and therefore has a legal basis. Moreover, [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR") does not apply, as the final decision lies with the counsellors and therefore the decision-making is not based solely on automated processing. However, the Court held that the controller should provide counsellors with instructions and training to ensure they do not accept the result of the algorithm unquestioningly. The Court concluded that the DPA decision should be annulled due to the lack of violation of the principle of lawful data processing under [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR").

The DPA appealed the decision before the Supreme Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof, VwGH). The DPA argued that the Federal Administrative Court did not take into account the character of profiling as a special processing procedure and challenged the lawfulness of the processing under [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR").

### Holding

The Supreme Administrative Court found that the lawfulness of the data processing at issue in the proceeding must be examined against the background of [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR").

The Court found that the controller’s algorithmic process in itself is an automated decision under [Article 22(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR#1 "Article 22 GDPR"), based on the recent CJEU decision [C-634/21 - Schufa](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C%E2%80%91634/21_-_SCHUFA "CJEU - C‑634/21 - SCHUFA"). The Court explained that the algorithm decided on the allocation of jobseeker’s group and thus has a legal effect on the jobseekers concerned or similarly significantly affects them. The fact that the final decision on the jobseeker’s group assignment lies with the counsellor, does not prevent the algorithm from being classified as an automated decision under [Article 22(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR#1 "Article 22 GDPR"). The Supreme Administrative Court found that the instructions and trainings that were provided to ensure counsellors would not accept the algorithm’s results unquestioningly could not exclude the possibility that the algorithm is ultimately decisive for the allocation.

The Court further held that the algorithm did not fall under the exceptions of [Article 22(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR#2 "Article 22 GDPR"). Therefore, the Court concluded that the appeal had to be upheld and that the decision of the Federal Administrative Court needed to be set aside, _de facto_ confirming the violations identified by the DPA.

## Comment

In paragraph 15 and 20 of the decision, the Supreme Administrative Court refers to [Article 9(2)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2d "Article 9 GDPR"), which is incorrect. It should be [Article 9(2)(g) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2g "Article 9 GDPR"), which is about the substantial public interest.

Moreover, it seems that the Supreme Administrative Court interprets [Article 22(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR#1 "Article 22 GDPR") very broadly. The Court does not substantiate how the algorithm produces legal effects for the data subject or similarly significantly affects the data subject. It merely states it does in paragraph 79 of the decision. This is interesting, because it does state that the algorithm cannot be used for a job placement itself, but only for choosing the right support strategy for the jobseeker. Moreover, according to paragraph 7 of the decision, the jobseeker can have a different assessment of the labour market opportunities than the counsellor, which will be then be documented in the support agreement that is made between the counsellor and jobseeker.

        The Administrative Court has through the presiding Senate President

        Dr. Kleiser, Councilor Dr. Mayr, court councilor Mag. Hainz-Sator and the court councilors

        Dr. Pürgy and Mag. Brandl as judges, with the participation of the secretary
        Mag. Vonier, about the data protection authority's appeal against the finding

        of the Federal Administrative Court of December 18, 2020,
        Zl. W256 2235360-1/5E, concerning a data protection matter

        The contested finding is due to illegality of the content

        Reasons for the decision:

1 1. The contested finding is based on the following undisputed facts

2 The co-participating party (hereinafter: mP), in the proceedings before the

        The detailed procedure of the consultants employed for this purpose can be found in the
        “Federal Guideline” of the Labor Market Service “Core Process Workers

        support”. This states that consultants in the process
        a consultation with job seekers

        Wishes/expectations, their previous life course and the reasons for their

        have to explain unemployment. The labor market opportunities of
        Job seekers should be addressed and discussed.

        mP consultants will be mandatory from January 1, 2021.

5 This statistical model uses an algorithm to determine the degree of

        Probability for job seekers automatically calculated,
        a certain number within a certain period of time in the future

        to be busy for days. Specifically, this is based on the following
        Data an “IC” is calculated:

        age group,

        Gender,

        group of states,

        Education,

        Duration of the business case at mP.

6 Based on the “IC”, job seekers are divided into the following

        three groups:

        Service customers with job market opportunities are high
        Care customers with labor market prospects low

        Advice clients with medium labor market prospects.

         Job seekers expressly have a different assessment of the

         Labor market opportunities than the consultants, this is in the
         Document care agreement.

 8 AMAS does not take into account criteria such as motivation, self-help potential
         Customers, addiction, debts, housing situation, etc.

 9 2. After the initiation of an ex officio examination procedure in accordance with
         Art. 57 Para. 1 lit. h in conjunction with Art. 58 Para. 1 lit. b and Para. 2 lit. a GDPR in conjunction with

         Section 22 Paragraph 1 DSG was notified to the mP by the appeal applicant

         from August 16, 2020 data processing in connection with
         Determination of labor market opportunities for job seekers

         With the help of the Labor Market Opportunities Assistance System (AMAS).
         Effective January 1, 2021, “unless there are any by this point in time.”

         there is a suitable legal basis for data processing.”

10 In summary, the appellant gave reasons in her decision

         that data processing takes place with the help of AMAS
         Within the framework of the exercise of the rights transferred to the mP in accordance with Section 1 Paragraph 1 AMSG

         public tasks. For an authority it is in accordance with Section 1 Paragraph 2 DSG

         it is necessary that their data processing is sufficient
         determined legal authorization. The § 29 mentioned by the mP

         and Section 31 Paragraph 5 AMSG would only generally describe the goal and the
         Specify the fulfillment of tasks by the mP, but not for data processing

         authorize. The data processing in question is the issue
         This is a profiling within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 4 GDPR, through which a

         “informational added value” comes about, which is stated in the law

         must be expressly referred to. The present
         Data processing cannot be based on a suitable legal basis

         support. In addition, there is a case of Art. 22 GDPR, namely an automated one
         individual decision. It should be admitted that the final decision

         due to internal guidelines lies with the mP consultants. This

         However, internal instructions for action would not bind the mP
         unfold and are therefore not subject to any verification controls. In addition

                                                                 4 out of 53

         It cannot be ruled out that in individual cases the decision will be made exclusively

         based on profiling.

11 3. The Federal Administrative Court issued the contested finding

         (BVwG) of the mP's complaint against the appeal applicant's decision

         Followed and repealed the contested decision without replacement. The audit explained it
         below one for permissible.

12 In addition to the findings already presented at the beginning, the BVwG made in
         his reasons also include the findings that only after the

         Discussing the optimal support strategy with customers

         would be defined by the consultants based on a supervision agreement.
         To ensure that the consultants do not have the result of the algorithm

         would take over without question, have the mP in addition to those shown
         Guidelines also provide appropriate instructions for action

         Training conducted.

13 In its legal assessment, the BVwG stated in an ex officio manner

         The appellant is responsible for the examination proceedings initiated

         Supervisory authority in the event of a violation of the GDPR being detected
         the power to order various remedial measures. Matter

         The complaint procedure before the BVwG can only be examined
         Legality of the specific order made in connection with

         the violation on which the supervisory authority is based. In the

         In the present case, it can be assumed that the appellant is
         Prohibition issued by official notice solely because of the lack of one

         sufficient legal basis for official action.
         A legality assessed in the contested decision

         The BVwG is prohibited from further checking data processing.

14 Art. 9 Paragraph 2 Letter h GDPR refers, according to its wording, to one

         Data processing for health-related purposes. In the present case be

         this provision cannot therefore be relied upon without further ado.

15 It follows from Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. e GDPR and Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. d GDPR that

         the processing of personal data can be lawful if

         Administrative Court

         www.vwgh.gv.at Ro 2021/04/0010-11
                                                                  December 21, 2023
                                                                  5 out of 53

         the processing for a sovereign or other public interest
         underlying task or in the case of processing special categories

         personal data due to significant public interest

         was required. In this context it is according to the provisions of
         GDPR is irrelevant whether the person responsible is an authority or

         a private body and in which - sovereign or
         private sector - form the controller may take action if necessary.

         What is more important is whether a matter is public
         or significant public interest is required and a legal requirement

         regulated data processing is carried out. Art. 6 Paragraph 3 GDPR
         specifies content requirements for an appropriate legal basis,

         which are clear and precise in the context of recital 41 of the GDPR
         and should be predictable for those subject to the law. Related

         Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. g GDPR also stipulates that the corresponding
         Legal basis appropriate and specific measures to safeguard the

         should provide for the fundamental rights and interests of the persons concerned. Nothing

         otherwise see § 1 Para. 2 DSG, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended by Federal Law Gazette I No. 14/2019,
         provided that the data processing is carried out by the state authorities. The

         Union law provisions - Art. 6 and Art. 9 GDPR - would generally
         a task in the considerable public interest and - accordingly

         not limited to sovereign activities - one is sufficient
         Demand a specific legal basis for data processing. It

         It can therefore remain open in the present case whether the mP
         procedural data processing in sovereign or

         in a private law form. Rather, it comes because of the
         data processing that is the subject of the procedure also includes health data and

         thus special categories of data within the meaning of Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR
         are included, depends on whether the data processing that is the subject of the procedure

         on an appropriate legal basis and for a task by the MP

         is necessary in the significant public interest.

16 The mP is a service company under public law with its own
         Legal personality, which is responsible for the implementation of the labor market policy of the

         federal responsibility. According to Section 29 Paragraph 1 AMSG, the mP has a

                                                                 6 out of 53

         as complete, economically sensible and sustainable as possible

         Bringing together labor supply and labor demand
         to work towards supplying the economy with workers and the

         Employment of all people available on the labor market
         to secure it as best as possible. The mP is held in accordance with Section 29 Paragraph 2 AMSG

         efficient placement of suitable workers
         To create jobs that, as far as possible, correspond to the placement wishes

         provide the job seeker with appropriate employment and the

         Effect of circumstances that have a direct mediation in this
         to help overcome the senses. The principles are:

         Economy, economy and practicality must be taken into account and it is
         It is also important to ensure that groups of people who are particularly affected by

         If people are threatened with unemployment, appropriate support services are offered
         would.

17 Section 25 Paragraph 2 AMSG expressly authorizes the mP to do so
         Processing of those involved in the proceedings

         personal data, provided this is necessary to fulfill legal requirements
         Task is an essential prerequisite. That of the mP is therefore legal

         The task of ensuring an orderly system assigned by Section 29 AMSG

         and well-functioning labor market is undoubtedly a significant one
         public interest within the meaning of Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. g GDPR.

18 In addition, it is undisputed that it is also necessary to take into account personal characteristics

         of job seekers in combination with the general

         Labor market events and the resulting application opportunities
         of job seekers on the labor market to take into account the

         The task of optimally supplying the economy with workers and the
         To secure employment for job seekers in the best possible way

         can. The relevance of the procedural subject matter in data processing
         The personal data included cannot be disputed

         become. There are therefore no concerns that the MP should be used to “ensure

         “Ordinary labor market policy” is the subject matter of the proceedings

         Background to the requirements of the GDPR and the DSG
         Related comprehensive appropriate technical and

         organizational measures to ensure compliance with the principles of

         GDPR and processing in accordance with the DSG. About the of
         In addition to the measures mentioned in recital 78, see Section 25 (10) AMSG

         additional specific requirements to ensure the
         Data security.

19 The fundamental right of the mP to evaluate the
         Labor market opportunities for job seekers based on certain personal characteristics

         The appellant does not doubt that data should be provided
         pulled. An “informational” accepted by the appeal applicant

         Added value” of one based on the same personal data

         Assessment of labor market opportunities can - whether the assessment is not
         automated or based on profiling - for data protection reasons

         View cannot be recognized because each evaluation is also weighted
         the evaluator is based on.

20 In addition, a different assessment could affect the legality of a
         Data processing relating to Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter e or Article 9

         Paragraph 2 lit. d GDPR cannot be derived because these provisions do not

         distinguish between automated and non-automated processing
         would only focus on the concept of processing in general

         would. Art. 4 Z 1 GDPR in turn defines using an example
         List the processes there in connection with personal data

         Data as processing, regardless of whether this is done with or without help
         automated procedures are carried out. That Art. 4 Z 4 GDPR

         I exclusively refer to automated processing separately as profiling,

         highlight this significant use case and make it clear that these
         Form of processing falls within the scope of application of the GDPR and the

         must meet the general criteria there.

27 For these reasons, the appeal is admissible and ultimately justified.

28 5.1. The legal basis:

29 5.1.1. The case-specific relevant recitals and provisions of the

         Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of

32 5.2. To assess the relevant action of the AMS as sovereign or

         private sector and on the question of the applicability of Section 1 Paragraph 2 DSG

         the present facts

33 5.2.1. The revision argues that the data processing in question is carried out

         the mP takes place within the framework of sovereign administration. Nobody spoke
         understandable reasons for the processing to be in the area of

         To be attributed to private sector administration, especially since Section 29 AMSG covers the mediation
         of suitable workers for jobs as the goal and task of the mP

         statue. However, the task of providing employment is one
         inseparable connection with the Unemployment Insurance Act

         (AlVG). AMAS cannot be separated from official activities according to the
         AlVG are considered because this data processing is ultimately considered

         Basis for decision-making for job placement and thus

         serve in conjunction with unemployment insurance claims.
         Since the data processing in question takes place within the framework of sovereign administration

         is carried out, Section 1 Paragraph 2 DSG requires the respective legislator
         Matter-specific regulations in the sense that the cases are more admissible

34 The response to the appeal counters that the AMSG regulates the same

         Essentially the “services” of the employment service (AMS) and
         thus the private sector tasks of the mP, in particular their

         Employment placement activities including organization and
         Carrying out training and awarding aid. The

         Procedural processing - AMAS - is used for activities of the
         mP used in the private sector. These in Sections 29 ff AMSG

         The tasks envisaged by the mP would be carried out using the means of private law

         carried out, the basis for the procedure essentially being:
         Supervision agreement in accordance with Section 38c AMSG. On any possible

         There is no entitlement to services. See Section 32 AMSG in this sense
         suggests that the MPs describe their services in more detail

         have to provide services to which expressly no reference is made
         legal claim exists. This also applies to the awarding of aid. The

         The appellant herself assumes that the matter at issue in the proceedings

         Data processing for the purposes of job placement in accordance with
         §§ 29 ff AMSG is used. It should be noted that AMAS is not for

         the job placement itself, but only for the targeted person
         Support and support can be used. The program

         serve to choose the right care strategy. The employment agency itself
         success regardless of the calculated opportunities on the labor market. From all

         The result is that the requirement of Section 1 Paragraph 2 DSG, according to which an intervention in the
         Basic right to data protection by a state authority only on the basis

         should be made on a qualified legal basis, this is not the case

         application succeed.

35 5.2.2. The balancing of interests stipulated in Section 1 Paragraph 2 DSG requires:
         Admissibility of official interventions in data protection secrecy

         an (express) legal regulation resulting from the provisions set out in Article 8 Para. 2 ECHR

         reasons mentioned is necessary. The explanations for this provision
         understand authorities as state bodies acting sovereignly; that is what is meant

         sovereign action by administrative authorities (cf. Pürgy/Zavadil,

36 5.2.3. Sovereign administration occurs when the administrative bodies

         “Empire”, i.e. using specific state command and control
         Coercive force occurs. They act in those legal sentence forms that...

         public law for the exercise of official powers

         (cf. VfGH March 3, 2001, KI-2/99).

37 The determination that an administrative body is an act of society

         services of general interest, thus a public administrative task,
         excludes the qualification of such an activity as

         Private sector administration not out. For the delimitation of the area
         Private sector administration from that of the sovereign administration it depends on the

         motives and the purpose of the activity, what is more important is
         what legal technical means the legislation can use to implement the

         fulfilling tasks. Does the legislature have the administrative authority?

         not endowed with coercive powers, there is no sovereign administration,
         but rather private sector administration (see VfGH October 18, 1957, KI-1/57;
                                                                                     6
         see also the comments in Raschauer, General Administrative Law,
         2021, paragraph 694 ff).

38 According to the statements in - the still relevant
         “leading case” - VfSlg. 3262/1957 it is official for qualification

         Acting as a sovereign administration, it is irrelevant whether the authority in question has one
         performs a “public task” because not everything “public” is sovereign

         is carried out. Furthermore, it is not decisive that it is one

         regulation in the field of public law. Not everyone is either
         Act of a body endowed with official powers is an act of sovereignty.

         The fact that the relevant authority in connection with the
         Works with public funds to fulfill the task does not make a decision either

         about the questions of sovereign action, because also within the framework of

         Private sector administration the state deals with public funds.
         The only decisive factor is what legal means the legislature uses

         has provided, i.e. whether there is a legal authorization to do something sovereign

         action is given and whether such action is used in the specific case

         is made (cf. on all the Raschauer, ibid).

39 The term “simple sovereign administration” refers to administrative action

         recorded, which is not of a private economic nature, but rather belongs to the area of
         sovereign administration, even if in the specific case there is no sovereign act

         is set. In the simple sovereign administration the
         Administrative bodies not in the forms of action of the decision

         direct administrative command and coercive power as well as the
         Regulation acts, although this limits its power to order and enforce

         is present in the background. In this sense it is simple

         Sovereign administration a potentially sovereign administration that can be achieved through deployment
         can go from empire to current sovereign administration; it deals

         It is therefore a matter of “different intensity” of an administrative activity
         overall belongs to the area of sovereign administration (cf. VwGH April 15, 2016,

         Ra 2016/02/0028). There may be administrative acts that are not
         have independent normativity, but undoubtedly - preparatory,

         accompanying, implementing - within the framework of the sovereign administration.
         In some cases it is even expressly provided that the refusal

         Such an (actual) performance should be made with a notice, which is probably the case

         The clearest indication of this is also the case of positive approval
         or fulfillment can be qualified as sovereign action. The simple one

         Sovereign administration can no longer be based solely on the limited
         Number of typified forms of sovereign acts can be determined.

         What is crucial is that certain actions are taken that both
         in the area of sovereign administration as well as in the area of

         Private sector administration can be found. To act sovereignly
         this action the context in which they are placed

         (cf. again Raschauer, ibid).

40 5.2.4. It is undisputed that the mP has both private and sovereign interests

         To fulfill tasks (see Section 31 Paragraph 1 AMSG) because they

         Job seekers both as a (contractual) partner and as a sponsor
         confronted with state sovereignty.

         Benefits to which there is a legal claim - for example under the AlVG - are decided

         consists. The care activity in question including that in this context
         the planned creation of a care plan/a care agreement

         but takes place without the law granting the mP coercive powers or
         the job seeker has a legal right to what is considered expedient there

         The prospect of supporting measures opens up. Rather, the mP

         “Economic Principles” fulfillment of tasks

         (see Section 29 Paragraph 1 AMSG) to be provided in the form of services,
         which anyone can take advantage of (Section 31 Paragraph 1 AMSG). The

         Case-related relevant activity of the MP is therefore not considered a sovereign activity
         in a narrower sense.

42 5.2.4.2. The possibility of this happening simply needs to be questioned
         sovereign action because - as the appeal argues - the

         Employment placement in an “inseparable connection with the AlVG”

         stand.

         Principles in the sense of an active labor market policy (Section 29 Paragraph 1 AMSG).

         According to the materials on the AMSG (RV 1468 BlgNR 18. GP, 32; AB 1555
         BlgNR 18. GP) the sole purpose of the law is reform

         the labor market administration and the associated re-achievement of the
         Full employment and the participation of job seekers in working life

         The central aim of the provisions of the AMSG is to achieve one
         the highest possible level of employment through the organization of the mP

         should be achieved, for whose services the rapid placement of a

         Productive and individually satisfying employment is the top priority.
         According to Section 29 AMSG, the economic existence should be maintained during the period of

         Job search is guaranteed, securing a living in form
         Recurring benefits to job seekers are therefore part of the

         Labor market policy. This is the basic idea of active labor market policy
         through specific measures tailored to the individual case and under

         Consideration of the greatest possible compatibility of full employment

         and achieve economic growth. From this objective
         The AMSG shows that, on the one hand, the AMS unites the job seeker

         Overview of the domestic labor market and orientation towards it
         enable, on the other hand, through targeted advice and assistance

         Identify a position that is appropriate to the individual's individual abilities
         should do (see OGH January 30, 2001, 1 Ob 257/00a).

46 The entitlement to unemployment benefit (§ 47 para. 1 AlVG) is of a sovereign nature;
         when deciding whether you are entitled to unemployment benefit

         official tasks are fulfilled. The placement of job seekers
         However, as can be seen from Section 31 Paragraph 1 AMSG, it is in any case not sovereign

         (see OGH November 24, 2015, 1 Ob 208/15t, mwN).

47 The relevant advice according to the findings, within the framework of which this

         The data processing in question is carried out - regardless of the narrow subject matter
         Context - intentionally not about the preparation of the agreement

         Claims from unemployment insurance, but rather the purpose of the

         Bringing together supply and demand in the labor market. The

         Section 31 Paragraph 1 AMSG is also open to job seekers who are not recipients of
         Unemployment benefits are not provided through sovereign means

         carried out this still ends - given the lack of reciprocal

         Rights and obligations - in a sovereign act. The purely objective one
         Connection between unemployment and possible support

         According to the AlVG, in the event of an unsuccessful job search, advice is provided
         Reintegration into the labor market itself is not one

         Preparatory act for official activities at the
         Granting support, namely in the absence of a sufficient normative one

         Connexes does not apply even if it is made to people who are already in the
         Receipt of benefits according to the AlVG.

48 This also applies to the “care plan”: according to the
         The Labor Market Reform Act 2004, BGBl. I No. 77, inserted Section 38c AMSG has this

         AMS to create a care plan for every unemployed person
         “Based on the expected need for care, in particular the type and

         Type of care and the measures envisaged as well as a
         Justification for the intended course of action”. The explanations

         of the legislature, ErlRV 464 BlgNR 22. GP 9, excerpts read:

         “The basic principles of the employment service have already been good so far
         Experiences in the care plan used should now be expressly legal
         be anchored. The care plan is not the sovereign administration
         to be attributed, but should only be the framework conditions for which the

         Mediation and placement services associated with the private sector administration
         the employment service's placement-supporting activities.
         The care plan should provide a consistent, meaningful, predictable and
         Proceedings in accordance with the principle of trust in the care and
         Placement of the unemployed must be ensured. Depending on the to
         Part of very different conditions for success

         Reintegration into the labor market involves different requirements
         to provide care for the unemployed. This results in tiered ones

         Special efforts are required in the labor market. (...) The
         Agreement on the care plan is within the framework of the existing one

         Unemployed people are not in compliance with the applicable regulations

         in any case in an appropriate manner, for example by handing it over or sending it
         to bring knowledge. The care plan should define the framework,
         within which placement efforts and qualification or other
         to improve employment opportunities on the labor market

         necessary measures should be taken. In the agreements should
         also the planned personal activities of the unemployed
         be held. The care plan is for the actions of the
         Labor market service as well as the unemployed as long as he
         not changed - usually after a new consultation
         became. (...) On the one hand, the support plan is intended to provide for the unemployed

         higher degree of personal action orientation as well
         Predictability of the actions of the employment service and on the other hand
         Overall, it is even more planned, easier to understand and, if necessary, targeted
         changeable approach of the employment service can be guaranteed. The
         The tried and tested 'agreement culture' should be continued and expanded. (...)"

49 According to the declared will of the legislature, the mP is given the task

         the creation of the care plan/care agreement within the framework
         the private sector administration. This corresponds to the explicit one

         Exclusion of a legal right to a specific care plan or

         on measures that are envisaged in the care plan
         (see also Julcher in AlV-Komm § 9 AlVG Rz 79). Furthermore is

         decisive for the classification of the relevant cases
         mP's advisory activity as a private sector activity that

         Creation of the care plan in accordance with the reasonableness criteria
         Section 9 paragraphs 1 to 3 AlVG must be taken into account; one from the

         Binding terms that can be derived directly from the care plan/care agreement
         Determination of the limits of the reasonableness of employment in the sense of

         § 9 AlVG or just a binding definition of the individual case-related criteria
         However, the law does not provide for the assessment of these limits,

         so that the care plan, against this background, limits the

         Reasonableness of employment - especially in connection with

                                                                 34 out of 53

         possible sanctions according to § 10 AlVG - neither expand nor restrict

         can. There can also be no sanction directly following the care plan
         § 10 AlVG. Section 9 (8) AlVG also changes this consequence

         nothing, because the provision there does reduce the justification effort of the mP for

         Reintegration measures for the job seeker - under
         certain requirements - in connection with an existing one

         Care plan modified, but which itself does not develop any bond and the
         Authority is also not relieved of its obligation to present one

         comprehensible - and in this sense independent - justification

         which is subject to verification (cf. in this direction
         pointing VwGH March 28, 2012, 2010/08/0250).

50 From what has been said above it follows that neither the advice

         as part of the job placement itself, the creation of the

         Care plan (a care agreement) within the meaning of Section 38c AMSG
         to be attributed to the (even if simply) sovereign area of activity of the mP

         is. Rather, this is part of the private sector
         actions of the mP, against the background of the functional concept of authority

         Section 1 Paragraph 2 DSG does not correspond to this in terms of data protection law

         determinate standard for encroachments on fundamental rights
         Personal data is subject to confidentiality in accordance with Section 1 Paragraph 1 DSG.

51 For this reason alone, the controversial legality of the
         data processing that is the subject of the procedure using the

         to examine the relevant provisions of the GDPR without the standard of
         Section 1 Paragraph 2 DSG must be taken into account.

52 5.3. On the question of the existence of sufficient justification reasons
         Articles 6 and 9 GDPR

53 5.3.1. The BVwG supported its argument regarding legality
         the processing in question is based on the conclusion in accordance with Article 6

         Paragraph 1 lit. e GDPR and Art. 9 para. 2 lit. g GDPR can be processed
         personal data or special categories of personal data

         Data will be lawful if this processing is based on the law of

         Member State of the person responsible for a matter in the public interest
         underlying task or with regard to the processing of special categories

         personal data based on significant public interest

         was required. The legal basis corresponding to Art. 6 Para. 3 GDPR
         according to Recital 41 of the GDPR, I have made it clear and precise and for the

         to be predictable for those subject to the law. Art. 9 paragraph 2 lit. g GDPR requires
         additional appropriate and specific measures to safeguard the

         Fundamental rights and interests of the persons concerned. Summarized
         The BVwG believes that the mP has the right to it in accordance with Section 29 Paragraph 1 AMSG

         assigned tasks in accordance with Section 31 Paragraph 5 AMSG
         required principles of thrift, economy and

         expediency must be met. Section 25 Paragraph 2 AMSG grants the mP one
         Authorization to process personal data, insofar as this

         are an essential prerequisite for fulfilling legal tasks.
         The task assigned to the mP in accordance with Section 29 AMSG is undoubtedly one of

         significant public interest. In order to achieve the set goal of optimal

         Supplying the economy with workers and employing everyone
         In order to secure people in the best possible way, it is undeniably necessary to focus on the

         personal characteristics of the job seekers in combination with the
         Labor market events to be taken into account. That those brought in

         personal data of job seekers for the assessment of the job seekers
         Labor market opportunities can be relevant, also from the appeal applicant

         not been disputed. There are none in this case
         Concerns that the mP is intended to ensure a “proper

         Labor market policy” the personal data in accordance with Section 25 Paragraph 1 AMSG
         may use. There are indications that such data processing is carried out in

         § 25 AMSG is not sufficiently clearly expressed
         recognizable. Section 25 Paragraph 10 AMSG takes precautions to ensure that the

         Processing and warranty in accordance with the principles of the GDPR

         data security.

54 5.3.2. In order to answer the appeal's submissions, we must first look at the
         The question of whether the requirements of Articles 6 and 9 of the GDPR are met will be addressed

         and to say in advance that the question of the legality of the

         Administrative Court

         Processing against the background of these provisions is one of the questions

         the ban on automated decisions in accordance with Art. 22 GDPR
         represents a dividing legal question.

55 5.3.2.1. The processing of personal data is in accordance with
         Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. e GDPR - among other things - lawful if the

         Processing is necessary for the performance of a task that is...

         is in the public interest or is carried out in the exercise of official authority
         was transferred to the person responsible.

56 Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. e GDPR is closely related to Art. 6
         Paragraphs 2 and 3, which contain more detailed requirements for the legal basis.

         The legal basis for the processing is in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter e of the GDPR
         may in accordance with Art. 6 para. 3 leg. cit. by Union law or the law of the

         Member States to which the controller is subject must be determined. The
         The purpose of the processing must - unlike the processing according to

         Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR - not necessarily in a legal basis

         be expressly provided for. According to Art. 6 Para. 3 Sentence 2 GDPR, it is sufficient
         if the purpose of the processing is necessary to complete a task

         fulfill which is in the public interest or in the exercise of a public purpose
         Violence occurs.

57 Recital 41 of the GDPR again provides that the corresponding
         Legal basis or legislative measure clear and precise and their

         Application should be predictable for those subject to the law. However
         Recital 45 of the GDPR expressly does not require each individual

         Processing a specific law. Rather, a law can serve as a basis

         be sufficient for multiple processing operations when processing
         is necessary to carry out a task in the public interest.

58 In light of the wording of these relevant provisions
         It cannot be assumed that the national legislature is responsible for fulfilling the

         Justification of Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter e GDPR with regard to a
         certain data processing is in any case held, the data processing

         to determine themselves in the law. Rather, it is the justification fact

         must be consistent with the legitimate purpose pursued (see also this view

60 Core of - Art. 6 Paragraph 1 Letter e GDPR

         is that the processing is carried out for reasons of significant public concern
         interest must be required. While accordingly for processing

         personal data is generally in the public interest
         (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. e GDPR), the processing of sensitive data is required

         Within the meaning of Article 9 Para. 1 GDPR - according to its wording - such
         considerable interest. This means that specific consideration is required

         a special legitimation for the use of such data (cf. to

61 The requirements for the legal basis are not specified in more detail

         What these two justification facts have in common and the respective one

         Reference to Union law or the law of a Member State as well

         In the absence of an order to the contrary, this is also necessary to justify the
         Processing of special categories of personal data within the meaning of

         Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. g GDPR assumes that - just like with
         Justification for Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter e - the sufficiently clear definition

         the task to be performed with the processing - which is related
         This data must have a special quality (arg.: “significant

         public interest”) - is necessary but also sufficient (cf. the
         Statements by Schörghofer/Warter, The legal basis of a

         Data processing in FS Pfeil, 2022, 721ff \[734\]). This view corresponds
         the opinion of the ECJ in C-136/17, according to which Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. g GDPR

         Processing of the special categories of data referred to in Article 9 is permitted,
         if it is necessary for reasons of significant public interest,

         on the basis of Union law or the law of a third party

         Member State that is proportionate to the objective pursued,
         preserves the essence of the right to data protection and appropriate and

         specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and interests of the
         data subject, whereby the ECJ in the manner provided for by Article 11 of the Charter

         protected right to free information a possible justification
         The legal basis for the data processing in dispute there is (cf. ECJ ibid.,

         61, 66 and 68). In this examination, the ECJ in no way relies on
         whether the justifying legal basis is the disputed data processing itself

         designated.

62 5.3.2.3. Case-related arises against the background of this legal situation

         the following:

         First of all, it should be noted that the question of the existence of a public one

         Interest in the assets transferred to mP by Sections 29 ff AMSG
         Tasks - including those of the audit department - are not disputed.

63 Section 29 Paragraph 1 AMSG defines the task of the mP; Section 29 Paragraph 2 AMSG mentions this

         The goals to be achieved in connection with the fulfillment of this task

         Activity of the mP. Section 30 Paragraph 2 AMSG also explicitly norms this
         Commitment of the mP to labor market monitoring and statistics

         care for. By detailing the principles governing task fulfillment
         must be taken as a basis; Section 31 AMSG also states which

         Demands must be met when fulfilling tasks. Section 25 Paragraph 1 AMSG
         limits the authorization for processing to the statutory task and

         to such processing that is essential for the fulfillment of the task

         are prerequisites. This is done by listing the data and the
         direct connection between the same and the permitted processing purpose

         It regulates in a predictable manner for the data subject which data and for what purpose
         may be processed. There is no doubt that this violates §§ 29

         up to 31 AMSG the task in connection with which the mP is to be processed
         the data listed in Section 25 Paragraph 1 AMSG is authorized, and thus the

         Framework for the permitted purpose of data processing is sufficiently clear and
         describe precisely. That the assessment of the labor market opportunities of one

         a relevant parameter for an efficient person looking for work

         Employment placement is obvious. It can therefore be assumed
         that a subject to the law is given in view of the mP

         Task and the services to be provided - in particular the
         The care plan to be drawn up in accordance with Section 38c AMSG - is sufficiently clear

         It is clear that processing in accordance with Section 25 Paragraph 1 AMSG
         The data listed also helps to assess the positioning of each

         relevant job seekers on the labor market and thus for

         this purpose, which is necessary for the fulfillment of the public task,
         can be used.

64 Furthermore, with regard to the health data affected on a case-by-case basis,

         the special categories of personal data within the meaning of
         Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR must be counted, it should be noted that it is in accordance with the requirements

         There is no doubt about the case law of the ECJ cited above

         can ensure the best possible integration of job seekers
         The legislative objective applicable to the national labor market is significant

         pursues public interest within the meaning of Article 9 Paragraph 2 Letter g GDPR
         but this objective in connection with efficient use

         state support resources and optimization of social satisfaction

         job-seekers on the one hand and the best possible care for the
         labor market on the other hand. That case-related data processing in one

         appropriate relationship to the task assigned by law
         pursued goals is not and is not in dispute

         visible. This is particularly because, according to the findings in
         According to the contested finding, only those health data are processed

         which restrict the exercise of activities in the labor market and therefore

         are directly related to the employment placement.

65 The provisions regarding the duty of confidentiality of the bodies of the mP in

         § 27 AMSG and the detailed provisions on disclosure and
         Storage of the data in Section 25 Paragraphs 2 to 11 AMSG leaves no room for doubt

         to fulfill the measures required by Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. g GDPR
         Preservation of the essence of the fundamental right enshrined in Article 8 GRC

         Protection of personal data (see the concept of the essential content guarantee

         affected persons. The revision does not bring forward anything concrete,

         which calls this view into question.

66 Insofar as the appeal repeatedly points out that the BVwG has the

         Character of profiling as a special processing procedure
         There is no connection with the requirements of Articles 6 and 9 GDPR

         observed, it is not clear from the statements to what extent the mentioned

         There are other requirements for this form of processing

         should provide a justifying legal basis, especially since neither Article 6 nor
         Art. 9 GDPR refer to Art. 4 Z 4 GDPR. That of revision in it

         It may be agreed that profiling is a special form of processing
         does not change this view per se. The peculiarity of the

         Precipitation finds.

         In this respect, the revision - including in this context - is based on the

         Requirements of Section 1 Paragraph 2 DSG, the case law of
         Constitutional Court on the legality principle of Article 18 B-VG and the

         insufficient legal basis of the federal directive because of it
         refers to insufficient commitment, please refer to the comments on point

         5.2. to point out.

67 Does the revision point out that in order to exercise the rights concerned,

         It is necessary that “the data collection is carried out in a way that is suitable for those affected by it
         \[...\] foreseeable manner and in a manner that is at most contestable

         “duly verifiable form”, it should be noted that the
         Data collection itself is not even an issue in this case.

         The subject of the appeal proceedings is rather that of the
         Prohibition issued by the appellant regarding the appeal

         Processing of data. The data to be collected itself is also set out in Section 25

         Paragraph 1 AMSG is listed in detail so that there is no doubt about it
         There is predictability about the type of data to be collected.

68 If the appeal further refers to this, it follows from

         Processing may be necessary for the performance of a public task

         It is not clear that the content should be determined in more detail.
         Art. 6 Para. 3 GDPR, on the other hand, expressly speaks of the need for one

         Legal basis from which the purpose of the processing can be derived

         data processing must be attributed. In this respect, the revision in this

         these in turn refer to the statements under point 5.2. to refer to what

         this legal provision does not apply in each case.

69 This is used by the revision as a yardstick for the sufficient specification of a

         The judgment of the ECJ is not relevant because it violates the principle of

         Data minimization is treated in accordance with Art. 5 lit. c GDPR. On this
         The appellant's decision was not supported in principle.

70 The appeal must be agreed that when processing special data

         In this context, criticizes the reasoning of the BVwG, according to which a

         Review of Section 25 Paragraph 10 AMSG to ensure compliance with the requirements

         necessary data security measures did not have to be taken,
         because this is not the subject of the review by the appeal applicant

         has been.

71 However, even if this view of the BVwG were not correct, the appeal

         does not show to what extent the guarantees for data security in this case

         Case - different from that under 5.3.2.1. shown

         assessment - would be inadequate. So nothing comes of the appeal applicant
         brought forward, which would lead to the assumption that with the

         Disclosure of health data in accordance with Section 25 Paragraph 8 AMSG

         5.4. On the question of the existence of an automated decision within the meaning of

         Art. 22 Para. 1 GDPR

72 The appeal repeatedly points out that the BVwG has the character of

         Profiling is not taken into account as a special processing procedure. It will happen
         from Recital 41, second sentence of the GDPR, that from the

         The legal basis itself must be clearly visible and predictable

         Data processing is carried out. The job seekers also ran
         There is a risk that AMAS' assumptions will be changed without further processing

         could be taken over.

73 With this argument, the appeal concerns the legality of the

         processing that is the subject of the proceedings against the background of
         Art. 22 GDPR.

         regarding the interpretation of Article 22 Para. 1 GDPR as follows:

         “40 With its first question, the referring court essentially wants:
         know whether Article 22 Para. 1 GDPR is to be interpreted as meaning that a
         “automated decision in individual cases” within the meaning of this provision
         exists if a claim is based on personal data about a person

Third party to whom this probability value is transmitted
The contractual relationship with this person is established, executed or terminated.

41 To answer this question, it should first be noted that:
the interpretation of a provision of Union law not only its wording,
but also the context in which it stands, as well as the purposes and
objectives pursued by the legal act to which it is a part
must be taken into account (judgment of June 22, 2023, Pankki S, C‑579/21,
EU:C:2023:501, paragraph 38 and the case law cited therein).

42 As far as the wording of Article 22 Para. 1 GDPR is concerned, this is what it looks like
Provision stipulates that a data subject has the right, not one
solely based on automated processing - including

Profiling - to be subjected to decision based on it
has legal effect or is similarly significant
impaired.

43 The applicability of this provision therefore depends on three cumulative factors
prerequisites, namely that, firstly, a 'decision'
must be available, secondly, this decision 'exclusively on one
automated processing, including profiling, must be based on and
thirdly, they have ‘legal effect vis-à-vis \[the person concerned\]’
or must affect it ‘in a similar significant way’.

44 As regards, first, the requirement for the existence of a decision,
It should be noted that the term 'decision' within the meaning of Article 22
Paragraph 1 GDPR is not defined in this regulation. Already from the

However, the wording of this provision shows that this term does not apply
only refers to actions that have legal effect on the person concerned
person develop, but also on actions that this person is similar to

45 The broad meaning of the term 'decision' is defined by the
Recital 71 of the GDPR confirms that a decision on
Assessment of personal aspects that affect a person, 'a measure

47 Secondly, as regards the requirement that the decision in the sense
of Art. 22 Para. 1 GDPR 'exclusively on an automated basis
Processing, - including profiling - \[must be based\]', it says
Advocate General stated in point 33 of his Opinion that one
Activity like that of SCHUFA in the definition of 'profiling'

Art. 4 No. 4 GDPR corresponds and that this requirement is therefore in place
present case is fulfilled; the wording of the first question refers
Furthermore, we expressly refer to the automated creation of one
personal data about a person based probability value
regarding their ability to service a loan in the future.

48 Thirdly, as regards the requirement that the decision against
the data subject has 'legal effect' or it has 'a similar effect'
The content of the document must have a significant impact on it
first question that the actions of the third party, the

Probability value is transmitted, 'relevant' from this value
is directed. According to the facts of the case submitted by the presenter
Court in a case addressed to a bank by a consumer
Loan application has an insufficient probability value in almost all
In some cases, the bank may refuse to grant the requested loan.

49 Consequently, it can be assumed that the third requirement, of which
the application of Art. 22 Para. 1 GDPR depends, is fulfilled because a
Probability value like that at issue in the main proceedings
affected person is at least significantly impaired.

50 Therefore, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, in which
that determined by a credit reporting agency and reported to a bank
Probability value plays a significant role in granting a
Credit plays, the determination of this value as such is a decision

to be classified as a person within the meaning of Article 22 Paragraph 1 GDPR

significantly impaired'.

51 This interpretation is influenced by the context in which Article 22
Paragraph 1 GDPR stands, as well as the purposes and objectives associated with it

         73 In view of the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that Article 22

75 5.4.2. From the reasons for the judgment given above
         of the ECJ it can be concluded that the application of an automated

         Processing - such as AMAS - as such already constitutes a decision
         of Art. 22 Para. 1 GDPR can represent, without justification

         legal basis within the meaning of Article 22 Paragraph 2 Letter b GDPR - the

         legitimate interests of the data subject (cf. the
         Statements by the ECJ in C-634/21, paragraph 65).

76 According to the statements in the ECJ judgment cited, one
         Automated data processing - such as profiling - itself an “automated

         Decision in individual cases” within the meaning of Article 22 Paragraph 1 GDPR if
         the result of this automated processing for a

         certain - further - decision is decisive insofar as the action

         of the third party is “significantly guided” by the profiling in question, and so on
         significantly affects those affected (cf. the statements of the ECJ in

         C-634/21, paragraphs 48 and 73).

78 5.4.3.1. First of all, it should be noted that the classification of the
         mP applied automated, based on a mathematical-statistical

         program processing of personal data
         affected job seekers (in AMAS) as “profiling” in the sense

         of Art. 4 Z 4 GDPR in accordance with the case law of the ECJ

         This is a fundamentally forbidden decision (cf. again

         would take over, may now justify the assumption that

         one of the exceptions mentioned in Article 22 Paragraph 2 GDPR is applicable and

         the special requirements of Article 22 Paragraphs 3 and 4 GDPR are met.

83 Art. 22 Paragraph 2 Letter b GDPR contains an opening clause that allows the Union
