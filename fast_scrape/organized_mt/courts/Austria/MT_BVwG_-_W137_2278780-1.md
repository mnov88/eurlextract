## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject was a department head at the Department of Education (the controller).

On 20 January 2022, the data subject sent an access request under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") to the controller regarding his stored personal data. On 25 May 2022, the data subject sent another request.

At the same time, two proceedings were pending before the Labour and Social Court (“_Arbeits- und Sozialgericht_”) between the data subject and the controller.

On 30 June 2022 and 17 August 2023, the controller responded to the request and provided the data subject with information. This included a total of 187 documents relating to the data subject and his personal file. However, the controller refused to provide information to certain emails and statements, claiming it relied on overriding confidentiality interests, which would outweigh the data subject’s interest in receiving this information. As there were labour and social court proceedings pending, these emails and statements were part of these proceedings. Providing this information would therefore mean a deterioration of the controller’s litigation position.

On 27 September 2022, the data subject lodged a complaint at the Austrian DPA (“_Datenschutzbehörde - DSB_”) against the controller for violating their right of access under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"). According to the data subject, the controller provided the data subject with incomplete information. The data subject argued that he was still missing the following documents: the extensive volume of written complaints against the data subject at the controller’s personnel department, the written requests for dismissal from the data subject’s function as appointed department head, statements on the data subject to the controller and other relevant files.

The DPA rejected the complaint, because there were no indications that the information provided by the controller was incomplete. The DPA also held that the controller was cooperative throughout the proceedings and had been able to demonstrate in a comprehensible manner that no data existed regarding the other information the data subject requested. Apart from the data subject's mere speculation, they had not provided any substantiated evidence of incomplete information.

The data subject appealed this decision at the Federal Administrative Court (“_Bundesverwaltungsgericht – BVwG_”), arguing that the controller had not yet provided the data subject with complete information regarding his processed data. The claim that the requested data no longer existed was incorrect, because it was suddenly introduced as evidence in the labour court proceedings by the controller in 2022 and 2023. According to various statements in these proceedings, there were also other files that still needed to be given to the data subject. The data subject also rejected the claim that certain information could not be shared due to the ongoing labour court proceedings, as this legal view of the controller overlooks the principle of immediacy in personnel matters under labour law.

### Holding

The court agreed with the controller that it had a confidentiality interest. As the data subject was provided with extensive information and that the controller’s refusal to provide information was only limited to the emails and statements, the court held that requesting access to strengthen the data subject's case goes beyond the protective purpose of this right. Thus, the controller’s legitimate interest in confidentiality outweighed the interests of the data subject.

The court further held that the physical folders requested by the data subject are exclusively physical files located in the controller’s office. The court thus agreed with the DPA’s reasoning that these physical files did not qualify as a filing system.

With regard to the other information that the data subject claimed the controller had about them, the court found that these documents or files do not exist at all. By providing a negative answer to the data subject, the controller also complied in this regard with the access request.

The court therefore held that the controller was justified to withhold certain information and thus the controller did comply with the the data subject's access request. The data subject’s right of access was thus not violated.

In this decision, the data protection authority essentially made the following findings of fact:

The complainant was the head of department at XXXX and thus an employee of the co-involved party. The complainant was the head of department at Roman 40 and thus an employee of the co-involved party.

On January 20, 2022, the complainant sent a request for information regarding his stored personal data to the co-involved party.

In a letter dated May 25, 2022, the complainant submitted a further request to the co-involved party for the release of his personal information in accordance with the GDPR.

In letters dated June 30, 2022 and August 17, 2023, the co-participating party sent the complainant a total of 187 documents concerning him as well as parts I to III of his personnel file. In letters dated June 30, 2022 and August 17, 2023, the co-participating party sent the complainant a total of 187 documents concerning him as well as parts Roman I to Roman III of his personnel file.

In addition to the copies sent by the co-participating party, the co-participating party only has a "meter-long" row of file folders in the office, which contain all documents (briefs, documents, etc.) relating to the ongoing legal proceedings, No. 34 Cga 42/18el.

On the basis of these findings of fact, the data protection authority concluded the following in legal terms:

According to Article 15, paragraph 3, GDPR, the controller must provide a copy of the personal data that are the subject of the processing. According to Article 15, paragraph 3, GDPR, the controller must provide a copy of the personal data that are the subject of the processing.

The co-involved party had already sent the complainant copies of numerous documents. Accordingly, it was subsequently necessary to check whether the copies sent by the co-involved party were incomplete in these points.

a) “meter-long row” of file folders

In principle, data copies outside the personnel file would also have to be disclosed. However, as can be seen from the findings, the file folders requested by the complainant are exclusively physical file folders that are located in the co-involved party’s office. With regard to data stored in paper files, the Supreme Court, like the highest courts under public law, assumes that paper files, due to their structure, cannot be qualified as files within the meaning of Section 4, Item 6, DSG 2000. In principle, data copies outside the personnel file must also be disclosed. However, as can be seen from the findings, the file folders requested by the complainant are exclusively physical file folders located in the office of the party involved. With regard to data stored in paper files, the Supreme Court, like the highest courts under public law, assumes that paper files, due to their structure, cannot be qualified as files within the meaning of Section 4, Item 6, DSG 2000.

Furthermore, the right to information under Art. 15 Para. 3 GDPR is restricted by Art. 15 Para. 4 GDPR. The right to receive a copy of the data must not affect the rights and freedoms of other persons. The refusal to provide a copy of the data would therefore be justified if the confidentiality interests of the co-participating party or third parties outweighed the complainant's interest in information. As can be seen from the findings, civil proceedings are currently pending and the co-participating party must be granted an interest in keeping any evidence confidential, especially since this would worsen their position in the proceedings. A copy of the file is therefore not covered by the right to information. Furthermore, the right to information under Article 15, Paragraph 3, GDPR is restricted by Article 15, Paragraph 4, GDPR. The right to receive a copy of the data must not affect the rights and freedoms of other persons. The refusal to provide a copy of the data would therefore be justified if the confidentiality interests of the co-participating party or third parties outweighed the complainant's interest in information. As can be seen from the findings, civil proceedings are currently pending and the party involved has an interest in keeping any evidence confidential, especially since this would result in a deterioration in their position in the case. A copy of the file is therefore not covered by the right to information.

c) File note "AV XXXX employment" c) File note "AV roman 40 employment"

d) Statements from Ms XXXX d) Statements from Ms roman 40

e) E-mail correspondence

f) Interview records from the Ministry of Education

The data protection authority found no indication that the information provided by the party involved was incomplete on these points. The party involved was cooperative throughout the proceedings and was able to explain in a comprehensible manner that no data was available in this regard. The complainant was also unable to provide any solid evidence of incomplete information other than his mere assumption.

10. The complainant lodged the present complaint against this decision within the deadline. In support of this, the complainant essentially stated the following:

The co-participating party had not yet provided the complainant with complete information regarding the data it processed. The claim that the data he had requested was no longer available was incorrect because it was suddenly introduced as evidence in the labor court proceedings by the bodies of the co-participating party in 2022 and 2023, the release of which he had already unsuccessfully requested from the co-participating party in 2019.

Furthermore, certain data that was to be released is no longer available to the co-participating party because the complainant's personal data was allegedly automatically deleted when XXXX retired. According to XXXX and the Ministry of Education, this data was actually processed and therefore must also be disclosed. Furthermore, certain data that was to be released to the co-participating party because the complainant's personal data was allegedly automatically deleted when roman 40 retired. According to roman 40 and the Ministry of Education, this data was actually processed and therefore must also be disclosed.

In addition, the complainant's personal data that was created by Director XXXX every 14 days and, according to her statement on December 12, 2017, was also passed on to the co-participating party and the Ministry of Education, must also be disclosed. In addition, the personal data of the complainant, which were created by the director Roman 40 at 14-day intervals and, according to her statement on December 12, 2017, were also handed over to the other party involved and the Ministry of Education, must also be released.

Finally, the view that the data in question should be released because of the alleged secrecy in the labor court proceedings is legally untenable, because this legal view of the other party involved overlooks the labor law principle of immediacy in personnel matters.

11. The authority concerned submitted the complaint to the adjudicating court, attaching the administrative act, with a written submission dated September 28, 2023, received on September 29, 2023, and requested that the complaint be dismissed.

10. All of the Ministry of Education's interview records available to the respondent with my personal information in the respondent's "Attachment\_2\_Information\_from\_09.05.2022.pdf" have not been released."

1.4. At least one case under No. 33 Cga 24/20b is pending before the Labor and Social Court between the complainant and the co-participating party.

1.5. The complainant's request for information was answered by the co-participating party with comprehensive letters dated June 30, 2022 and August 17, 2023 (a total of 187 documents concerning the complainant as well as parts I to III of his personnel file). 1.5. The complainant's request for information was answered by the co-participating party with comprehensive letters dated June 30, 2022 and August 17, 2023 (a total of 187 documents concerning the complainant as well as parts Roman I to Roman III of his personnel file).

This information turns out to be complete.

2. Assessment of evidence:

The findings on the relevant facts arise from the administrative act, the complaint and the court file.

2.1. The fact that the complainant was once an employee of the co-participating party is based on the consistent statements of the complainant and the co-participating party.

2.2. The findings on the request for information to the co-participating party arise from the administrative act, in particular from the requests for information dated January 20, 2022 and May 25, 2022.

2.3. The information considered incomplete by the complainant and specifically requested from the co-participating party can be seen in the letter dated December 14, 2022.

2.4. The fact that at least one case is pending before the Labor and Social Court between the complainant and the co-participating party follows from the administrative act and is undisputed.

2.5. The finding that the co-participating party has (now) provided the complainant with complete information follows from the letters from the co-participating party dated June 30, 2022 and August 17, 2023 sent to the complainant, but in particular from the fact that the co-participating party has consistently been cooperative with both the complainant and the authorities in the present proceedings and has endeavored to provide information that is as detailed as possible and complies with the requirements of the GDPR.

To the extent that the complainant believes, in connection with the interview of XXXX dated December 13, 2017, presented in the complaint, that a written request from the person named on December 12, 2013 exists, it must be countered that there is no evidence of the existence of such a letter. In this regard, the co-participating party has credibly argued that a written request from XXXX dated December 13, 2017 is not stored with them and, in the opinion of the Federal Administrative Court, there is also no reasonable reason for them to withhold individual documents from the complainant. To the extent that the complainant believes, in connection with the interview of Roman 40 dated December 13, 2017, presented in the complaint, that a written request from the person named on December 12, 2013 exists, it must be countered that there is no evidence of the existence of such a letter. In this regard, the co-participating party has credibly argued that a written request from Roman 40 dated December 13, 2017 is not stored with them and, in the opinion of the Federal Administrative Court, there is no reasonable reason for them to withhold individual documents from the complainant.

The same applies to the other information requested (file note "AV XXXX employment", statement from XXXX, email correspondence, interview records from the Ministry of Education). With regard to the other information requested, the complainant merely states in general terms that these documents or data must be available to the co-participating party. These are merely allegations by the complainant without any concrete evidence that these documents actually exist. Therefore, the co-involved party's argument that the documents do not exist at all was to be followed on this point as well. The same applies to the other information requested (file note "AV roman 40 employment", statement from roman 40, e-mail correspondence, interrogation records from the Ministry of Education). With regard to the other information requested, the complainant merely makes a general statement that these documents or data must be available to the co-involved party. These are only allegations by the complainant without any concrete evidence that these documents actually exist. Therefore, the co-involved party's argument that the documents do not exist at all was to be followed on this point as well.

The data protection authority has carried out a comprehensive investigation in this context, and in the meantime (in March 2023) it has also been established that the information was not complete. This was subsequently added by the co-involved party. The data protection authority could no longer understand the subsequent alleged incompleteness of the information and has also provided a convincing justification for this.

There are no (new) convincing arguments in the complaint that indicate that the information is still incomplete. In essence, the complainant is only repeating his allegations to the authority.

Basic right to data protection

§ 1. (1) Everyone has the right to keep personal data concerning him or her confidential, in particular with regard to the respect for his or her private and family life, provided that there is a legitimate interest in doing so.

The existence of such an interest is excluded if data is not accessible to a claim of confidentiality due to its general availability or because it cannot be traced back to the person concerned.

(2) To the extent that the use of personal data is not in the vital interest of the data subject or with his consent, restrictions on the right to confidentiality are only permissible to protect the overriding legitimate interests of another person, and in the case of interventions by a state authority only on the basis of laws that are necessary for the reasons set out in Article 8 paragraph 2 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), Federal Law Gazette No. 210/1958. Such laws may only provide for the use of data which, by their nature, are particularly worthy of protection to protect important public interests and must at the same time establish appropriate guarantees for the protection of the data subject's interests in confidentiality.

2. as far as this is reasonable, the designation of the legal entity or body to which the alleged violation of law is attributed (respondent),

3. the facts from which the violation of law is derived,

4. the reasons on which the allegation of illegality is based,

5. the request to establish the alleged violation of law and

6. the information required to assess whether the complaint was submitted in time.

(5) If a complaint proves to be justified, it must be acted upon. If a violation is attributable to a person responsible in the private sector, he must be instructed to comply with the complainant's requests for information, correction, deletion, restriction or data transfer to the extent necessary to eliminate the violation of law identified. If the complaint proves to be unjustified, it must be rejected.

(6) Until the proceedings before the data protection authority have been concluded, a respondent can subsequently eliminate the alleged violation of law by complying with the complainant's requests. If the data protection authority considers the complaint to be irrelevant in this respect, it must hear the complainant on the matter. At the same time, the complainant must be informed that the data protection authority will discontinue the proceedings without formal notice if the complainant does not provide reasons within a reasonable period of time as to why the complainant still considers the originally alleged violation of law to have not been eliminated, at least in part. If such a statement by the complainant changes the nature of the matter (Section 13, Paragraph 8 AVG), it is assumed that the original complaint has been withdrawn and a new complaint has been lodged at the same time. In this case too, the original complaint procedure must be discontinued informally and the complainant must be informed of this. Late statements are not to be taken into account.(6) A respondent can subsequently remedy the alleged violation of law by complying with the complainant's requests until the proceedings before the data protection authority have been concluded.

As can be seen from Article 15 Paragraph 1 GDPR, every data subject has the right to request confirmation from the controller as to whether personal data concerning them are being processed. If this is the case, they have a right to information about this personal data. In addition, the information specified in Article 15 Paragraph 1 Letters a - h or Paragraph 2 GDPR must be provided. As can be seen from Article 15, Paragraph 1, GDPR, every data subject has the right to request confirmation from the controller as to whether personal data concerning them are being processed. If this is the case, they have a right to information about this personal data. In addition, the information specified in Article 15, Paragraph 1, Letters a - h or Paragraph 2, GDPR must be provided.

The information should enable the data subject to be aware of the processing of his or her personal data and to be able to check its legality (see Recital 63 of the GDPR). The information must comply with the transparency requirement of Art. 12 Para. 1 of the GDPR, which requires that information intended for the data subject is precise, easily accessible and understandable and written in clear and simple language (Recital 58 of the GDPR; see also Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Art. 15 GDPR Rz 33). The information should enable the data subject to be aware of the processing of his or her personal data and to be able to check its legality (see Recital 63 of the GDPR). The information must comply with the transparency requirement of Article 12, paragraph 1, GDPR, which requires that information intended for the data subject is precise, easily accessible and understandable and written in clear and plain language (Recital 58 of the GDPR; see also Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Article 15, GDPR para. 33).

According to Article 15(3) GDPR, the controller must provide a copy of the personal data that are the subject of the processing. According to Article 15(3) GDPR, the controller must provide a copy of the personal data that are the subject of the processing.

According to the case law of the European Court of Justice and the Administrative Court, Article 15(3) GDPR does not establish an independent right to receive a copy of the data alongside the right to information under Article 15 GDPR. Rather, Article 15(3) sentence 1 GDPR is to be interpreted as meaning that the right to receive a copy of the personal data that are the subject of the processing under Article 15 from the controller means that the data subject is provided with a faithful and intelligible reproduction of all of this data. This right may also include the right to receive a copy of extracts from documents or even entire documents or extracts from databases that, among other things, contain personal data. containing these data, if the provision of such a copy is essential to enable the data subject to effectively exercise the rights conferred on him or her by this Regulation, taking into account the rights and freedoms of others (see the case law of the ECJ 04.05.2023, C-487/21 and the VwGH, 03.08.2023, Ro 2020/04/0035 cited by the authority concerned). According to the case law of the European Court of Justice and the Administrative Court, Article 15, paragraph 3, GDPR does not establish an independent right to receive a copy of the data in addition to the right to information under Article 15, GDPR. Rather, Article 15, paragraph 3, sentence 1 of the GDPR is to be interpreted as meaning that the right to obtain from the controller a copy of the personal data that are the subject of processing pursuant to Article 15 means that the data subject is provided with a faithful and intelligible reproduction of all of these data. This right may also include the right to obtain a copy of extracts from documents or even of entire documents or extracts from databases containing, among other things, this data, if the provision of such a copy is essential to enable the data subject to effectively exercise the rights conferred on him or her by this Regulation, taking into account the rights and freedoms of others (see the case law of the ECJ 04.05.2023, C-487/21 and of the VwGH, 03.08.2023, Ro 2020/04/0035 cited by the authority concerned).

According to Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the GDPR, the right to receive a copy pursuant to Paragraph 1b must not affect the rights and freedoms of other persons. According to Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the GDPR, the right to receive a copy pursuant to Paragraph 1b must not affect the rights and freedoms of other persons.

According to Recital 63 of the GDPR, the exception under Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the GDPR is intended to protect trade secrets and intellectual property rights, in particular copyright in software. However, it can be assumed that in principle all rights and freedoms recognized by Union or MS law will be relevant. If the controller had to provide information on an email in which other persons whose interests are to be ranked higher are also named, these documents are not covered by the right to information (cf. Haidinger in Knyrim, DatKomm Art. 15 GDPR \[as of 1 October 2018, rdb.at\] para. 49). According to Recital 63 of the GDPR, the exception under Article 15, paragraph 4, GDPR is intended to protect trade secrets and intellectual property rights, in particular copyright in software. However, it can be assumed that in principle all rights and freedoms recognised by Union or MS law will be relevant. If the responsible party had to provide information on an email in which other persons are also named whose interests are to be ranked higher, these documents are not covered by the right to information (cf. Haidinger in Knyrim, DatKomm Article 15, GDPR \[as of October 1, 2018, rdb.at\] margin number 49).

Article 15, paragraph 4 of the GDPR stipulates that the right to receive a copy "according to paragraph 3" must not affect the rights and freedoms of other persons. At first glance, this explicit reference to the right to a copy in paragraph 3 seems to contradict the system developed so far, because according to the wording it only refers to the right to a copy and not to the right to information on the content in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 1. However, this contradiction is resolved if one considers the right to a copy as a more detailed provision regarding the manner in which information about the personal data of the data subject is to be provided in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 1. Then the obligation to weigh up interests relates to the entire provision of information (see Jahnel, Commentary on the GDPR, Art. 15, Rz 42). Article 15, Paragraph 4, GDPR stipulates that the right to receive a copy "according to Paragraph 3" must not affect the rights and freedoms of other persons. This explicit reference to the right to a copy in Paragraph 3 seems at first glance to contradict the system developed so far, because according to the wording it only refers to the right to a copy and not to the right to information on the content in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 1. This contradiction is resolved, however, if the right to a copy is viewed as a more detailed provision regarding the manner in which information on the personal data of the data subject is to be provided in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph . Then the obligation to weigh up interests relates to the entire provision of information (see Jahnel, Commentary on the GDPR, Article 15, Rz 42).

According to the provision of Section 4 Paragraph 6 of the Data Protection Act (issued on the basis of the opening clause of Article 23 of the GDPR), the right to information from a controller does not “as a rule” exist, without prejudice to other statutory restrictions, if the provision of information would endanger a business or trade secret of the controller or a third party. From the insertion "as a rule" it can be concluded that no absolute right of refusal has been created here, but that it will have to be carefully considered to what extent the provision of information actually affects this right (cf. Haidinger in Knyrim, DatKomm Art. 15 GDPR \[as of 1 October 2018, rdb.at\] paras. 50 - 51). According to the provision of paragraph 4, section 6 of the Data Protection Act (issued on the basis of the opening clause of Article 23 of the GDPR), the right to information from a controller does not "as a rule" exist, without prejudice to other legal restrictions, if the provision of the information would endanger a business or trade secret of the controller or a third party. From the insertion "as a rule" it can be concluded that no absolute right of refusal has been created here, but that it will have to be carefully considered to what extent the provision of information actually affects this right (cf. Haidinger in Knyrim, DatKomm Article 15, GDPR \[as of October 1, 2018, rdb.at\] paras. 50 - 51).

It should be noted that in his data protection complaint of September 27, 2022, which is the basis for the contested decision, the complainant submitted a violation of the right to receive complete information to the authority concerned. In doing so, he relied overall on the provision of Article 15 GDPR. It should be noted that in his data protection complaint of September 27, 2022, which is the basis for the contested decision, the complainant submitted a violation of the right to receive complete information to the authority concerned. In doing so, he relied overall on the provision of Article 15 GDPR.

The co-participating party based its refusal to provide information regarding the files essentially on overriding interests in confidentiality, which outweighed the complainant's interest in information. It argued that two labor and social court proceedings were pending against the complainant, with any email histories and statements being part of these proceedings (it is undisputed that at least one of the proceedings is still pending). Since this is precisely a contentious issue in pending civil proceedings, providing information would mean a deterioration in the procedural position of the co-participating party.

In the opinion of the Federal Administrative Court, the co-participating party thus also has a legitimate interest in confidentiality (see, for example, BVwG 22.02.2017, W214 2132040-1/15E), although it cannot be determined from the complaint to what extent the complainant's interest in the disclosure outweighs the co-participating party's interest in confidentiality. In addition, given that the complainant was provided with extensive data stored by the co-participating party (a total of 187 documents concerning the complainant as well as parts I to III of his personnel file) and that the refusal to provide information was limited to the email histories and statements in question, it must be concluded that obtaining information from the complainant that would strengthen the case goes beyond the protective purpose of the norm and that in the present case the co-participating party's interest in keeping the aforementioned email histories and statements confidential outweighs the complainant's interest.

In addition, given that the complainant was provided with extensive data stored by the co-participating party (a total of 187 documents concerning the complainant as well as parts Roman I to Roman III of his personnel file) and that the refusal to provide information was limited to the email histories and statements in question, it must be concluded that obtaining information from the complainant that would strengthen the case goes beyond the protective purpose of the norm and that in the present case the co-participating party's interest in keeping the aforementioned email histories and statements confidential outweighs the complainant's interest.

It should also be noted that the file folders requested by the complainant are exclusively physical file folders located in the office of the co-participating party. In this regard, the argument of the authority concerned that, with regard to data stored in paper files, the Supreme Court and the highest courts under public law would assume that paper files, due to their structure, cannot be classified as files within the meaning of Section 4 No. 6 DSG 2000 (cf. VfGH B 1187/2013 mwN; VwSlg 16.477 A/2004; cf. also Jahnel, Datenschutzrecht \[2010\] Rz 3/101) should be followed.

3.3.4. Written request of XXXX , file note "AV XXXX Employment", statement from XXXX , email correspondence, interview records of the Ministry of Education3.3.4. Written request from roman 40, memo “AV roman 40 employment”, statement from roman 40, email correspondence, interview records from the Ministry of Education

With regard to the written request from XXXX of December 12, 2023 specifically requested by the complainant in the letter of December 14, 2022, the memo “AV XXXX employment” of September 21, 2017, the statement from XXXX of February 8, 2023 and February 9, 2023, any email correspondence and interview records from the Ministry of Education, the Federal Administrative Court assumes - as the authority concerned argues in the decision and explained in more detail above in the assessment of evidence - that these documents or files do not even exist. In this regard, the co-participating party had explained to the complainant that these documents were not stored by them and thus provided (negative) information in this regard. The fact that XXXX spoke in a 2017 protocol of having "reported" every 14 days in 2014 does not contradict this finding. With regard to the written request from roman 40 dated December 12, 2023, specifically requested by the complainant in the letter dated December 14, 2022, the file note "AV roman 40 employment" dated September 21, 2017, the statement from roman 40 dated February 8, 2023 and February 9, 2023, any email correspondence and interrogation records from the Ministry of Education, the Federal Administrative Court assumes - as the authority concerned argues in the decision and explained in more detail above in the assessment of evidence - that these documents or files do not even exist. The co-involved party had explained to the complainant that these documents were not stored by them and thus provided (negative) information in this regard. The fact that Roman 40 said in a 2017 report that they had "reported" every 14 days in 2014 does not contradict this finding.

3.4. Final assessment

The responsible Senate therefore comes to the conclusion that the complainant was given complete information by the co-involved party in the present case. The complainant's right to information was therefore not violated.

Since the contested decision is not illegal within the meaning of Article 130, paragraph 1, item 1 of the Federal Constitutional Court Act (B-VG) for these reasons, the appeal against it was to be dismissed in accordance with Section 28, paragraph 2 of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG) in conjunction with Section 24, paragraph 1 and paragraph 5 of the Data Protection Act (DSG).Since the contested decision is not illegal within the meaning of Article 130, paragraph 1, item 1 of the Federal Constitutional Court Act (B-VG) for these reasons, the appeal against it was to be dismissed in accordance with Section 28, paragraph 2 of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG) in conjunction with Section 24, paragraph 1 and paragraph 5 of the Data Protection Act (DSG).

3.5. Cancellation of the oral hearing

According to Section 24, Paragraph 1 of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court must hold a public oral hearing upon request or, if it considers this necessary, of its own motion.According to Paragraph 24, Paragraph 1 of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court must hold a public oral hearing upon request or, if it considers this necessary, of its own motion.

The complainant has requested such a hearing and has also requested the summons of a total of twelve people, although it is not specifically stated which witness should be heard on which evidence (specific request for information). The people are the complainant's former director, six employees of the Education Directorate XXXX and five employees of the Federal Ministry of Education - thus obviously people who were involved in some way in the processing of the complainant's data in the context of his service and the proceedings resulting from this. In some cases, their specific involvement/function is also explained in the complainant's submissions. The complainant has requested such a hearing and has also requested that a total of twelve people be summoned, although it is not specifically stated which witness should be heard on which evidence topic (specific request for information). The persons are the complainant's former director, six employees of the Roman 40 Education Directorate and five employees of the Federal Ministry of Education - thus obviously persons who were involved in some way in the processing of the complainant's data in the context of his service and the proceedings resulting from this. In some cases, their specific involvement/function is also explained in the complainant's submissions.

According to Section 24, Paragraph 4 of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court can - unless otherwise provided by federal or state law - refrain from holding a hearing regardless of a party's application if the files show that the oral discussion is unlikely to provide any further clarification of the legal matter, and neither Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the ECHR nor Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights preclude the omission of the hearing.According to Section 24, Paragraph 4 of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court can - unless otherwise provided by federal or state law - refrain from holding a hearing regardless of a party's application if the files show that the oral discussion is unlikely to provide any further clarification of the legal matter, and neither Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the ECHR nor Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights preclude the omission of the hearing.

In the present case, the waiver of an oral hearing can in any case be based on the fact that the facts of the case were clarified from the files. The requested witnesses have already participated extensively and cooperatively in the first instance proceedings (which has already been acknowledged by the data protection authority). The Federal Administrative Court had to rule exclusively on a legal issue (cf. ECHR 20.06.2013, Appl. No. 24510/06, Abdulgadirov/AZE, para. 34ff). According to the case law of the Constitutional Court, an oral hearing can also be omitted if the facts are undisputed and the legal issue is not particularly complex (VfSlg. 17.597/2005; VfSlg. 17.855/2006; most recently VfGH 18.06.2012, B 155/12).

It was therefore not necessary to hold an oral hearing in accordance with Section 24, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 4 of the Administrative Court Act. It was therefore not necessary to hold an oral hearing in accordance with Section 24, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 4 of the Administrative Court Act.

Regarding B) Inadmissibility of the appeal:

According to Section 25a, Paragraph 1 of the Administrative Court Act, the administrative court must state in its ruling or decision whether the appeal is admissible in accordance with Article 133, Paragraph 4 of the Administrative Court Act. The ruling must be briefly justified. According to Section 25a, Paragraph 1 of the Administrative Court Act, the administrative court must state in its ruling or decision whether the appeal is admissible in accordance with Article 133, Paragraph 4 of the Administrative Court Act. The ruling must be briefly justified.

The appeal is not admissible in accordance with Article 133, Paragraph 4 of the Administrative Court Act because the decision does not depend on the solution of a legal question of fundamental importance. The decision in question does not deviate from the previous case law of the Administrative Court, nor is there a lack of case law; furthermore, the current case law of the Administrative Court cannot be judged as inconsistent. There are also no other indications of a fundamental importance of the legal question to be resolved.
