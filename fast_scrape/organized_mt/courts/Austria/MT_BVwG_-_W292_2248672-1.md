## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject wanted to enter into an energy supply contract with an energy supplier in 2020, but received a letter back on 1 October 2020 from the energy supplier that this was not possible due to an insufficient credit rating. This credit check was done by a credit reference agency (the controller).

On 7 October 2020, the data subject submitted an access request under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") to the controller.

On 8 October 2020, the controller provided the data subject with the personal data it had of the data subject, including their name and address. It also stated that the energy supplier had made a credit inquiry to the controller about the data subject on 1 October 2020.

On 7 January 2021, the data subject requested the controller to properly comply with its obligation to provide access.

On 13 January 2021, the controller replied that there was no right to access under [Article 15(1)(h) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1h "Article 15 GDPR") with regard to the calculation of credit scores and the parameters and methods that were used to calculate a risk value as those were seen as business secrets of the controller.

On 17 March 2021, the data subject lodged a complaint against the controller at the Austrian DPA (“_Datenschutzbehörde -DSB_“).

The controller argued in the proceeding that there was no automated decision-making within the meaning of [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR") and that there was therefore no right of access under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"). It furthermore argued that it calculated the credit score on the basis of the parameters “qualified payment defaults (debt collection entries, insolvency, etc.) age, and place of residence”. Regarding the data subject, the controller sent a “medium” credit score to the energy supplier. No negative payment history data was available in the controller’s system to determine the creditworthiness score of the data subject. The controller stated it collected data from publicly available sources, data from address publishers and information on payment experience provided by corporate customers and debt collection partners.

The DPA upheld the complaint and found that the controller violated [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), [Article 13(2)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#2f "Article 13 GDPR"), [Article 14(2)(g) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR#2g "Article 14 GDPR"). [Article 15(1)(h) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1h "Article 15 GDPR") and [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR"). The DPA further ordered the controller to comply with the access request of the data subject within eight weeks.

The controller appealed the DPA’s decision at the Federal Administrative Court (“_Bundesverwaltungsgericht - BVwG_“).

### Holding

Complaint based on the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency

The court dismissed the controller’s argument that a violation of [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR") could not be made the subject of a complaint under [Section 24 of the Austrian data protection law](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/NormDokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10001597&FassungVom=2022-03-21&Artikel=2&Paragraf=24&Anlage=&Uebergangsrecht=) ("_DSG_") and [Article 77 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_77_GDPR "Article 77 GDPR"). The court took into account the CJEU judgement ([C-33/22](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C-33/22_-_%C3%96sterreichische_Datenschutzbeh%C3%B6rde "CJEU - C-33/22 - Österreichische Datenschutzbehörde")), which states clearly that a complaint under [Article 77(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_77_GDPR#1 "Article 77 GDPR") does not need to be based on a violation of rights, but on a violation of data processing in the GDPR.

Automated decision-making

On whether assessing the data subject’s creditworthiness falls under automated decision-making under [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR"), the court took into account the CJEU judgement [C-634/21 OQ / Land Hessen](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A62021CJ0634). The CJEU held that “the automated establishment, by a credit information agency, of a probability value based on personal data relating to a person and concerning his or her ability to meet payment commitments in the future constitutes ‘automated individual decision-making’ \[under [Article 22(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR#1 "Article 22 GDPR")\], where a third party, to which that probability value is transmitted, _draws strongly_ on that probability value to establish, implement or terminate a contractual relationship with that person.” (See para 73).

The court therefore dismissed the controller’s argument that it did not carry out automated decision-making under [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR"), as the probability value that the controller provided to the energy supplier was the decisive criterion in refusing to conclude a contract with the data subject. Moreover, the court held that the fact that the decision led to the data subject being able to conclude a energy supply contract was a decision that “produces legal effects concerning a data subject or similarly significantly affects a data subject” within the meaning of [Article 22(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR#1 "Article 22 GDPR").

The court dismissed the controller’s argument that it only calculated the credit score and that any further decision is made by their contractual partners, and the controller could therefore not anticipate whether a decision is solely based on the credit score they provided. The court again took into account the CJEU judgement [C-634/21 OQ / Land Hessen](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A62021CJ0634), which explicitly stated that such a restrictive interpretation would risks a circumvention of [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR"). If the calculation of the credit score is only seen as a preparatory act and not a decision, it would create a gap in legal protection.

Therefore, the court held that the controller's creation of a credit score was automated decision-making under [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR"). Moreover, the court held that no exceptions under [Article 22(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR#2 "Article 22 GDPR") applied to the controller and thus, the controller's automated processing was unlawful. The court agreed with the DPA that the controller also violated the principles of “lawfulness” and “fairness” under [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR").

The court further elaborated that the controller violated its information obligations under [Article 13(2)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#2f "Article 13 GDPR") and [Article 14(2)(g) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR#2g "Article 14 GDPR"), because it did not provide information to the data subject about the logic involved or the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject.

Access request

The court agreed with the findings of the DPA that the controller did not comply with the data subject’s access request under [Article 15(1)(h) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1h "Article 15 GDPR"). The court again took into account the CJEU judgement [C-634/21 OQ / Land Hessen](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A62021CJ0634), which held that the data subject has a right of access to the “meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject” (para 56). The court found that the data subject could not verify the lawfulness of the data processing with the information given by the controller as it did not include the specific information on the calculation of the credit score attributed to it. The court held that the information provided must be so comprehensive that the data subject can understand the reasons for the scoring value of the credit score. This court held that the term “logic involved” means the principle on which such a calculation is based and not the specific calculation formula.

The court dismissed the controller’s argument that this information was a trade secret. Although under [Section 4(6) DSG](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/NormDokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10001597&Artikel=2&Paragraf=6&Anlage=&Uebergangsrecht=), the right to information is generally excluded if it would jeopardize a business or trade secret, the court held that this was not an absolute right to refusal of information. The controller must carefully weigh up in each individual case the extent to which specific part of information would affect a business or trade secret. The data subject can still be provided with further information on how this credit score was calculated without disclosing business secrets, such as the specific calculation formula. The court agreed with the DPA that providing information on the calculation of the credit score would not result in a competitive disadvantage for the controller compared to market competitors, especially since all of them are subject to the GDPR.

Therefore, the court held that the controller violated [Article 15(1)(h) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1h "Article 15 GDPR") by not providing the data subject with sufficient information. The court thus agreed with the DPA in ordering the controller to provide the data subject with the relevant information within a deadline of eight weeks.

The court thus dismissed the controller's appeal.

Reasons for the decision:

I.       Procedure: Roman one.        Procedure:

I.1.    The co-involved party, XXXX, summarized in his data protection complaint of October 4, 2021 to the data protection authority (authority concerned) that he considered that XXXX (complainant in the administrative court proceedings) had violated his right to information under Art. 15 in conjunction with Art. 12 GDPR, his right to data accuracy under Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. d GDPR, the "transparency principle" and the principle of processing in "good faith" under Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR, his right to information under Art. 14 in conjunction with Art. 12 GDPR and his right not to be subject to automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling, under Art. 22 GDPR. Specifically, as part of its commercial activity as a credit agency, XXXX provided one of its contractual partners, XXXX, with information on the (probable) creditworthiness of the party involved in the form of a scoring value upon request. However, the information provided in this way was insufficient because the person responsible had only assigned the party involved and the person affected an "average" creditworthiness, although there was no information on the person affected that could objectively justify this. In addition, the data had been processed without the knowledge of the party involved, which is why Art. 5 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR had been violated. The complainant should also have informed the party involved in accordance with Art. 14 Para. 1 GDPR. In addition, the credit report on the person affected should be qualified as a decision in accordance with Art. 22 Para. 1 GDPR, since it can be assumed that the calculation was carried out using purely automated processing.

In addition, the data had been processed without the knowledge of the party involved, which is why Article 5, paragraph one, letter a, GDPR had been violated. The complainant should also have informed the party involved in accordance with Article 14, paragraph one, GDPR. In addition, the credit report on the person affected should be qualified as a decision in accordance with Article 22, paragraph one, GDPR, because it can be assumed that the calculation was carried out using purely automated processing.

(f) where applicable, the intention of the controller to transfer the personal data to a recipient in a third country or to an international organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or, in the case of transfers pursuant to Article 46 or Article 47 or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), a reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means to obtain a copy of them or where they are available.

(2) In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject with the following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing for the data subject:

(a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;

(b) where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party;

c) the existence of a right to obtain from the controller information about the personal data concerned, as well as to rectification or erasure or restriction of processing, and a right to object to processing, as well as a right to data portability;

d) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2), the existence of a right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing carried out on the basis of the consent until its withdrawal;

e) the existence of a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

f) the source of the personal data, and, where applicable, whether they come from publicly accessible sources;

g) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.

(3) The controller shall provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2:

(a) within a reasonable period of obtaining the personal data, taking into account the specific circumstances of the processing of the personal data, but no later than one month;

(b) where the personal data are to be used for communication with the data subject, at the latest at the time of the first communication to him or her; or,

(c) where disclosure to another recipient is intended, at the latest at the time of the first disclosure.

(4) Where the controller intends to further process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were obtained, the controller shall provide the data subject with information about that other purpose and any other relevant information referred to in paragraph 2 before such further processing.

(5) Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not apply if and to the extent that:

(a) the data subject already has the information;

(b) providing such information would prove impossible or involve disproportionate effort; this applies in particular to processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes, subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 89(1), or where the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is likely to make the achievement of the objectives of that processing impossible or seriously compromises In such cases, the controller shall take appropriate measures to protect the rights and freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject, including making such information available to the public,

c) the acquisition or disclosure is explicitly regulated by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which provides for appropriate measures to protect the legitimate interests of the data subject, or

d) the personal data are subject to a duty of professional secrecy, including a statutory obligation of secrecy, by Union or Member State law and must therefore be kept confidential.

Article 15

Right of access of the data subject

(3) The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. For any further copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on the administrative costs. Where the data subject makes the request electronically, the information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic format, unless the data subject specifies otherwise.

(4) The right to receive a copy pursuant to paragraph 1b shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.”

Article 22

Automated individual decisions, including profiling

(1) The data subject shall have the right not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her.

(2) Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the decision

(4) Decisions referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be based on special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1), unless points (a) or (g) of Article 9(2) apply and suitable measures to protect the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests have been taken.

Paragraph 152 of the Trade Regulations 1994 (GewO 1994), Federal Law Gazette I No. 111/2002, reads with the heading: Paragraph 152 of the Trade Regulations 1994 (GewO 1994), Federal Law Gazette Part One, No. 111 of 2002, reads with the heading:

"Credit reporting agencies

(1) Business operators who are authorized to operate credit reporting agencies are not authorized to provide information about private circumstances that are not related to creditworthiness.

(2) The business operators named in paragraph 1 are obliged to keep their business correspondence and business records for seven years. The seven-year period runs from the end of the calendar year in which the correspondence took place or the last entry was made in the business record. If the trade license is terminated, the correspondence and business books must be destroyed, even if the seven-year period has not yet elapsed.”(2) The traders named in paragraph one are obliged to keep their business correspondence and business books for seven years. The seven-year period runs from the end of the calendar year in which the correspondence took place or the last entry was made in the business book. If the trade license is terminated, the correspondence and business books must be destroyed, even if the seven-year period has not yet elapsed.”

II.3.1.2. In this case, the party involved (hereinafter also: “data subject”) essentially argued in its submissions to the authority concerned that the complainant (hereinafter also “data controller”) had calculated a “credit score” for her without her knowledge and subsequently forwarded this to XXXX, the controller’s contractual partner, at its request. The calculation of this "credit score" was carried out without any payment experience data on the party involved and therefore led to an incorrect result. Roman II.3.1.2. In relation to the case, the party involved (hereinafter also: "data subject") essentially argued in its submissions to the authority concerned that the complainant (hereinafter also "data controller") had calculated a "credit score" on her person without her knowledge and subsequently forwarded this to Roman XXXX, the controller's contractual partner, at its request. The calculation of this "credit score" was carried out without any payment experience data on the party involved and therefore led to an incorrect result.

II.3.1.3. As regards the violation of the principles of data processing (point 1.a) of the contested decision), it was first necessary to examine whether the complainant, as the data controller, had violated the principle of legality and the principle of processing in good faith pursuant to Art. 5, Paragraph 1, Letter a of GDPR when processing the personal data of the co-participating party as the data subject. Roman II.3.1.3. As regards the violation of the principles of data processing (point 1.a) of the contested decision), it was first necessary to examine whether the complainant, as the data controller, had violated the principle of legality and the principle of processing in good faith pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 1, Letter a of GDPR when processing the personal data of the co-participating party as the data subject.

It should be noted at this point that the argumentation of the complainant in the context of her appeal against the decision, according to which a violation of the principles of legality and data processing in good faith (Article 5, paragraph 1, letter a, GDPR) cannot be made the subject of a complaint under Section 24 of the Data Protection Act \[and Article 77 of the GDPR\], could not be followed from the point of view of the deciding Senate. It should be noted at this point that the argumentation of the complainant in the context of her appeal against the decision, according to which a violation of the principles of legality and data processing in good faith (Article 5, paragraph one, letter a, GDPR) cannot be made the subject of a complaint under Section 24 of the Data Protection Act \[and Article 77 of the GDPR\], could not be followed from the point of view of the deciding Senate.

The fact that the data protection authority could only determine a violation of subjective rights in those cases in which the person concerned explicitly relies on a right under the provisions of Chapter III "Rights of the data subject", i.e. Art. 12ff GDPR, cannot be derived from either Section 24 DSG - or from Art. 77 GDPR. In connection with Art. 77 GDPR, the data protection authority is obliged to make a decision whenever the person concerned "believes that the processing of personal data concerning him or her violates this Regulation". Contrary to the complainant's legal opinion, however, Art. 77 GDPR does not contain a restriction on the rights of the person concerned in accordance with Art. 12ff GDPR, but a person concerned can base a violation of rights on any provision of the GDPR, provided that the processing of personal data in violation of the GDPR also leads to a violation of the legal position of the person concerned (see Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Art. 77 GDPR, para. 11f). The fact that the data protection authority could only determine a violation of subjective rights in those cases in which the person concerned explicitly relies on a right under the provisions of Chapter III "Rights of the data subject", i.e. Articles 12 f, f, GDPR, cannot be derived from either Paragraph 24, DSG - or Article 77, GDPR. In connection with Article 77, GDPR, the data protection authority is obliged to make a decision whenever the person concerned "believes that the processing of personal data concerning him or her violates this regulation". Contrary to the complainant's legal opinion, however, Article 77, GDPR does not contain a restriction on the rights of the person concerned in accordance with Articles 12 f, f, GDPR, but rather a person concerned can base a violation of rights on any provision of the GDPR, provided that the processing of personal data in violation of the GDPR also leads to a violation of the legal position of the person concerned (see Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Article 77, GDPR, para. 11f).

The ECJ has also already stated that Article 77 GDPR is sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional and thus directly applicable (cf. ECJ 16.1.2024, C-33/22, Austrian Data Protection Authority, para. 62). According to its wording, Article 77 paragraph 1 GDPR does not refer to a violation of rights, but to a violation of the GDPR by the data processing. However, this does not contradict the assumption that violations of the principles of Art. 5 (1) GDPR (as in the case-specific case according to its letters a and d) can be asserted in a complaint under Art. 77 GDPR, provided that this violation concerns the processing of personal data concerning the complainant (here the co-participant) (cf. VwGH of March 6, 2024, Ro 2021/04/0030, para. 49). The ECJ has also already stated that Article 77, GDPR is sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional and thus directly applicable (cf. ECJ January 16, 2024, C-33/22, Austrian Data Protection Authority, para. 62). According to its wording, Article 77, paragraph 1, GDPR does not refer to a violation of rights, but to a violation of the GDPR in the data processing. However, this does not contradict the assumption that violations of the principles of Article 5, paragraph 1, GDPR (as in the case of the case according to its letters a and d) can be asserted in and of themselves in a complaint under Article 77, GDPR, provided that this violation concerns the processing of personal data concerning the complainant (here, therefore, the co-participant) (cf. VwGH of 06.03.2024, Ro 2021/04/0030, para. 49).

II.3.1.4. The term “profiling” is defined by the legal definition in Article 4(10) of the GDPR as “any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements”. Roman II.3.1.4. The term “profiling” is defined by the legal definition in Article 4(10) of the GDPR as “any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements”.

II.3.1.5. First of all, it should be pointed out that, according to the settled case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, any processing of personal data must comply with the principles for the processing of personal data set out in Art. 5 GDPR and, in view of the principle of lawfulness of processing provided for in Art. 5(1)(a), must meet one of the conditions for lawfulness of processing set out in Art. 6 of that regulation (see ECJ of December 7, 2023, C-634/21, para. 67 and the case law cited therein). The controller must be able to demonstrate compliance with these principles in accordance with the principle of accountability set out in Art. 5(2) GDPR (see ECJ of October 20, 2022, C-77/21, para. 24).Roman II.3.1.5. First of all, it should be pointed out that, according to the settled case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, any processing of personal data must comply with the principles for the processing of personal data set out in Article 5 of the GDPR and, in view of the principle of lawfulness of processing provided for in Article 5, paragraph one, letter a, must meet one of the conditions for the lawfulness of processing set out in Article 6 of this Regulation (see ECJ of December 7, 2023, C-634/21, para. 67 and the case law cited therein). The controller must be able to demonstrate compliance with these principles in accordance with the principle of accountability set out in Article 5, paragraph 2 of the GDPR (see ECJ of October 20, 2022, C-77/21, para. 24).

With regard to the legality of processing personal data, Article 6, paragraph 1 of the GDPR contains an exhaustive and conclusive list of six cases (for the previous provision, Article 7 of the GDPR: ECJ 24.11.2011, combined cases C-468/10 and C-469/10, ASNEF, para. 30 ff; 19.10.2016, C-582/14, Breyer, para. 57). With regard to the legality of processing personal data, Article 6, paragraph 1 of the GDPR contains an exhaustive and conclusive list of six cases (for the previous provision, Article 7 of the GDPR: ECJ 24.11.2011, combined cases C-468/10 and C-469/10, ASNEF, para. 30 ff; 19.10.2016, C-582/14, Breyer, para. 57).

In the present case, in the absence of consent from the data subject or in the absence of a corresponding contractual relationship between the parties, the only permissible basis is Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter f, GDPR - thus the exercise of a legitimate interest in data processing by the controller or a third party. In the present case, in the absence of consent from the data subject or in the absence of a corresponding contractual relationship between the parties, the only permissible basis is Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter f, GDPR - thus the exercise of a legitimate interest in data processing by the controller or a third party.

According to the consistent case law of the European Court of Justice, the processing of personal data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR is permissible under three cumulative conditions: 1. the legitimate interest pursued by the controller or the third party(s) to whom the data is transmitted, 2. the necessity of processing the personal data to achieve the legitimate interest, and 3. the fundamental rights and freedoms of the person affected by the processing do not outweigh the legitimate interest pursued (cf. ECJ, judgment of 4 May 2017, C-13/16, Rīgas satiksme, para. 28; 11 December 2019, C-708/18, TK v Asociaţia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA, para. 40; OGH 2 February 2022, 6 Ob 129/21w; 6 Ob 67/22d). According to the consistent case law of the European Court of Justice, the processing of personal data on the basis of Article 6, paragraph one, letter f, GDPR is permissible under three cumulative conditions: 1. Pursuance of a legitimate interest by the controller or the third party(s) to whom the data is transmitted, 2. Necessity of processing the personal data to achieve the legitimate interest and 3. the fundamental rights and freedoms of the person affected by the processing do not outweigh the perceived legitimate interest (cf. ECJ, judgment of 4 May 2017, C-13/16, Rīgas satiksme, para. 28; 11 December 2019, C-708/18, TK v Asociaţia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA, para. 40; OGH 02.02.2022, 6 Ob 129/21w; 6 Ob 67/22d).

II.3.1.5.1. In this context, the recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 07.12.2023, OQ / Land Hessen, C‑634/21, had to be discussed in more detail, in which the ECJ made the following findings in connection with the activities of credit reporting agencies in determining probability values for credit assessment: Roman II.3.1.5.1. In this context, the recent judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of December 7, 2023, OQ / Land Hessen, C‑634/21, had to be discussed in more detail, in which the ECJ made the following findings in connection with the activities of credit reporting agencies in determining probability values for credit assessment:

"... Article 22 paragraph 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) is to be interpreted as meaning that"... Article 22, paragraph one, of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) is to be interpreted as meaning that

an “automated individual decision” within the meaning of this provision exists if a probability value based on personal data relating to a person with regard to that person’s ability to meet future payment obligations is created automatically by a credit agency, provided that this probability value is the decisive factor in determining whether a third party to whom this probability value is transmitted establishes, implements or terminates a contractual relationship with that person.”

As the Court of Justice of the European Union stated in the above-mentioned decision, Article 22(1) GDPR grants the data subject the “right” not to be subjected to a decision based exclusively on automated processing – including profiling. As can be seen from Article 22(2) GDPR in conjunction with Recital 71 of that regulation, the adoption of a decision based solely on automated processing is only permissible in the cases referred to in Article 22(2), i.e. if it is necessary for entering into or fulfilling a contract between the data subject and the controller (lit. a), if it is permitted by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject (lit. b), or if it is based on the data subject’s explicit consent (lit. c) (see paragraph 53 of the judgment in question). As the Court of Justice of the European Union stated in the above-mentioned decision, Article 22(1) GDPR grants the data subject the “right” not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing – including profiling. As can be seen from Article 22, paragraph 2, GDPR in conjunction with Recital 71 of this Regulation, the adoption of a decision based solely on automated processing is only permissible in the cases referred to in Article 22, paragraph 2, i.e. if it is necessary for entering into or fulfilling a contract between the data subject and the controller (point a), if it is permitted by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject (point b), or if it is made with the data subject's explicit consent (point c); see paragraph 53 of the judgment in question).

Furthermore, in the case of automated decision-making, such as that within the meaning of Article 22, paragraph 1 GDPR, the controller is subject to additional information obligations under Article 13, paragraph 2, letter f and Article 14, paragraph 2, letter g of this Regulation. On the other hand, according to Article 15(1)(h) GDPR, the data subject has a right of information from the controller, which in particular concerns “meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject” (cf. paragraph 56 of the judgment). Furthermore, in the case of automated decision-making, such as that within the meaning of Article 22(1) GDPR, the controller is subject to additional information obligations under Article 13(2)(f) and Article 14(2)(g) of this regulation. On the other hand, according to Article 15(1)(h) GDPR, the data subject has a right of information from the controller, which in particular concerns “meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject” (cf. paragraph 56 of the judgment).

These increased requirements for the legality of automated decision-making, as well as the additional information obligations of the controller and the associated additional information rights of the data subject, follow from the purpose pursued by Art. 22 GDPR, which is to protect individuals from the particular risks to their rights and freedoms associated with the automated processing of personal data - including profiling (para. 57 of the judgment in question).These increased requirements for the legality of automated decision-making, as well as the additional information obligations of the controller and the associated additional information rights of the data subject, follow from the purpose pursued by Article 22 GDPR, which is to protect individuals from the particular risks to their rights and freedoms associated with the automated processing of personal data - including profiling (para. 57 of the judgment in question).

These increased requirements for the legality of automated decision-making, as well as the additional information obligations of the controller and the associated additional information rights of the data subject, follow from the purpose pursued by Article 22 GDPR, which is to protect individuals from the particular risks to their rights and freedoms associated with the automated processing of personal data - including profiling (para. 57 of the judgment in question). In its decision, the ECJ stated that in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, in which three actors are involved, there is a risk of Article 22 of the GDPR being circumvented and, consequently, there is a gap in legal protection if preference is given to a narrow interpretation of this provision, according to which the determination of the probability value is to be regarded only as a preparatory act and only the act carried out by the third party can, if appropriate, be classified as a “decision” within the meaning of Article 22(1) of this regulation. Furthermore, in paragraph 61 of its decision, the ECJ stated that in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, in which three actors are involved, there is a risk of Article 22 of the GDPR being circumvented and, consequently, there is a gap in legal protection if preference is given to a narrow interpretation of this provision, according to which the determination of the probability value is to be regarded only as a preparatory act and only the act carried out by the third party can, if appropriate, be classified as a “decision” within the meaning of Article 22(1) of this regulation.

As the ECJ finally stated in paragraph 67 of its decision, As the ECJ states in paragraph 67 of its judgment, referring to established case law, any processing of personal data must comply with the principles for the processing of personal data set out in Article 5 of the GDPR and, in view of the principle of lawfulness of processing set out in Article 5(1)(a), meet one of the conditions for the lawfulness of processing set out in Article 6 of this Regulation. Finally, as the ECJ states in paragraph 67 of its judgment, referring to established case law, any processing of personal data must comply with the principles for the processing of personal data set out in Article 5 of the GDPR and, in view of the principle of lawfulness of processing set out in Article 5(1)(a), meet one of the conditions for the lawfulness of processing set out in Article 6 of this Regulation.

If the law of a Member State allows the adoption of a decision based solely on automated processing pursuant to Article 22(2)(b) of the GDPR – the ECJ continues – that processing must therefore fulfil not only the conditions laid down in the latter provision and in Article 22(4) of the GDPR, but also the requirements set out in Articles 5 and 6 of that Regulation. Consequently, Member States may not adopt legislation pursuant to Article 22(2)(b) of the GDPR which allows profiling in breach of the requirements of Articles 5 and 6 as interpreted by the Court of Justice (see paragraph 68 of the judgment).If the legislation of a Member State allows the adoption of a decision based solely on automated processing pursuant to Article 22(2)(b) of the GDPR - the ECJ continues -, this processing must therefore not only meet the conditions set out in the latter provision and in Article 22(4) of the GDPR, but also the requirements set out in Articles 5 and 6 of this Regulation. Consequently, Member States may not adopt legislation pursuant to Article 22(2)(b) of the GDPR which allows profiling in breach of the requirements of Articles 5 and 6 as interpreted by the Court of Justice (see paragraph 68 of the judgment).

II.3.1.5.2. From all of this, however, it follows in the specific case that the complainant's argument that it itself does not carry out automated decision-making within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR when calculating probability values for assessing the creditworthiness of natural persons and providing this information to their customers (third parties) was to be rejected in light of the ECJ decision of December 7, 2023 presented above. Rather, the complainant, as a credit agency, automatically created a probability value based on personal data with regard to the ability of the co-participating party to meet future payment obligations and this probability value was the decisive criterion for the co-participating party being simply refused to conclude an energy supply contract by XXXX. Roman II.3.1.5.2. From all of this, however, it follows in the specific case that the complainant's argument that it itself does not carry out automated decision-making within the meaning of Article 22 of the GDPR when calculating probability values for assessing the creditworthiness of natural persons and providing this information to their customers (third parties) was to be rejected in light of the ECJ decision of December 7, 2023 presented above. Rather, the complainant, as a credit agency, automatically created a probability value based on personal data with regard to the ability of the co-participating party to meet future payment obligations and this probability value was the decisive criterion for the co-participating party being refused an energy supply contract without further ado by Roman XXXX.

In this context, reference should also be made to the VwGH decision of December 21, 2023, Ro 2021/04/0010. In it, the Administrative Court referred to the ECJ's statements in the judgment in Case C-634/21, according to which profiling itself constitutes an "automated decision in an individual case" within the meaning of Art. 22 (1) GDPR if the result of this automated processing is decisive for a specific - further - decision insofar as the actions of the third party are "significantly guided" by the profiling in question and thus significantly affect the person concerned. It is already clear from the content of the first question referred that the actions of the third party to whom the probability value is transmitted are "significantly" guided by this value. According to the findings of fact of the referring court, in the case of a credit application submitted by a consumer to a bank, an insufficient probability value leads in almost all cases to the bank refusing to grant the requested credit. In this context, reference should also be made to the decision of the VwGH of December 21, 2023, Ro 2021/04/0010. In it, the Administrative Court referred to the ECJ's statements in the judgment in Case C-634/21, according to which profiling itself constitutes an "automated decision in an individual case" within the meaning of Article 22, paragraph one, GDPR, if the result of this automated processing is decisive for a specific - further - decision insofar as the actions of the third party are "significantly guided" by the profiling in question and thus significantly affect the person concerned. It is already clear from the content of the first question referred that the actions of the third party to whom the probability value is transmitted are "significantly" guided by this value. According to the findings of fact of the referring court, in the case of a credit application submitted by a consumer to a bank, an insufficient probability value leads in almost all cases to the bank refusing to grant the requested credit.

In the present case, the responsible party, in its capacity as a credit agency, assigned a credit rating - sometimes with sufficiently negative connotations - to the party involved in the complainant's system, all without the person concerned ever having shown negative payment behavior. The fact that the complainant's legal representative confirmed in his email of November 15, 2021 that no negative payment experience data on the person concerned had been included in the credit score concerning him cannot change this legal classification. The probability value (credit score) transmitted by the complainant to XXXX was indisputably the decisive criterion for the fact that the person concerned was refused a contract by XXXX and the behavior of XXXX was thus largely guided by automated decision-making. In the present case, the controller, in its capacity as a credit agency, assigned the party involved a credit rating - sometimes with sufficiently negative connotations - in the complainant's system, all without the person concerned ever having shown negative payment behavior. The fact that the complainant's legal representative confirmed in his email of November 15, 2021 that no negative payment experience data on the person concerned had been included in the credit score concerning him cannot change this legal classification. The probability value (credit score) transmitted by the complainant to roman XXXX was indisputably the decisive criterion for the person concerned being refused a contract by roman XXXX and the conduct of roman XXXX was therefore largely guided by automated decision-making.

In the present case, the determination of the "credit score" of the person concerned, which was ultimately decisive for the refusal to conclude a contract with the energy supplier, was therefore to be classified as a decision that "has legal effects on a person concerned or significantly affects them in a similar way" within the meaning of Article 22 paragraph 1 of the GDPR. In the present case, the determination of the "credit score" of the person concerned, which was ultimately decisive for the refusal to conclude a contract with the energy supplier, was therefore to be classified as a decision that "has legal effects on a person concerned or significantly affects them in a similar way" within the meaning of Article 22 paragraph 1 of the GDPR.

The complainant's legal opinion that it only carries out a creditworthiness calculation itself, while any further decision is made by the respective recipients of the creditworthiness reports it has prepared, i.e. the contractual partners and customers of the responsible party, in this case an energy supplier, and that a decision - of whatever kind - based on the calculation of the "credit score" is therefore not anticipated by the responsible party as a credit agency, does not hold water from a legal point of view. As the ECJ explicitly stated in the decision presented above, there would be a risk of circumvention of Art. 22 GDPR and consequently a gap in legal protection if preference were given to a narrow interpretation of the provision, according to which the determination of the probability value should only be regarded as a preparatory act, which is why, in the specific case, there is undoubtedly automatic decision-making within the meaning of Art. 22 (1) GDPR. The complainant's legal opinion that it only carries out a creditworthiness calculation itself, while any further decision is made by the respective recipients of the creditworthiness reports it has prepared, i.e. the contractual partners and customers of the responsible party, in this case an energy supplier, and that a decision - of whatever kind - based on the calculation of the "credit score" is therefore not anticipated by the responsible party as a credit agency, does not hold water from a legal point of view. As the ECJ explicitly stated in the decision presented above, there would be a risk of circumventing Article 22 of the GDPR and consequently a gap in legal protection if a narrow interpretation of the provision, according to which the determination of the probability value should only be regarded as a preparatory act, were given preference, which is why, in this case, there is undoubtedly automatic decision-making within the meaning of Article 22, paragraph 1, of the GDPR.

However, if a decision based solely on automated processing is permissible pursuant to Article 22(2) GDPR, such processing must also meet the requirements of Articles 5 and 6 of this Regulation. However, if a decision based solely on automated processing is permissible pursuant to Article 22(2) GDPR, such processing must also meet the requirements of Articles 5 and 6 of this Regulation.

II.3.1.5.3.  First of all, it had to be examined whether one of the exceptions in Article 22(2) GDPR came into play in the present case: Roman II.3.1.5.3. First of all, it was therefore necessary to examine whether one of the exceptions in Article 22, Paragraph 2, GDPR applies in the present case:

As far as the requirements of Article 22, Paragraph 2, GDPR are concerned, it cannot be said in the specific case that the decision was necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between the data subject, i.e. the party involved, and the controller, i.e. the complainant, within the meaning of Article 22, Paragraph 1, Letter a, GDPR. There are also no legal provisions in national law that contain "appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject", as required by Article 22, Paragraph 1, Letter b, GDPR. In this context, it should be expressly stated that Section 152 of the Trade Regulations 1994 does not constitute such a legal basis. In the case at hand, with regard to the automated decision-making process at hand within the meaning of Article 22 Paragraph 1 GDPR, there is also no (express) consent from the party involved within the meaning of Article 22 Paragraph 1 Letter c GDPR. As far as the requirements of Article 22 Paragraph 2 GDPR are concerned, it cannot be said in this specific case that the decision was necessary for the conclusion or fulfillment of a contract between the data subject, i.e. the party involved, and the controller, i.e. the complainant, within the meaning of Article 22 Paragraph 1 Letter a, GDPR. Nor do national law contain any legal provisions containing “appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject”, as required by Article 22 Paragraph 1 Letter b, GDPR. In this context, it should be expressly noted that Paragraph 152 of the Trade Regulations 1994 does not constitute such a legal basis. In relation to the automated decision-making process in question within the meaning of Article 22, Paragraph 1, GDPR, there is also no (express) consent from the party involved within the meaning of Article 22, Paragraph 1, Letter c, GDPR.

As a result, in this specific case, a decision based exclusively on automated processing (creation of the "credit score") was not covered by Article 22, Paragraph 2, GDPR. As a result, in this specific case, a decision based exclusively on automated processing (creation of the "credit score") was not covered by Article 22, Paragraph 2, GDPR.

Overall, it was therefore to be noted that in the present case, a probability value based on personal data with regard to the ability of the party involved to fulfil future payment obligations was automatically created by a credit agency, namely the complainant as the data protection controller within the meaning of Art. 4(7) GDPR, and that the probability value calculated here was crucial in determining whether third parties (in this case: an energy supply company) would establish, implement or terminate a contractual relationship with this person, but the legal requirements for this were not met due to the lack of an exception under Art. 22(2) GDPR. Overall, it was therefore clear that in the present case a probability value based on personal data with regard to the ability of the party involved to fulfil future payment obligations was automatically created by a credit agency, namely the complainant as the data protection controller within the meaning of Article 4, paragraph 7, GDPR, and that the probability value calculated here was the key factor in determining whether third parties (in this case: an energy supply company) would establish, implement or terminate a contractual relationship with this person, but that the legal requirements for this were not met due to the lack of an exception under Article 22, paragraph 2, GDPR.

II.3.1.5.4. In addition, the above-mentioned decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union shows that in the case of profiling the controller is subject to further information obligations under Article 13, paragraph 2, letter f and Article 14, paragraph 2, letter g of GDPR, but has not complied with these in the present case. Roman II.3.1.5.4. In addition, the above-mentioned decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union shows that in the case of profiling, the controller is subject to further information obligations under Article 13, Paragraph 2, Letter f and Article 14, Paragraph 2, Letter g, GDPR, but has not complied with these in the present case.

Specifically, it follows from the aforementioned provisions of the GDPR that, in addition to the information pursuant to paragraph 1 leg. cit., the controller must provide the data subject with information at the time the data is collected as to the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, in accordance with Art. 22 paragraph 1 and paragraph 4 GDPR and - at least in those cases - meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the scope and the intended effects of such processing for the data subject.Specifically, it follows from the aforementioned provisions of the GDPR that, in addition to the information pursuant to paragraph 1 leg. cit., the controller must provide the data subject with information at the time the data is collected as to the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, in accordance with Article 22 paragraph 1 and paragraph 4 GDPR and - at least in those cases - meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the scope and the intended effects of such processing for the data subject.

II.3.1.5.5. However, the complainant did not adequately inform its contractual partners, i.e. those companies that enquired about the creditworthiness of the other party involved, in accordance with the requirements set out above, that automated decision-making, including profiling, was taking place in accordance with Art. 22 Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 4, that the "credit score" of the other party involved was calculated without any payment history data being available, and that the other party involved was therefore not given sufficient opportunity to present its point of view as a data subject to data protection law to a company inquiring about the creditworthiness. To do this, it would be necessary for the credit report to make it sufficiently clear that the credit score contained therein was calculated without any payment history data. In addition, no information was provided about the logic involved, as well as the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject.Roman II.3.1.5.5. However, the complainant did not adequately inform its contractual partners, i.e. those companies that requested the creditworthiness of the other party involved, in line with the requirements outlined above, that automated decision-making, including profiling, was taking place in accordance with Article 22, paragraph one and paragraph four, that the "credit score" of the other party involved was calculated without the existence of payment history data, and that the other party involved was therefore not given sufficient opportunity to present its position as a data subject to data protection law to a company that requested creditworthiness. To do this, it would be necessary for the credit report to make it sufficiently clear that the credit score contained therein was calculated without payment history data. In addition, no information was provided about the logic involved, the scope and the intended effects of such processing for the data subject.

Overall, the Senate therefore comes to the same conclusion as the authority concerned, apart from the fact that in the present case there was no exception under Article 22 paragraph 2 of the GDPR. As the person responsible for data protection, the complainant violated the principles of "lawfulness" and processing in "good faith" within the meaning of Article 5 paragraph 1 letter a of the GDPR when processing personal data to create probability statements ("credit score") on the creditworthiness of the person concerned. Overall, the Senate therefore comes to the same conclusion as the authority concerned, apart from the fact that in the present case there was no exception under Article 22 paragraph 2 of the GDPR. The complainant, as the person responsible for data protection, violated the principles of "lawfulness" and processing in "good faith" within the meaning of Article 5, Paragraph 1, Letter a, of the GDPR when processing personal data to create probability statements ("credit score") on the creditworthiness of the person concerned.

II.3.1.6. The authority concerned also ruled in point 1.b) of the contested decision that the person responsible had violated the principle of transparency because it had not explained to the person concerned in an understandable manner whether it was also processing the personal data of the other party involved, which it processed for the purpose of carrying out the business of providing credit information on credit relationships, for the purpose of carrying out the business of address publishers and direct marketing companies and the business of providing services in automatic data processing and information technology. Roman II.3.1.6. The authority concerned also stated in point 1.b) of the contested decision that the responsible party had violated the principle of transparency because it had not explained to the person concerned in a comprehensible manner whether it was also processing the personal data of the other party involved, which it processed for the purpose of operating the credit reporting business, for the purpose of operating the address publishing and direct marketing business and the business of providing services in automatic data processing and information technology.

From the point of view of the Senate, however, it is not understandable why this point was made, especially since any violation that might have occurred in this regard was not covered by the application initiating the proceedings.

From the complainant's statements of October 8, 2020 and April 28, 2021, it is also clear that the complainant's data is stored for the purpose of carrying out the trades in accordance with Section 151 (address publishers and direct marketing companies), Section 152 (credit reporting agencies) and Section 153 (automatic data processing and information technology services) of the Trade Regulations 1994 (GewO) for forwarding to the recipient group of the lending industry.From the complainant's statements of October 8, 2020 and April 28, 2021, it is also clear that the complainant's data is stored for the purpose of carrying out the trades in accordance with Section 151 (address publishers and direct marketing companies), Section 152 (credit reporting agencies) and Section 153 (automatic data processing and information technology services) of the Trade Regulations 1994 (GewO) stored for forwarding to the recipient group of the lending industry.

It was not clear to what extent the controller had violated the principle of transparency in this context.

The relevant ruling in the ruling of the contested decision therefore had to be omitted without replacement.

II.3.1.7. The same applies to ruling point 2. a) of the contested decision, with which the controller was instructed by the authority concerned to provide the person concerned with information within a period of eight weeks, under penalty of execution, as to whether it is intended to further process the personal data of the co-participating party, in addition to processing for the purposes of exercising the business of providing credit information, for the purposes of exercising the business of address publishers and direct marketing companies and the business of providing services in automatic data processing and information technology. Roman II.3.1.7. The same applies to point 2. a) of the contested decision, in which the responsible party was instructed by the authority concerned to provide the person concerned with information within a period of eight weeks, under penalty of execution, as to whether it is intended to further process the personal data of the co-participating party in addition to processing it for the purpose of carrying out the business of providing information on credit relationships, for the purposes of carrying out the business of address publishers and direct marketing companies and the business of providing services in automatic data processing and information technology.

II.3.1.8. The data protection authority also came to the conclusion that the complainant had violated the co-participating party's right to confidentiality by unlawfully processing the co-participating party's data. Roman II.3.1.8. The data protection authority also came to the conclusion that the complainant had violated the co-participating party's right to confidentiality by unlawfully processing the co-participating party's data.

It should be noted that, contrary to the opinion of the authority concerned, the deciding senate does not assume that in the event of a violation of the principles for the processing of personal data set out in Article 5 of the GDPR in the context of a complaint pursuant to Article 77 of the GDPR and Section 24 of the DSG - apart from cases of an application explicitly directed solely to this effect - a ruling on a violation of the right to confidentiality pursuant to Section 1 Paragraph 1 of the DSG should also be denied.It should be noted that, contrary to the opinion of the authority concerned, the deciding senate does not assume that in the event of a violation of the principles for the processing of personal data set out in Article 5 of the GDPR in the context of a complaint pursuant to Article 77 of the GDPR and Section 24 of the DSG - apart from cases of an application explicitly directed solely to this effect - a ruling on a violation of the right to confidentiality pursuant to Paragraph 1, Paragraph 1 of the DSG should also be denied.

There is no legal requirement to necessarily rule out a uniform and inseparable decision on a data protection complaint that alleges both a violation of Section 1 Paragraph 1 of the Data Protection Act and violations of Article 5 Paragraph 1 of the GDPR. A violation of the right to confidentiality does not automatically constitute a violation of the GDPR in every case. Conversely, it cannot be ruled out that a violation of the GDPR asserted within the framework of Article 77 of the GDPR does not constitute a violation of the right to confidentiality under Section 1 Paragraph 1 of the Data Protection Act (cf. again VwGH of March 6, 2024, Ro 2021/04/0030, margin numbers 53 and 59). There is no legal requirement to necessarily rule out a uniform and inseparable decision on a data protection complaint that alleges both a violation of Paragraph 1, Paragraph 1 of the Data Protection Act and violations of Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the GDPR. A violation of the right to confidentiality does not automatically constitute a violation of the GDPR in every case. Conversely, it is also not excluded that a violation of the GDPR asserted within the framework of Article 77, GDPR does not constitute a violation of the right to confidentiality under paragraph one, subsection one, DSG (see again VwGH of March 6, 2024, Ro 2021/04/0030, paras. 53 and 59).

The co-involved party did not assert a violation of the right to confidentiality under Section 1, paragraph 1 DSG in its application initiating the proceedings. The co-involved party did not assert a violation of the right to confidentiality under paragraph one, subsection one, DSG in its application initiating the proceedings.

In addition, in the present case, an (additional) ruling on a violation of the right to confidentiality pursuant to Section 1 Paragraph 1 of the Data Protection Act does not appear to be necessary, since the legality of the data processing has already been conclusively agreed upon in point 1.a) of the contested decision. In this regard, reference is again made to the recent decision of the ECJ of December 7, 2023, OQ v Land Hessen, C‑634/21. The ruling point 1.c) of the contested decision therefore had to be omitted without replacement. In addition, in the present case constellation, an (additional) ruling on a violation of the right to confidentiality according to paragraph one, subsection one, DSG does not appear to be necessary, since the legality of the data processing has already been conclusively agreed in ruling point 1.a) of the contested decision. In this regard, reference is again made to the recent decision of the ECJ of December 7, 2023, OQ / Land Hessen, C‑634/21. The ruling point 1.c) of the contested decision therefore had to be omitted without replacement.

II.3.1.9. On the right to information under Art. 15 GDPR: As regards the alleged violation of the right to information under Art. 15 GDPR in view of the fact that the controller did not provide the party involved (and data subject) with complete data information until the procedure was concluded, the relevant legal findings of the authority concerned had to be followed. Roman II.3.1.9. On the right to information under Article 15 GDPR: As regards the alleged violation of the right to information under Article 15 GDPR in view of the fact that the controller did not provide the party involved (and data subject) with complete data information until the procedure was concluded, the relevant legal findings of the authority concerned had to be followed.

II.3.1.9.1. Article 15(1)(h) of the GDPR states that the data subject has the right to obtain confirmation from the controller as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed. If this is the case, the data subject has the right to access these personal data, as well as to be informed as to the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, pursuant to Article 22(1) and (4), as well as to be provided with meaningful information as to the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. Roman II.3.1.9.1. Article 15(1)(h) of the GDPR states that the data subject has the right to obtain confirmation from the controller as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed. If this is the case, the data subject has the right to information about these personal data and to information about the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, in accordance with Article 22, paragraphs one and four, as well as meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject.

The right to information under Art. 15 GDPR is generally intended to ensure that the data subject receives sufficient information about the specific processing in order to be able to assert their rights as a data subject. The right to information under Article 15 GDPR is generally intended to ensure that the data subject receives sufficient information about the specific processing in order to be able to assert their rights as a data subject.

II.3.1.9.2. The complainant (and controller within the meaning of Art. 4(7) GDPR) stated several times in the proceedings that no automated decision-making within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR was taking place and that there was therefore no right to information in accordance with Art. 15(1)(h) GDPR. Roman II.3.1.9.2. The complainant (and controller within the meaning of Article 4, paragraph 7, GDPR) stated several times in the proceedings that no automated decision-making within the meaning of Article 22, GDPR takes place and therefore there is no right to information pursuant to Article 15, paragraph one, letter h, GDPR.

As already stated under II.3.1.5.1., it follows from the decision of the ECJ of December 7, 2023, OQ / Land Hessen, C‑634/21, that the calculation of the statistical probability of default, as carried out by the complainant, undoubtedly constitutes “profiling” within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR, because it assesses the economic situation of the person concerned and makes a prediction about payment behavior. As already stated under Roman II.3.1.5.1. It follows from the decision of the ECJ of December 7, 2023, OQ / Land Hessen, C‑634/21, that the calculation of the statistical probability of default, as carried out by the complainant, undoubtedly constitutes “profiling” within the meaning of Article 22, GDPR, because it assesses the economic situation of the data subject and makes a prediction about payment behavior.

Since such “profiling”, as already stated, is expressly mentioned in Art. 15, paragraph 1, letter h, GDPR, this circumstance is subject to the right to information under this provision. Since such “profiling”, as already stated, is expressly mentioned in Article 15, paragraph one, letter h, GDPR, this circumstance is subject to the right to information under this provision.

II.3.1.9.3. In addition, the ECJ holds in its judgment above under II.3.1.5.1. The ECJ states in its decision presented above under Roman II.3.1.5.1 that the data subject has a right to information from the controller under Article 15 paragraph 1 letter h of the GDPR, which in particular concerns "meaningful information about the logic involved as well as the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject". Roman II.3.1.9.3. In addition, the ECJ states in its decision presented above under Roman II.3.1.5.1 that the data subject has a right to information from the controller under Article 15 paragraph 1 letter h of the GDPR, which in particular concerns "meaningful information about the logic involved as well as the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject".

In this specific case, the co-involved party repeatedly requested information pursuant to Article 15 paragraph 1 letter h of the GDPR.In this specific case, the co-involved party repeatedly requested information pursuant to Article 15 paragraph 1 letter h of the GDPR.

In this case, the co-involved party has repeatedly requested the complainant to provide sufficiently clear and complete information regarding the personal data processed; in particular with regard to the information underlying the "credit score", such as the basis on which the co-involved party's creditworthiness was assessed, what type of data was processed by the controller to determine it, what exact content it has and where it comes from. The information to be transmitted by the controller must therefore be of such granularity and traceability that it is possible for the co-involved party as the data subject to understand how they could improve their current "credit score".

II.3.1.9.4. In the case under review here, it was not possible for the party involved to check the legality of the data processing, especially since it had not yet received any concrete information on how the credit score assigned to it came about.Roman II.3.1.9.4. In the case under review here, it was not possible for the party involved to check the legality of the data processing, especially since it had not yet received any concrete information on how the credit score assigned to it came about.

In its response to the request for information dated October 8, 2020, the controller merely stated in general terms that the credit rating transmitted was calculated based on qualified payment defaults, age and place of residence of the person concerned, and it contains a general reference to the fact that data was obtained from publicly available sources, data from address publishers and information on payment experiences transmitted by a large number of corporate customers and over 60 debt collection partners.

As a result, the co-participating party requested the complainant by letter dated January 7, 2021 to provide sufficiently clear and complete information regarding the personal data processed; in particular with regard to the information underlying the "credit score", such as the basis on which the co-participating party's creditworthiness was assessed, what type of data was processed by the complainant to determine it, what exact content it has and where it comes from. In concrete terms, in the opinion of the deciding Senate, the information provided must be sufficiently comprehensive for the co-participating party to be able to understand the reasons for the credit assessment (in the present case, a "scoring value" between 550 and 574 points in the controller's system).

II.3.1.9.5. In its letter dated January 13, 2021, the controller then referred to the fact that there was no right to information within the meaning of Article 15 of the GDPR regarding the creation of the risk values determined, especially since this information was to be classified as a trade secret. Roman II.3.1.9.5. In its letter dated January 13, 2021, the controller then referred to the fact that there was no right to information within the meaning of Article 15 of the GDPR regarding the creation of the risk values determined, especially since this information was to be classified as a trade secret.

In its information statement of April 28, 2021, the complainant subsequently sent a current data extract to the co-involved party, which listed the personal data it had stored about the co-involved party, as well as the companies to which credit data on the co-involved party was passed on, and also the value transmitted to them. In addition, the complainant's data protection declaration was enclosed, which, among other things, shows the sources from which the personal data is collected.

The responsible party explained that it calculates the risk value, which for private individuals is on a scale of 250 to 750, from the information stored in its identity and credit database as well as from the information transmitted by the customer in the request to the complainant, with the decision on the significance of the credit score transmitted to a customer of the complainant then being made by the customer.

In addition, the person responsible once again argued that the complainant does not carry out automated decision-making within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR and that for this reason alone there is no right to information. In addition, the information requested by the co-involved party is to be qualified as the complainant's trade secrets within the meaning of Section 4 Paragraph 6 DSG. In addition, the person responsible once again argued that the complainant does not carry out automated decision-making within the meaning of Article 22 GDPR and that for this reason alone there is no right to information. In addition, the information requested by the co-involved party is to be qualified as the complainant's trade secrets within the meaning of Section 4 Paragraph 6 DSG.

The complainant also subsequently repeatedly argued that the specific calculation formula constituted a trade secret.

II.3.1.9.6. According to Section 4, Paragraph 6 of the Data Protection Act, the right to information is generally excluded if providing this information would endanger a business or trade secret of the controller or a third party. Roman II.3.1.9.6. According to Section 4, Paragraph 6 of the Data Protection Act, the right to information is generally excluded if providing this information would endanger a business or trade secret of the controller or a third party.

However, this exception did not create an absolute right of refusal, but rather the controller must carefully weigh up in each individual case to what extent providing information actually affects a business or trade secret (cf. Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation, Article 15 of the GDPR, paragraph 55). However, this exception does not create an absolute right of refusal, but rather the controller must carefully consider in each individual case to what extent the provision of information actually affects a business and trade secret (see Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Article 15, GDPR margin number 55).

II.3.1.9.7. If automated decision-making is given in an individual case according to Art. 22 Para. 1 and 4 GDPR, and the exceptions in Art. 22 Para. 2 GDPR do not apply, the data subject must also be informed of this when the information is provided. In addition, information must be provided about the logic involved and the scope and intended effects of such processing. When providing information to the data subject, the controller must describe the logic used in such a way that the data subject is informed about the parameters included in the assessment and can recognize which aspects of their person or behavior are used. The algorithm itself does not have to be disclosed. The term “logic involved” is to be understood in such a way that only the principle on which such a calculation is based is to be presented, not the concrete calculation formula (cf. Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Art. 15 GDPR Rz 32). Roman II.3.1.9.7. If automated decision-making is given in an individual case in accordance with Article 22, Paragraph 1 and 4 GDPR, and the exceptions in Article 22, Paragraph 2 GDPR do not apply, the data subject must also be informed of this when the information is provided. Information must also be provided on the logic involved as well as on the scope and intended effects of such processing. When providing information to the data subject, the controller must describe the logic used in such a way that the data subject is informed of the parameters included in the assessment and can recognize which aspects of their person or behavior are being used. The algorithm itself does not have to be disclosed. The term "logic involved" is to be understood in such a way that only the principle on which such a calculation is based is to be presented, but not the concrete calculation formula (see Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Article 15, GDPR, para. 32).

If the controller in the present case therefore objects that the concrete calculation formula represents a trade secret, it must be countered that the assertion of a trade secret cannot absolutely eliminate the right to information, since interference with the fundamental right to data protection must be limited to the absolutely necessary extent (see also the judgment of the ECJ of February 14, 2019, C-345/17, para. 64). If the controller in the present case therefore objects that the specific calculation formula represents a trade secret, it must be countered that the assertion of a trade secret cannot completely eliminate the right to information, since interference with the fundamental right to data protection must be limited to the absolutely necessary extent (see also the judgment of the ECJ of 14 February 2019, C-345/17, paragraph 64).

II.3.1.9.8. Like the authority concerned, the deciding Senate also takes the view that, notwithstanding the fact that the complainant's specific calculation formula represents a trade secret, the controller could have provided the other party involved with further information for calculating the "credit score" attributed to it, without the complainant having to disclose its trade secrets. Roman II.3.1.9.8. Like the authority concerned, the Senate hearing the case is of the opinion that, regardless of the fact that the specific calculation formula of the complainant is a trade secret, the responsible party could have provided the other party with further information on the calculation of the "credit score" attributed to it without the complainant having to disclose its trade secrets.

The information provided by the responsible party remained superficial and vague throughout the entire procedure; at no point did the responsible party explain the principle on which the calculation of the "credit score" of the person concerned is based.

The responsible party should, however, have presented and provided at least basic information with regard to the calculation of the credit score of the other party (person concerned).

II.3.1.9.9. In her appeal against the decision, the complainant repeatedly stated that both point 1. d) and point 2. b) of the contested decision were unlawful, especially since it was completely unclear what information the authority in question still considered to be required to be provided and the decision also did not indicate where the line was to be drawn between the trade secrets, which she also considered to be protected, and the "further information" that was to be provided. In this respect, the points of the decision were also not enforceable. All information to be provided was disclosed to the party involved by April 28, 2021 at the latest. Roman II.3.1.9.9. In her appeal against the decision, the complainant repeatedly stated that both point 1. d) and point 2. b) of the contested decision were unlawful, especially since it was completely unclear which information, in the opinion of the authority concerned, still had to be provided and the decision did not indicate where the line should be drawn between the trade secrets, which in her opinion were also protected, and the "further information" that had to be provided. In this respect, the points of the decision were also not enforceable. All information to be provided was disclosed to the party involved by April 28, 2021 at the latest.

As already stated, the Senate is of the opinion that the specific algorithm itself does not have to be disclosed by the person responsible, but the person responsible must provide information about the logic used in a form that shows the basic principles on which the calculation of the "scoring value" is based. The controller must inform the other party involved about the specific parameters used in the assessment so that they can see which precise aspects of their person or their behavior are being used.

As correctly stated by the authority concerned, nothing can be gained for the complainant's legal position from its argument that the provision of basic information \[to create a "credit score"\] would result in a competitive disadvantage compared to market competitors, especially since all market participants are subject to the same provisions of the GDPR.

II.3.1.9.10. Result: Against the background of the preceding considerations, it was stated that the complainant violated the other party's right to information by not providing it with sufficient information in accordance with Art. 15 Paragraph 1 Letter h of GDPR throughout the entire procedure.

II.3.2. On the omission of an oral hearing: Roman II.3.2. On the omission of an oral hearing: Pursuant to Section 24 Paragraph 1 of the VwGVG, the administrative court must hold a public oral hearing upon request or, if it deems this necessary, of its own motion. Pursuant to Section 24 Paragraph 4 of the VwGVG, the administrative court may - unless federal or state law provides otherwise - refrain from holding a hearing regardless of a party's request if the files show that the oral discussion is not likely to clarify the legal matter further and neither Article 6 Paragraph 1 of the ECHR nor Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights prevent the hearing from being omitted. Pursuant to Section 24, Paragraph 1 of the VwGVG, the administrative court must hold a public oral hearing upon request or, if it deems this necessary, of its own motion. According to paragraph 24, paragraph 4, VwGVG, the administrative court may – unless otherwise provided by federal or state law – refrain from holding a hearing, notwithstanding a party’s request, if the files show that the oral discussion is not likely to lead to further clarification of the legal case, and neither Article 6, paragraph 1, ECHR nor Article 47, CFR preclude the omission of the hearing.

In the present case, the facts were clear from the files. The use of further evidence was not necessary to clarify the facts.

In this case, the Federal Administrative Court had to rule exclusively on a legal question (cf. ECHR 20.06.2013, Appl. No. 24510/06, Abdulgadirov/AZE, para. 34 ff.); this consisted, on a case-by-case basis, of the legal assessment of the processing of personal data for the purpose of determining and creating probability values for the payment behavior of individual data subjects in the form of a "credit score" as a form of automated decision-making within the meaning of Art. 22 Para. 1 GDPR.

No. 24510/06, Abdulgadirov/AZE, para. 34 ff.); this consisted, on a case-by-case basis, of the legal assessment of the processing of personal data for the purpose of determining and creating probability values for the payment behavior of individual data subjects in the form of a "credit score" as a form of automated decision-making within the meaning of Article 22, Paragraph one, GDPR.

It was therefore not necessary to hold an oral hearing on a case-by-case basis.

II.3.3. On point B) of the ruling - inadmissibility of the appeal: Roman II.3.3. On point B) of the ruling - inadmissibility of the appeal:

According to Section 25a, Paragraph 1 of the Administrative Court Act (VwGG), the administrative court must state in its ruling or decision whether the appeal is admissible in accordance with Article 133, Paragraph 4 of the Federal Constitutional Court Act (B-VG). The ruling must be briefly justified.According to Paragraph 25a, Paragraph one, VwGG, the administrative court must state in its ruling or decision whether the appeal is admissible in accordance with Article 133, Paragraph 4, Federal Constitutional Court Act (B-VG). The ruling must be briefly justified.

The appeal is not admissible according to Article 133, Paragraph 4 of the Federal Constitutional Court because the decision does not depend on the solution of a legal question of fundamental importance. The decision in question does not deviate from the previous case law of the Administrative Court, nor is there a lack of case law; furthermore, the present case law of the Administrative Court cannot be judged as inconsistent. There are also no other indications of a fundamental importance of the legal question to be resolved.
