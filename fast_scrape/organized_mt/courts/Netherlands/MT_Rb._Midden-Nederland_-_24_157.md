## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject was placed in the persoonsgerichte aanpak (PGA), a local multi-agency intervention programme in Amersfoort aimed at tackling repeated public disorder and safety issues. The police had referred him in December 2022 following multiple complaints of nuisance and repeated negative encounters, documented in a formal police report. His personal data was shared between various municipal partners under the PGA privacy covenant.

In February 2024 the municipality informed the data subject that his PGA file had been closed due to the absence of further incidents, but that his data would remain stored for two years. The data subject objected, arguing that his inclusion in the PGA was unfounded, had damaged his reputation, and that continued storage constituted unlawful processing. He sought cessation of the processing under [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR"). The municipality rejected his objection, upholding the continued retention of the data.

### Holding

The Court held that the processing of personal data pursued a task of public interest under [Article 6(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1e "Article 6 GDPR"), namely maintaining public order and safety. It accepted the police reports and the PGA expert’s assessment as a sufficient basis for the referral, and held that keeping the data for two years was proportionate to allow swift intervention if problems re-emerged.

Although it was held that the data subject had a valid interest in challenging the lawfulness of the processing, the Court concluded that the municipality had demonstrated compelling legitimate grounds that outweighed his personal interest under [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR").

The Court found that the municipality had not explained its decision properly at the time, so it formally struck down that decision. However, because the data processing itself was lawful, the outcome remained the same and the data could continue to be stored. The data subject’s appeal was therefore technically successful, but it did not stop the processing. The municipality was ordered to refund the court fees (€187) and cover the claimant’s legal costs of €1,814.

## Comment

The ruling illustrates how [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR") provides only limited protection where controllers can rely on [Article 6(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1e "Article 6 GDPR").

\[plaintiff\], from \[place\], plaintiff
(attorney: Mr. J. Visscher),

and
the Municipal Executive of the Municipality of Amersfoort
(attorney: Mr. J.A. van Kippersluis).

Procedural history
1. In this judgment, the court assesses the plaintiff's appeal against the municipal executive's decision regarding the suspension of the processing of his personal data as referred to in Article 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The processing of the personal data is related to the registration of a personalized approach (PGA).

1.2.
The plaintiff has filed an appeal against the contested decision.

1.1.
The municipal executive responded to the appeal with a statement of defense.

1.3.
The court heard the appeal on April 1, 2025. The plaintiff, the plaintiff's representative, and the municipal executive's representative participated.

Court's assessment
What happened?
2. On December 22, 2022, the plaintiff was registered with the police for a Personal Data Protection Act (PGA). The PGA is a collaboration between various partners in the municipality of Amersfoort active in the field of emergency services and safety. It is a structure that the various partners jointly implement to ensure safety and public order in the municipality. The Agreement on Privacy Regulations for a Local, Person-Oriented Approach (the Agreement) sets out the agreements between the partners. Personal data about the data subject is exchanged between the partners. The reasons for this are laid down in the Agreement. The reason for the plaintiff's registration was that the police believed there were repeated complaints from local residents about nuisance and that attempts to discuss this with the plaintiff had been unsuccessful.

3. By letter dated February 8, 2024, the municipal executive informed the claimant that his PGA file was being closed because there was no longer any (serious) nuisance and/or police records. The municipal executive informed the claimant that his data was no longer being shared between the partners, but would remain in the file for some time (two years).

The court's assessment
4. In these proceedings, the court will assess whether the municipal executive rightfully processed the claimant's personal data in connection with the PGA application and whether there are grounds to discontinue the processing. It will do so based on the claimant's grounds for appeal.

5. The court finds that the processing of the claimant's personal data is lawful and that the processing need not be discontinued. The court will explain below how it reached this conclusion and what consequences it has.

Does the claimant have an interest in the proceedings? 6. The claimant objected to the processing of his personal data because he believes his honor and good name have been damaged and that the processing of his data is unlawful and unjustified. He stated that he is a respectable person and that his future prospects are being diminished by his inclusion in the Personal Data Protection Act (PGA). Furthermore, according to the claimant, the registration with the PGA is neither verifiable nor justifiable, as it lacks a factual basis. For this reason, the claimant argued, his personal data should not have been processed. The claimant wishes to recover the reputational damage in separate proceedings.

7. The Board argues that the claimant has no interest in these proceedings because there is no reputational damage and there is no ongoing processing of his personal data. The data processing was stopped by the closing letter of February 8, 2024.

8. Contrary to the Board's assertion, the court finds that the claimant has an interest in answering the question of whether inclusion in the PGA has been lawful. The claimant claims to have suffered reputational damage as a result of his inclusion in the PGA. That the claimant suffered damages as a result of being included in the Personal Data Protection Act (PGA) is not implausible a priori. After all, if it is established that the claimant was wrongly included in the PGA, he will have become known as a nuisance-maker within the integrated approach, while he should not have been placed in that category. This could result in reputational damage. Furthermore, the court disagrees with the municipal executive's position that there is no longer any ongoing processing of his personal data. In the letter of February 8, 2024, the municipal executive stated that the claimant's data was no longer being shared, but would remain in its files for some time. If there were no new nuisances after two years, the PGA data would be permanently deleted. The court considers that the term "processing" is also defined as the storage of personal data.1 Therefore, storing personal data is a form of processing. Therefore, it is established that the processing of the claimant's data is currently ongoing until February 8, 2026. Therefore, there is ongoing processing. In view of the above, it has been established that the claimant has an interest in these proceedings.

9. The municipal executive treated the claimant's objection as an appeal to cease the processing of his personal data.2 The municipal executive assessed that there are compelling legitimate grounds for processing the personal data, which in this case outweigh the claimant's interests in ceasing the processing of the personal data under the Personal Data Protection Act (PGA). The municipal executive stated, both in writing and at the hearing, that the question of whether the claimant's registration for the PGA is unlawful is not an issue that arises in these proceedings. Nevertheless, the municipal executive assessed this in the primary decision and concluded that the processing was lawful. In the contested decision, the municipal executive limited itself to a balancing of interests. In the court's opinion, the court must assess in these proceedings whether, in light of the grounds for appeal submitted, the processing of the claimant's personal data was lawful.3 The court will address this below.
Is the processing of the claimant's personal data lawful? 10. To lawfully process personal data, the processing must be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of public authority vested in the municipality.4 To this end, it must first be assessed whether the purpose for which the personal data is processed is specific and explicitly defined. Next, it must be assessed whether the processing of the personal data actually achieves the purpose. The purpose must then be consistent with the task carried out in the public interest. The processing must also be necessary.

Is the purpose of the processing specific and explicitly defined?
11. After registration, the municipal executive monitors the progress of the local PGA with limited information. For this purpose, the municipality processes the personal data of the data subject.5 The purpose of this processing is to protect public order and safety in the municipality by establishing and implementing the Personal Data Protection Act (PGA) for residents whose behavior repeatedly disrupts public order and/or repeatedly threatens their own safety or that of others.6 In the court's opinion, the purpose of the processing is therefore well-defined and explicit.7

Does the data processing fulfill a task in the public interest?
12. The mayor is responsible for maintaining public order.8 The purpose of the processing arises from the mayor's obligation to maintain public order. This is a task in the public interest, so the processing of personal data by the mayor (and thus the municipal executive) fulfills that task.

Is the processing of the claimant's personal data necessary? 13. The claimant was registered for the PGA because the municipal executive believed the claimant met the criteria for registration.9 Registration for the PGA can take place if 1) a chain partner, based on repeated contacts and interventions, believes that continuing interventions from within its own chain is insufficient, 2) the behavior or problem necessitates an integrated approach from two or more chains, and 3) if at least two police reports within a twelve-month period have been found that relate to a disruption of public order and/or a threat to the safety of the resident or their environment. These criteria are also considered sufficiently clear and precise, and their application is based on the statutory obligations for maintaining public order.

Have the criteria for participation in the PGA been met, and have the necessary safeguards been observed?
14. The court may assume the accuracy of the content of an administrative report drawn up under oath, unless there are indications that give reason to doubt this. In these proceedings, the claimant has not specified which facts and circumstances he believes are incorrect, even though it has been demonstrated that he had a joint meeting on January 26, 2023, during which he was informed of the situation. Therefore, it would have been incumbent upon him to provide more insight into the situation and to substantiate this further. The court finds no grounds in the arguments submitted to support the position that the content of the administrative report does not provide sufficient factual basis for the PGA application. The document containing a list of neighbors does not provide sufficient substantiation to disregard the accuracy of the administrative report. This is because it is insufficiently verifiable and there is uncertainty regarding its preparation. Therefore, the court will hereinafter assume the accuracy of the administrative report.

15. From the file available to the court, the court infers the following. The municipal executive submitted an administrative report from the police dated July 19, 2024. This administrative report shows that the plaintiff had been negatively reported to the police on several occasions. According to this report, drawn up under oath, his behavior consisted primarily of verbally abusing, spitting on, and intimidating others. A physical confrontation also occurred on several occasions. Between September 30, 2021, and September 30, 2022, the police received at least fifteen reports about the plaintiff, alleging that he was disturbing public order and/or threatening his safety and that of his surroundings. After September 30, 2022, the plaintiff came to the attention of the police several more times. The last report dates from February 7, 2023. The court infers the following from the initial decision. The police, as a chain partner, subsequently saw reason to implement an integrated approach involving two or more chains and therefore contacted the municipality. A PGA expert subsequently determined that an integrated approach was useful, because the police and a support organization were unable to independently engage with the plaintiff and discuss with him what was needed to turn the situation around.

16. The court finds that the criteria for registration have been met and that the municipal executive has observed sufficient safeguards when placing the plaintiff in the PGA.10 The file contains no indication that the police's determination regarding the need for an integrated approach was incorrect. This determination was further confirmed by the PGA expert, who assessed whether the plaintiff met the aforementioned criteria. The court also considers it relevant that the administrative report shows that there were fifteen reports that occurred over a longer period. The administrative report further shows that at least two police reports were made in the twelve months preceding the PGA notification.

17. The primary decision and the statement of defense also clearly indicate who and how the decision to actually place the claimant in the PGA was made, and which procedure was followed. These reports also mention the involvement of the PGA expert who investigated the necessity of a PGA. This necessity is sufficiently explained in the primary decision and the statement of defense. On this point, too, the claimant has not specified what is incorrect about the PGA expert's assessment. Moreover, the claimant has not disputed that a joint meeting took place on January 26, 2023, in which the PGA expert explained the PGA approach and to which the claimant was able to respond.

18. The fact that the claimant later received a closing letter does not alter the foregoing.
The municipality will send such a letter if there are no further nuisances and/or police reports within a period of one year. The administrative report showed that no police registrations had taken place since February 7, 2023, so this letter was permitted to be sent. The sending of that letter makes no difference to the assessment of the period preceding it.

19. The above means that there was sufficient (factual) basis for processing the claimant's personal data.

Should the municipal executive cease the ongoing processing of the personal data?
20. The municipal executive interpreted the claimant's appeal as an appeal to cease processing the personal data. A data subject may object to the processing of personal data concerning them for reasons related to their specific situation. The municipal executive must then cease processing, unless there are compelling legitimate grounds to continue it.11 The court notes that, regardless of whether the claimant's objection should have been considered an appeal to cease processing the personal data, the assessment of the claimant's appeal depends on a balancing of interests. This balancing of interests is important because the municipal executive may have legitimate reasons for processing the claimant's personal data, but this should not mean that the claimant's rights are simply disregarded. In that case, the balancing of interests is necessary to assess which interest outweighs the claimant's in this situation. This concerns, on the one hand, the claimant's interests and, on the other hand, the municipal executive's interests, which constitute the legitimate interest in carrying out the task in the public interest.

21. The claimant argues that he has an interest in ceasing the processing of his personal data because he wants to focus on the future, and future burdensome decisions will be reviewed in the past. The Personal Data Protection Act (PGA) may affect his future prospects.

21. The municipal executive's interest lies in the fact that the processing of the personal data is necessary to achieve the objectives of the privacy regulations. The PGA must ensure an improvement in public order and safety in Amersfoort and also protects the safety of the data subject and others. The municipal executive considers it valuable to be able to support the claimant and his neighborhood in focusing on a peaceful living environment. At the hearing, the municipal representative explained that retaining the personal data is necessary in case problems arise (again) in the neighborhood.

21. In the court's opinion, the municipal executive's interest in retaining the claimant's personal data outweighs the claimant's interest in ceasing that processing. The purpose of retaining the data for the PGA, as also appears from the letter of February 8, 2024, is to request old data in the event of new reports of residential nuisance. This can help in offering appropriate, new assistance and contribute to protecting the safety of the claimant and others. The consequence outlined by the claimant in this case does not outweigh the municipal executive's interest in retaining the data. Retaining the data can contribute to quickly determining the severity of the situation and the appropriate intervention, which also benefits the claimant in terms of safeguarding his safety and living environment. Moreover, the retention of his personal data has already taken place for over a year, and it has not been asserted or demonstrated that this has had any adverse consequences for the claimant. The claimant has also not further substantiated the adverse consequences. In view of the foregoing, the municipal executive's interests are compellingly justified, meaning it is not required to cease processing the claimant's personal data.
The contested decision is flawed.
24. The fact that the processing of the personal data is justified and does not need to be ceased does not mean that the contested decision can be upheld. It is important to note that the municipal executive only sufficiently substantiated and substantiated the facts and circumstances underlying the application and placement in the Personal Data Protection Act (PGA) on appeal, with the statement of defense and the administrative report. The position that the PGA application is not an issue in these proceedings is incorrect in this regard. The contested decision only contains a balancing of interests and is therefore flawed. This means that the contested decision is eligible for annulment and that the appeal is well-founded. In view of the foregoing, the court, however, upholds the legal consequences.

Conclusion and consequences
25. The appeal is well-founded. The contested decision is annulled while upholding the legal consequences. This means that the processing of the claimant's personal data will not be halted. The claimant will be reimbursed for the court fees. He will also be reimbursed for his legal costs.
Decision
The court:
- declares the appeal well-founded;
- annuls the decision of 23 November 2023;
- orders that the legal consequences of the annulled decision remain in effect;
- orders the municipal executive to reimburse the claimant for the court fees of €187;
- orders the municipal executive to pay the claimant €1,814 in legal costs.

This judgment was rendered by Judge L. van 't Hof, in the presence of L.M. Kalkman, court clerk. Pronounced in open court on July 21, 2025.
