## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject submitted a request to the Minister for Legal Protection (now: the State Secretary for Justice and Security) to erase the files of her two sons held by the controller, the Child Protection Council (RvdK), pursuant to [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR"). The files contained documents regarding the termination of her parental rights to both her children.

On 15 September 2021, the Minister rejected the erasure request, arguing that the records should be retained under the Dutch Archives Act, and on 14 February 2022, he rejected the objection lodged against it.

The data subject filed an appeal before the court of first instance against the decision of the Minister.

By judgment dated 22 December 2022, the court dismissed it as unfounded. It held that the processing of the data subject’s children’s personal data was necessary for the fulfillment of a statutory processing obligation pursuant to [Article 17(3)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#3b "Article 17 GDPR").

The data subject filed an appeal before the highest administrative court (Council of State-Raad van State). She argued that since the custody termination order for her youngest son had been lifted the files must be deleted because their content was incorrect and therefore unlawful. She further argued that the measure of custody termination for the eldest son should also be lifted because it was based on the unlawful RvdK files.

### Holding

The court held that the data subject did not present any reasons why the processing of the personal data was unlawful, nor has there been any such evidence. She is therefore not entitled to the erasure of the personal data in the RvdK files under [Article 17(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1d "Article 17 GDPR"). It also pointed out that these proceedings could not lead to a judgment on the measure to terminate custody.

  
The court also ruled that RvdK was obliged by statutory law to retain the contested personal data in the files for the envisaged time period, according to the Dutch Archives Act. In the case of a custody order the time period would be 100 years. This means that, even if the personal data of the data subject and her children were unlawfully processed by the RvdK, the provisions of [Article 17(3)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#3b "Article 17 GDPR") would in principle preclude the right to erasure.

Judgment

202206218/1/A3.

Date of judgment: July 16, 2025

DIVISION

ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

Judgment on the appeal of:

\[appellant\], residing in \[place of residence\],

appellant,

against the judgment of the District Court of North Holland of December 22, 2022, in case no. 22/1529 in the proceedings between:

\[appellant\]

and

the Minister for Legal Protection (currently: the State Secretary for Justice and Security).

Procedural history

By decision of September 15, 2021, the Minister rejected \[appellant\]'s request for the deletion of personal data.

By decision of February 14, 2022, the Minister dismissed the objection lodged against this request by \[appellant\].

By judgment of December 22, 2022, the District Court dismissed the appeal lodged against this request by \[appellant\].

\[Appellant\] filed an appeal against this ruling.

The Minister submitted a written statement.

\[Appellant\] and the Minister submitted additional documents.

The Division heard the case at a hearing on July 29, 2024, at which \[appellant\] appeared.

After the hearing was closed, the Division reopened the investigation and referred it to a three-judge panel.

The Division heard the case at a further hearing on April 8, 2025, at which \[appellant\] and the Minister, represented by Mr. L.A. van Bergeijk and Mr. W.A.J. Bekker, appeared.

Considerations

Introduction

1. \[Appellant\] submitted a request to the Minister to destroy the files of her two sons held by the Child Protection Council (hereinafter: the Council for Child Protection). She made this request pursuant to Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter: the GDPR). The Minister rejected the deletion request because, in his opinion, the data must be retained under the Archives Act. He upheld the rejection of the deletion request on appeal.

Judgment of the Court

2. The Court considered that the processing of personal data of \[appellant\]'s sons in this case is necessary to comply with a statutory processing obligation as referred to in Article 17, paragraph 3, introductory sentence and (b), of the GDPR. In the Court's opinion, the Council for the Protection of Personal Data (RvdK) is subject to a statutory processing obligation under the Archives Act 1995 (hereinafter: the Archives Act). Since the exception under Article 17, paragraph 3, introductory sentence and (e), of the GDPR applies, the Court will not assess \[appellant\]'s assertion that the personal data were processed unlawfully and the arguments she presented in that regard. Grounds and Assessment of the Appeal

3. \[Appellant\] argues that the court wrongly ruled that the Council for the Protection of Children (RvdK) may retain the existing files on her sons. Now that Veilig Thuis has destroyed the file on her youngest son, \[appellant\] also wants the council files on her two sons to be destroyed because their content is incorrect and therefore unlawful. \[Appellant\] further argues that the measure terminating parental authority must also be terminated because it is based on the unlawful council files. The Minister argues that he cannot delete the files because he is required to retain them under the Archives Act.

3.1. Article 17, paragraph 1, introductory sentence and point (d), of the GDPR states:

"1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies:

\[…\]

d) the personal data have been unlawfully processed."

3.2. The Division finds that \[appellant\]'s main concern is the determination that the council files concerning her sons contain inaccurate information and that the measure terminating parental authority for her eldest son be lifted. The Division considers that a request for erasure under the GDPR is not suitable for a substantive assessment of the Council for the Protection of Children's Rights (RvdK) investigation (see the ruling of 10 April 2024, ECLI:NL:RVS:2024:1437, under 4.1). Furthermore, these proceedings cannot lead to a judgment on the measure to terminate parental authority. While it is understandable that the content of the council files has had, and may still have, significant consequences for \[appellant\] and her children, these proceedings cannot establish that the Council for the Protection of Children (RvdK) should not have initiated an investigation and that the personal data of \[appellant\] and her children should therefore not have been processed, as \[appellant\] wishes. \[Appellant\] has not put forward any other reasons why the processing of the personal data would be unlawful, and no such reasons have been demonstrated. Therefore, these proceedings have not established that there has been unlawful processing of data as referred to in Article 17, paragraph 1, introductory sentence and (d), of the GDPR. On this basis, \[appellant\] is therefore not entitled to erasure of the personal data in the council files.

3.3. The court also correctly determined that the Council for the Protection of Children (RvdK) is subject to a statutory processing obligation. This statutory processing obligation arises from Article 3 of the Archives Act. Based on this, the Council for the Protection of Children (RvdK) is obligated to ensure that archival documents, in this case the documents in the files of \[appellant\]'s children, are in good, orderly, and accessible condition and are kept in accordance with the applicable retention period (cf. the ruling of the Division of 14 October 2020, ECLI:NL:RVS:2020:2419). According to Part 11, Cluster I, Child Protection (page 93) of the selection list of the Ministry of Justice and Security and its legal predecessors from 5 May 1945 (Staatscourant of 12 April 2021, no. 17848), which was established pursuant to Article 5 of the Archives Act, notifications, requests, advice, and underlying documents, as well as correspondence, must be permanently retained in the event of a measure terminating parental authority and for 100 years after birth in all other cases. This means that, even if the personal data of \[appellant\] and her children had been unlawfully processed by the Council for the Protection of Personal Data (RvdK), the provisions of Article 17, paragraph 3, introductory sentence and (b) of the GDPR would, in principle, preclude the right to erasure.

3.4. The argument is unsuccessful.

Request for compensation

4. Finally, \[appellant\] requests compensation for the damage she claims has been caused by the unlawful processing of personal data in files held by the Council for the Protection of Personal Data (RvdK).

4.1. Pursuant to Article 82, paragraph 1, of the GDPR, anyone who has suffered damage as a result of a breach of the GDPR is entitled to compensation. As discussed above, there has been no breach of the GDPR in this case. Therefore, \[appellant\]'s request for compensation must be rejected (see the judgment of the Division of 6 December 2023, ECLI:NL:RVS:2023:4531).

Conclusion

5. The appeal is unfounded. The court's judgment is upheld.

6. The Minister is not required to reimburse legal costs.

I. upholds the contested judgment;

II. dismisses the request for compensation.
