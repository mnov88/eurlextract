## English Summary

### Facts

Data Controller (B) had entered into contract with defendant company to ensure back-up of personal data in case of physical or technical incidents, and to establish regular testing, assessment and evaluation of the efficiency of the technical and organisational measures.

Witness 2 explains, and this is uncontested, that the Data Controller was subject to a ransomware attack on 12ᵗʰ August 2020. The Data Controller’s systems were locked and they were unable to restore using back-ups.

t is found in the terms of service that the defendant has assumed obligations to ensure access and availability of processed data for the Data Controller.

Witness 1 has explained that they, as Executive Officer in the Data Controlling company, were unaware that they ought be in possession of an access key to the back-up. The witness for Data Controller explains that the defendant company had not established a procedure for testing, assessment and evaluation of the feasibility of using the back-up to restore access to the processed data.

vs.
Defendant ApS
CVR No.
Indictment received on 26 March 2024.
Defendant ApS is charged with violating
Article 32(1) of the Data Protection Regulation, cf. Section 41(1)(1) of the Data Protection Act, cf. Subsection 3, Subsection 6, Subsection 83(2) and Subsection 4(a), cf. Subsection 9
by a period from 25 May 2018 to August 12, 2020 – as data processor for Virksomhed ApS – for failing to comply with its obligation to implement appropriate security measures that could ensure a sufficiently high level of security for the data subjects, ¹where the defendant had not ensured that the backup copy that was taken of the personal data, including health data, that was processed for Virksomhed ApS, was in a state that could be used to restore access to the personal data, as the backup copy was locked with a key that the defendant had not secured, which meant that when outsiders encrypted Virksomhed ApS' medical record system on August 12, 2020, among other things, the personal data could not be restored from the backup copy and were therefore no longer accessible, and ²where the defendant had not established a procedure for regular testing, assessment and evaluation of the possibility of using the backup copy made to restore access to the processed personal data, which had the consequence that it was not discovered that a key to the backup copy was missing.

Claims
Std 75271

The prosecution has filed a claim for a fine.
The defendant has pleaded not guilty.
Case information
The defendant has given a statement through Director Witness 1 and Witness 2.
The statements are audio-recorded and are not reproduced in the judgment.
The defendant has not been previously punished
The court's reasoning and decision
According to Witness 2's explanation, and as undisputed by the defendant company, it is assumed that Virksomhed ApS was exposed to a ransomware attack on August 12, 2020, whereby the company's system was locked, and that the defendant company could not obtain access to the backup copy taken and thus restore access to the processed personal data.
It appears from the undated data processing agreement entered into between Virksomhed ApS and the defendant company, clause 2.4, that the defendant company, as a data processor, has, among other things, undertaken the obligation to ensure Virksomhed ApS' ability to promptly restore the availability of and access to personal data in the event of a physical or technical incident and to establish a procedure for regular testing, assessment and evaluation of the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of processing.
The witness has further explained that he, as the director of Virksomhed ApS, is not aware that Virksomhed ApS is supposed to be in possession of a key to the backup copy.
Director Witness 1 has explained that the defendant company has not established a procedure for testing, assessing and evaluating the possibility of using the backup copy to restore access to the processed information.
Regardless of whether it could be assumed, in accordance with Witness 1's explanation, that it is the customer himself who creates the code when installing the system and is instructed in connection with the installation that the customer is responsible for being in possession of the code, which the defendant company does not possess, the defendant company has thus not ensured that Virksomhed ApS was in possession of the key and thus had the ability to restore the availability of and access to the personal data on the backup in a timely manner. The fact that Appendix 4 of the dealership agreement states that the customer is responsible for setting up systems and the
page 3
software and code used cannot therefore lead to a different result. As a result of the above, the defendant company is found guilty in accordance with the charges brought.
The penalty is set at a fine of DKK 40,000, cf.
Article 32(1) of the Data Protection Regulation, cf. Section 41(1)(1) of the Data Protection Act, cf. Subsection 3, Subsection 6, cf. Article 83(2) and Subsection 4(a) of the Data Protection Regulation, cf. Subsection 9.
In determining the fine, the court has, among other things, placed emphasis on the nature of the offence, the number of persons affected, the risk of damage and the category of information to which the offence relates, as well as the information provided about the size of the defendant company, cf. the considerations mentioned in Article 83(2) and (4)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation. The court has also placed emphasis on the time that has elapsed since the offence was committed and the fine requested by the prosecution.
It is hereby declared that:
The defendant ApS shall pay a fine of DKK 40,000.
The defendant shall pay the costs of the case.
