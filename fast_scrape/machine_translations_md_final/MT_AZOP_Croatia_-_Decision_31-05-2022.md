Following on from the above, we point out that from May 25, 2018, in all states

directly applies Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016.

either by automated or non-automated means such as collecting, recording,
organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or modification, finding, performing insights,
use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available,
matching or combining, limiting, deleting or destroying.
Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation stipulates how personal data must be
lawfully, fairly and transparently processed with respect to the respondent, collected in special,
express and lawful purposes, appropriate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to
the purposes for which they are processed (principle of reducing the amount of data), accurate and, if necessary, up-to-date,
processed in a way that ensures adequate security of personal data, including
protection against unauthorized or illegal processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage
by applying appropriate technical or organizational measures (principle of integrity and
confidentiality).
It is also necessary to refer to Article 6, paragraph 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation, which
stipulates that the processing of personal data is legal only if and to the extent that it is
at least one of the following is fulfilled: the respondent has given his consent for the processing of his personal data

the obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the scope of their processing,
storage period and their availability. More specifically, such measures ensure that personal
data are not automatically, without individual intervention, available to an unlimited number of individuals.
Article 32, paragraph 2 of the General Regulation on Data Protection stipulates that by

The aforementioned results from the submitted statement of the School, as the processing manager, in which it states
as the relevant documentation is missing in the applicant's file.
From the established factual situation, it is clear how the documents were lost
which contain personal data of the applicant. In this regard, the School as a manager of personal data processing
of data, in the submitted statement states that it is possible that the documentation has disappeared
lost during renovation and relocation of equipment and furniture due to weather conditions.
Also, based on the documentation collected in the procedure, it was established that the School as
the processing manager did not respect the principle of completeness and confidentiality of personal data processing
on the basis of which it was obliged to ensure adequate security of personal data, including
protection against unauthorized or illegal processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage

32. General regulations on data protection. In the specific case, above all, we indicate the need
continuous education of persons employed in the processing of personal data, primarily in terms of
the obligation to safely dispose and process personal data in such a way that every possibility
reduce the loss/disappearance of documentation containing personal data of employees to a minimum
possible measure.
Also, the School, as a data controller, is obliged to introduce organizational measures to protect personal data
data, for example in such a way that the documentation containing the personal data of the respondent, such as
of natural persons is separated from documentation that does not contain such data. It would also be advisable
keeping records when issuing certain documents at the request of respondents, such as
natural persons. In addition, the School, as the manager of personal data processing, is obliged in the course of some
work activities when certain documents containing personal data are transferred
respondents to act with increased attention, all for the reason that there is no risk of accidental
or illegal destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of personal data or
unauthorized access to personal data that has been transferred, stored or otherwise
processed.
