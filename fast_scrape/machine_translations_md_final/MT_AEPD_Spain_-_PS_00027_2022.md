                            FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

                                            Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Re-

General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each authori-
quality of control and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of

digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: “The procedures processed

by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions of
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the regulations
comments dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with a sub-

sisidario, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

                                            II

In this case, we proceed to examine the initial claim dated 03/16/21

through which the following facts are transferred:

       “presence of video surveillance cameras in the family home” that “could
recording the public highway”, as well as access to family-owned housing.

The facts bring cause, apart from other implications in his criminal case, of the
installation of a system of video-surveillance cameras in a family home of which
the claimant temporarily disposes of the usufruct.

The installation of video surveillance cameras in the street corresponds solely and exclusively-
to the State Security Forces and Corps in the performance of functions

In accordance with the "evidence" available in this proceeding
disciplinary action, it is considered that the claimed party has proceeded to install a system
of video-surveillance cameras, made up of a single camera that captures from the

building façade a minimal portion of sidewalk, coinciding with the access to the
home garage.

       The installed system has an informative sign(s) indicating that it is

of a video-surveilled area, informing the person responsible for the treatment and the way of
exercise rights within the framework of the regulations in force.

       It has not been verified that a control of the entrances/exits is being exercised

       Article 22 section 2 of the LOPDGDD (LO 3/2018, December 5) provides:

       "Images of public roads may only be captured to the extent that it is
essential for the purpose mentioned in the previous section.

       Therefore, sometimes a minimum public space capture is allowed
essential for the protection of people or property, as is the case of
this analysis due, among other reasons, to the scarce portion of public sidewalk that limits

with access to the garage of the house.

       It is recalled that with this type of device it is not possible to exercise control of
the entrances / exits of the property, as it can be considered a means of coercion of

the freedom of its inhabitants, who can be intimidated by this type of
of devices being a conduct with reproach in other fields of law.

The presumption of innocence governs without exceptions in the sanctioning Law and has

to be respected in the imposition of any sanction, whether criminal or administrative
(TCo 13/1981), since the exercise of the sanctioning right in any of its
manifestations, is conditioned to the set of evidence and a procedure

contradictory in which one's own positions can be defended.

Pursuant to this principle, no sanction may be imposed based on the
guilt of the accused if there is no probative activity, which in the

appreciation of the authorities or bodies called to resolve, destroy this
presumption (TCo Auto 3-12-81).
