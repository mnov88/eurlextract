AFTER DUE CONSIDERATION
1.	The General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as ‘GDPR’), which replaced Directive 95/56, has been applicable since 25 May 2018.
In accordance with the provisions of Article 15 (1) GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not the personal data concerning him or her are being processed and, if so, the right of access to the personal data and information detailed in the cases referred to in that paragraph, whereas paragraph 3 of the same Article provides that the controller shall provide the data subject with a copy of the personal data processed.
In order to satisfy the right to information and access, a legitimate interest is not required, since this is inherent in and forms the basis of the data subject’s right of access in order to obtain knowledge of him/her and is entered in a file kept by the controller, in order to give effect to the basic principle of the law on the protection of personal data, which is transparency of processing as a condition for any further scrutiny of the data subject’s lawfulness by the data subject (see MFF 16/2017).Similarly, it is not necessary to rely on the reasons for which the data subject wishes to exercise the right of access.
If the controller does not act on the data subject’s request, he shall inform within one month of receipt of the request the data subject of the reasons for not taking action and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy (Article 12 (4) GDPR).This deadline may be extended by an additional two months, if necessary, taking into account the complexity of the request and the number of requests (Article 12 (3) GDPR).Please note that even when the controller does not keep a record of data of the subject, it is not therefore exempted from its obligation to provide a negative response (CoE 2627/2017).
Furthermore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 58 (2) (i) of the GDPR, each supervisory authority has, inter alia, the power to impose an administrative fine under Article 83, depending on the circumstances of each individual case.
2.	Evidence in the file and the hearing led to the following:
The complainant A by email to the Public Data Protection Officer of PPC S.A. had submitted a request for access to their physical and electronic communication for the period from 2015 to the present, but has not received a response. PPC divided by the Data Protection Officer through the clarifications document (No...) to the Authority, it replied that there is no physical and electronic correspondence requested by the complainant from the year 2015 to date. In addition, it stated that the administrator (HEDNO SA) made a de-activation of the benefit at the request of PPC, as the complainant did not comply with the settlement conditions and failed to pay off the debts due.
However, DEI, as the controller, did not respond to the complainant within one month of receiving the request and, as it should have been, did not inform the complainant within one month of receipt of the request, of the inability to respond immediately and of satisfaction of its request and of the reasons for the delay, in breach of the provisions of Article 12 (3) and (4) of the GDPR.The same infringement, namely the late reply of the PPC as a controller after one month from the receipt of the request, was found in the Authority’s previous Decision 15/2019.
3.	In view of the specific infringement that, after one month from the receipt of the request, PPC S.A., as the controller, did not respond to the complainant that it was not immediately successful, and in view of its repeated infringement as a result of the previous same infringement found in the above-mentioned Authority’s Decision 15/2019, the Authority finds by unanimity that, in the circumstances of this case, on the basis of the circumstances found, the first sentence of Article 58 (2) of the GDPR should be applied in an effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative fine in accordance with the provisions of of the GDPR.83 GDPR to punish such unlawful behaviour.
FOR THESE REASONS
Having regard to the above:
It shall impose on DEI AE the effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative pecuniary fine appropriate to the circumstances of the case, in accordance with the particular circumstances of this case, amounting to EUR 5.000,00. 
The Deputy Chairman
