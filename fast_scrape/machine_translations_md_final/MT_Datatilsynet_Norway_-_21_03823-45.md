The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (hereinafter referred to as ‘Datatilsynet’, ‘we’,
‘our’, ‘us’, ‘the supervisory authority’) is the competent supervisory authority pursuant to
Section 20 first paragraph of the Act relating to the processing of personal data (Personal Data
Act) and pursuant to Article 51 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and
of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the

processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive
95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter ‘GDPR’).

We hereby adopt a decision to issue a compliance order, impose a reprimand on and an
administrative fine to Telenor ASA (hereinafter also referred to as ‘controller’, ‘processor’,
‘company’, ‘enterprise‘, ‘undertaking’, ‘party’, ‘employer’, ‘you’ and ‘your’) for the reasons
outlined below. Telenor ASA is separate from the Telenor Group (hereinafter also referred to

as the ‘Group’), which consists of the parent company and subsidiaries (hereinafter also
referred to as ‘business units’).

Other concerned supervisory authorities in the EEA countries where Telenor has business
units (Denmark, Sweden and Finland) were consulted before the decision was adopted.

Excerpts from documents not available in Norwegian have been reproduced in the original
language. This includes Telenor ASA’s internal documents and job titles. For documents from
EU bodies, the Danish language version, alternatively English, is used.

Summary
After having received anonymous tips, Datatilsynet launched an inspection into Telenor
ASA’s compliance with the data protection officer (‘DPO’) requirements set out in Articles

37–39 GDPR and the organisational requirements set out in Article 24 GDPR. Based on the
inspection, our conclusion is that Telenor ASA has violated Articles 37(7), 38(2), 38(3), 24(1)
and 24(2) GDPR during the timeframe of the inspection. As a result of the inspection, we
issue a compliance order, impose a reprimand on and an administrative fine to Telenor ASA,
as further described in section 2.

2    Decision

Pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) GDPR and Article 24(1) and (2) GDPR, we hereby impose the
following orders on Telenor ASA:

    -   To carry out a documented internal assessment of whether Telenor ASA is obliged to
        appoint a data protection officer (DPO), which, among other things, takes into

        account Telenor ASA’s role in the various processing activities.

1Telenor ASA is the parent company of the Telenor Group.

                                                                                                3    -   To revise the record of processing activities, cf. Article 30 GDPR, and implement
        organisational measures to ensure that it at all times reflects an updated description
        of Telenor ASA’s processing activities, the number of data subjects and Telenor ASA’s
        roles.

    -   In the event that Telenor ASA is actually obliged to have a DPO, to implement
        organisational measures and appropriate policies with regard to the DPO’s
        organisation. This includes a description of the reporting line to a clearly defined
        highest management level, a description of the tasks the DPO should be involved in,
        as well as the manner and timing of such involvement. Assessments and measures to
        ensure independence and to avoid conflicts of interest include clearly distinguishing

        between any other roles in the job description, providing a separate email address for
        the DPO and carrying out a documented assessment of the DPO’s shareholding in the
        company.

Pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) GDPR, cf. Article 38(3) last sentence, we hereby impose a
reprimand on Telenor ASA for:

    -   not having a direct reporting line in place for the DPO of Telenor ASA to the highest
        management level for approximately one year of the timeframe of the inspection.

Pursuant to Article 58(2)(i) GDPR and Section 26 of the Norwegian Personal Data Act, we
hereby impose an administrative fine against Telenor ASA in the amount of NOK 4,000,000
for:

    -   not having implemented appropriate organisational measures to ensure and
        demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, in violation of Article 24(1) GDPR, and for
        not having implemented appropriate data protection policies, in violation of Article
        24(2) GDPR.

3    Background to the case

In 2021, the management of Datatilsynet decided to carry out an on-site inspection of Telenor
ASA. The object of the inspection was to clarify Telenor ASA’s compliance with the data
protection officer requirements set out in Articles 37–39 GDPR and the requirements for
appropriate organisational measures set out in Article 24 GDPR.

The original plan was to carry out the on-site inspection on 7 January 2022. However, due to
the Norwegian Government’s restrictions in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic, the inspection
had to be postponed to 28 January 2022, at which time Datatilsynet held several interviews
with executives and employees of Telenor ASA via video conference calls. The inspection
and interviews concerned factual circumstances in the period from 10 October 2020 until the

2The date when Datatilsynet was first notified of then DPO     . See the final inspection report of 30
September 2022, p. 2.

                                                                                               4interviews were conducted on 28 January 2022 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘timeframe of
the inspection’).

In our inspection notice dated 26 November 2021, we asked Telenor ASA for specific
documentation, which we received on 13 December 2021. We also asked for additional
documentation on 22 December 2021, which we received on 9 January 2022. Moreover, after
the interviews on 28 January 2022, we asked Telenor ASA to disclose their record of
processing activities, which we received on 2 February 2022. We sent our preliminary

inspection report to Telenor ASA on 11 April 2022 and received their comments on 16 May
2022. Telenor ASA’s comments have been addressed and incorporated into the final
inspection report.

For further details regarding the factual background to the present case, we refer to our final

inspection rapport dated 30 September 2022.

The new Director General of Datatilsynet, Line Coll, was appointed on 1 August 2022. In
summer 2023, Coll concluded that she was disqualified from considering the case due to
impartiality following her former role as partner in the law firm Wikborg Rein, where she had

provided legal counselling to Telenor ASA regarding Datatilsynet’s inspection. A request was
sent to the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development to appoint an acting
director general for the case. The Ministry concluded on 20 November 2023 that Coll was
disqualified from considering the case. Pursuant to Section 6 third paragraph of the
Norwegian Public Administration Act, a case in which the superior official is disqualified

may not be decided by any directly subordinate official in the same administrative agency.
However, according to theory and the interpretation of the wording of Section 6 third
paragraph, Datatilsynet’s employees may assist in handling the case and preparing decisions.

The Ministry appointed Mona Naomi Lintvedt as Acting Director General for this case, and

the decisions in the case were made under her direction. Since the final inspection report was
finalised after Coll took office, the Acting Director General has considered whether the
disqualification would affect the validity of the report. In an assessment dated 30 December
2023, she concluded that the final report did not contain any assessments or decisions, but
only described the facts and findings of the inspection, and that it was therefore not affected

by the disqualification of Datatilsynet’s Director General and employees.

An advance notification was issued on 1 March 2024 pursuant to Section 16 of the Public
Administration Act to enable the company to make written representations in relation to the
case before a decision was made.

Datatilsynet considers this to be a cross-border case in which the cooperation mechanism in
Article 60 GDPR applies, which means that a draft decision will be shared with the competent
supervisory authorities in the EEA. See also section 4.1 below. Due to the aforementioned
European cooperation and the fact that Telenor ASA’s working language is English, the

4dministration Act).

lawyer, we prepared a Norwegian version of the notification, which was sent to the company
on 18 April 2024. In the event of conflict, the Norwegian text shall take precedence. Wikborg
Rein, on behalf of Telenor ASA, submitted their comments on the advance notification on 31

May 2024 (hereinafter also referred to as the ‘response’).

4    Legal background

4.1   Competence, tasks and powers of supervisory authorities under the GDPR

We refer to Articles 55(1), 56(1) and 58(2) GDPR regarding Datatilsynet’s competence, tasks
and powers. We further refer to Article 83(1) to (5) GDPR regarding the imposition of
administrative fines and to Section 26 first paragraph of the Personal Data Act.

Article 3(1) GDPR reads as follows:

        ‘This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data in the context of the
        activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union, regardless of
        whether the processing takes place in the Union or not.’

The Telenor Group has operations and business units/offices (‘BUs’) both in and outside the
EEA:

        ‘The Telenor Group (of companies) consists of several autonomous legal entities,
        registered both in Norway and across the globe, with separate Boards of Directors.

        This includes the administrative headquarters and Group parent company Telenor
        ASA, and various “Business Units” (BUs), which are subsidiaries directly or indirectly
        controlled by Telenor ASA’.  5

Pursuant to Article 3(1) GDPR, the GDPR applies to all processing of personal data by

Telenor ASA where the company acts as controller, joint controller and/or data processor,
regardless of whether the processing activities take place in or outside the EEA.

With respect to the processing activities covered by the scope of the inspection, Telenor ASA
qualifies as controller (cf. Article 4(7) GDPR) or processor (cf. Article 4(8) GDPR),
                                      6
depending on the processing at hand. As controller and processor, Telenor ASA has its main
establishment in Norway, cf. Article 4(16) GDPR.

We consider the processing activities that fall within the scope of the present case to qualify
as ‘cross-border processing’ under Article 4(23) GDPR. In its comments on the advance
notification, Telenor ASA claims that the case is not of a cross-border nature because it does

not concern specific processing activities and – alternatively – because the processing does

 ‘Response to Datatilsynet’, 13 December 2021, p. 1.

                                                                                                6not meet the requirement of Article 4(23)(b) GDPR, in particular the condition that concerns
data subjects in more than one member state being ‘substantially’ affected.     7

We have considered Telenor ASA’s arguments, but uphold our assessment, which we will
elaborate on in more detail below.

First and foremost, it should be emphasised that, since the DPO must be involved in ‘all’
issues that relate to the protection of personal data, cf. Article 38(1) GDPR, the present case
covers all processing of personal data that takes place in connection with activities in Telenor
ASA. The documentation that Telenor ASA has sent to Datatilsynet shows that a wide range

of processing activities take place in connection with activities in Norway and in other
countries, both in and outside the EEA. The record of processing activities refers to several
‘countries of processing’ in the EEA (Denmark, Sweden, Finland etc.).. Several of these
processing activities actually concern the personal data of employees throughout the Telenor

Group, which means that they take place in connection with activities in several Telenor
business units in and outside the EEA. This in itself meets the requirement set out in Article
4(23)(a).

We note that, in the sense of the GDPR, ‘establishment’ entails ‘the effective and real exercise
of activity through stable arrangements. The legal form of such arrangements, whether
through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor in that
         9
respect’. In other words, the term ‘establishment’ does not only cover the place where the
controller or processor is formally incorporated; it also covers subsidiaries, branches and
agents abroad, such as ‘all Telenor companies’ in the EEA, cf. the column ‘recipients of

personal data’ in the record of processing activities. Therefore, we believe it is not correct, as
claimed in the response, that ‘\[g\]iven that Telenor ASA is only established in Norway, only
the provision in (b) can form the basis for characterising the processing as cross-border
processing’. Telenor ASA has, in the sense of the GDPR, several establishments in the EEA,

and it is therefore not only the provision in (b) that can form the basis for characterising the
processing.

In addition, in order to determine that the processing takes place ‘in the context of the

activities of establishments’ of a controller or processor, it does not need to be carried out
directly by that establishment. It is enough that the processing is related to the activities of
that company. Accordingly, the condition set out in Article 4(23)(a) GDPR is met with

respect to the processing activities described in the record of processing activities with several
EEA countries (‘countries of processing’) or involving Telenor subsidiaries or branches in the

employees of Telenor ASA).     12

Moreover, there are processing activities that take place in connection with the establishment
in Norway, but which substantially affect or are likely to substantially affect
data subjects in more than one EEA country. This is the case, for example, with regard to

‘multi-year surveys in Telenor’s markets to understand customer behaviours’, which,
according to the record of processing activities, affect                  customers in several EEA
countries through an analysis of their behaviour that may be particularly intrusive. The same

applies when processing activities in Norway affect all employees in the Telenor Group, such
as ‘Learning Management Systems’ and ‘Employee Share Plan’, which, according to the
record of processing activities, affect             data subjects. In our final inspection report,

we find that the number of employees in the Telenor Group during the timeframe of the
inspection is approximately 15,000. In this regard, it must be noted that the consistency
mechanism for cooperation between supervisory authorities applies when processing activities
substantially affect a significant number of data subjects in several EEA countries, cf. GDPR

Recital 135. We find that the condition concerning a significant number is met. We emphasise
that the condition concerning data subject being substantially affected is not a requirement
under Article 4(23)(a) GDPR, but only under (b), and it is therefore not strictly necessary to

demonstrate that the requirement is met in this case. In any case, the threshold is low for what
is considered to significantly affect data subjects. The EDPB’s guidelines assume, for
example, that it is sufficient if the actual processing in question affects or is likely to affect
                                                         14
individuals’ ‘health, well-being and peace of mind.’

The documentation collected by Datatilsynet has shown that Telenor ASA has internal
procedures and policies that are the same in all countries in which the Telenor Group

operates, thus affecting data subjects in several EEA countries. We assume that Telenor ASA
as the parent company and controller has the power to change and influence group policies.          16
The inspection has revealed that Telenor ASA, in addition to being the controller for certain

data processing activities, sometimes acts as processor on behalf of other business units and
may also act as joint controller with other business units, which in itself entails a cross-border
element. 17

12In this regard, it should be noted that, when the record of processing activities refers to the processing of
employees’ personal data, it refers to several thousand employees. It is therefore obvious not only employees of
Telenor ASA, cf. the columns ‘data subject categories’ and ‘number of data subjects’ in the record of processing
activities.

therefore apply in this case. Datatilsynet is competent to act as lead supervisory authority in
the case pursuant to Article 56(1). Pursuant to Article 60 GDPR, Datatilsynet shall cooperate
with the other supervisory authorities concerned. This entails exchanging relevant information

about the case and submitting a draft decision to the other supervisory authorities concerned
so that they can issue an opinion. Due account shall be taken of their views when deciding on
the case.

4.2   EEA and Norwegian law

The GDPR has been incorporated into Annex XI to the Agreement on the European Economic
Area (‘EEA Agreement’) by means of Decision of the EEA Joint Committee No 154/2018
(‘EEA Joint Committee Decision’).   18

Article 1(b) of the EEA Joint Committee Decision provides that:

    ‘\[…\] the terms “Member State(s)” and “supervisory authorities” shall be understood to
    include, in addition to their meaning in the Regulation, the EFTA States and their
    supervisory authorities, respectively.’

Furthermore, Article 1(c) of the EEA Joint Committee Decision reads as follows:

    ‘References to Union law or Union data protection provisions shall be understood as
    referring to the EEA Agreement or data protection provisions contained therein,
    respectively.’

The Personal Data Act incorporated the GDPR into Norwegian law. The Personal Data Act
and the GDPR entered into force in Norway on 20 July 2018.

5    Designation of data protection officer – Article 37

5.1   Inspection criteria and evidence

Article 37 GDPR reads as follows:

   1) The controller and the processor shall designate a data protection officer in any case
      where:

        a) the processing is carried out by a public authority or body, except for courts acting

            in their judicial capacity;

18 Decision of the EEA Joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 2018 amending Annex XI (Electronic
communication, audiovisual services and information society) and Protocol 37 (containing the list provided for in
Article 101) to the EEA Agreement OJ \[2018\] L 183/23.

                                                                                               9        b) the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing
            operations which, by virtue of their nature, their scope and/or their purposes,
            require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale; or

        c) the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on a large
            scale of special categories of data pursuant to Article 9 or personal data relating to
            criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10.

   2) A group of undertakings may appoint a single data protection officer provided that a

       data protection officer is easily accessible from each establishment.

   3) Where the controller or the processor is a public authority or body, a single data
       protection officer may be designated for several such authorities or bodies, taking
       account of their organisational structure and size.

   4) In cases other than those referred to in paragraph 1, the controller or processor or
       associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors may or,
       where required by Union or Member State law shall, designate a data protection

       officer. The data protection officer may act for such associations and other bodies
       representing controllers or processors.

   5) The data protection officer shall be designated on the basis of professional qualities
       and, in particular, expert knowledge of data protection law and practices and the ability
       to fulfil the tasks referred to in Article 39.

   6) The data protection officer may be a staff member of the controller or processor, or

       fulfil the tasks on the basis of a service contract.

   7) The controller or the processor shall publish the contact details of the data protection
       officer and communicate them to the supervisory authority.

We further refer to sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 in the final inspection report of 30 September
2022.

Article 30 GDPR reads as follows:

    1) Each controller and, where applicable, the controller’s representative, shall maintain a
        record of processing activities under its responsibility. That record shall contain all of
        the following information:

            a. the name and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, the joint

                controller, the controller’s representative and the data protection officer;
            b. the purposes of the processing;
            c. a description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal
                data;
            d. the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be
                disclosed including recipients in third countries or international organisations;

                                                                                                  10            e. where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an
                international organisation, including the identification of that third country or
                international organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second
                subparagraph of Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards;
            f. where possible, the envisaged time limits for erasure of the different categories
                of data;
            g. (g) where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational

                security measures referred to in Article 32(1).
    2) Each processor and, where applicable, the processor’s representative shall maintain a
        record of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a controller,
        containing:
            a. the name and contact details of the processor or processors and of each
                controller on behalf of which the processor is acting, and, where applicable, of
                the controller’s or the processor’s representative, and the data protection

                officer;
            b. the categories of processing carried out on behalf of each controller;
            c. where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an
                international organisation, including the identification of that third country or
                international organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second
                subparagraph of Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards;
            d. (g) where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational

                security measures referred to in Article 32(1).

    3) The records referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be in writing, including in
        electronic form.

    4) The controller or the processor and, where applicable, the controller’s or the

        processor’s representative, shall make the record available to the supervisory authority
        on request.

    5) The obligations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to an enterprise or an
        organisation employing fewer than 250 persons unless the processing it carries out is
        likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the processing is
        not occasional, or the processing includes special categories of data as referred to in

        Article 9(1) or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to
        in Article 10.

5.2   Datatilsynet’s assessment

5.2.1 Concerning the designation of a DPO

Telenor ASA had designated a qualified DPO within the meaning of Article 37(5) GDPR
throughout the timeframe of the inspection and had communicated the contact details to us.
This is undisputed.

                                                                                                  11Whether Telenor ASA fell within Article 37(1), under which the designation of a DPO is
mandatory, or whether it was a voluntary arrangement was never an issue during the
inspection. This was therefore not discussed further in the inspection report or in the
notification of the decision. It was assumed in the case that Telenor ASA had appointed a

DPO, in which case it follows from the European Data Protection Board’s (EDPB) Guidelines
on Data Protection Officers that the requirements for the role set out in Articles 38 and 39 are
the same as for cases where the designation of a DPO is mandatory.     19

After receiving an advance notification, Telenor ASA stated in a letter dated 31 May 2024
that the company’s DPO function had been terminated because they believed that the
company’s processing activities do not fall under the requirement for mandatory designation

set out in Article 37. Datatilsynet was formally notified of the termination on 11 June 2024.
Telenor ASA did not elaborate on why they had found that the company was not required to
appoint a DPO, but assumes this as a fact without further documentation.

We reproduce the following from the EDPB’s Guidelines on Data Protection Officers:

        ‘When an organisation designates a DPO on a voluntary basis, the requirements under
        Articles 37 to 39 will apply to his or her designation, position and tasks as if the
                                           20
        designation had been mandatory.’

We find that the requirements in Articles 37–39 GDPR are applicable in this case under any
circumstances. Whether Telenor ASA is obliged to have a DPO or not cannot influence the

assessment of sanctions, including the amount of an administrative fine.

The above guidelines also state:

        ‘Unless it is obvious that an organisation is not required to designate a DPO, the
        WP29 recommends that controllers and processors document the internal analysis
        carried out to determine whether or not a DPO is to be appointed, in order to be able to
                                                                                        21
        demonstrate that the relevant factors have been taken into account properly.’

The EDPB refers to Article 24(1) GDPR in this context and continues:

                                                                                          22
        ‘This analysis is part of the documentation under the accountability principle’, cf.
        Article 5(2) GDPR.

In our notification of the on-site inspection of 26 November 2021, we specifically requested

documentation on the designation of the DPO as part of the internal control, cf. Article 24(2)

19WP 243 rev.01 ‘Guidelines on Data Protection Officers’ adopted on 13 December 2016, last revised and

GDPR. A documented internal assessment of the basis on which Telenor ASA’s DPO was
appointed was not submitted to Datatilsynet, not then or at a later date. Such documentation is
necessary to be able to demonstrate that you have carried out a genuine assessment in which
all relevant factors have been taken into account. We therefore assume that such an

assessment did not exist. Such an assessment should be carried out in accordance with the
accountability principle unless it is obvious that the company is not obliged to designate a
DPO, which is not obvious in this case. At no stage during the inspection, either in writing or
orally, have you mentioned or claimed that you believe that Telenor ASA’s DPO has operated
on a voluntary basis. That claim only appears in your comments on the advance notification.

So far, we have understood that it was agreed that Telenor ASA is obliged to have a DPO,
based on the information provided by Telenor ASA during the inspection.

To be able to answer the question of whether Telenor ASA is obliged to designate a DPO

pursuant to Article 37(1)(b) GDPR, it must be considered whether Telenor ASA’s core
activities in its role as controller or processor consist of processing operations that, by virtue
of their nature, their scope and/or their purposes, require regular and systematic monitoring of
data subjects on a large scale. Telenor ASA claims that the company does not process

‘personal data about employees in any other way or to a greater extent than is usual and
necessary for other companies with employees. The processing is related to appointments,
payroll, personnel administration, training and other routine activities that require handling of
employees’ personal data. These processing activities constitute necessary support functions
                                                              24
and must be considered side activities, not core activities.’

It is undisputed that necessary personnel administration and regular IT support are standard in
all enterprises and are not considered core activities. For that matter, Telenor ASA has not
                                      25
reported what its core activities are. In your comments of 31 May 2024, the company is
described as follows:

        ‘an administrative company with very limited operational activities, with a limited

        number of office employees and with mainly low-risk processing activities. Telenor
        ASA is not a telecom operator and nor does it provide such services to corporate or
        retail customers. Telenor ASA is primarily the controller for the processing of
        personal data about its own employees and its own suppliers etc., and otherwise has a

        limited role as processor in certain relations.’

We would also like to remind you that the obligation to designate a DPO is not only
incumbent on the controller, but also the processor. When assessing whether the company is

obliged to have a DPO, Telenor ASA must therefore take into account not only the processing

information/documentation be sent to us by 13 December 2021, cf. Article 58(1) GDPR:

                                                                                                 13activities it carries out as controller, but also as processor. All processing activities in the
company must be considered when deciding on this issue. As explained in more detail in the

following sections, the record of processing activities shows that Telenor ASA carries out far
more processing activities of a greater scope than simple HR tasks. In our opinion, it is not
obvious that Telenor ASA’s processing activities are as limited as claimed in the response. On

the contrary, the response confirms that Telenor ASA carries out processing activities that
include more than just the processing of HR data for employees of Telenor ASA, and that
Telenor ASA also acts as processor.    27

As we will return to, Article 24(1) GDPR requires that the controller implements appropriate
organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed
                                                                    28
in accordance with the GDPR, which demands internal control. It is undisputed in
Norwegian law theory that the assessment of an undertaking is obligated to design a DPO
shall be documented and is a part of then internal control pursuant to Article 24 GDPR. This  29

is necessary to ensure and be able to demonstrate compliance like Article 24 requires. When
Telenor ASA was not able to demonstrate such documented assessment, it thus is a violation
of Article 24 GDPR.

5.2.2    On the obligation to keep records of processing activities under Article 30 GDPR

It is undisputed that Telenor ASA is obliged to keep a record of processing activities in

accordance with Article 30 GDPR, and that the company does not fall under the exception in
Article 30(5) as it has more than 250 employees. A record of processing activities must
include a description of the purposes of processing, categories of personal data, categories of

data subjects and the role of Telenor ASA as controller, joint controller and/or processor.
Datatilsynet requested a copy of the record of processing activities at the end of the day of the
inspection, 28 January 2022. Telenor ASA sent us the record in an email on 2 February 2022,

without a disclaimer.

Telenor ASA makes a point that the record of processing activities ‘was not requested by
                                                                                          30
Datatilsynet until the summary meeting at the very end of the day of th31inspection’ and that
‘the record was not an issue when the inspection was carried out’. Furthermore, Telenor
ASA claims that the information in the record of processing activities has also not been
subject to contradiction and that ‘the company’s attempt to explain the processing activities
                                                                               32
that take place in Telenor ASA has not been followed up by Datatilsynet’.

26See Article 38(1) GDPR on the involvement of DPOs in all issues relating to the protection of personal data
and Article 4(2), which defines ‘processing’.

several opportunities for contradiction in accordance with the Public Administration Act
Section 17.

We emphasise the obligation in Article 30(4) GDPR that the record must be available to

Datatilsynet on request. This is a key document that provides an overview of the scope of
processing activities that takes place in an enterprise. This applies regardless of whether the
record of processing activities is subject to inspection or, as in this case, whether other matters
are being investigated. There is therefore no doubt that Telenor ASA was not only obliged to
keep a record of processing activities, but that it was also obliged to make this record
available to Datatilsynet on request.

We emphasise again that the obligation to keep an updated record of processing activities that
meets the requirements of Article 30 is incumbent on Telenor ASA as controller and
processor. We refer to section 13.2.

5.2.3 Concerning the content of the record of processing activities, including Telenor
        ASA’s role and division of responsibilities

Datatilsynet incorporated relevant information in the record of processing activities in its
preliminary inspection report of 11 April 2022. Telenor ASA provided its comments on the
report in a letter of 16 May 2022. Telenor ASA’s comments were incorporated into the final
inspection report of 30 September 2022. In a letter of 2 November 2022, we gave you an
opportunity to state your opinion on what should be exempt from public disclosure, cf. the

Freedom of Information Act Section 13 first paragraph and the Public Administration Act
Section 13 second paragraph (2). In connection with this, Telenor ASA submitted a second
round of comments and appendices on the report in a letter dated 24 November 2022. Telenor
ASA’s input was taken into account in the advance notification that was sent to Telenor ASA
for contradiction, first in English on 1 March 2024 and then in Norwegian on 18 April 2024.
Telenor ASA submitted its comments on the notification and the inspection report with

appendices in a letter dated 31 May 2024, which contained some new claims and information.

Among other things, the letter stated:

        ‘Telenor does not dispute that, under the circumstances, the structure of the record of
        processing activities may appear difficult to grasp and therefore cause some confusion.

        The decisive factor, however, is what type of processing activities actually take place
        in Telenor ASA.’

Datatilsynet considers that Telenor ASA has been given ample opportunity to clarify what
they consider to be unclear, but not least, this emphasises the importance of having an
accessible, reliable and clear record of processing activities in place as part of the mandatory

33Comments on the advance notification of 31 May 2024, p. 11.

                                                                                               15internal control, cf. Article 24 GDPR. The record forms part of the evidence investigated
during the timeframe of the inspection and must contain factual descriptions of the processing
activities that actually take place. Telenor ASA’s claim that we ‘appear to hold Telenor ASA
                                                                       35
accountable for the activities that take place in Telenor Norge AS’ is unfounded and not
correct. The scope of the inspection is Telenor ASA and the processing activities that Telenor
ASA is responsible for as controller, joint controller and/or processor.

Furthermore, after the inspection had been carried out, Telenor ASA had the opportunity to
clarify and change the record to make it more up to date if necessary. It appears from the
response that the company was aware that the record was not complete or appropriately
           36
structured. Although this was not the subject of the inspection, Telenor ASA had and
continues to have a vested interest in ensuring that the record of processing activities meets
the requirements of Article 30. The record constitutes important documentation for both
internal and external use and should be updated as necessary. The purpose is precisely to

ensure that the record documents actual processing activities, as the company itself refers to in
its response. As Telenor ASA states, the record of processing activities was created by
different people filling in information:

        ‘As mentioned, the entries in the record were written by employees in the line
        organisation who know the individual activities well, but who do not necessarily have
        special knowledge of the GDPR, or who otherwise maintain a level of legal
                   37
        precision.’

If it was known that the quality was poor, it would be natural for someone to be assigned

responsibility for overseeing the record as an overall document, as an obligatory
organisational measure cf. Article 24(1) GDPR. Pursuant to Article 24(1) GDPR the company
shall implement measures precisely to ensure and demonstrate GDPR compliance, including
the duty to ensure that the record of processing activities is correct and updated at all times cf.
                   38
Article 30 GDPR. This is also something the DPO could have been involved in, cf. Article
38(1) GDPR. The record of processing activities also constitutes an important tool for the
DPO to be able to maintain an overview of the company’s processing activities, and thus also
to determine which areas the DPO should become involved in.

In its response, Telenor ASA mention that the record of processing activities does not reflect
its actual processing activities. This is something they have had several opportunities to

comment on to Datatilsynet. We maintain that, also on this point, Telenor ASA has been
given an opportunity for contradiction during the course of the case. Telenor ASA has

received previously.

It appears from Telenor ASA’s record of processing activities that Telenor ASA processes
personal data about its own employees (current, former and potentially future), next of kin
and family members of employees, customers of the Telenor Group, suppliers, other

contractual partners, consultants, hired resources, visitors (on site and online), board members
and members of the Corporate Assembly and the nomination committee.           39

Furthermore, it is clear from the record that Telenor ASA also processes personal data
provided by other subsidiaries of the Telenor Group; see also section 3.3.2 in the final
inspection report. First and foremost, this concerns personal data about employees of the
                                         41                                                 42
Telenor Group (approximately 15,000 ), but also to a limited extent about customers.

In the record, Telenor ASA describes that they act as controller for many processing
activities, including internal notification, investigations, surveys, audio recordings of

meetings, evaluations, talent development, nonconformity reports etc. from the following
entities: Group Internal Audit & Investigation, Group Legal, Group People & Sustainability
and Group Strategy & Ext. Relations.    43

In two instances, Telenor ASA states that have joint controllership. In its comments on the
advance notification, Telenor ASA states that ‘there are or have been very few instances

where the Group has joint controllership’ and that they believe it ‘is incorrect when the
supervisory authority, for example, seems to assume that we have joint controllership to any
significant degree’. Datatilsynet finds that, in this context, the number of processing activities
is less important than, for example, the nature and scope of the activities, including the

number of data subjects and/or purposes that require regular and systematic monitoring on a
large scale, cf. Article 37(1)(b).

One processing activity concerns HR information processed in the system                     by
Group People & Sustainability for all employees in the Group (approx. 15,000). Telenor ASA
explains:

        ‘           is Telenor’s core HRIS maintaining an overview of all of our employees
        and the organizational structure.             contains employees \[sic\] personal
        information, job/role and employment related details, compensation and benefits
                                                                   45

                                                                                                   17        ‘probably to a somewhat greater extent during the timeframe of the inspection than is
        the case today, had an IT administrator role in place who was responsible for the tools
        that the Telenor Group uses to handle employee information                    as well as to

        facilitate information to and interaction between employees                   . Also during
        the timeframe of the inspection, it was clear from a legal point of view that it was the
        individual company in the Telenor Group that used the system that was the controller
                                 46
        as regards its own use.’

It is the processing activities during the timeframe of the inspection that form the basis for the
decision. According to the record of processing activities, Telenor ASA describes that they

have joint controllership for the            processing activities. The fact that the individual
company in the Telenor Group has controllership for the processing does not in any way
reduce the responsibility that rests with Telenor ASA as joint controller. It is not the case that
joint controllers necessarily have the same degree of responsibility. Datatilsynet notes that

Telenor ASA states that, during the timeframe of the inspection, they processed employee
data on behalf of the whole Group, both as joint controller and as processor.     48

The second processing activity for which Telenor ASA states that the company has joint

controllership concerned                                                 , which, according to the
record, was put on hold, but was scheduled to restart in the first quarter of 2022. It appears
that the data subjects are customers, and the number is estimated to be                . The
processing is described by Telenor ASA as follows: ‘Processing of aggregated market

research data (customers and non-customers) to produce charts, overviews, summary tables –
and executive level reporting.’  49

In addition, Telenor ASA describes in the record of processing activities that they act as
processor for several different processing activities. Group Internal Audit & Investigations
processes internal audits that affect current and former employees, consultants, suppliers and
customers, and the number of data subjects is given as                 .

Telenor Research under Group Strategy & Ext. Relations acts as processor for, among other
things, the following:  50

 Multi-country, multi-year surveys in Telenor’s markets to understand customer behaviours.      Customers

 The purpose of the processing activity is to train machine learning algorithms on audio and    Current Employees;

 transcription data for speech recognition. The data comes from Telenor Norway.                 #Customers

        details;#Location;#Identification;#Life history and events;#Behavior;#Preferences or
        interests;#Location’ 51

The number of data subjects involved in processing activities for which Telenor ASA acts as
processor is stated to a minimum of 100–250 to a maximum of 25K–100K.         52

In our inspection report, we wrote the following on pp. 8–10:

        ‘The former DPO of Telenor ASA has repeatedly pointed out unclarified issues with
        regard to controllership. In the PowerPoint presentation presented to the GU Forum on

        9 September 2021, the following risks were highlighted:

                ‘Internal data sharing governance – Personal data is shared between business
                units within Telenor without adequate data sharing governance, including legal

                transfer mechanisms, clear definition of controller/processor relationships, and
                generally diffusion of responsibility.’3

            •   ‘Lack of transparency into existing agreement setups \[+I/P\]
            •   Often symptoms showing of unclear division of responsibility \[+I/P\]
            •   Lack of knowledge re. differing legal requirements in TN-regions \[+I/P\]

            •   Differing opinions and non-standardization of roles and terms for business
                initiative governance \[+P\]’ 54

In relation to the description above, Telenor ASA has commented that it is misleading
because the concerns were related to the processing that Telenor ASA mainly carries out, i.e.
the processing of employee data. Furthermore, Telenor ASA claims that there is no ambiguity
regarding the processing of customer data, ‘which is mainly carried out by Telenor ASA’s

various subsidiaries as telecom operators, and where Telenor ASA’s role in this, if any, is
primarily as processor through Telenor Research and GIAI’.     55

                                                                                                19Datatilsynet has no basis for determining that the statement from the external DPO applies to
customer data, but cannot see how the description can possibly only concern employee data in
Telenor ASA. The concern relates to the sharing of personal data between ‘Business Units’ in
the Telenor Group. Telenor ASA has not presented any arguments or documentation to
support the claim that the general description above applies to employee data. Regardless of
the personal data in question, it appears that the division of responsibility has been unclear.

Furthermore, the external DPO has expressed the following in an email correspondence in the
context of Schrems II issues, which shows concern with regard to the division of
controllership in general:

    •   ‘In my opinion, for initiatives rolled out by, or directed by ASA, ASA should be
        regarded a “data controller” under the law and through that will have several

        obligations to adhere to which cannot simply be outsourced. That is not to say that
        some concrete activities may not be outsourced, but privacy accountability cannot, and
        consequently a not insignificant level of involvement by ASA business-, system- and
        contract owners will be required regardless of outsourcing. Put differently, as long as

        ASA has an operational involvement in business activities involving processing of
        personal data, whether it’s within ASA itself or exercised upon other businesses
        through ASAs role as HQ, there are privacy obligations to adhere to that ASA cannot
        fully escape. With that said, I am of course looking forward to Group Legal’s

        assessment on this topic!

    •   Currently, there seems to be a dilution of responsibility between the entities
        mentioned, where no single party takes full responsibility of privacy issues/activities
        or is even capable of doing it. For example:

            o BUs may be struggling with the conundrum of being “accountable for their
               own privacy”, while at the same time being required to adopt what comes
               down the pipe from ASA/GSS/TPC and themselves being unable to impact

               product/system features, contracts or even privacy assessments – and expecting
               that things they are directed to do business wise has been properly checked out
               privacy wise, which is often not the case;

            o GSS may be expected to implement systems and features as prescribed by a
               business owner at ASA, even potentially impacting data flows or data access

               of other BUs or between ASA/BUs, but where GSS is lacking ownership,
               involvement or access to assessments or contracts/frameworks enabling this;

            o TPC may be entering into contracts under their mandate, which then typically
               has a commercial focus and an inadequate privacy focus, impacting all later
               (privacy) activity down the chain;

            o ASA does not have (my opinion) the proper awareness, competence and/or
               resources to do necessary compliance work with sufficient quality and

               timeliness (including catching up with backlog), on behalf of itself or group

                                                                                              20                initiatives that other BUs must rely upon. There are simply things falling
                                                                            56
                through the cracks with how things are currently set up.’

Telenor ASA has pointed out that the first paragraph in the citation specifically relates to a
potential outsourcing of certain operational privacy-related tasks in Telenor ASA to Telenor
Global Shared Services (GSS), which has not been carried out to date. Telenor ASA therefore
is of the opinion that the first paragraph is not relevant to the inspection, and that these
                                                                                              57
general concerns have been followed up in dialogue between the DPO and management.
Even if the email was sent in that context, it is necessary to look at the wording. The wording
he uses is ‘for initiatives rolled out by, or directed by ASA’. Datatilsynet therefore finds the
statement relevant, as it reflects a concern with regard to understanding the division of
responsibilities for different processing activities, even if the specific outsourcing was not

carried out.

Telenor ASA does not consider our mentioning in the inspection report of Telenor ASA’s
processing of customer data to be a suitable description of its actual processing activities.  58
We have written the report and advance notification of the decision based on the documents

submitted, including information provided in the record of processing activities and in
interviews. If the descriptions are still not accurate, this is due to the fact that information
previously received from the company has been inadequate or incorrect. We note that it was
not until the case culminated in the notification of the decision that we received more detailed

information in the company’s response.

In its comments on the advance notification, Telenor claims that Telenor ASA does not
process large amounts of customer data and/or personal data of a more intrusive nature as
processor, despite the fact that our opinion is based on the descriptions in their record of

processing activities.

In its comments on the advance notification, Telenor ASA states that:

        ‘In this system, there are certain standardised and partly pre-filled text boxes and

        hashtags that the person who fills in the record chooses from, which in certain cases
        may lead to the contents of the protocol being misunderstood/filled in incorrectly, for
        example in the indication of who the data subjects are, the number of data subjects, the
        types of personal data being processed etc. In retrospect, Telenor acknowledges that

        there are such sources of misunderstandings and errors in the document that has been
        submitted to Datatilsynet. For example, the company acknowledges that figures have
        been given for a number of items that may leave the impression that personal data
        processing takes place on a larger scale and of a more extensive scope than is actually
        the case. Based on the indication of the types of data being processed, it is in some

        places easy to misunderstand what the processing actually concerns and the type of
        information involved. There are also other aspects of the actual setup used that the

  Comments on the advance notification of 31 May 2024, pp. 16–17.

                                                                                                  21        company acknowledges has affected the content of the submitted material in a way

        that can lead to incorrect conclusions or misunderstandings. It is therefore unfortunate
        that Datatilsynet has relied on a literal interpretation of the content, without taking into
        account Telenor’s attempt to explain the facts that form the basis for the extraction.’   59

As mentioned above, it is Telenor ASA’s responsibility, as controller and processor, to ensure
that the record of processing activities is completed and up to date. This includes ensuring that
the information is correct. The company must expect Datatilsynet to rely on and base its
decision on the content of the submitted record of processing activities. That is the very
purpose of a record of processing activities cf. GDPR recital 82:

        ‘In order to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller or processor
        should maintain records of processing activities under its responsibility. Each
        controller and processor should be obliged to cooperate with the supervisory authority

        and make those records, on request, available to it, so that it might serve for
        monitoring those processing operations.’

If the company itself considers that the record of processing activities was, and still is,
misleading, it falls within the obligation set out in Article 30, supplemented by Article 24, to

ensure that the record of processing activities is revised and updated. If the content has
deficiencies because different people have lacked the competence required to complete the
record or the solution used is not suitable. Telenor ASA should have ensured to have
procedures or follow-up measures in place, or other appropriate organisational and technical

measures to ensure that the record is as up to date and correct as possible. If information is
available in other more suitable systems, we expect this to have been forwarded along with
the response.

We note that the response provides more detailed information. This is useful, but in our
opinion, this shows that the processing activities referred to are of a significant scope and that
Telenor ASA’s processing activities are not limited to simple HR management for employees
of Telenor ASA. Again, this information confirms that the company also acts as joint
controller and as processor, and not only as controller. This must be included in the

assessment of, among other things, whether the company is obliged to have a DPO. It also
emerges in the response that Telenor ASA processes customer data to some extent when they
write: ‘it is essentially the mobile companies in the Telenor Group that process data related to
external customers, and not Telenor ASA’ (our italics).

We also remind you that whether an enterprise acts as controller, joint controller and/or
processor depends on the actual circumstances and not on formal roles. Regardless of which
group structure Telenor has chosen and what role is defined for Telenor ASA, it is the actual

basis.

5.2.4 Regarding contact information

On the day of the inspection, we were unable to find contact information for Telenor ASA’s
DPO on Telenor’s website. Telenor ASA explained that the contact details were available on
the intranet for employees since the majority of personal data processing concerns employees
                       62
and internal relations. This has not been verified, but we assume that it was known to the
employees who Telenor ASA’s DPO was and how to make contact with that person.

Datatilsynet notes that it is of utmost importance that all data subjects, internal and external,
have easy access to the contact details of the company’s DPO, regardless of whether the

company acts as controller or processor. We regard this as a precondition for being able to
safeguard the data subject’s rights set out in Article 38(4) GDPR. Therefore, the DPO’s
contact information should be published for example on the company’s website, and it should
be clear that the receiver of the emails to that address is in fact the DPO. For example, a
generic email address to customer service would not be satisfactory in our opinion.

Our assessment is that this constitutes a partial violation of Article 37(7) GDPR, but we
otherwise find Telenor ASA to be in compliance with Article 37 GDPR, within the scope of
the inspection. We note that Telenor ASA updated the online privacy statement on 3 February
2022 with the DPO’s contact details.  63

5.2.5 Conclusion

The inspection has uncovered unclear and incomplete records of processing activities at
Telenor ASA and ambiguities that need to be resolved regarding, among other things, Telenor

ASA’s responsibility for certain processing activities, categories of personal data and the
number of data subjects. The record of processing activities must be made available to
Datatilsynet on request, cf. Article 30(4) GDPR and Recital 82 GDPR. This means that the
company must be aware of the importance of maintaining the record and that it can and will
be used as evidence in connection with an inspection.

Based on Telenor ASA’s processing activities, as described above, we are of the opinion that
it is not obvious that the company is not obliged to have a DPO. This must first be seen in
conjunction with the company’s role as controller, joint controller and processor, respectively,
and secondly with what these activities actually entail. Telenor ASA must therefore consider
whether it is obliged to have a DPO and document this assessment before a conclusion can be

made.

                                                                                                236    Involvement of the data protection officer – Article 38(1) GDPR

6.1   Inspection criteria and evidence

Article 38(1) GDPR reads as follows:

‘The controller and the processor shall ensure that the data protection officer is involved,
properly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data.’

Furthermore, when carrying out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA), the controller
has a specified obligation to seek the advice of the DPO pursuant to Article 35(2) GDPR. We

further refer to sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 in the final inspection report of 30 September 2022.

6.2   Datatilsynet’s assessment

According to the wording of Article 38(1) GDPR, the DPO shall be involved ‘properly’ and
‘in a timely manner’ in all data protection issues. These requirements demand a
proportionality assessment, as what is ‘properly’ and a ‘timely manner’ will vary depending

on the complexity and nature of the relevant data protection issues. This requires the
controller to have appropriate measures in place, e.g. internal procedures, to ensure that the
involvement of the DPO meets the requirements of Article 38(1) GDPR. Without any form of
internal, documented standard procedures, it will be difficult for the employees to evaluate
what is ‘properly’ and ‘timely’ in each situation.

The Guidelines on Data Protection Officers from the former Article 29 Data Protection
Working Party (WP29), which were endorsed by the European Data Protection Board
(EDPB), set out examples of what enterprises should do to comply with the provision at hand:

       ‘\[…\] the organisation should ensure, for example, that:

           •   The DPO is invited to participate regularly in meetings of senior and middle
               management.
           •   His or her presence is recommended where decisions with data protection
               implications are taken. All relevant information must be passed on to the DPO
               in a timely manner in order to allow him or her to provide adequate advice.

           •   The opinion of the DPO must always be given due weight. In case of
               disagreement, the WP29 recommends, as good practice, to document the
               reasons for not following the DPO’s advice.
           •   The DPO must be promptly consulted once a data breach or another incident
               has occurred.

       Where appropriate, the controller or processor could develop data protection
       guidelines or programmes that set out when the DPO must be consulted.’     64

64WP 243 rev.01 ‘Guidelines on Data Protection Officers’, p. 14.

                                                                                             24The EDPB’s guidelines are not binding, but set out elements that are relevant in an
assessment of whether an organisation complies with Article 38(1) GDPR. The EDPB’s
guidelines reflect the common understanding and practice of the EEA’s data protection

supervisory authorities. They are therefore a relevant source for interpreting the GDPR, in
particular in view of ensuring consistent application of the GDPR across the EEA, as required
by Articles 51(2) and 70(1) GDPR.    65

The Telenor Group’s Group Privacy Policy prescribes that each company within the group
(Business Units):

        ‘shall appoint a Data Protection Officer who advises and reports on privacy matters to
        the top level of management in the Business Unit \[…\]’.    66

The Telenor Group’s Group Manual Privacy Policy states that the DPO must:

        ‘\[a\]dvise management and personnel in the Business Unit on risks and best practices
        related to processing of personal data, including the resources needed and effort

        required in order to manage privacy risk in the processing activities of the Business
        Unit and the privacy impact of processing activities’. 67

These two internal documents set out overarching obligations on a general level for all

companies within the group, including Telenor ASA.

Pursuant to the Group Privacy Manual, a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) should as

a minimum:

        ‘\[i\]nclude an independent recommendation from the DPO before the assessment is
        concluded’. 68

Furthermore, in the event of privacy incidents, the DPO should as a minimum:

        ‘be consulted for his/her independent opinion on assessments of the breach impact and

        the risk it poses to the individuals, as well as the effect of mitigating controls in
        limiting the incident’.69

Other than what follows from the above-mentioned general internal requirements for all
companies in the Telenor Group, Datatilsynet was not provided with any written procedures
during the inspection or with other standard policies specifically for Telenor ASA regarding
the timing and manner for involving Telenor ASA’s DPO in all issues related to the

protection of personal data.

inspection consists in having regular meetings between the DPO and functions in the line
organisation, i.e. through the Group Unit Forum (GU Forum) and meetings with Privacy
Coordinators in the line organisation. However, these regular meetings are a result of recent

developments, as set out below.

Telenor ASA’s DPO started attending meetings of the GU Forum in September 2021. While      70

involvement of the DPO requires the line organisation to reach out to the DPO for their advice
on arising issues, the main purpose of the DPO’s participation in the GU Forum was to
establish a proper DPO reporting line:

        ‘… \[the CEO\] agreed that it would be useful to delegate the authority of privacy
        reporting from the DPO in Telenor ASA, from \[the CEO\], to the Policy owner and
                             71
        Group Unit forum’.

Prior to attending meetings of the GU Forum, the DPO was able to attend Compliance

Committee Meetings (CCM), but did not regularly attend these meetings. The meetings were
less suitable for the involvement of the DPO, since the meetings were limited to handling
issues in the Telenor Group and not dedicated specifically to data protection issues; see

section 3.5.2 in the final inspection report of 30 September 2022.

The Privacy Coordinators in the different units in Telenor ASA’s line organisation have
                                                                                                 72
meetings with the DPO on a weekly basis, at which they can discuss data protection issues.
The external DPO mentioned in the interview that getting all the Privacy Coordinators in the
different Group Units in place had been crucial. Furthermore, he stated that, before the

appointment of these coordinators, the DPO did not have sufficient links out to all the
different parts of the company.  74

Telenor ASA has stated that the DPO has regular meetings with Group Legal and the
temporarily hired Schrems II resource, and that at these meetings it is possible to exchange
information. Datatilsynet has not been provided with any documents that formalise the

occurrence of such regular meetings.

Other than the above-mentioned regular meetings, the involvement of Telenor ASA’s DPO in
issues that relate to the protection of personal data takes place on a case-by case basis. The

same occurred before these regular meetings were established. The final inspection report
shows how the case-by-case involvement is carried out. There appears to have been some ad
hoc involvement of the DPO in data protection matters in the period between October 2020

Datatilsynet to conclude on the exact extent to which Telenor ASA’s DPO has been involved
in ‘all issues which relate to the protection of personal data’, cf. Article 38(1) GDPR.

Even though we find that there has been a risk of Telenor ASA’s DPO not being involved in
all issues related to the protection of personal data ‘properly’ and ‘in a timely manner’, we do
not conclude that Article 38(1) GDPR has been violated in the timeframe of the inspection, as
there is no preponderance of evidence. We find a lack of policies to clarify in which cases and
how the DPO should be involved. See section 12.2 on the legal requirements of Article 24(1)

and (2) GDPR to implement organisational measures and appropriate data protection policies,
which entails sufficient and clear content.

7    Allocation of resources – Article 38(2) GDPR

7.1   Inspection criteria and evidence

Article 38(2) GDPR reads as follows:

    ‘The controller and processor shall support the data protection officer in performing the
    tasks referred to in Article 39 by providing resources necessary to carry out those tasks
    and access to personal data and processing operations, and to maintain his or her expert
    knowledge.’

We further refer to sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 in the final inspection report of 30 September
2022.

Pursuant to Article 39(2) GDPR:

        ‘The data protection officer shall in the performance of his or her tasks have due
        regard to the risk associated with processing operations, taking into account the nature,
        scope, context and purposes of processing.’

We refer to section 3.8 in the final inspection report regarding the DPO’s tasks mentioned in

Article 39.

7.2   Datatilsynet’s assessment

The requirement to provide necessary resources for the DPO to carry out their tasks is a
general and overarching requirement. In addition, Article 38(2) GDPR sets out an obligation
to give the DPO access to personal data and processing operations, and to facilitate the

maintenance of their expert knowledge.

Pursuant to Article 39 GDPR the DPO has the task of informing and advising the controller or
the processor, and monitor the compliance with the GDPR. A clarification of Telenor ASAs
role is therefore important when assessing whether the DPO has been allocated sufficient
resources to carry out their tasks.

                                                                                               27The Guidelines on Data Protection Officers from the former Article 29 Working Party provide
guidance on what should be done to fulfil the requirements in Article 38(2) GDPR:

        ‘The following items, in particular, are to be considered:

            •   Active support of the DPO’s function by senior management (such as at board
                level).
            •   Sufficient time for DPOs to fulfil their duties. This is particularly important
                where an internal DPO is appointed on a part-time basis or where the external
                DPO carries out data protection in addition to other duties. Otherwise,

                conflicting priorities could result in the DPO’s duties being neglected. Having
                sufficient time to devote to DPO tasks is paramount. It is a good practice to
                establish a percentage of time for the DPO function where it is not performed
                on a full-time basis. It is also good practice to determine the time needed to
                carry out the function, the appropriate level of priority for DPO duties, and for
                the DPO (or the organisation) to draw up a work plan.

            •   Adequate support in terms of financial resources, infrastructure (premises,
                facilities, equipment) and staff where appropriate.
            •   Official communication of the designation of the DPO to all staff to ensure that
                their existence and function are known within the organisation.

            •   Necessary access to other services, such as Human Resources, legal, IT,
                security, etc., so that DPOs can receive essential support, input and information
                from those other services.
            •   Continuous training. DPOs must be given the opportunity to stay up to date
                with regard to developments within the field of data protection. The aim should
                be to constantly increase the level of expertise of DPOs and they should be

                encouraged to participate in training courses on data protection and other forms
                of professional development, such as participation in privacy fora, workshops,
                etc.
            •   Given the size and structure of the organisation, it may be necessary to set up a
                DPO team (a DPO and his/her staff). In such cases, the internal structure of the
                team and the tasks and responsibilities of each of its members should be clearly

                drawn up. Similarly, when the function of the DPO is exercised by an external
                service provider, a team of individuals working for that entity may effectively
                carry out the tasks of a DPO as a team, under the responsibility of a designated
                lead contact for the client.

        In general, the more complex and/or sensitive the processing operations, the more

        resources must be given to the DPO. The data protection function must be effective      78
        and sufficiently well-resourced in relation to the data processing being carried out.’

While the guidelines are not binding, they set out relevant factors for assessing whether an
organisation complies with the requirements in Article 38(2) GDPR.

78WP 243 rev.01 ‘Guidelines on Data Protection Officers’ adopted 13 December 2016, p. 15.

                                                                                                 28We further refer to the final inspection report of 30 September 2022, pp. 10–11, for the factual
background.

Sufficient time for the data protection officer to perform tasks
Allocating sufficient time for the DPO to perform their tasks is one of the main factors to
ensure compliance with Article 38(2) GDPR.

Telenor ASA’s DPO is appointed in a 50 per cent FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) position,
while the remaining 50 per cent is in principle allocated to being an associate lawyer
                                                                       80
(‘advokatfullmektig’) in Telenor ASA’s Group Legal department. Telenor ASA specifies
that, since October 2020, the DPO has in practice spent most of their working hours on
performing tasks connected to the DPO role. However, this was not formalised in any

document shared by Telenor ASA with Datatilsynet. It has been pointed out on several
occasions and from different people that, in practice, the allocation of a 50 per cent FTE for
the DPO neither is nor has been sufficient in practice.  82

Furthermore, several circumstances indicate that even the above-mentioned practical increase
of the time spent working on DPO tasks has not been sufficient. Based on the documentation
                                                                    83
we received, there was a major backlog in the first half of 2021, which also indicates that the
DPO did not have sufficient time to perform their tasks. In this regard, the external DPO
noted in September 2021 that the ‘DPO spends 50% more time than originally intended, while

still being overburdened with tasks and being a bottleneck’ and that ‘\[m\]ost time \[is\] spent on
retro-active issue management, instead of pro-active and strategic work’. This indicates a
lack of resources as regards the DPO being able to perform their tasks.

Telenor ASA’s management stated that they would look into whether there is a need to
formally allocate a 100 per cent FTE to Telenor’s DPO. We find that having a 50 per cent

FTE as a flexible, informal resource allocation may result in conflicting priorities, when the
allocation of (at least) a 100 per cent FTE seems necessary.

Telenor ASA’s DPO mentioned in the interview that she assumes that a 50 per cent FTE will
be appropriate with time, but that it will require another level of data protection maturity
compared with the current state of affairs.  86

Furthermore, the interview revealed that the DPO planned to acquire a licence as a lawyer,
which would require practical procedural experience from legal matters as well as taking legal

take place within working hours. Telenor ASA has stated that the formal requirements to
obtain the licence will be fulfilled over time depending on the amount of court cases, and that
obtaining the procedural experience might take several years. Furthermore, it will mainly

encompass smaller cases relating to the business of Telenor Norge AS.

Reports from the data protection officer on the resource situation
On several occasions in 2021 and 2022, the DPO raised concerns about the need for more
resources. For instance, in February 2021, the DPO recommended the continued allocation

of:

        ‘100% FTE on ASA privacy matters (50% DPO, 50% extra) until privacy
        org./compliance state more mature’.  90

At the first meeting of the GU Forum in September 2021, the DPO reported the following:

    •   ‘DPO spends 50% more time than originally intended, while still being overburdened
        with tasks and being a bottleneck \[+P\]
    •   Most time spent on retro-active issue management, instead of pro-active and strategic
        work \[+I/P\]

    •   Internal alignment between CM, BSO and DPO delayed due to capacity and prio
        \[+I/P\]
    •   High-risk processing activities uncovered which should have had a DPIA, but did not
        (e.g. recording, investigations, tutela) \[+I/P\]

    •   Lack of capacity to deal (properly) with known cases \[+P\]
    •   Lack of audits and follow-up of contracts makes it a guessing game to assess whether
        3rd parties are complying \[+I/P\]
                                                                               91
    •   Lack of capacity and competence to follow-up systematically \[+I/P\]’

In and of itself, these reports from the DPO are factors showing a lack of resources.

In its letter of 16 May 2022, Telenor states that the need for more resources flagged by the
DPO has been taken on board by the management, which has been documented.

Conclusion

The inspection has uncovered that the formal allocation of a 50 per cent FTE for the DPO has
not been sufficient. Furthermore, several circumstances indicate that even dedicating most of
the working hours of one person to the performance of DPO tasks has not been sufficient. We
emphasise that the DPO can hardly perform all the tasks listed in Article 39 GDPR without

being provided with the necessary resources by the employer pursuant to Article 38(2) GDPR.

resource allocation for facilitating the fulfilment of the DPO’s tasks. This was a positive

change during the timeframe of the inspection.

Based on the above, there was a backlog and a general diffusion of responsibility and
accountability, with many specific data protection issues that needed the attention and
involvement of the DPO. The increase of resources (financial privacy/compliance budget

and adding privacy coordinators) may indirectly support the DPO role, but are not allocated
specifically to ensuring that the DPO is able to perform their tasks.

Datatilsynet finds that Telenor’s DPO has been supported with the necessary resources to

facilitate the maintenance of their expert knowledge.

In an overall assessment based on the available documentation, interviews and information
provided in response to the advance notification, Datatilsynet finds under doubt that there is a
preponderance of evidence that Telenor ASA has violated Article 38(2) GDPR by not

providing the DPO with the resources necessary to perform the tasks referred to in Article 39
within the timeframe of the inspection.

8    The data protection officer’s access to the highest management – Article

     38(3)

8.1   Inspection criteria and evidence
The last sentence of Article 38(3) GDPR reads as follows:

    ‘The data protection officer shall directly report to the highest management level of the
    controller or the processor.’

We further refer to sections 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 in the final inspection report of 30 September
2022.

8.2   Datatilsynet’s assessment
Under Article 38(3) GDPR, the controller shall ensure that the DPO directly reports to ‘the
highest management level’. The use of the word ‘highest’ – as a superlative to ‘high’ –

indicates that the DPO is to report directly to the absolute top level of management of the
relevant controller or processor. What is considered the top level of management will depend
on the form of incorporation and the organisational structure in each specific case.

Furthermore, when interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary to consider not only its
                                                                                    93
wording but also its context and the objectives of the legislation it forms part of. Therefore,
the preparatory works of Article 38(3) GDPR should be taken into account to consider its
proper interpretation.94

that the DPO must report directly to the absolute top management of the relevant organisation.
In the European Commission’s initial draft of the GDPR, it was set out that the DPO must

report to ‘the management’, without specifying the management level to which the reporting
should be addressed. The European Parliament suggested replacing the word ‘management’
with ‘executive management’. The European Parliament also added – as an additional

safeguard – that there should be a dedicated executive management member responsible for
GDPR compliance.      97

The wording of Article 38(3) was further amended by the European Council, and it was
proposed to specify that the reporting should be addressed to the ‘highest management’. The          98
Council’s approach was ultimately embraced in the final version of the Regulation.

Emphasis is put on specifying the management level to which the reporting should be
addressed to ensure that the highest management level of the relevant organisation is kept

informed and involved in how the company complies with the GDPR and its own internal
procedures, and is thus able to intervene to ensure that the measures that are necessary to
ensure compliance are put in place. The reference to the highest management level must also

be seen in the context of the accountability principle in Article 5(2) GDPR, where the
controller is responsible for demonstrating compliance with the provision.

In this regard, it should be noted that the WP29 Guidelines on Data Protection Officers
(‘DPOs’) state that:

        ‘\[...\] Article 38(3) \[provides\] that the DPO “shall directly report to the highest
        management level of the controller or the processor”. Such direct reporting ensures
        that senior management (e.g. board of directors) is aware of the DPO’s advice and

95See the European Commission’s initial draft of the GDPR (COM/2012/011 final – 2012/0011 (COD)), dated
25 January 2012, where Article 36(2) (today’s Article 38(3)) states: ‘\[…\] The data protection officer shall
directly report to the management of the controller or the processor.’ The problem of a potential conflict of
interest arising as a result of the reporting line being situated on too low a level in the company’s hierarchy was

96t addressed.
  See the draft of the GDPR adopted by the European Parliament (EP-PE\_TC1-COD(2012)0011), dated 12
March 2014, where Article 36(2) (today’s Article 38(3)) states: ‘\[...\] The data protection officer shall directly
report to the executive management of the controller or the processor.’
97Ibid. See Article 36(2) (today’s Article 38(3)) last sentence, which states: ‘The controller or processor shall for
this purpose designate an executive management member who shall be responsible for the compliance with the
provisions of this Regulation.’
98See the draft of the GDPR adopted by the European Parliament (5419/1/16 REV 1), dated 8 April 2016, where
Article 38(3) states: ‘The data protection officer shall directly report to the highest management level of the

controller or the processor’ (emphasis added). With this amendment of the specification of the management
level, the Council decided to remove the European Parliament’s suggestion to dedicate an executive member of
management to be responsible for compliance with the provision.

                                                                                                         32        recommendations as part of the DPO’s mission to inform and advise the controller or
        the processor.’ 100

The reference to the ‘board of directors’ as an example of the highest management must be
considered in light of the organisational structure of the controller or processer on a case-by-
case basis. Not all controllers or processors would have a board of directors. For example,

public authorities and organisations such as municipalities, counties, universities, schools,
governmental bodies etc. would typically not have a board of directors as the highest level
management. The example provided in the WP29 Guidelines must therefore be understood as
a specific example of the highest management, which applies in those situations where such a

form of management organisation is compulsory (typically for private limited companies and
public companies), or simply where this form of management structure is chosen
independently of any compulsory requirements.

In the present case, Telenor ASA is organised as a public limited liability company subject to
the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act. The company is obliged to have a
board of directors (board). 101 This is also apparent from Telenor ASA’s organisational
      102
chart.

In its comments on the advance notification of 31 May 2024, Telenor ASA states that:

        ‘No specific requirements can be set for who should be reported to, or how reporting
        should take place.’

        ‘that the reporting structure and format are adapted to the individual company’s “size,
        organisation and current risk picture”, so that the controller has “flexibility” with
        regard to the reporting line.’103

Datatilsynet emphasises that, it is the company’s responsibility to specify what constitutes
reporting to the highest level. Precisely because the ‘highest management level’ is not always
clear, it is all the more important to have a clear and documented reporting line as regards
whom the DPO should report to and how. We will return to this in section 12.2 on Article 24.

In this case, it is assessed whether Telenor ASA has put in place measures to ensure that its
DPO reports directly to Telenor ASA’s highest management level.

Several measures may be relevant to ensure compliance with Article 38(3) GDPR.          104 In our
view, it is essential to formalise and explain the DPO’s reporting line (in internal documents,

reports to the highest management in practice.

Between 2020 and 2022, Telenor ASA introduced several amendments to its formal
procedures, practices and policies for DPO reporting.   105 During the interviews conducted in
connection with our inspection, Telenor ASA took the view that, throughout this period, there

were measures in place to ensure that the DPO reported directly to the organisation’s highest
management. This view is further expressed in Telenor ASA’s comments on the preliminary
inspection report, in which they write:

        ‘Furthermore, the role of DPO reports to top management and local policy owner
                  through the GU Forum and otherwise as the DPO finds necessary.’        106

Based on the findings of our inspection, we find that Telenor ASA’s statement should be

rejected in the present case for the whole timeframe of the inspection. The reasons for this are
outlined below.

Firstly, it must be examined how the top management’s responsibility for compliance with the
requirements of Article 5(2) GDPR is formalised.    107 The functional job description for
Telenor’s DPO is as follows:

        ‘As DPO for Telenor ASA report directly to the highest management level of the
        Telenor ASA on the status of data protection and urgent matters.’    108

This wording merely mirrors the wording of Article 38(3) and does not demonstrate the
existence of any direct relationship between the DPO and the highest level of management of
Telenor ASA. Furthermore, it is not specified what is meant by ‘highest management level’ in
this context. A mere reference in the job description to the fact that the DPO shall report

directly to the highest management is not sufficient to ensure compliance with Article 38(3).
We expect organisational measures to be in place regarding where, when, how and to whom
exactly the DPO shall report in documented internal data protection policies. This is
particularly important when Telenor ASA now claims that it cannot be understood to mean
                                                                   109
that the DPO should report to the company’s board of directors.        The understanding of what
constitutes the ‘highest management level’ must be specified.

The board is officially the highest level of Telenor ASA. Without further clarification of the
reporting line, it is therefore reasonable to assume that it is the board that constitutes the
‘highest management level.’ Telenor ASA points out in its response, it is not clear under the

reporting line, as well as an escalation mechanism for urgent matters to management that can bypass the
intermediate hierarchical level(s).’ (our translation from French to English).

108‘DPO – Functional Job Description – Group Legal – Associate Lawyer & DPO’
109In its comments on the advance notification of 31 May 2024, p. 37, Telenor ASA states: ‘There is no basis for
(i) requiring the DPO to report to the company’s board of directors; or for (ii) requiring the controller to have
formalised policies on how and to whom the DPO reports.’ (our italics).

                                                                                                 34GDPR that the highest level of management must be the board of directors. In its response,
Telenor ASA refers to the annotated edition of Jarbekk et al., which states that the DPO
should not report to the board because the board only reports to the general manager, and that
‘there is nothing to indicate that the DPO is supposed to be on equal footing with the general
                               110
manager vis-à-vis the board’.     Here, we point out that the EDPB has a different
interpretation, and that the preparatory works to the GDPRshow that the intention is precisely
that the DPO should be able to report to what is de facto the highest management level in a
company. These are sources of law that we assess having greater weight than legal theory.
How this is in keeping with Norwegian company law is not mentioned in the preparatory

works to the Norwegian Personal Data Act. The intention is to ensure the DPO’s
independence, and the DPO must thus be able to report and give advice independently of the
company’s formal line organisation.

                                                                                    111
The DPO is closely linked to the accountability principle in Article 5(2) GDPR.        The DPO
is a role based on ‘authority and expertise rather than on formal powers over the governance
of personal data within organisations’. 112 The DPO has no formal role vis-à-vis the board and
has no authority that goes beyond the company’s, but has an independent advisory and
                                                 113
overseeing role with ‘expert-based autonomy’.       There may be cases where it is necessary to
alert the board of privacy risks in the company. The board shall ensure that the business
activities are soundly organised, cf. the Public Limited Liability Companies Act Section 6-
12(1) and shall supervise the day-to-day management and the company’s activities in general,

cf. same law Section 6-13(1). The responsibility under Article 5(2) GDPR thus formally rests
with the board, even if day-to-day data controllership is assigned to others in the company.

Jarbekk et al. also write that the highest level does not necessarily mean the top manager, but

the highest level of day-to-day management. The general manager is responsible for the day-
to-day management of the activities of a public limited company, cf. the Public Limited
Liability Companies Act Section 6-14. In Telenor ASA’s case, the highest level of day-to-day
management is the CEO or CEO with the management team (Group Leadership Team). If we

rely on this understanding of the highest level, it would be natural for the DPO to report to the
CEO or CEO with the Group Leadership Team. It can be argued that such interpretation
safeguards the purpose of the provision, as the top day-to-day management will be the closest
to take action on basis of the DPO’s report, precisely because they are exercising operational

management in the company on a daily basis.

The response also refers to how Jarbekk et al. emphasise that there is some flexibility in the
exact reporting lines, but does not specify whether this means that the reporting can be made
                                                   114
to levels below the highest level of management.       Such an understanding will go beyond
what is possible to infer from the wording and intention of the law, which, by specifying the
highest management level, clearly dictates that reporting shall be made to the highest and not

                                                                                                35just any management level. We believe that such an expanded interpretation cannot be
applied.

The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has stated as follows: ‘As is clear from

settled case-law, in interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary to consider not only its
wording, by considering the latter’s usual meaning in everyday language, but also the context
in which the provision occurs and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it is part...’. 115
The highest level of management must therefore be interpreted in the light of the intention of
the law, which is to ‘ensure a high level of protection of natural persons within the European

Union and, to that end, to ensure a consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for
the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of such natural persons with regard to
the processing of personal data throughout the European Union...’.    116

We also point out that the reference to Voigt and Bussche in the response does not say that
reporting should not be made to the highest level, but that it is not necessary for ‘each and
every routine data protection matter’ to be reported to the highest management level. At the
same time, they emphasise that the DPO ‘must be able to report directly to the highest

management level when the need arises and must not be prevented from doing so by the
organisation’. In our view, the DPO can communicate with different levels of the organisation
on a day-to-day basis, but should be able to report directly to the highest management level. It
is important here to differentiate between Article 38(1) GDPR involvement of the DPO –

which should happen on several different levels, and where the DPO is the closest to assess
what is appropriate – and the formal reporting pursuant to Article 38(3) GDPR.

In Datatilsynet’s view, reporting to the board fulfils the requirement pursuant to Article 38(3)

GDPR last sentence. Datatilsynet is also open to that reporting to the CEO or reporting to the
CEO with the concerned management may fulfil the requirement. However, such reporting
requires that the DPO can escalate matters further to the board because the responsibility
under Article 5(2) GDPR rests with the board, as mentioned.

It is regardless important to carry out a concrete assessment on the DPO’s reporting line and
document this, which we consider to be inadequate in this case. We refer to section 12 below.

It emerged in the interviews with the external DPO and the then DPO, as well as the
management,   117that the DPO reported to                  , Executive Vice President and Chief
People and Sustainability Officer, during the first part of the inspection period. Telenor ASA
realised that there was a need for broader reporting, and there were plans in place for the DPO
                                                         118
to report to CCM (Compliance Committee Meetings).           Furthermore, it emerged in the
interview that the external DPO made Telenor ASA aware that CCM, which was at group
level, ‘was probably not the optimal way of contacting management’ in Telenor ASA.

118See section 6.2 of the decision.

                                                                                                36Secondly, the loan agreement between Telenor ASA and               for the hiring of the external
DPO from January 2021 until October 2021 states that the DPO shall report to ‘
                , VP Privacy and Information Management Telenor Group’.        119This is only a
reference to the employee’s line management reporting, and not to the DPO’s reporting line
                            120
for data protection matters.             was also not responsible for compliance within
Telenor ASA, but for compliance at group level.

Thirdly, Telenor ASA has a written ‘Group Manual Privacy’ and a ‘Group Policy Privacy’ for
ensuring compliance within the group of companies, including Telenor ASA. During the
inspection, we have received both the updated policy dated 1 January 2022 (became valid
after Datatilsynet notified its inspection on 26 November 2021), and the old mandates and
                                                         121
policies (valid between 1 June and 31 December 2021).        In this regard, the manual and
mandate provide for some written procedures regarding the GPO’s (Group Privacy Officer)
reporting on data protection matters to the management, for example functionally to the Chief
Compliance Officer and to the CEO through the Group Compliance Committee.          122

Between 1 March 2020 and 30 November 2021, a group called the Group Unit for Privacy &
IM worked on data protection in Telenor’s Compliance department.      123The internal document
on the group’s mandate states as follows:

     ‘Group Privacy & IM has a preventive, advisory and supervisory role, acting
     independently from operational management, with particular emphasis on three main
     areas of responsibility:

            a) Act as Group Policy Manager for Privacy & IM, in accordance with Telenor’s
               Compliance Management System to ensure that the applicable Group Manuals
               are kept up to date and are being effectively adopted across the Group. Group

               Privacy & IM shall perform core CMS activities following a Plan-Do-Check-
               Act model, and the implementation of the Group Manuals are subject to
               monitoring and management reporting, as described in chapter 4.
            b) Act as both the Group Privacy Officer and DPO for Telenor ASA, including

               the right and duty to report independently on relevant privacy risks and non-
               conformities to the Group President and CEO of Telenor. (Our italics).
            c) Advise and support management at the Group-level, and other key
               stakeholders such as Data Protection Officers (DPOs) in the BUs. Advisory

               and support tasks include:
               •   Providing expertise and knowledge on specific privacy and IM topics
               •   Providing expertise and input on privacy and IM advocacy activities

the same as ‘CCM’ or the Compliance Committee Meeting that Telenor ASA refers to.
123‘2020 Mandate and Functional Description Group Privacy and IM (share), valid from: 01.03.2020’. The
document was valid until 30 November 2021; see ‘Response to Datatilsynet additional documentation’, 10
January 2022, pp. 2–3.

                                                                                               37                •   Providing expertise and input on privacy strategy and position development

                •   Supporting the implementation of privacy and IM requirements in relevant
                    Group-wide processes.’   124

It is stated that the GPO may report to the board via the Sustainability and Compliance
Committee.  125 However, in its response to Datatilsynet, Telenor ASA emphasises that, despite
the wording of the mandate, the roles of the DPO and the GPO were completely separate and
                                126
held by two different persons.     Furthermore, Telenor ASA states that the reference to Group
Privacy & IM acting as both the Group Privacy Officer and DPO for Telenor ASA was only
meant as a reference to the DPO’s organisational affiliation to that unit and that the DPO’s
responsibilities, tasks and reporting lines are not included in the document.   127Telenor ASA
                                                                                     128
has documented that the above positions were occupied by different individuals.
Datatilsynet notes that this group manual and the mandate did not then contain any specific
guidelines for the DPO of Telenor ASA, which we consider to be inadequate.

Fourthly, it is our view that Telenor ASA’s lack of formalised reporting lines has resulted in
practical issues for the DPO in the performance of their tasks under the GDPR. During the

inspection, the external DPO stated that he experienced a lack of access to the highest
management level.   129Furthermore, the external DPO emphasised that he experienced a lack
of organisational efficiency and that he was frustrated because of the many hierarchical levels
                                                                               130
the DPO had to bypass and involve in order to reach the top management.

In that connection, we note that the DPO’s practical difficulties with bypassing hierarchical

intermediaries and reporting directly to highest management level has been deemed a   131
violation of Article 38(3) GDPR in and of itself by other supervisory authorities.       In its
response, Telenor ASA claims that ‘decisions made by a foreign supervisory authority are of
little legal relevance, especially when Datatilsynet has not demonstrated that the decision
                                      132
constitutes an established practice’.    We do not agree with this claim. The GDPR applies
throughout the EEA, and according to Recital 13, it aims to ensure a consistent level of
protection for natural persons, ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal

data, and equivalent sanctions in all member states etc. We believe it is relevant to look at
practices in other EEA member states since a harmonised interpretation of the GDPR is
assumed to exist.

                                                                                                  38        ‘a) DPO reporting, access & independence -The DPO is unable to perform the role
        effectively and independently due lack of proper implementation of the role in the
        organization, including clarified reporting lines, access to highest level of management
                                       133
        and interference in reporting.’

Furthermore, the following observations were made in the same report:

        •   ‘DPO reporting and sounding board not implemented

        •   Independent reporting and mgmt. access (has been) difficult’    134

As a follow up point from the DPO, it was emphasised that Telenor ASA must:

        ‘Establish DPO reporting line to ASA mgmt.’     135

These statements and findings from the former DPO illustrate the core issue when the
controller does not ensure any formalisation of the DPO reporting line to the highest
management. The external DPO did not have the option to refer to the manuals or policies to

demand their right to have direct contact with highest management at the time. Rather, it was
left to the DPO’s own personal initiative to involve and bypass hierarchical levels in order to
reach the highest management. Thus, even though informal contact with the highest

management may technically have been possible, that cannot be regarded as compliance in
this case.

For the purpose of completeness, we note that Telenor ASA’s management in the interview

acknowledged that only having the Privacy Policy Owner to report to was not sufficient. They
saw the need for changes in the DPO’s reporting line. Thus, the management decided that the
DPO should report quarterly to the CCM,     136and from summer 2021, this reporting line was
replaced by the GU Forum.    137

In this regard, we note that the Privacy Policy Owner – i.e.          and later           – was,
at the time, part of the Group Executive Management (an advisory body to the CEO) and held

the titles ‘Executive Vice President and Chief People & Sustainability Officer’ and ‘Executive
Vice President and Head of Strategy & External Relations’, respectively. These positions
cannot be regarded as the highest management level within the meaning of Article 38(3)
GDPR.

137See the final inspection report of 30 September 2022, page 19, which states that the replacement of the CCM
with the GU Forum was a direct consequence of the external DPO’s continued individual efforts to inform and
report to management and the Privacy Policy Owner on the lack of clear and formal reporting lines to highest
management level.

                                                                                                39As regards the CCM, the external DPO pointed out that this forum was not suitable as the
                                                                                             138
main reporting channel from the DPO to the highest management level of Telenor ASA.
These meetings were intended for addressing group level compliance issues, and privacy risks
in Telenor ASA were too lightweight compared with other topics and agenda items
                                139
concerning group level issues.     This is also illustrated by the fact that the DPO had no
formal or permanent agenda slot at these meetings to present data protection matters
concerning Telenor ASA.    140 If the DPO reported to the CCM, this was only on an ad hoc
                                                                 141
basis, and it was up to the DPO to ask to attend the meetings.      In this regard, we note that
Telenor ASA has only provided minutes from one CCM meeting containing any information
or reporting from the DPO. It is also worth mentioning that the DPO did not get an

opportunity to attend in person, and the presentation prepared for CCM was circulated in
writing in advance of the meeting for CCM’s information and not for discussion at the
meeting. 142

The first meeting of the GU Forum attended by the DPO was held in September 2021, and
data protection matters concerning Telenor ASA were on the agenda,       143which was a positive

change from CCM.

The GU Forum was established as the main arena for reporting and dialogue on data
                                                             144
protection matters with the management of Telenor ASA.          The GU Forum was headed by
the Executive Vice President of People & Sustainability and consisted of the heads of the
other departments in Telenor ASA, called ‘Group Units’.     145 In the interview, the GU Forum

was described as an arena for the executive vice presidents to agree on decisions to be made
in the line organisation, and the GU Forum cannot be regarded as a decision-making body in
itself.46The GU Forum thus consists of managers in Telenor ASA, of which the Executive

Vice President for Strategy & External Relations is also a member of the management team in
Telenor ASA and the Group.     147

                                                                             148
It appears in the evidence that GU Forum is not a decision-making body.         This in itself
indicates that GU Forum cannot be considered the highest management level in the
understanding of the GDPR. Furthermore, we note that reporting to individuals in

management is not the same as reporting to the management as such.

Datatilsynet notes that in a few PowerPoint presentations, Telenor ASA mentions with regard
to the organisation of the data protection work that the DPO may escalate and report matters

directly to ‘CEO 1. escalation’ and ‘BoD 2. escalation’ (board of directors). These are dated 6

148Interview with Telenor ASA’s management.

                                                                                                 40December 2021, i.e. after our notification of inspection was sent.  149This is a positive change,
but we note that Telenor ASA has not submitted any information how these reporting lines
work in practise. In order to meet the requirement for internal policies in Article 24(2) GDPR,

we consider that the information obtained from the slides should also be recorded in the
relevant policies, as the slides alone do not necessarily meet this requirement. Policies must
be accessible and known in the organisation. We note that Telenor ASA, with the assistance
of the DPO, made efforts to correct and improve the DPO’s reporting lines to the highest
management. Furthermore, the slides show that the month before we conducted the

interviews, Te150or ASA had realised that there should be a reporting line to both the board
and the CEO.     However, Telenor ASA’s attempt of correction does not change the fact that,
for almost a year, the DPO lacked a direct reporting line to the highest management level, as
stated above.

Overall, the above circumstances have led Datatilsynet to conclude that Telenor ASA, for most
of the timeframe of the inspection, did not have a direct reporting line to the highest
management level and has violated Article 38(3) GDPR. See also section 3.5.3 in the final
inspection report of 30 September 2022.

9    Data subjects’ access to the DPO – Article 38(4)

9.1   Inspection criteria and evidence

Article 38(4) GDPR reads as follows:

       ‘Data subjects may contact the data protection officer with regard to all issues related to

       processing of their personal data and to the exercise of their rights under this
       Regulation.’

We further refer to sections 3.6.1 and 3.6.2, in addition to section 3.1.2 in the final inspection
report of 30 September 2022.

9.2   Datatilsynet’s assessment
The objective of Article 38(4) GDPR is to establish the rights of the data subject vis-à-vis the
DPO. It is closely related to Article 37(7) GDPR. We consider easy access to the DPO’s contact
details a precondition for the data subjects to be able to contact the DPO with regard to all
privacy-related issues and concerning the exercise of their rights.

We refer to section 5.2.4 in this decision, where we point out a violation. Apart from this
element, Datatilsynet did not find any indication during the inspection to suggest that this right
had not been safeguarded.

   See in this context for example CNPD (Luxembourg) – Decision 20FR/2021, paragraph 39, where the
restricted committee considers ‘that the DPO should be able to bypass the intermediate hierarchical levels as
soon as it deems necessary’.

                                                                                                4110 Independence of the DPO and absence of conflicts of interests – Article
     38(3) and (6)

10.1 Inspection criteria and evidence

The first and second sentences of Article 38(3) GDPR read as follows:

        ‘The controller and processor shall ensure that the data protection officer does not
        receive any instructions regarding the exercise of those tasks. He or she shall not be

        dismissed or penalised by the controller or the processor for performing his tasks.’

We further refer to sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 in the final inspection report of 30 September
2022, in particular where it says that the external DPO informed us that he never received any
direct instructions from the management regarding the exercise of his tasks. During the

inspection, Datatilsynet did not find any evidence that a DPO of Telenor ASA had been
dismissed or penalised by Telenor ASA for performing their tasks.

Furthermore, Article 38(6) GDPR reads as follows:

      ‘The data protection officer may fulfil other tasks and duties. The controller or
      processor shall ensure that any such tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of
      interests.’

We further refer to sections 3.7.1 and 3.7.2 in the final inspection report of 30 September
2022.

10.2 Datatilsynet’s assessment

In our opinion, Article 38(3) and Article 38(6) GDPR are closely related, and we therefore
look at both provisions in this section.

Article 38(3) states that the controller shall ensure that the DPO does not receive any

instructions regarding th151xercise of their tasks. This provision is important for ensuring the
independence of DPOs.        It refers not only to direct instructions from a superior, but also
implies that a DPO must not be in a position to be inclined to accept certain compromises
when dealing with the controller’s staff in higher positions.  152

151
   See Recital 97 GDPR, which states that ‘\[…\] data protection officers, whether or not they are an employee of
152 controller, should be in a position to perform their duties and tasks in an independent manner.’
   See by analogy the EDPS Position paper on the role of Data Protection Officers of the EU institutions and
bodies (30 September 2018), p. 9.

                                                                                                  42Article 38(6) stipulates that ‘the data protection officer may fulfil other tasks and duties’
provided that ‘any such tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests’.  153 It is
therefore crucial that the DPO’s independence is guaranteed, especially when the DPO is
given other tasks in the organisation. This is because, as noted by the Network of Data

Protection Officers of the EU Institutions and Bodies, a ‘part-time DPO faces a permanent
conflict between allocating time and efforts to their DPO tasks versus other tasks \[and is\] in
danger of encountering conflicts of interest’.  154 It is therefore extremely important to make

thorough assessments of possible conflicts of interest when establishing a part-time position
as DPO.

To avoid conflicts of interests, controllers should make sure:

    •   ‘to identify the positions which would be incompatible with the function of DPO
    •   to draw up internal rules to this effect in order to avoid conflicts of interests

    •   to include a more general explanation about conflicts of interests
    •   to declare that their DPO has no conflict of interests with regard to its function as a

        DPO, as a way of raising awareness of this requirement
    •   to include safeguards in the internal rules of the organization and to ensure that the
        vacancy notice for the position of DPO or the service contract is sufficiently precise

        and detailed in order to avoid a conflict of interests. In this context, it should also be
        borne in mind that conflicts of interests may take various forms depending on whether
        the DPO is recruited internally or externally.’  155

In the present case, Telenor ASA’s DPO is meant to fulfil other tasks too. As noted by
Telenor ASA:

        ‘The DPO is organizationally situated within the Group Legal department (a Group
        Unit) and has its personnel line reporting here. The DPO is appointed as a 50 % FTE

        position, while this person156remaining 50 % FTE is allocated to being an associate
        lawyer for Group Legal.’

Thus, it should be assessed whether such an arrangement is compatible with Article 38(3) and

(6) GDPR, and whether Telenor ASA has adopted measures to avoid possible conflicts of
interests.

153WP 243 rev.01, ‘Guidelines on Data Protection Officers’, adopted on 13 December 2016, p. 17 (stating that:
‘The absence of conflict of interests is closely linked to the requirement to act in an independent manner.
Although DPOs are allowed to have other functions, they can only be entrusted with other tasks and duties
provided that these do not give rise to conflicts of interests’).

(30 September 2018), p. 9.

156‘Response to Datatilsynet’, 13 December 2021 , p. 10.

                                                                                                   43Telenor’s Group Manual Privacy from 2020 states that:

        ‘The BU shall ensure that the DPO is in a position to perform her or his duties and
        tasks in an independent manner and shall not receive any instructions regarding the

        exercise of these tasks. He or she shall not be dismissed or penalised by Telenor for
        performing his/her tasks. To avoid any conflicts of interests, the DPO cannot be
        organised in the line-organisation, but shall be organised in the Corporate Affairs Unit
        of the BU and report directly to the Corporate Affairs Officer of the BU.’    157

In essence, the Group Manual Privacy from 2020 largely mirrors the wording of Article 38(3)
and (6) GDPR, as well as Recital 97 GDPR.

The Group Policy Privacy and the Group Manual Privacy from 2022 are less specific in this

respect, as they mention that the DPO should be ‘independent’, but fail to specify that the
DPO may only perform other tasks and duties if they do not result in a conflict of interests.    158

In any event, a reference to the independence of the DPO in internal guidelines is not

sufficient in itself to ensure compliance with Article 38(3) and (6) GDPR. To verify whether
the controller has taken adequate measures to ensure that the DPO performs their tasks in an
independent manner and that any additional tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of
interests, other elements need to be considered too. In particular, it should be considered

whether there are elements that may weaken the position of the DPO, and whether the other
tasks that the DPO is asked to perform entail the advancement of interests that may conflict
with data protection considerations.

While it is not uncommon for part-time DPOs to be a member of the legal team of their
organisation, the duties normally assigned to a legal team also comprise tasks that may give
rise to a conflict of interests for the DPO.159Therefore, when the DPO is a member of the
legal team, it is of paramount importance to ensure that the DPO is only given other tasks or

duties that are compatible with their role as DPO, and that it is clear – both to the DPO and
the rest of the organisation – which tasks are performed in the capacity of DPO and which
tasks are performed as a member of the legal team. In this respect, the Article 29 Working
Party/EDPB has stated that an important element to avoid conflicts of interests is to ensure
                                                                                          160
that ‘the position of DPO or the service contract is sufficiently precise and detailed’.     The
European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) has stated that:

        ‘If the DPO is also a member of the legal team, organisational measures should be put

        in place to allow the DPO and their staff to clearly distinguish their activities, e.g. by
        having a separate functional mailbox for DPO matters (so that the rest of the

section 2.1.
159For example, a conflict of interests may arise if a DPO is asked to represent the controller in court in matters
relating to the protection of personal data; see WP 243 rev.01 Guidelines on Data Protection Officers, adopted on
13 December 2016, approved by the EDPB in Endorsement 1/2018 of 25 May 2018, p. 17.
160Ibid.

                                                                                                  44        organisation can see whether the advice comes from the DPO function or legal
        advisory function).’161

In our view, the organisational measures put in place by Telenor ASA fail to ensure a clear
distinction between the tasks performed as DPO and those that are to be performed as an
Associate Lawyer.

Telenor ASA’s functional job description for the employee to be hired as ‘DPO & Associate

Lawyer’ describes the ‘responsibility’ of the employee as follows:

        ‘Implement and/or develop as necessary policies, manuals, best practices, provide
        legal advice, and liase \[sic\] with external legal counsel. This shall be done in line with
        the risks and tasks identified by the Heads of Legal for Telenor Digital/Nordic

        Content/Technologies & Services/Telenor Norway and the prioritizations set by Head
        of Group Legal and Team Leader for Contracts & Content Team.

        - Inform and provide legal advice in alignment with other attorneys in Group Legal to
        Telenor ASA and the employees on their obligations pursuant to Data Protection

        Laws, regulations and other requirements.
        - Provide advice as regards the data protection impact assessment;
        - Cooperate with the supervisory authority;
        - Act as the contact point for the data protection supervisory authority on issues
        relating to processing, and to consult, where appropriate, with regard to any other

        matter.
        - On behalf of Telenor ASA seek prior consultation, where required, for high risk
        processing in absence of sufficient measures to mitigate such risk
        - As DPO for Telenor ASA report directly to the highest management level of the
        Telenor ASA on the status of data protection and urgent matters’.   162

Furthermore, the tasks of the employee in question are described in the functional job
description as follows:

        ‘Implement and/or develop as necessary policies, manuals, best practices, provide

        legal advice (including contribute in relation to Authority Requests) and provide
        support during negotiations of contracts and liase \[sic\] with external legal counsel.
        Cooperate closely with other experts in Group Legal and other Group functions as
        required to support high risk or critical processes. Share information and best practice
        with colleagues in Group Legal.

        Act as DPO in accordance with the GDPR which entail the following activities as
        examples:
        - Develop and maintain Privacy Management Tools and Data Transfer Mechanisms
        - Contribute to Training and Awareness Program

                                                                             163
        - Liaise with Group Compliance on related compliance activities’.

In our view, even though there is an empty line in the Excel sheet separating the two
paragraphs, this is not sufficient to clearly distinguish between the activities to be carried out

as a DPO and those to be carried out as an Associate Lawyer. However, following our
inspection, Telenor ASA argued that only the tasks expressly listed in the functional job
description as examples of DPO activities are those to be fulfilled as a DPO, whereas the
other tasks should be fulfilled as an Associate Lawyer. This ex-post statement with the aim of

clarifying the relevant division of tasks fails to overcome the ambiguity of the functional job
description. For example, Telenor ASA claims that it is exclusively in the capacity of
Associate Lawyer that the employee should:

        ‘Implement and/or develop as necessary policies, manuals, best practices \[…\] in line
        with the risks and tasks identified by the Heads of Legal for Telenor Digital/Nordic
        Content/Technologies & Services/Telenor Norway and the prioritizations set by Head
        of Group Legal and Team Leader for Contracts & Content Team.’        164

This is despite the fact that one of the examples of DPO activities in the functional job
description is specifically to ‘Develop and Evolve the Relevant Guidelines and Templates to
Support Telenor ASA in Matters Regarding Protection of Personal Data’. Similarly, Telenor

ASA claims that it is in the capacity of Associate Lawyer that the employee should ‘Inform
and provide legal advice in alignment with other attorneys in Group Legal to Telenor ASA
and the employees on their obligations pursuant to Data Protection Laws, regulations and
other requirements’, 165although that wording essentially mirrors the wording of Article
                                                   166
39(1)(a) GDPR concerning the tasks of the DPO.        The latter element is particularly
concerning, as it suggests that the DPO’s advice on data protection matters must be ‘in
alignment with other attorneys in Group Legal’, which contradicts the requirement that the
DPO should act independently.

We emphasise that working as a lawyer per se does not preclude the possibility of performing
DPO duties, for example if the legal advice concerns areas of law other than data protection

166Article 39(1) GDPR reads as follows: ‘to inform and advise the controller or the processor and the employees
who carry out processing of their obligations pursuant to this Regulation and to other Union or Member State
data protection provisions’.

                                                                                                46                          167
matters in the company.      This would be a matter to be determined on a case-by-case
basis,168and the framework must be clear and concise.

Telenor ASA highlights the CJEU’s decision in case C-453/21 X-FAB Dresden, which states,

inter alia, that:

        ‘a “conflict of interests”, as provided for in that provision, may exist where a DPO is

        entrusted with other tasks or duties, which would result in him or her determining the
        objectives and methods of processing personal data on the part of the controller or its
        processor, which is a matter for the national court to determine, case by case, on the
        basis of an assessment of all the relevant circumstances, in particular the

        organisational structure of the controller or its processor and in the light of all the
        applicable rules, including any policies of the controller or its processor’ (our
        italics).69

In our view, CJEU provides examples in this decision of circumstances that may suggest that
the DPO has a conflict of interest. What is important here is that it is based on a case-by-case
assessment of what constitutes a conflict of interest and whether the DPO is considered
independent. Furthermore, we emphasise that the CJEU points specifically to internal

guidelines in this assessment, which in this case are inadequate.

The Court’s opinion referred to by Telenor ASA must also be read in the context of paragraph
40 of the same judgment:

        ‘It thus follows from the wording of that provision, first, that the GDPR does not
        establish that there is a fundamental incompatibility between, on the one hand, the

        performance of DPO’s duties and, on the other hand, the performance of other duties
        within the controller or processor. Article 38(6) of that regulation specifically provides
        that the DPO may be entrusted with performing tasks and duties other than those for
        which it is responsible under Article 39 of the GDPR.’ (our italics)

The Court points out here that the DPO may perform other tasks and duties than those for
which the DPO responsible pursuant to Article 39. Furthermore, ‘the DPO cannot be
entrusted with performing tasks or duties which could impair the execution of the functions
                          170
performed by the DPO’.

There must therefore be a clear distinction between tasks that the DPO performs by virtue of
their role as DPO and other tasks. Such a distinction will be unclear or impossible if the DPO

167The assessment will differ for an internal lawyer and for an external lawyer who is hired as a DPO. For an
external lawyer, there may be a clearer distinction between the individual clients and tasks (although here, too,
there may be ties that challenge independence), while for an internal lawyer who provides advice on data
protection matters in the company, it may be more difficult to maintain a clear distinction between the advisory
function and, subsequently, the more objective role of DPO, where the interests of the data subjects are to be
emphasised over the interests of the company.

169Ibid. In the response, Telenor has cited the English language version of the judgment, as recited here.
170CJEU case C-453 /21 X-FAB Dresden v FC,paragraph 41.

                                                                                                   47performs similar tasks or tasks that a DPO is set to oversee. In this context, we refer to the
description of tasks and duties reproduced above, which shows tasks that are largely practical

data protection tasks and for which the DPO has an advisory or control function.

The lack of clarity with respect to the activities that are carried out as DPO and those that are
carried out as an Associate Lawyer is exacerbated by the fact that there is no evidence to

suggest, in the timeframe of the inspection, that Telenor ASA’s DPO used a separate mailbox
for DPO matters.  171 Furthermore, the current DPO’s email signature mentions both of her
roles as follows:

        N.N.
        Associate Lawyer and Data Protection Officer (DPO) Telenor ASA
        Group Legal

        N-1360 Fornebu
        www.telenor.com

        Facebook | Twitter |LinkedIn

Thus, a colleague who receives an email with data protection advice from her would be
unable to distinguish whether the advice comes from the DPO function or the legal advisory
function.

Under Norwegian law, the supervisor (‘prinsipal’) of a associate lawyer (‘advokatfullmektig’)
has a duty to provide guidance to the associate lawyer,   172and the trainee lawyer has a duty to
keep the supervisor informed about the work performed.      173

In its comments on the notification, Telenor ASA states that:

        ‘The supervisor-trainee lawyer relationship does not apply to the role of DPO. The
        point of view therefore assumes that the supervisor as a lawyer will act contrary to the
        requirement for independence. This is a purely theoretical risk and it applies to all

                                                                                                  48        superior and subordinate relationships, not just the supervisor-trainee lawyer
        relationship. On the other hand, it must be assumed that a superior who is a lawyer has
        a particular awareness of roles and independence, and that the risk of independence
        being compromised is therefore lower than would otherwise be the case.’

We note that the head of a legal team is normally the one who decides (at least in part) on the
purposes of the personal data processing carried out by the team in connection with the
performance of the tasks assigned to the team (e.g. which personal data are to be processed in
connection with legal processes). It is possible that the supervisor-trainee lawyer relationship

will affect the proper performance of DPO tasks with respect to processing activities carried
out or otherwise affected by the work of the supervisor, as a trainee lawyer may have
difficulties standing up to their supervisor. Although the supervisor-trainee lawyer
relationship only applies to the associate lawyer role, we believe there is a risk that the person

in question may be more concerned with acquiring a licence as a lawyer than with the
performance of their tasks and duties as a DPO. All risks, including theoretical ones, must be
specifically assessed to determine the DPO’s independence and whether a conflict of interest
exists. These assessments should be documented as part of the internal control referred to in

Article 24(1) GDPR.

The proper performance of DPO tasks often requires the DPO to take a firm and insisting
attitude, also vis-à-vis employees who hold a superior position and have decision-making

power within the organisation, which may be perceived, at best, as bureaucratic or, at worst,
as unpleasant ‘trouble-making’. Thus, the DPO must be in a position to withstand the
pressures and difficulties that accompany this important position.   174

The fact that, in Telenor ASA, the budget for data protection-related expenses is ‘allocated on
a case-by-case basis by line management’    175 further weakens the DPO’s position. A DPO who
must request resources from their direct superior could face difficulties, in particular if the
latter is not fully committed to achieving data protection compliance.   176In the present case,

Telenor ASA’s DPO does not have their own budget line and needs to seek the budget for
data protection expenses from their line manager, who is also one of the DPO’s supervisors
(‘prinsipal’). This may have negative consequences for the independence of the DPO.

Finally, during the course of the inspection it became apparent that all DPOs in the Telenor
Group, including the DPO of Telenor ASA, own shares in the company.         177 Telenor ASA has
neither assessed whether this may generate a conflict of interests for the DPOs nor drawn up
internal rules to prevent possible conflicts of interests for DPOs in their capacity as

shareholders. It is a well-known issue that, for some professions that require a high degree of

                                                                                                 49independence (e.g., lawyers), ownership of shares in a company may be incompatible with the
requirement for independence. In particular, this may be the case if the shareholder who is
subject to such a requirement performs activities that may have an impact on the value of the
shares.178This is the case with respect to many activities of a DPO whose advice, if followed,
may lead to substantial changes to the company’s business model. Thus, owning shares in the

company may generate a conflict of interests for a DPO who is also a shareholder, in
particular if there are no limits on the amount of shares they may acquire. In turn, this may
affect the independence of the DPO when the latter is asked to advise on particularly
business-critical processing operations. As Telenor ASA points out in its response, we are
talking about a low number of shares in this case. It is not automatically the case that share
ownership leads to a conflict of interest, but it is an issue that Telenor ASA should have

considered and documented.

We have not considered the external DPO’s independence or possible conflicts of interest, but
note that he was hired as an external consultant for a limited period of time. At the time of the
inspection, his degree of independence was thus structurally different from the DPO, who was
permanently employed in the position of both DPO and Associate Lawyer.

We also note that, during the six-month timeframe of the inspection when the DPO held two
roles, she essentially worked full-time on DPO tasks, insofar as the DPO tasks were
distinguishable from the associate lawyer tasks (which Datatilsynet does not believe they
always were). Thus, there was a lower risk of conflicts of interest materialising in practise.
However, some of the circumstances discussed above nevertheless challenge the DPO’s
independence, for example in relation to the dependency relationship for acquiring test cases

and a licence as a lawyer. Such dependency can under certain circumstances have unfortunate
consequences, for example if a DPO chooses to prioritize down getting involved in
demanding cases that make the concerned DPO seem as a ‘trouble-maker’, for the sake of
further career development. Datatilsynet has doubts as to whether the role of in-house
Associate Lawyer can at all be combined with the DPO role.

Datatilsynet does not have enough information to conclude on this point. Regardless, we do
find that Telenor ASA has not carried out all the assessments it should have and that the
distinction between the roles and tasks of DPO and Associate Lawyer, respectively, was not
sufficiently clear. See section 12.2 on the requirements of Article 24(1) and (2) GDPR.

11 Tasks of the DPO – Article 39(1)

11.1 Inspection criteria and evidence

The first and second sentences of Article 39 GDPR read as follows:

    1. The data protection officer shall have at least the following tasks:

                                                                                                50        a) to inform and advise the controller or the processor and the employees who carry
            out processing of their obligations pursuant to this Regulation and to other Union

            or Member State data protection provisions;
        b) to monitor compliance with this Regulation, with other Union or Member State
            data protection provisions and with the policies of the controller or processor in
            relation to the protection of personal data, including the assignment of

            responsibilities, awareness-raising and training of staff involved in processing
            operations, and the related audits;
        c) to provide advice where requested as regards the data protection impact

            assessment and monitor its performance pursuant to Article 35;
        d) to cooperate with the supervisory authority;
        e) to act as the contact point for the supervisory authority on issues relating to

            processing, including the prior consultation referred to in Article 36, and to
            consult, where appropriate, with regard to any other matter.
    2. The data protection officer shall in the performance of his or her tasks have due regard
    to the risk associated with processing operations, taking into account the nature, scope,

    context and purposes of processing.

We further refer to sections 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 in the final inspection report of 30 September
2022.

11.2 Datatilsynet’s assessment

Overall, the tasks set out in Article 39(1) are reflected in the job description of Telenor ASA’s
DPO, the Group Manual Privacy from 2020       179and the Group Manual Privacy from 2022.      180
Even though we are of the opinion that the description of the DPO’s tasks should be more
specific, for example with regard to how and when the DPO should be involved in the

handling of personal data breaches and DPIAs, we do not conclude that Article 39(1) GDPR
has been violated within the timeframe of the inspection, as the preponderance of evidence is
insufficient.

12 Organisational measures to ensure compliance – Article 24(1) and (2)

12.1 Inspection criteria and evidence

Article 24(1) and (2) GDPR reads as follows:

        1. Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well
            as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of
            natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and
            organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is

            and updated where necessary.
        2. Where proportionate in relation to processing activities, the measures referred to in

            paragraph 1 shall include the implementation of appropriate data protection
            policies by the controller.

We refer to sections 3.9.1 and 3.9.2 in the final inspection report of 30 September 2022.

12.2 Datatilsynet’s assessment

Article 24(1) states that the controller shall implement appropriate technical and

organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is compliant
with GDPR. Those measures should take into account the nature, scope, context and purposes
of the processing and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

12.2.1 Scope of controllership

The processing operations carried out by Telenor ASA encompass different categories of
               181
personal data.    From Telenor ASA’s Article 30 report, it seems that a limited amount of
personal data processed by Telenor ASA falls within the definition of special categories of
personal data, cf. Article 9(1) GDPR.  182 Telenor ASA mostly processes personal data relating

to its own approximately 380 e183oyees, but also about other employees of the Te184or
Group (about 15,000 in total ), as well as customers and other individuals.         Even though
Telenor ASA does not have direct customer relations, it processes customer data originally
collected by its subsidiaries within Group-Unit-Internal Audit & Investigations (GIAI) and
                   185
Telenor Research.      Telenor ASA also processes data that originally stem from the
subsidiaries in the day-to-day monitoring of their compliance with group policies in the
Compliance department.    186

Processing activities carried out by Telenor ASA’s subsidiaries are only relevant for the
present case to the extent Telenor ASA qualifies as controller, alone or jointly with the
relevant subsidiary, or where Telenor ASA qualifies as processor and/or the relevant

subsidiary acts as processor or sub-processor for Telenor ASA.

It is beyond the scope of the present inspection to conclude on Telenor ASA’s role in all the
different processing activities that are carried out by the company and its subsidiaries.

However, taken together, the relevant facts in the case can say something about the
obligations incumbent on Telenor ASA.

for the company’s responsibilities. For instance, a processor must only process data on

documented instructions from the controller pursuant to Article 28(3)(a) GDPR. A controller,
on the other hand, is responsible for and must be able to demonstrate compliance with the
principles relating to the processing of personal data pursuant to Article 5(2) GDPR.
Furthermore, as mentioned, Article 24 GDPR is aimed at the controller.

In relation to its subsidiaries, Telenor ASA acts as controller, joint controller and processor.  187
Telenor ASA’s role must be considered individually in each situation. Controllership rests

with the company or companies that, alone or jointly with others, determine the purposes and
means of the processing of personal data, cf. Article 4(7) GDPR. One of the main elements in
this regard is who exerts decisive influence over the processing for their own purposes.     188 For

instance, a controller may exert influence over the processing of personal data for the purpose
of fulfilling legal obligations.189When a company in the Telenor Group processes personal
data on behalf of the controller, it qualifies as processor pursuant to Article 4(8) GDPR.

Telenor ASA maintains that the other companies in the Telenor Group act as separate
controllers for their own processing activities, and for processing activities that Telenor ASA
conducts involving data originally collected by the other companies.     190 Especially relating to

the processing of customer data, Telenor ASA maintains that they act as processor on behalf
of its subsidiaries.91 However, according to the Article 30 report, Telenor ASA qualifies as
controller, e.g. for the processing of personal data about employees in the Telenor Group for

‘Corporate Social Networking’ and ‘Learning Management Systems.’ It is in any case the 192
actual circumstances that are decisive for the assessment of who the controller is.       If Telenor
ASA in a specific context exerts influence over the processing to the degree that it (co-)
determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data by its subsidiaries,

Telenor ASA will be (joint) controller for that processing.

The CJEU has ruled that the term ‘controller’ must be broadly defined and that:

        ‘the existence of joint responsibility does not necessarily imply equal responsibility of
        the various operators engaged in the processing of personal data. On the contrary,
        those operators may be involved at different stages of that processing of personal data

        and to different degrees, so that the level of responsibility of each of them must be
        assessed with regard to all the relevant circumstances of the particular case.’   193

access to the personal data concerned’.  194

Telenor ASA processes customer data e.g. for the purposes of research through surveys in the
Telenor Group’s markets to understand customer behaviours.       195 These are multi-country,
multi-year surveys, with business and research purposes.    196 Telenor ASA defines itself as
                                        197
processor for this specific processing.    The fact that these investigations are carried out on a
large scale throughout the Telenor Group, and that they encompass the different markets of
the Telenor Group and with a purpose of understanding customer behaviours in these markets,
suggests that it is not only the subsidiaries of Telenor ASA that qualify as controllers for this

processing. It seems unlikely that Telenor ASA does not, at least to some degree, exert
influence over the purposes and means of this processing. Datatilsynet is of the opinion that
this could be a processing activity for which Telenor ASA may have joint controllership with
its subsidiaries.

Furthermore, there are several situations in which the subsidiaries are given responsibility for
how to implement instructions, e.g. through the group’s governing documents.        198In some

cases, these documents define the framework for the subsidiaries’ activities, including with
regard to the processing of personal data. In light of this, Datatilsynet is of the opinion that
Telenor ASA acts as joint controller together with its subsidiaries for some of the processing
activities carried out in the Telenor Group. However, we do not conclude on this point, as this

must be considered by Telenor ASA.

The external DPO described the situation as follows:

        ‘\[…\] as long as ASA has an operational involvement in business activities involving
        processing of personal data, whether it’s within ASA itself or exercised upon other
        businesses through ASAs role as HQ, there are privacy obligations to adhere to that
                                    199
        ASA cannot fully escape.’

As mentioned previously, it falls outside the scope of the present inspection to reach a firm
conclusion on Telenor ASA’s role in the different processing activities in the Telenor Group.

Such clarification will be a task in which a DPO, with their data protection expertise and
knowledge of the company, should be involved.

In this case, we only rely on what Telenor ASA has written in their own the records of
processing, to the extent that there is only a requirement of preponderance of evidence.

whether Telenor ASA should be considered controller, joint controller or processor for
specific processing activities. That is the case for processing both by other companies in the
Telenor Group and by Telenor ASA relating to data originally collected by other companies
of the group. However, we find it to have been substantiated that Telenor ASA acts as
controller for more activities than the company has assumed in its responses to Datatilsynet.

12.2.2 Regarding organisational measures

In this section we assess the organisational measures that Telenor ASA had in relation to
Article 38 GDPR and for general compliance of the GDPR.

In accordance with the accountability principle in Article 5(2) GDPR, Telenor ASA shall be
responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, the other principles of data

processing.

It follows from Article 24(1) GDPR that the controller shall implement appropriate technical
and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is
compliant with the GDPR.

Article 24(2) states that, where proportionate in relation to the processing activities, the

controller shall implement appropriate data protection policies. This entails that the
organisational measures should include internal data protection policies where relevant and
proportionate.

Telenor ASA is, in any case, controller for a number of processing activities regarding
employee data. For these type of processing activities, which take place in a professionalised

context and in the context of a large group, it is clearly reasonable to expect at least
fundamental guidelines and a minimum level of internal control to ensure GDPR compliance.
Anything else would undermine the purpose of Article 24 and the accountability principle.

We note that further processing activities for which Telenor ASA is identified as the
controller alone or jointly may impose even stricter requirements regarding which policies
must be in place.

For the sake of completeness, we emphasise that organisational measures, documentation and
policies must specify how the company should achieve GDPR compliance. It is, of course, not
sufficient to simply repeat or refer to the wording of the GDPR.

Telenor ASA must therefore adopt a written policy, with clear and precise content, as outlined
below. The documented policy should provide detailed descriptions that the Telenor ASA can

refer to and use internally with respect to organisation of the DPO within the company.

                                                                                                55In its response, Telenor ASA indicated that what is decisive is whether the measures have an
       200
effect.   It is in any case Telenor ASA’s responsibility to ensure that the policy is formalised
and documented so that compliance can be demonstrated, and to prepare the policy in such a
way that it is possible to operationalise the guidelines and enable them to have an effect.

Firstly, we refer to section 6.2 above, where we concluded there was a risk that Telenor
ASA’s DPO was not being involved in all data protection issues in a proper and timely
manner. We were not presented with any policy that demonstrated or ensured the involvement
of the DPO. For this reason, it has been difficult to determine whether or not the requirement
in Article 38(1) GDPR was met. We have given the company the benefit of the doubt.

Telenor ASA considers that there are no grounds for requiring a formalised policy since we
chose not to conclude that Article 38(1) GDPR had been violated.     201The fact that the absence
of a policy has made it difficult for Datatilsynet to conclude on these questions cannot be

understood to mean that no violation has taken place. We consider that the lack of a policy
constitutes an independent violation of Article 24 GDPR and believe there is a need for
documented assessments as part of the internal control.

Datatilsynet finds the degree of formalisation of the timing and manner of involvement of the

DPO insufficient. Telenor ASA has not provided us with any written procedures or other
appropriate policies regarding the timing and manner for involvement of Telenor ASA’s DPO
in all data protection issues, including DPIAs and data breach management. The inspection
has revealed that the involvement of the DPO in data protection matters has generally been

informal and to a large extent been decided on a case-by-case basis. We therefore find
Telenor ASA failed to establish organisational measures to ensure and demonstrate that all
processing activities were performed in accordance with the GDPR, and had not implemented
sufficient internal policies regarding when and how to involve the DPO in all data protection

issues.

Secondly, we refer to section 8.2 above, where it is our view that Telenor ASA has failed to
demonstrate the existence of organisational measures in the form of a formalised reporting
line between the DPO and the highest level of management      202of Telenor ASA, within the
                                                                          203
timeframe of the inspection. The issue was raised by the external DPO.       Telenor ASA has
not provided us with any formally adopted written policy describing or ensuring the DPO’s
access to the highest management level. As the discussion in section 8.2 shows, it is essential
that the company considers how and to whom the reporting should take place in practise and

concretizes this in clear and unambiguous written guidelines. This has lacked in Telenor ASA.

                                                                                                56We specify that mentioning the DPO’s possibility of reporting directly to the ‘CEO first
escalation’ and the ‘BoD second escalation’ (board of directors)  204in PowerPoint
presentations is not sufficient in this case.

We note that the new and updated policies, Group Manual Privacy and Group Policy Privacy,
valid from 1 January 2022, still do not mention the reporting line to the board. The following
sentence from the Group Manual Privacy (valid between 1 June and 31 December 2021) was
even removed in the updated version that entered into force on 1 January 2022:

        ‘The DPO shall have the right to report all privacy-related incidents and non-
        conformities directly to the BU CEO.’  205

In this case, we have seen different interpretations in Telenor ASA’s documentation of what

should be considered the highest management level. We are of the opinion that internal
policies for the company must clearly define the highest management level in Telenor ASA
and provide a description of how the DPO is ensured a direct reporting line accordingly.

In essence, Telenor ASA’s decisions on using CCM and GU Forum as reporting arenas and

the mentioned amendments to its former manuals and policies demonstrate how unclear the
content in the internal policies has been. Even though it would be possible for a DPO to reach
out informally to the board and day-to-day highest management, this would most likely be
dependent on personal acquaintances and perhaps by chance of circumstances. Either way,
companies must have appropriate organisational measures in place, including internal policies

that are reliable and available in all circumstances to be able to ensure and demonstrate
compliance,

Thirdly, we refer to section 10.2 above. where Datatilsynet did not have enough information
to conclude if the DPO was ensured sufficient independence and absence of conflict of

interests. A concrete and documented analysis of possible risks should have been conducted
in this respect. As previously mentioned, we find that the organisational measures put in place
by Telenor ASA failed to ensure a clear distinction between the tasks to be performed as DPO
and those to be performed as Associate Lawyer. There are several organisational measures
that would have been appropriate, ranging from placement in the organisation to avoid

dependencies, to the DPO needing to use a separate email address to clearly show the
distinction between roles. In addition, Telenor ASA has neither assessed whether the fact that
DPO owns shares in the company may generate a conflict of interests for the DPO nor
implemented organisational measures to prevent possible conflicts of interests for
DPOs/shareholders. We consider Telenor ASA’s implementation of organisational measures
to be inadequate in this regard. We find that these efforts do not fulfil the legal requirements

of Article 24(1) GDPR. In any case, Telenor ASA is not able to demonstrate compliance with
the provisions of the GDPR.

Group Manual Privacy policy, which stated that ‘GPO shall act as DPO in Telenor ASA’.          206
Telenor ASA noted in its comments on the inspection report that ‘DPO’ in this respect is
meant to refer to the fact that, at the time, the DPO was organisationally placed in the division
                                             207
Group Privacy & IM and not Group Legal.          Telenor ASA also claims that the DPO’s
responsibility and tasks are not presented in the Group Manual Privacy since it relates to
Telenor as a group. 208 Telenor ASA emphasised that the GPO and DPO have always been two
               209
separate roles.   Datatilsynet notes that Telenor ASA has kept us up to date regarding who
has the role of DPO in Telenor ASA, and that               was the GPO when someone else had
the role of DPO. This shows that Telenor ASA’s practice differed from what was written in
the internal group policy. Telenor has acknowledged that ‘they understand that the text is
                                        210
imprecise and can be misunderstood’.       It is difficult to see why it is stated in the policy that
the GPO shall act as DPO in Telenor ASA when that is not the case.

In its comments on the notification, Telenor ASA states that:

        ‘It has not been elaborated or stated what measures Datatilsynet considers necessary
        on the basis of the Group Privacy Manual. To the extent that Datatilsynet considers
        that the wording of this policy needs to be adjusted, Telenor will again emphasise that

        the matter does not constitute an independent violation of Article 24(1) and (2) GDPR.
        Such a change will not have an actual effect as regards the DPO’s position in Telenor
        ASA.’

Furthermore, Telenor ASA questions whether Article 24(1) and (2) GDPR on an independent
basis provide for special guidelines on DPOs. Telenor ASA asserts that ‘the internal control
provision in Article 24(1) and (2) GDPR targets the “processing” and is intended to ensure
                                                                                               211
that the processing of personal data is in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR’.
Their interpretation is thus that Article 24 GDPR only applies to the individual processing
activity, and not in general. However, this is a narrow understanding of the provision with
which we do not agree.

It follows from several sources of law that Article 24 GDPR is an internal control provision,
as Telenor ASA also states, and that it applies to GDPR compliance in general. Recital 78
states it is required ‘that appropriate technical and organisational measures be taken to ensure

that the requirements of this Regulation are met.’ In other words, the purpose and the
legislator’s intention, is that the requirement for appropriate technical and organisational
measures to ensure compliance, applies generally and not only for the ‘processing.’

Both Jarbekk et al. and Skullerud et al. refer to Article 24 GDPR as internal control and that
the provision is very much a continuation of the internal control provision in the former

                                                                                                 58                                          212
Personal Data Act (2000) Section 14.          Jarbekk et al. state that ‘the controller shall
implement ‘appropriate technical and organisational measures’ to ‘ensure and demonstrate’
compliance with the regulation’ (our emphasis).        213

In other words, it is a provision that establishes what is fairly obvious, namely that the
controller has a duty to comply with all relevant provisions of the GDPR. Article 24 GDPR

must be interpreted in light of Article 5(2) GDPR and the accountability principle, and must
be read as a provision on ‘accountability.’     214The provision was introduced because the
previous Data Protection Directive’s system of providing notification to the data protection
                                 215
authorities was discontinued.        This means that responsibility for compliance rests fully with
the controller. 216

It would be directly contrary to the purpose and context of the provision, cf. the EEA law
interpretation principles mentioned above, if the controller only needed to ensure compliance
with certain provisions of the GDPR. In practice, this would have entailed that the controller

did not need to ensure compliance with the other provisions. It is clear for Datatilsynet that
the legislator has not made such a rule.

As Docksey points out, Article 24 GDPR has evolved from the Data Protection Directive in
that it requires proactive and demonstrable compliance:

         ‘It places responsibility firmly on the controller to take proactive action to ensure
         compliance and to be ready to demonstrate that compliance. (…) Accountability in
         this sense requires that controllers put in place internal policies and mechanisms to

         ensure compliance and provide evidence to demonstrate compliance to external
         stakeholders, including supervisory authorities.’     217

         ‘It is crucial for controllers to take active responsibility for ensuring compliance and
         develop an accountability culture at all levels of their organisation.’     218

The obligation to provide documentation follows from Article 24(2) GDPR. As Skullerud et
al. point out:219

Article 24.

                                                                                                         59        ‘The company’s internal procedures must be established and documented in writing.’

        ‘As part of the internal control system, the controller shall implement governing
        documents addressing data protection for data subjects, cf. Article 24(2) GDPR.
        According to the Personal Data Act (2000), it was also considered a requirement to
        establish governing documents for the undertaking’s processing of personal data.’

Datatilsynet therefore finds that the company’s narrow understanding of Article 24(1) GDPR
must be rejected.

Furthermore, when a DPO has been appointed, it is a requirement that the DPO has
independence, necessary resources, direct reporting line to highest management, and is
involved in all data protection issues. As an example, if the requirements relating to
independence are failed to be respected, it may result in the processing activities in which the

DPO has been involved fail to comply with the GDPR. The same is the case if, for example,
the DPO has not been involved in processing activities where the DPO’s involvement was
required or if the DPO was unable to report any deficiencies to the highest management level.
In other words, there is always a link – albeit indirectly – between specific processing and
policies relating to the DPO. If the documentation relating to the DPO is inadequate, it will
simply not be possible for the controller to demonstrate that the processing complies with the
law, as required by the provision.

Article 24(1) GDPR states that the controller shall be able to demonstrate compliance.
Incorrect and contradictory policies are obviously not in line with this requirement. Failure to
demonstrate compliance is thus a violation in itself, regardless of whether an actual effect can
be established; the point is precisely that, when the documentation is inadequate, it will often
not be possible for the supervisory authority to uncover the facts.

In its response, Telenor ASA indicated that Article 24 requires a proportionality assessment:

        ‘Telenor cannot see that Article 24 GDPR necessitates guidelines to the extent and
        level of detail Datatilsynet requires, when this is not related to the processing activities
        themselves, but rather to the DPO (who is not directly involved in the processing
        activities).’

As mentioned Datatilsynet has pointed out that Telenor ASA is lacking fundamental internal
policies. To require the policies to be neither contradictory nor incorrect is hardly too much to
ask. Already here, we believe that Datatilsynet’s requirements are within the scope of what
can reasonably be expected from Telenor ASA.

Furthermore, the inspection has revealed some policies that are not concrete, and the data

protection work has taken place in the context of several different forums. Based on the
complexity, that has been uncovered through the inspection, on Telenor ASAs organisation of
the data protection work and ambiguities around the scope of processing activities, it will be
proportionate to implement concrete guidelines.

                                                                                                60We consider that Telenor ASA’s policies concerning the DPO were inadequate. In part, they
simply repeated the wording of the law, in part they were self-contradictory, and in part they
did not provide sufficiently detailed instructions for Telenor ASA’s DPO arrangement. The
findings and issues addressed in this decision are largely a consequence of these inadequate

policies. No appropriate organisational measures had been established to ensure that the role
was actually independent, that the DPO was involved in all issues relating to data protection
and that they had access to the highest management level in line with the intention of the law.

Fifthly, we find that Telenor ASA lacks organisational measures to ensure general GDPR

compliance.

          wrote in an email to         dated 12 April 2021:

        ‘Regarding Data Protection/Transfer Impact Assessments, the current backlog is quite
        big and I believe the organization is struggling a bit to get up to speed. There is
        currently little capacity/competency to conduct proper impact assessments among the
        ASA colleagues.’  220

The external DPO was copied in the above email and responded, among other things:

        ‘True. However, the lack of capacity/competence to conduct assessments is also a

        symptom of a more general issue of immature privacy compliance governance and
        performance at ASA, and a lack of foundational building blocks for privacy
        compliance, such as e.g. inventory, awareness and competence, operational capacity,
        implemented processes and unclear roles/responsibilities for group initiatives’.  221

In relation to a discussion on outsourcing of operational GDPR compliance activities, the
external DPO wrote the following:

        ‘However, more generally than simply discussing outsourcing of some operational
        privacy compliance activities (which also would have a time- (in terms of follow-
        up/involvement) and monetary cost to ASA), this discussion/issue between the
        mentioned entities foundationally has to do with defining each entity’s role (privacy

        wise) and corresponding accountability, responsibilities and operational capacity in
        initiatives with group dependencies’.  222

Telenor ASA has informed us that they did not go through with the outsourcing that was
                                                       223
under discussion and that this is therefore irrelevant.   In our view, the above
correspondence, regardless of whether the outsourcing happened or not, is relevant because it
illustrates that, at the time when it was written, there was uncertainty in Telenor ASA
regarding the allocation of data protection roles (i.e. when Telenor ASA acts as controller,

joint controller or processor with or on behalf of other business units), the accountability and

measures regarding these issues to ensure and demonstrate that processing is performed in
accordance with the GDPR.

According to the external DPO, there was a general diffusion of responsibility     225and a lack of
competence in Telenor ASA.     226Based on the evidence collected during the present

inspection, we agree with this assessment. We refer to section 5.2.3 regarding our assessment
of diffusion of responsibility and unclear allocation of roles in Telenor ASA.

Furthermore, we find the internal policies should have been better structured on several
                                                                                    227
specific and general data protection issues, as the former DPO also pointed out.       At the
meeting of the GU Forum in September 2021, the former DPO presented, among other things,
the following regarding data protection and privacy governance in Telenor ASA:

        ‘b) Routines, policies and documentation - The organization lacks structured and
        documented frameworks and ways-of-work to adhere to privacy requirements, causing
        inefficiencies, unclarity and direct non-compliance.

        c) Internal data sharing governance - Personal data is shared between business units
        within Telenor without adequate data sharing governance, including legal transfer
        mechanisms, clear definition of controller/processor relationships, and generally
        diffusion of responsibility.

        d) Business-, system- & contract ownership - Ambiguous/nonstandardized
        governance for internal business-, system- and contract ownership, as well as potential
        GSSoutsourcing/operation capacity, causing ambiguity and diffusion of responsibility

        for privacy compliance.
        e) Line org. capacity and competence - The organization lacks capacity and
        competence to deal adequately with privacy compliance pro-actively, causing strain on
        existing resource(s), process and progress bottlenecks, and ultimately low
                          228
        /noncompliance’.

In addition, the external DPO noted the presence of risks in relation to the privacy principles,
privacy notices, personal data breaches, DPIAs (Data Protection Impact Assessments),

sharing of personal data with non-compliant third parties, and sharing of personal data with
third parties without formal statutory requirements including international transfers.   229When
identifying these types of serious privacy risks, it is clear under Article 24(1) GDPR that the

controller must address them. Telenor ASA has not done so.

We note that Telenor ASA has adopted internal privacy principles and policies      230 that they
claim are reviewed and updated as required. A new Group Manual Privacy was shared with us

direction of better GDPR compliance. However, this is not sufficient, as during the timeframe

of the inspection, there was a lack of organisational measures to address the issues mentioned
above.

If this case had involved a small business with just a few employees, more informal policies
would perhaps have been be sufficient, but this is not practical in a company with an

extensive business area and many employees. In this context, we point out that Telenor ASA
is the parent company of one of the largest Norwegian groups in the telecom sector. At the
time of the inspection, Telenor ASA was responsible for adopting global policies, and we
believe that it must be expected that the parent company that decides data protection policies

is able to operationalise them through specific procedures and policies. The lack of specific
policies is also in contrast to Telenor ASA’s operations in other areas, which are governed by
many corporate governance documents. As Telenor ASA also refers to in its response, they
operate in a sector that is strictly regulated, with a strong emphasis on compliance. It is
therefore natural to set similar requirements for compliance in the area of data protection as

for other business-critical areas.

The external DPO described the risk of being unable to perform the role effectively and
independently. 231 In our opinion, one of the reasons for this was the lack of proper
implementation of clear policies, including a clear reporting line and access to the highest

management and clear description of the DPO’s tasks.

Overall, our assessment is that Telenor has violated Article 24(1) and (2) GDPR by not
having implemented appropriate organisational, that ensure and demonstrate compliance and

by not having had adequate policies in place.

13 Assessment of corrective measures

13.1 Summary of findings in relation to corrective measures

With reference to the assessments in section 5, we note that Telenor ASA has not carried out
an internal and documented assessment of the obligation to appoint a DPO, which is a
necessary part of internal control and thus constitutes a violation of Article 24 GDPR.

Furthermore, in section 5, we pointed out that Telenor ASA has admitted that the company
did not have adequate routines in terms of completing and updating the record of processing
activities. Telenor ASA notes the record of processing activities contains ambiguities.   232As
pointed out in section 5 the record of processing activities is a part of internal control, and

updated at all times.

With reference to the assessments in section 8, we found that Telenor had not established a
formalised and direct reporting line for the DPO to the highest management level for most of
the timeframe of the inspection, in violation of Article 38(3) GDPR.

With reference to the assessments in section 12, we found that Telenor ASA has not

implemented organisational measures to ensure compliance with the GDPR and has not
demonstrated compliance, in violation of Article 24(1) GDPR, and has not implemented
appropriate data protection policies, in violation of Article 24(2) GDPR, regarding
organisational measures linked to Article 38 GDPR and general compliance with the GDPR.

Regarding the partial violation of Article 37(7) GDPR, we note this as a minor infringement
for a limited amount of time, which has been corrected. Therefore, we consider that no further
action or corrective measures are needed.

Datatilsynet concluded under doubt that Telenor ASA had not ensured the DPO adequate

resources under Article 38(2) GDPR, but since Telenor ASA does not have a DPO at the
moment we do not impose a corrective measure for that.

13.2 Compliance orders

Based on the findings in section 13.1, we have concluded that it is necessary to react to these
infringements. We order Telenor ASA:

    -   To carry out a documented internal assessment of whether Telenor ASA is obliged to

        appoint a DPO, which among other things, takes into account Telenor ASA’s role in
        the various processing activities.

We refer to section 5.2.1, where we mention that Telenor ASA has not submitted a
documented assessment of the matter of whether Telenor ASA is obliged to appoint a DPO in

its roles as controller, joint controller and processor. Such an assessment shal233e carried out
as an organisational measure and documented as part of the internal control,       cf. Article 24
GDPR, unless it is obvious that it is not required.234 Considering uncertainties surrounding
Telenor ASA’s role, as well as the fact that the company’s record of processing activities
includes far more processing activities with a greater scope than pure HR tasks in Telenor
ASA and a high number of data subjects in several countries, we believe such an assessment

is required.

    -   To revise the record of processing activities, cf. Article 30 GDPR, and implement
        organisational measures to ensure that it at all times reflects an updated description of

                                                                                                64        Telenor ASA’s processing activities, the number of data subjects and Telenor ASA’s

        roles.

We refer to sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3, where we discuss Telenor ASA’s record of processing
activities. Keeping and maintaining such records, cf. Article 30 GDPR, also falls within the

scope of the mandatory internal control and organisa235nal measures that Telenor ASA must
implement in accordance with Article 24 GDPR.          The record of processing activities is an
important document that provides a genuine overview of the company’s processing activities
and roles.

    -   In the event that Telenor ASA is actually obliged to have a DPO, to implement
        organisational measures and appropriate policies with regard to the DPO’s
        organisation. This includes a description of the reporting line to a clearly defined
        highest management level, a description of the tasks the DPO should be involved in,

        as well as the manner and timing of such involvement. Assessments and measures to
        ensure independence and to avoid conflicts of interest include clearly distinguishing
        between any other roles in the job description, providing a separate email address for
        the DPO and carrying out a documented assessment of the DPO’s shareholding in the
        company.

We refer to section 12.

Our legal basis for imposing this compliance order is Article 58(2)(d) GDPR.

As mentioned, in order for processing activities to meet the requirements of the GDPR, it is a
prerequisite that the controller meets all its obligations under Chapter IV GDPR. We therefore
believe that the supervisory authority under Article 58(2) GDPR is not limited to processing
                                                                               236
activities as such, but includes all the requirements for GDPR compliance.        This is also
supported by Article 57(1)a GDPR, that establish the Supervisory Authorities’ task of
monitoring and enforcing the application of the GDPR. CJEU has stated that use of corrective
measures shall ‘ensure a consistent and high level of protection of personal data through
strong enforcement of the rules (…)’ and the purpose of Article 58(2) GDPR is ‘to ensure that

the processing of personal data complies with that regulation and to make good situations
where there has been a breach of that regulation so as to make them conform with EU law, as
a result of intervention by the national supervisory authorities (…).’  237

In any case, it is clear that Datatilsynet can impose administrative fine for a number of
infringements which do not directly apply to specific processing activity as such. In some
cases it is more appropriate and proportionate to impose milder administrative sanction as an

236On page 51 of the response of 31 May 2024, Telenor ASA stated that we cannot impose orders because the
orders do not concern the performance of the processing activities.

                                                                                                 65order than to impose an administrative fine. The same also applies to a reprimand, which
Recital 148 explicitly states can be imposed instead of an administrative fine.

The questions concerning the appointment of a DPO and inaccuracies in the record of
processing activities were not initially addressed specifically during the inspection, but were
raised by Telenor ASA in its comments on the advance notification. We consider that it is not
necessary and proportionate in relation to these infringements to impose an administrative

fine.

The deadline for fulfilling the compliance orders is 3 months from the date Telenor ASA
received the decision, and we ask Telenor ASA to send us a documented confirmation that the
compliance order has been fulfilled within that timeframe.

13.3 Reprimand

A reprimand is an administrative sanction intended to emphasise criticism of the cited
infringements. Imposition of a reprimand may be emphasised in any subsequent assessments
of whether to impose an administrative fine if there is a corresponding violation of the
regulations, cf. Article 83(2)(i) GDPR.

The DPO plays an important role in assisting the controller/processor in ensuring compliance

with the requirements of the GDPR and ensuring that the fundamental rights of the data
subjects are safeguarded. The obligations in Article 38 GDPR are basic requirements that
must be met in order to have a functional DPO. The requirements are the same regardless of
whether the appointment of a DPO is mandatory or voluntary. We find that violation of these
provisions leads to the inefficiency of the DPO, which again can affect the data subject’s
rights and to processing activities not complying with the law. In principle, this indicates that

the supervisory authority can impose an administrative fine. In some cases, however, there are
circumstances that indicate that a reprimand is an appropriate reaction.

As a consequence of the notification of the decision, Telenor ASA chose to terminate the
DPO arrangement. In our view, this is very regrettable. We find this requires a more thorough
assessment than what has been carried out, as it is not obvious that Telenor ASA is not
required to have a DPO. If, following such an assessment, Telenor ASA maintains that their

DPO role is voluntary, we will nonetheless encourage the company to reinstate the DPO. In
particular, it should be taken into account that it emerged during the inspection and later that
the DPO has in practice dedicated one hundred per cent of their time to the role, at the same
time as there have been DPO tasks they have not been able to perform. Considering the
company’s own description of the need for data protection work, it is therefore a paradox that
they choose to terminate the DPO role instead of ensuring that it is carried out both in
accordance with the GDPR and allocated sufficient resources.

However, we agree with Telenor ASA that it can send an unfortunate signal beyond this case
if an administrative fine is imposed for something that is a voluntary arrangement, and the
threshold for this should therefore be high. The purpose of the DPO role is precisely to
contribute to companies’ compliance and maintaining a privacy culture, and Datatilsynet

                                                                                                66would prefer more companies to have a DPO. We would nonetheless like to emphasise that
the circumstances that were uncovered during the inspection and that we have assessed

following further information from Telenor ASA indicate that Article 38(3) GDPR has been
violated and that the violation provides a basis for an administrative fine. The case may
therefore have been different if Telenor ASA clearly fell within the obligation to appoint a
DPO set out in Article 37.

We consider it necessary to react to the violations, and taking into account the above, we
impose a reprimand for violating Article 38(3) last sentence GDPR for

     •  not having a direct reporting line in place for the DPO in Telenor ASA to the highest

        management level for approximately one year of the timeframe of the inspection.

Our legal basis for imposing this reprimand order is Article 58(2)(d) GDPR.

13.4 Whether to impose an administrative fine

In what follows, we will consider whether to impose an administrative fine for infringements
of violations of Article 24(1) and (2) GDPR, when it comes to inadequate organisational
measures linked to Article 38 GDPR and general compliance with the GDPR.

13.4.1 General principles when assessing whether to impose administrative fines

An ‘administrative sanction’ is a negative reaction that may be imposed by an administrative
agency in response to an actual breach of a statute, regulation or individual decision, and

which is deemed t238e a criminal sanction pursuant to the European Convention on Human
Rights (ECHR).

The Norwegian Supreme Court (Rt. 2012 p. 1556) has concluded that an administrative fine
constitutes a penalty under Article 6 ECHR. As a result, we can only impose a fine where

there is a clear preponderance of evidence (in Norwegian: ‘klar sannsynlighetsovervekt’) that
the GDPR has been violated. In this case there is clear preponderance of evidence for all the
infringements that an administrative fine will be imposed for.

In order to impose administrative sanctions, such as an administrative fine, the principle of
legal certainty must be satisfied. The principle of legal certainty (in Norwegian:
‘legalitetsprinsippet’) is a general principle in both EEA Law  239and Norwegian
administrative law. 240

The right to impose administrative fines is provided as a means of ensuring effective

compliance with and enforcement of the Personal Data Act. It follows from Article 83(1)
GDPR that administrative fines ‘shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and
dissuasive’.

   The Norwegian Constitution Article 113.

                                                                                                67In Recital 148, this is elaborated:

      ‘In order to strengthen the enforcement of the rules of this Regulation, penalties
      including administrative fines should be imposed for any infringement of this
      Regulation, in addition to, or instead of appropriate measures imposed by the
      supervisory authority pursuant to this Regulation.’

The conditions for imposing a fine are set out in Article 83 GDPR. The provision suggests
that the imposition of an administrative fine shall be based on a discretionary overall
assessment, but also sets guidelines for the exercise of discretion by highlighting elements
that should be given special attention, cf. Article 83(2) (a) to (k) GDPR.

In its decision of 5 December 2023 in Case C-807/21 (Deutsche Wohnen), the CJEU specified
that the conditions for imposing an administrative fine are exhaustively regulated by Article
83(1) to (6) GDPR. The Court concluded that Article 83 must be understood to mean that the
imposition of an administrative fine is conditional on the controller having demonstrated
culpability in the form of negligence or intent. The fee should be set so high that it also takes

effect beyond the specific case, while the amount of the fee must proportionate to the
infringement and the undertaking, cf. Article 83(1) GDPR.

In regard to the purpose of the provisions in the GDPR, CJEU has stated that it

         ‘… to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons with regard
        to the processing of personal data within the European Union and, to that end, to
        ensure consistent and homogeneous application of the rules for the protection of the
        fundamental rights and freedoms of those persons with regard to the processing of
        personal data throughout the European Union.’     241

        ‘Through their deterrent effect, administrative fines contribute to strengthening the
        protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and
        therefore constitute a key element in ensuring respect for the rights of those persons, in
        accordance with the purpose of that regulation of ensuring a high level of protection of
                                                                        242
        such persons with regard to the processing of personal data.’

13.4.2 Statutory requirements

Depending on the circumstances of each individual case, an administrative fine shall be
imposed in accordance with Article 58(2)(i) GDPR, in addition to, or instead of, measures

referred to in points (a) to (h) and (j) of Article 58(2), cf. Article 83(2) first sentence GDPR.

Article 24 GDPR is not mentioned in the list in Article 83(4) and (5) GDPR. Violations of this
provision can therefore only be sanctioned with an administrative fine if so provided for in

241
242CJEU Case C-807/21 Deutsche Wohnen v Staatsanwaltschaft Berlin, para 72.
   CJEU Case C-807/21 Deutsche Wohnen v Staatsanwaltschaft Berlin, para 73.

                                                                                                 68national law. For Article 24 GDPR, such a legal basis is provided in Section 26 first
paragraph of the Personal Data Act, cf. Article 84 GDPR.

13.4.3 Elements to be given special emphasis when considering to impose a fine
In assessing whether an administrative fine should be imposed, Datatilsynet must emphasise
the elements in Article 83(2)(a) to (k) GDPR. Below is our assessment of the elements we
consider relevant in assessing whether an administrative fine should be imposed for violations
of Articles 24(1) and (2) GDPR.

a) the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement
As regards the criterion in Article 83(2)(a) GDPR, Telenor ASA’s infringements as
summarised above may be sanctioned in accordance with the lower tier of sanctions under the
GDPR’s two-tier sanctions system, cf. Article 83(4) GDPR.

When it comes to the nature of the infringements, the duty to implement appropriate
organisational measures and appropriate policies pursuant to Article 24(1) and (2) GDPR,
results of the fundamental accountability principle. The accountability principle underlies all
of the company’s obligations and is a prerequisite for real, systematic and effective

compliance with the GDPR. Therefore, the infringement concerns a central and fundamental
norm in the GDPR, which is aggravating.

When weighing the gravity of the infringements, we take into consideration the nature of the
processing, which is business activity. We attribute more weight to the gravity of the

infringement when there is a clear imbalance between the data subjects243d the controller
such as in this case, where most of the data subjects are employees.

Regarding the scope of the processing as mentioned, it is unclear which processing activities
Telenor ASA is controller for, which in turn affects the extent of the responsibility under

Article 24 GDPR.

This lack of clarity also makes it difficult to establish the purpose of the processing.
According to Telenor ASA, the purpose is mainly HR administration and processing of
employees’ personal data.

It is also difficult to estimate the number of data subjects who are affected. Telenor ASA has
around 380 employees, but the exact number of data subjects affected is uncertain. Telenor
ASA’s Article 30 record, shows that the number of data subjects encompassed by the
processing activities carried out by Telenor ASA in the timeframe of the inspection varied
from a minimum of 1–25 data subjects to maximum 25,000–100,000.         244 In addition, all

employees of the Group, approximately 15,000 data subjects, are affected by processing
carried out by subsidiaries for which Telenor ASA, according to their record of processing
activities, has joint controllership, cf. section 5.2.3.

243
244Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, p. \*\*18.
   Telenor ASA’s Article 30 record of 2 February 2022.

                                                                                                69Furthermore, a very high number of customers are mentioned as data subjects in the record of
processing activities in connection with joint controllership with Telenor’s subsidiaries. In its
response, Telenor ASA states that the entries in the records do not reflect reality. Datatilsynet
notes the importance of records of processing activities providing a correct picture of
processing activities in the organisation. This is because the company must maintain an

overview itself and because such records are an important form of documentation for the
supervisory authority’s assessments.

Due to the ambiguities in the documentation Telenor ASA has submitted to Datatilsynet, we
cannot determine how many data subjects are affected by the infringement.

Identifying specific damage is not necessary to be able to establish that a violation has
occurred, but the extent of damage must be included as an element in the assessment. We find
it mitigating that no specific damage to data subjects has been found, but keep in mind that it
may be difficult for data subjects to know and find out whether their personal data have been
processed in violation of the GDPR.

The assessment of the duration of the infringement is limited to the timeframe of the

inspection, which is the period from 10 October 2020 to 28 January 2022. We will only take
into account the duration of the violations within this period. We do not take the situation
before or after this period into consideration as aggravating or mitigating factors in this
context.

The violation of Article 24(1) and (2) GDPR regarding organisational measures and

appropriate policies lasted the entire timeframe of the inspection. We refer to section 12.2.

We find the duration of non-compliance of around 15 months in this case to be an aggravating
factor.

Despite that it is not possible to demonstrate tangible damage to the data subject’s privacy, as

well as ambiguities regarding the processing’s scope and purpose and the number of data
subjects, we find that the nature and duration warrant the imposition of an administrative fine.

b) the intentional or negligent character of the infringement
The imposition of an administrative fine is conditional on the controller having demonstrated
culpability in the form of negligence or intent, cf. Article 83(2)(b) GDPR in conjunction with

Article 83(3) GDPR, cf. the CJEU’s decisions dated 5 December 2023 in case 807/21
Deutsche Wohnen and C-683/21. In the Deutsche Wohnen decision CJEU states:

        ‘Accordingly, it follows from the wording of Article 83(2) of the GDPR that only
        infringements of the provisions of that regulation committed wrongfully by the
        controller, that is to say those committed intentionally or negligently, can result in a
                                                                        245
        fine being imposed on the controller pursuant to that article.’

245CJEU Case C-807/21 Deutsche Wohnen v Staatsanwaltschaft Berlin, para 68.

                                                                                                70See also the Norwegian Public Administration Act section 46(1).

Negligence is defined as follows in Section 23 of the Penal Code:

        ‘Any person who acts in contravention of the requirement of due care in an area of
        life, and who may be held to blame in view of his or her personal circumstances, is
        negligent. The negligence is gross if the act is highly reproachable and there are
        grounds for significant blame.’

Pursuant to the due care requirement, businesses and the responsible individuals acting on
their behalf need to examine the legal requirements that apply to their field and implement
these. Otherwise, the company can be deemed to have acted negligently with respect to this
omission.

Telenor Group is a leading telecom company across the Nordics and Asia with 209 million
subscribers and annuals sales of around NOK 81 billion (2023),    246 where Telenor ASA is the
parent company located in Norway. In our view, Telenor ASA has the means and competence
to familiarise itself with the legal requirements in the field of data protection, and should act

accordingly.

In our view, Telenor ASA has not sufficiently familiarised itself with the requirements of
Article 24 GDPR, as evidenced by the inadequate assessments, measures and policies. The
information we got during the inspection shows that the company did not prioritise and

allocate enough resources to address the problems identified by the external DPO, including
with regard to internal control, despite clearly being encouraged to do so. In other words, the
company has not done what could be expected, and it has not operated in accordance with the
due care requirement. Therefore, the infringement was at least committed negligently.
Consequently, we find a culpable infringement to have been established, which is a condition
                                     247
for imposing an administrative fine.

We find that the culpability requirement has been met and that this indicates that an
administrative fine should be imposed.

c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data
    subjects

There is no evidence that the data subjects have suffered any material damage. This criterion
is therefore not applicable in the present case.

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor taking into account technical
    and organisational measures implemented by them pursuant to Articles 25 and 32

246

                                                                                                71We agree with Telenor ASA that this criterion does not apply in this supervisory case, as
technical and organisational measures pursuant to Articles 25 and 32 GDPR have not been an
issue.

e) any relevant previous infringements by the controller or processor

This criterion is not applicable in the present case, as Telenor ASA has not been sanctioned for
similar or otherwise ‘relevant’ infringements in the past.

f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority, in order to remedy the

    infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement

Telenor ASA has been cooperative through the whole inspection, by providing information
and answering our questions. We consider that this factor is neither an aggravating nor a
                   248
mitigating factor.

g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement

Categories of personal data relating to Telenor ASA’s own employees include contact
information, information about career and competence, communication, location, behaviour,
financial accounts and balance, financial transactions and family relations.    249Some of these

categories of personal data may be regarded as sensitive for the data subject (such as
information about finances), even though they do not fall under Article 9(1) GDPR.

Only some of the categories fall within the definition of special categories of personal data
pursuant to Article 9(1) GDPR, including health data relating to employees and the police
records of job applicants. 250

Categories of personal data relating to customers include behaviour, preferences, interests,
demography, identity, location and physical characteristics (not health-related).    251Telenor
ASA also processes some categories of personal data relating to other persons, including
consultants and contractors.  252

It is difficult to conclude exactly which categories of personal data are affected by the
infringement, because of ambiguity in the submitted documentation from Telenor ASA.

We find this criterion in sum, to be neither an aggravating nor a mitigating factor.

248According to WP253 Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines in accordance with
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, p. 15, letter (f) may be a mitigating factor in some cases, but it would not be
appropriate to take into account cooperation that is already required by law.

    particular whether, and if so to what extent, the controller or processor notified the
    infringement

The infringement became known to Datatilsynet through our own initiation of the inspection.
In this case, we consider this to be neither an aggravating nor a mitigating factor.

i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the
    controller or processor concerned with regard to the same subject-matter, compliance
    with those measures

This is neither a mitigating nor an aggravating factor, as we have not ordered any previously
corrective measures against Telenor ASA with regard to the same subject matter.

j) adherence to approved codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or approved certification
    mechanisms pursuant to Article 42

This criterion is not applicable in the present case.

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,
    such as financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the

    infringement

Datatilsynet has no information to indicate that Telenor ASA has benefitted financially from
the infringements.

As explained previously, it is difficult to conclude various elements above because the scope

of Telenor AS’s controllership is ambiguous. This is a consequence of Telenor ASA not
having implemented adequate organisational measures to maintain and update a record of
processing activities, cf. section 5 and 13.2. Datatilsynet considers this to be an aggravating
factor.

As described in the previous sections, Telenor ASA has taken some measures throughout
2021 and tried improving the reporting line for the DPO and added the option of escalating

matters to the CEO and the board. These are considered mitigating factors.

13.4.4 Conclusion on whether to impose an administrative fine

Telenor ASA is the parent company of a large group in a strictly regulated telecom industry
and should be equipped to have good internal control. Considering the factors set out in
Article 83(2) GDPR, the imposition of an administrative fine is warranted due to the

circumstances of this case.

In Datatilsynet’s view, the imposition of an administrative fine will produce a genuine
deterrent effect and dissuade Telenor ASA – as well as Telenor Group companies and other
companies in general – from committing similar infringements in the future, and ensure that

                                                                                               73they ensure good internal control, including the implementation of necessary measures and
assessments as well as documentation thereof. Enforcement efforts should generate sufficient
pressure to make non‑compliance economically unattractive in practice.       253

13.5 Deciding the amount of the administrative fine

Having had due regard to the factors under Articles 83(1) and (2) GDPR outlined above, we
find an administrative fine of 4,000,000 NOK to be appropriate in this case. The reasons for
this are outlined below.

In that connection, it should be noted that the setting of a fine is not a precise mathematical
exercise,254 and the supervisory authorities have a certain margin of discretion in this respect.  255
Theyshouldnonethelessspecifythefactorsthatinfluencedtheexerciseoftheirdiscretionwhen
setting a fine.256

Article 83(1) GDPR establishes the following when deciding the amount of administrative
fines:

        ‘Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines
        pursuant to this Article in respect of infringements of this Regulation referred to in
        paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 shall in each individual case be effective, proportionate and

        dissuasive.’

Article 83(2) GDPR further provides that, when deciding on the amount of the administrative

fine in each individual case, due regard shall be given to the factors listed in Articles
83(2)(a)–(k) GDPR.

Recital 148 GDPR emphasises that administrative fines should be imposed ‘in order to

strengthen the enforcement of the rules of this Regulation’.

Recital 150 GDPR states:

        ‘Where administrative fines are imposed on an undertaking, an undertaking should be
        understood to be an undertaking in accordance with Articles 101 and 102 TFEU for
        those purposes.’

Pursuant to CJEU case law, the term ‘undertaking’ must be understood as an economic unit,
even if that economic unit consists of several legal persons.   257Different companies belonging

the meaning of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU (Treaty on the Functioning of the European

Union).

Telenor ASA is the parent company of Telenor Group. Telenor Group must be considered an

economic unit, and therefore also the SEU (single economic unit), i.e. the undertaking that is
relevant for the calculation of the administrative fine.    258 The EDPB has issued a binding
decision with the instruction to the supervisory authority to take into consideration the total

turnover of all the entities composing the single undertaking, i.e. the consolidated turnover of
the group of companies headed by the parent company.            259 The CJEU has ruled that the
maximum amount of the administrative fine is calculated on the basis of a percentage of the
                                                                                                  260
total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding business year of the undertaking concerned.
The infringements found in this case qualify for administrative fines under Article83(4) GDPR,
pursuant to litra (a) of the provision. The maximum amount under Article 83(4) GDPR is

10,000,000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 2% of the total worldwide annual
turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.

In terms of the requirements under Article 83(1) GDPR to ensure that the imposition of the

fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive, the financial position of Telenor Group must be
taken into account. The financial position of Telenor Group is also relevant to determine the
maximum fine applicable in the present case.

In the calculation of the administrative fine, Datatilsynet takes into account the revenue of
Telenor Group.  261 According to the financial statement of Telenor Group’s annual report
                                                                       262
2023, the group’s total revenue in 2023 was NOK 80,452,000,000,           or approximately EUR
7,157,332,860.  263In the present case, the legal maximum amount pursuant to Article 83(4)
GDPR is 2% of the total annual turnover, which in 2023 amounted to NOK 1,609,040,000, or
                                    264
approximately EUR 143,146,000.

We refer to our assessments above in this section on the factors set out in Articles 83(2)(a)–

(k) GDPR. It is very important that a controller maintains good internal control, carries out
necessary assessments that are documented and establishes the necessary organisational
measures, which we have found to be lacking during the timeframe of the inspection.

                                                                                                  75Emphasis is also placed on Telenor ASA’s negligence (Article 83(2)(b)), especially in view of
the company’s size and influence and what is expected of such a company. That said, we have
not found direct damage to data subjects. This is a factor we give considerable weight.

We have moreover emphasised that the processing time has been long and the case has been

inactive for some time, which implies downward adjustment to the amount. This is also in
accordance with the practice of the Privacy Appeals Board; see the decisions in cases PVN-
2022-3, PVN-2021-20, PVN-2021-16, PVN-2021-13 and PVN-2021-3.

In sum we are of the opinion that the administrative fine should be set at low level.

We believe that an administrative fine of NOK 4,000,000, or approximately 0.005% of
Telenor Group’s annual turnover, is proportionate and dissuasive in this case, in light of the
specific circumstances. The amount does not exceed what is necessary to achieve compliance
with the GDPR in this case.

14 Collection of the administrative fine

The administrative fine is due for payment four weeks after the decision is final, cf. the
Personal Data Act (2018) Section 27. The decision constitutes grounds for an attachment
order. Collection of the claim will be carried out by the Norwegian National Collection
Agency.

15 European cooperation

This decision has been adopted in cooperation with the other concerned supervisory authorities,
pursuant to Article 60 GDPR.

16 Access to documents

Pursuant to the Public Administration Act Sections 18 and 19, Telenor ASA – as a party to

this case – has the right to acquaint itself with the documents in this case. Documents in the
case were submitted on 22 December 2021 and 22 March 2024.

Pursuant to Section 3 of the Freedom of Information Act,   265all case documents we hold are,
as a rule, subject to public access. If you think that any documents in this case should be
partly or entirely exempted from public access based on legal derogations, please notify us

and provide an explanation for your claim.

17 Right to appeal

When a decision has been adopted pursuant to Article 56(2) GDPR and Chapter VII GDPR, it
may be challenged before Oslo District Court (‘Oslo tingrett’) in accordance with Article

265Act No 16 of 19 May 2006 relating to the right of access to documents held by public authorities and public
undertakings (Freedom of Information Act)

                                                                                              7678(1) GDPR, Sections 22 and 25 of the Personal Data Act and Section 4-4(4) of the Dispute
    266
