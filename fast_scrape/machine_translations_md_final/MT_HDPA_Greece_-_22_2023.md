Summary
The Authority considered three related complaints of violation of the right of access to recorded conversations against an electricity supplier. He found, first of all, that the recording of the disputed conversations is legal, as it constitutes a legal professional practice according to article 4 paragraph 3 of Law 3471/2006 in conjunction with article 3 of Annex III of the Electricity Supply Code and, further, that there was a violation of articles 12 par. 2, 3 of the GDPR, to the extent that the complained company delayed in all three cases to satisfy the complainants' exercised rights of access, while in one case it made it difficult to exercise the disputed right of access.

At the same time, he ordered the complainant to act, within three (3) months of the decision being made, in order to shape the organization of its internal procedures in such a way, as an organizational safety measure, especially in the context of any existing emergency conditions, in order to facilitate the exercise of the rights of the data subjects and to satisfy the exercised rights within the deadlines provided for in article 12 par. 3 of the GDPR, and to inform the Authority accordingly.
