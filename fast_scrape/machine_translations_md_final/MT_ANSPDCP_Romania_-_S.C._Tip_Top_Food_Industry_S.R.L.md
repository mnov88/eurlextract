The Romanian Supervisory Authority has completed an investigation of the controller S.C. Type Top Food Industry S.R.L and found a violation of the provisions of art. 5 par. (1) lit. b) and c) and par. (2), art. 6 and art. 7 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

As such, the controller S.C. TIP TOP FOOD INDUSTRY S.R.L. was sanctioned with a fine of 24,362.50 RON (the equivalent of 5,000 Euros).

Following the investigation, the Romanian Supervisory Authority found that the controller processed the image of its employees excessively through video cameras installed in locker rooms and in the dining area, for the purpose of protecting the company's goods and products, as well as and discouraging theft.

In this context, the Romanian Supervisory Authority considered that the processing of personal data was not adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed ("data minimisation"), thus violating the principles of art. 5 par. (1) lit. b) and c) of the General Data Protection Regulation. The Romanian Supervisory Authority considered that the stated purpose of the controller (protection of the company's goods, products and deterrence of theft) could be achieved by less intrusive means for the privacy of employees.

On the other hand, in the investigation, taking into account the employer-employee relationship, it was noted that the consent of the data subject could not be considered freely given and no other legal basis for processing could be identified, as the controller could not prove compliance for the processing, by reporting to art. 5 par. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

The following corrective measures were also applied to the controller:

- the corrective measure to ensure the conformity of the personal data processing operations in the video monitoring activity, respecting the principle of “data minimisation”, reported to art. 5 par. (1) lit. c);
- to reanalyze the orientation of the angle of capturing the video images so that they do not monitor the activity of its employees in the spaces with the destination of locker rooms and in the dining room, related to the purpose of processing.

The investigation was initiated following a complaint from an individual who reported that the company S.C. TIP TOP FOOD INDUSTRY SRL processes personal data (respectively the image), through the video cameras installed in the employees' offices, in the locker rooms and in the dining room.
