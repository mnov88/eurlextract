(2) lit. d) from the General Regulation on Data Protection, it was ordered towards the operator Fundația Pro Economica – Pro Economica Alapítvány and the corrective measure to review and update the technical and organizational measures implemented regarding the security of personal data processed through the IT infrastructure used, especially those which concern connecting from outside the network to the data servers.
