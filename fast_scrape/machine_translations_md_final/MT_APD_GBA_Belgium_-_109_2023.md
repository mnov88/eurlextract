        personal are used for prospecting purposes, "has the right to oppose at any time

        to the processing of personal data concerning him for such purposes of

 Pursuant to Article 95, § 2 LCA, by this decision, the Litigation Chamber informs the parties of the fact that following

direct marketing, page 8, available at https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/publications/recommandation-n-01-
2020.pdf Decision 109/2023 – 3/6

 6. Article 12.3 of the GDPR provides that the controller needs to respond to the

       request from a data subject exercising their rights under Articles 15 to 22 of the GDPR

       within one month of receipt of the request. The manager of

       processing also informs within the same period if it needs an extension of the period

       orifthecontrollerdoesnotfollowupontherequestmadebytheperson

       concerned (article 12.4 GDPR).

    II.2. Application to the present case

 7. On June 15, 2022, after receiving an email purporting to promote real estate in

       location, the complainant had expressed his wish to be removed from the “email loop” of the

       defendant.

 8. Subsequently, it appears from the documents in the file that the defendant continued to send

       prospecting emails to the complainant. 4

 9. On June 27, 2022, the Complainant again contacted the Respondent by email for him

       ask to be removed from their real estate ad mailing list.

 10. The defendant did not comply with this second request either, because the exhibits of the

       record show that the defendant continued to send the same type of emails to the

       complainant.5

 11. On May 4, 2023, the complainant again expressed his wish to be removed from the list of

       recipients of the emails in question. The defendant did not respond to this

       request.

 12. In the Complaint Form, the Complainant indicates that the Respondent would also have

       contacted by phone. During this telephone call, the complainant allegedly reiterated his

       requests to no longer appear on the list of recipients of real estate advertisements of the

       defendant. However, the Litigation Chamber does not have evidence proving

       the existence of this phone call.

 13. The Litigation Chamber finds that the complainant's data (his email address

       containing his first and last name) have been used for direct marketing purposes. There

       Litigation Chamber also considers that the requests submitted by the plaintiff

       constitute opposition requests within the meaning of Article 21 of the GDPR because their requests

       intended to ensure that his contact details were no longer used for a particular purpose, namely

       direct marketing purposes.

4According to the documents provided by the complainant, the complainant was contacted on May 23, 2022, May 31, 2022, June 1, 2022, June 9,
2022, June 13, 2022, June 15, 2022, June 17, 2022 and June 27, 2022.
5According to the documents provided by the complainant, the complainant was contacted on July 12, 2022, July 22, 2022, August 26, 2022, July 7,
September 2022, October 25, 2022, November 4, 2022, November 9, 2022 and January 10, 2023. Decision 109/2023 – 4/6

 14. It is the responsibility of the Respondent, in its capacity as controller, to follow up on the

       the exercise of the rights of the persons concerned, in compliance with the conditions of

       Article 12 of the GDPR, mentioned in point 6 of this decision.

 15. The Litigation Chamber considers that on the basis of the aforementioned facts, there is reason to
       conclude that the defendant may have committed a violation of the provisions of the GDPR,

       which justifies that in this case, the Litigation Chamber takes a decision

       in accordance with Article 95, § 1, 5° of the LCA, more specifically to order the

       respondent to comply with the complainant's request to object to the processing of his

       data for direct marketing purposes under Article 21.2 of the GDPR.

 16. This decision is based on the fact that the complainant provides evidence of the disputed emails from

       direct marketing, the exercise of its right on several occasions as well as proof of

       persistent processing of his data despite his requests and after the expiry of a

       month provided for in Article 12.3 of the GDPR.

 17. Furthermore, in his complaint form, the complainant expressed the wish that all of the
       his personal data is erased from any of the defendant's servers.

       As this request was not made directly to the defendant, the

       Litigation Chamber invites the defendant to consider this request

       erasure within the meaning of Article 17 of the GDPR.

 18. This decision is a prima facie decision taken by the Litigation Chamber
       pursuant to Article 95 of the LCA on the basis of the complaint lodged by the complainant/the

       complainant, in the context of the "procedure prior to the substantive decision" and not a

       decision on the merits of the Litigation Chamber within the meaning of Article 100 of the LCA.

 19. The purpose of this decision is to inform the defendant, allegedly responsible for the

       processing, because it may have violated the provisions of the GDPR,

       in order to enable it to still comply with the aforementioned provisions.

 20. If, however, the defendant does not agree with the content of this decision

       prima facie and believes that it can make factual and/or legal arguments that

       could lead to another decision, it may send the Litigation Chamber a

       request for treatment on the merits of the case via the e-mail address litigationchamber@apd-

       gba.be, within 30 days of notification of this decision. The case
       applicable, the execution of this decision is suspended for the period

       aforementioned.

 21. In the event of further processing of the case on the merits, pursuant to Articles 98, 2° and 3°

       juncto article 99 of the LCA, the Litigation Chamber will invite the parties to introduce their

6Section 3, Subsection 2 of the ACL (sections 94 to 97 inclusive). Decision 109/2023 – 5/6

         conclusions and attach to the file all the documents they deem useful. If applicable, the

         this decision is permanently suspended.

  22. In the interests of transparency, the Litigation Division finally emphasizes that a

         dealing with the case on the merits may lead to the imposition of the measures mentioned in
                                    7
         section 100 of the ACL.

  23. Given the importance of transparency regarding the decision-making process of the Chamber

         Litigation, this decision is published on the website of the Protection Authority

         Datas. However, it is not necessary for this purpose that the identification data

         of the parties are communicated directly.

  2° order the dismissal;
