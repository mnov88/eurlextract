2. Application for b):

The rejection of the application for b) - which the plaintiff made in the appeal instance

in an unchanged form - was wrongly done by the regional court. Also
if the plaintiff initially states this in the oral hearing

has positioned that what matters to him is the insertion to a) and therefore

The defendant also does not agree with the word “there” that introduces the application under b), since this
