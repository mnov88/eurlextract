LEGAL FOUNDATIONS

I

By virtue of the powers that Article 58.2 of the RGPD recognises to each supervisory authority, and as established in Articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

II
Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter referred to as GDPR), under the heading "Definitions", provides that
"For the purposes of this Regulation
1)	"personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more factors specific to that person's identity
 

physical, physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social of that person;
2)	"processing" means any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data or upon sets of personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, limitation, erasure or destruction
Therefore, in accordance with these definitions, the collection of personal data through forms included on a website constitutes data processing, for which the data controller must comply with the provisions of Article 13 of the RGPD, a provision that has been moved from 25 May 2018 to Article 5 of Organic Law 15/1999 of 13 December on the Protection of Personal Data.
In relation to this matter, it is noted that the Spanish Data Protection Agency has at the disposal of citizens the Guide for the fulfilment of the duty to inform (https://www.aepd.es/media/guias/guia-modelo- clausula-informativa.pdf) and, in the case of low risk data processing, the free tool Facilita (https://www.aepd.es/herramientas/facilita.html).

III
Article 13 of the RGPD, which determines the information to be provided to the data subject at the time of collection of his or her data, provides
"1.Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected, the controller shall provide him with all the following information at the time of collection
a)	the identity and contact details of the person responsible and, where appropriate, his representative;
b)	the contact details of the data protection officer, if any;
c)	the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended and the legal basis of the processing;
d)	where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party;
e)	the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, where appropriate;
f)	where appropriate, the intention of the controller to transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation and the existence or otherwise of a Commission decision on adequacy, or, in the case of transfers pursuant to Article 46 or 47 or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), reference to adequate or appropriate safeguards and the means to obtain a copy thereof or the fact that they have been provided.
2.	In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject, at the time the personal data are collected, with the following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing of the data
 

a)	the period for which personal data will be kept or, where this is not possible, the criteria used to determine this period;
b)	the existence of the right to request the controller to have access to the personal data concerning the data subject and to have them corrected, deleted or restricted, or to object to their processing, and the right to the transfer of data;
c)	where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of the processing based on consent prior to withdrawal;
d)	the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
e)	whether the disclosure of personal data is a legal or contractual requirement or a requirement for entering into a contract, and whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and is informed of the possible consequences of not providing such data;
f)	the existence of automated decisions, including profiling, as referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in such cases, significant information on the logic applied and the significance and expected consequences of such processing for the data subject.
3.	Where the controller plans to further process personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, he shall provide the data subject, prior to such further processing, with information about that other purpose and any relevant additional information within the meaning of paragraph 2.
4.	The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if and in so far as the information is already available to the person concerned.
Article 11 of the LOPDGDD provides as follows:
"Where personal data are obtained from the data subject, the controller may fulfil the duty of information laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 by providing the data subject with the basic information referred to in the following paragraph and by indicating an electronic address or other means that makes the other information easily and immediately accessible.
2. The basic information referred to in the previous section must contain at least the following
a)	The identity of the data controller and his representative, in his
 
case.
 

b)	The purpose of the treatment.
c)	The possibility of exercising the rights set out in Articles 15 to 22
 
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
If the data obtained from the data subject are to be processed for profiling purposes, the basic information shall also include this circumstance. In this case, the person concerned must be informed of his right to oppose the adoption of automated individual decisions which produce legal effects on him or significantly affect him in a similar way, where this right exists in accordance with Article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
 

IV
By virtue of the provisions of Article 58.2 of the RGPD, the Spanish Data Protection Agency, as the supervisory authority, has a set of corrective powers in the event of a breach of the precepts of the RGPD.
Article 58(2) of the RGPD provides as follows:
"2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following corrective powers as set out below:
(…)
(b) sanction any controller or processor with a warning where processing operations have infringed the provisions of this Regulation
(...)
"(d) to instruct the controller or processor to bring processing operations into conformity with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a particular manner and within a specified time limit;".
"(i) to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of the individual case;".
Article 74(a) of the LOPDGDD, under the heading "Offences considered minor" provides:
"The remaining infringements of a purely formal nature of the Articles referred to in Article 83(4) and (5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and in particular the following, shall be regarded as minor and shall be subject to a limitation period of one year
(a) Failure to comply with the principle of transparency of information or the right to information of the person concerned by not providing all the information required by Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

V

In this case, it is claimed that the web page of the claimed person does not have a personal data privacy policy.

This Agency has noted the difficulty of access to the privacy policy of the claimed, on its website, http://aepae.es/ as it must be done through the link of cookie policy https://automattic.com/cookies/, and then, following this second link through the link https://automattic.com/privacy/.

Furthermore, analysing its privacy policy, it should be pointed out that nothing is indicated with respect to the exercise of rights, nor with respect to the right to file a complaint with the AEPD, nor is the regulation governing the protection of personal data expressly indicated.
It should also be noted that, taking into account this context, and the fact that the respondent collects the personal data of its users, it is clear that the
 

The requested information contravenes Article 13 of the RGPD, since it does not provide them with all the information on data protection provided for in that provision prior to its collection.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and assessed the criteria for the graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been accredited,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE SPANISH ASSOCIATION FOR THE PREVENTION OF
SCHOOL HARASSMENT, with NIF G86432226, for an infraction of Article 13 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, a warning sanction

-Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (RGPD)-, adapting the information offered to the requirements contemplated in article 13 of the RGPD, having to provide the users, prior to the collection of their personal data, all the information required in the mentioned precept, for which the claimed association will have to take into account the provisions of article 6 of the RGPD in relation to the legality of the treatment, as well as what is indicated in article 5 of the RGPD in relation to the purpose of the treatment and term of conservation of the data.
