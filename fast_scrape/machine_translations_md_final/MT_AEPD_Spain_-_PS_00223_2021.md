                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

In accordance with the provisions of article 84.3) of the LGT, the competence to
initiate and resolve this Penalty Procedure corresponds to the Director of

the Spanish Agency for Data Protection.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/12

Regarding the allegations made by the data controller (ONO), it is
means the following:

     1. The calls were made due to a mere error in filtering with the list
     Robinson, so in October 2020 a new
     filtered excluding the claimant's numbering. Provides a list of
     numbering in <Document 1> which does not include the numbering of the
     claimant.

In the present case, there are successive calls (three accredited) after the
exercise on two previous occasions of the right of opposition and deletion and that it was
attended by ONO on 01/13/2020 incorporating the internal exclusion list
advertising, which undoubtedly excludes that it was not caused by an error
punctual but due to a regular and continued improper practice.

     1. Although it is acknowledged that the calls were made, ONO does not consider your
     classification as serious.

The investigated and accredited facts converge on the fact that we are faced with a
conduct classified as serious.

In this sense, it should be noted that there is recklessness when a
legal duty of care and the offender does not behave with the required diligence, to
what must be added that the element of enforceability of a different conduct
consists of the capacity of the obligated subject to act differently and therefore

Therefore, in accordance with the legal system. In the present case, ONO has not been set
to the legal system and this lack of diligence constitutes the applicable type of
guilt in the behavior now analyzed.

     2. Disagreement with the application of the aggravating circumstance of article 80.1.a) of the

     LGT, by motivating it in a generic way.

In this regard, it means that in the same period of time this AEPD accredited, between
others, the same behaviors. It is enough to bring up the Annex of PS / 00059/2020, now
known to ONO.

     3. Disagreement with the application of the aggravating factor of article 80.1.c) of the
     LGT, as the alleged infringement has not reported any benefit to the company.

There is no doubt that the marketing action carried out by ONO now
imputed, corresponds to the profit motive of the entity. This is not an obstacle to

that, assuming the cost / benefit risk, may result in a specific case
unfavorable. In this regard, the serious conduct charged is part of the
insistence on their misconduct as a result of deficiencies in the
organizational and / or technical measures implemented, with absolute omission of the due
diligence and profit motive. It is worth mentioning the provisions of article 29.2 of

Law 40/2015, of 1/10, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/8

     4. Disagreement with the application of the aggravating factor of article 80.1.g) of the
     LGT, considering that the activity ceased and the specific error was corrected in October
     2020, as evidenced by <Document 1> provided.

It should be noted that the document provided by ONO (Document 1) as the basis for
prove the elimination of the call list the claimant's line lacks
evidentiary interest, both for its lack of authenticity and for its impossibility of
traceability from its origin.

Consequently, the allegations must be rejected.

                                             II

Of the documentation in the file as a result of that provided by the claimant,
