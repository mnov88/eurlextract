to object to the receipt of unwanted direct marketing emails.
The complainant will receive direct marketing from the defendant on June 21, 2023. On June 22, 2023
requests the complainant to be unsubscribed from the mailing list. Confirmed the same day
the defendant that the complainant was unsubscribed from the newsletters. On September 6
2023, the complainant informs the defendant that he is still receiving direct marketing.
After the complainant receives direct marketing again on October 6, 2023, the complainant brings
informs the defendant that he will file a complaint with the GBA.
2. On October 7, 2023, the complainant will submit a complaint to the Data Protection Authority
against the defendant.
3. On October 20, 2023, the complaint will be declared admissible by the First Line Service on
under Articles 58 and 60 of the WOG1 and the complaint is filed under Article 62,
§ 1 of the WOG transferred to the Disputes Chamber2
.
II. Justification
4. The complainant wishes to unsubscribe from the defendant's newsletters. The GDPR
does not define what is meant by “direct marketing”. To date, none exists
legal, official or generally accepted definition of this concept at European level.
Building on Recommendation No. 02/2013 of the CBPL of January 30, 2013 regarding
direct marketing and protection of personal data on the one hand and the proposal of
regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2019 on
respect for privacy and the protection of personal data in electronic
communications and repealing Directive 2002/58/EC123
, the GBA proposes to
define the concept of direct marketing as follows:
“Any communication, in any form, solicited or unsolicited, originating from a
organization or person and aimed at the promotion or sale of services, products (al
without payment), as well as brands or ideas, addressed by an organization or
person acting in a commercial or non-commercial context, who directly

is addressed to one or more natural persons in a private or professional context and
which involves the processing of personal data.”

5. The (unsolicited) communication is aimed at promoting the activities and the
promoting the defendant's image to the public, in this case cooperation
to the development of legislation. The message is addressed to identified persons
natural persons (cf. the address by name of the recipients) and becomes
sent via electronic communication, more specifically by e-mail. The Dispute Chamber
therefore concludes that the newsletters received by the complainant are direct marketing
to finish.
6. Article 21.2 GDPR stipulates that every data subject whose personal data is used
for direct marketing has the right to “object to the processing of him
concerning personal data for such marketing, including profiling
relates to direct marketing". The third paragraph of the same article stipulates that
"\[w\]hen the data subject objects to processing for direct
marketing, the personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes."
When a data subject objects to the processing of data for direct
marketing purposes, he does not have to justify his objection.
7. In accordance with Article 12.3 GDPR, the controller provides the
person concerned without delay and in any case within one month of receipt of the request
pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 GDPR information about the action taken on the request
is given. Depending on the complexity of the requests and the number of requests
that period may be extended by a further two months if necessary. The
the controller shall inform the data subject within one month of receipt of the
request of such extension.
8. The Disputes Chamber determines that the complainant's personal data, such as his email address, have indeed been used for direct marketing, since the complainant is a
direct marketing email on June 22, 2023. The Disputes Chamber also states
fixed the request dated. June 23, 2023 from the complainant to be removed from the mailing list
constitutes the exercise of his right to object within the meaning of Article 21.2 GDPR, because his
request that his data may no longer be used for a specific purpose,
namely direct marketing.
9. It is the responsibility of the defendant, in her capacity
controller, to respond to the exercise of the rights of the
data subjects in accordance with the conditions of Article 12.3 of the GDPR (see above,
marginal number 5). The Disputes Chamber notes that the answer dated June 23, 2023 of the

Decision 157/2023 — 4/7
defendant to the request for removal from the complainant's mailing list in a timely manner
answer constitutes a response in accordance with Article 12.3 GDPR. However, the complainant submits documents
which shows that he received another direct marketing email on October 6, 2023. The
The Disputes Chamber can deduce from this that appropriate action may not have been taken
to the complainant's objection.
10. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that on the basis of the above analysis
concluded that the defendant had violated the provisions of the GDPR
committed, which justifies taking a decision in this case
