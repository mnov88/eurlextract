The operator was notified by a customer claiming to take out a loan on his behalf.

During the investigation, it was found that an employee of the operator illegally used the client's credit application, as well as the other documents related to this application, although the client had notified Raiffeisen Bank S.A. that he waives this request.

Raiffeisen Bank S.A. notified that two of its employees provided confidential information about a customer's transactions to a former bank employee using Facebook, Messenger and WhatsApp, who in turn forwarded it to relatives of the customer.

During the investigation, it was found that Raiffeisen Bank S.A. did not take measures to ensure that any natural person acting under its authority and having access to personal data only processes it at the operator's request, which led to unauthorized access and unauthorized disclosure of customer data (name, surname, CNP, home/mailing address, account number, date of transactions, amount of transactions, beneficiaries of payments).

The operator was notified by a customer who complained about the existence of products not requested by him, as well as the lack of sums of money from his account.
