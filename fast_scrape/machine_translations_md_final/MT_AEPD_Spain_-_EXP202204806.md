gave from which the following is transferred as the main fact:

       “…a peephole of the make and model has been installed: EZVIZ DP1C. We have
evidence that he uses it to record and know which neighbors go up to the landing or to

hanging clothes on the roof” (folio nº 1).

       The facts are therefore concretized in the presence of a digital peephole that
According to the claimant's statement, it is used "to record and know who is close to
his door according to comments from the defendant himself.

The above facts may constitute a presumed infringement of art. 5.1
c) RGPD, which provides: “Personal data will be:

       c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes
for which they are processed (“data minimization”) (…)”.

       It should be noted that the device (digital peephole) is installed on the door pro-
property of the defendant and not in a common area, which is why it differs from other cases analysed.

attacks on property (vgr. Crime of robbery with force—articles 238 and ss CP).

       The use of the installed devices must be carried out in accordance with the purpose of

       In the written claim itself it is made clear that the door of the
