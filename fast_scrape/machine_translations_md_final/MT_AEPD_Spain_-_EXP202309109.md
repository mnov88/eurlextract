In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of article 4.1 and 4.2 of the RGPD,

involves processing personal data, since the entity
UNIQUE HOTEL APARTMENT. S.L carries out the collection and conservation of data
clients' personal data and carries out this activity in its capacity as responsible for the
treatment, given that it is the one who determines the purposes and means of such activity, by virtue
of article 4.7 of the GDPR.

For its part, article 5.1.c) of the GDPR regulates the “principles relating to processing”
establishing that: “1. Personal data will be: c) adequate, relevant and

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/6

limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed
(“data minimization”)”

This article states that personal data will be “adequate,
relevant and limited to the need” for which they were collected, in such a way
that, if the objective pursued can be achieved without excessive treatment of
data, this is how it should be done.

In turn, recital 39 of the GDPR indicates that: “Personal data must only be

processed if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be achieved by others
media." Therefore, only data that is “adequate,
relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which they are obtained or processed.”

The categories of data selected for processing must be the

strictly necessary to achieve the stated objective and the person responsible for the
processing must strictly limit data collection to that information that
is directly related to the specific goal that is intended to be achieved.

In this case, it is confirmed that the entity UNIQUE HOTEL APARTMENT.
S.L performs a scan of the clients' DNI and that it does not comply with the regulations

in force in relation to the obligation you have to communicate the data to the
State security forces and bodies.

Organic Law 4/2015, on the protection of citizen security, establishes, in its
article 25.1 “Documentary registration obligations” the following:

       “Natural or legal persons who carry out activities relevant to the
       citizen security, such as accommodation, transportation of people, access
       commercial use of telephone or telematic services for public use through
       establishments open to the public, trade or repair of used objects,

       rental or scrapping of motor vehicles, purchase and sale of jewelry and metals, whether
       whether precious or not, objects or works of art, security locksmithing, centers
       metal waste managers, wholesale trade establishments
       scrap metal or waste products, or sale of hazardous chemicals
       to individuals, will be subject to the obligations of documentary registration and
       information in the terms established by the applicable provisions.”

Likewise, Order INT/1922/2003, of July 3, on record books and parts of
entry of travelers into hospitality and other similar establishments includes, in its
Annex the “Traveller entry part model”, and the traveler data indicates
that the following data will be collected from travelers: “number. of document

identity, type of document, date of issue of the document, first surname,
second surname, first name, sex, date of birth, country of nationality, date of
entrance".

In this way, from the documentation in the file it can be concluded that the
copy of the identification document is not a necessary treatment to carry out the
registration, and comply with Organic Law 4/2015, constituting said action

a violation of article 5.1.c) RGPD, since it would not be necessary data
for the processing that is carried out, considering that excessive data has been processed
that are not necessary for the purpose for which they are intended.

                                           IV
                                       Sanction

The violation of art. 5.1.c) of the RGPD implies the commission of one of the infractions
typified in art. 83.5 of the RGPD, which provides the following: “Violations of the
following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with section 2, with fines
administrative expenses of €20000000 maximum or, in the case of a company, a

amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover of the
previous financial year, opting for the highest amount: “a) the principles
basics for the treatment, including the conditions for consent under
of the arts. 5, 6, 7 9”.

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 “Infringements considered “very

serious” of the LOPDGDD indicates: “1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and will expire after three years.
infringements that involve a substantial violation of the articles
mentioned in that and, in particular, the following: a) The processing of data
personal data violating the principles and guarantees established in article 5 of the

Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

The balance of the circumstances contemplated, with respect to the infraction committed
By violating the provisions of article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, it allows setting a penalty of
2,000 euros (two thousand euros).

                                       Measures

Article 58.2 of the GDPR establishes the corrective powers available to a
control authority and section d) of the aforementioned provision establishes that it may consist
in, “order the person responsible or in charge of the treatment that the operations of

treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable,
in a certain way and within a specified period.”

Therefore, it is appropriate to impose the corrective measure described in article 58.2.d) of the
RGPD and order the complained party to, within a period of one month, establish the

appropriate measures to adapt the management of the customer registry in the
hotel establishment as stipulated in article 5.1.c) of the RGPD.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and evaluated the criteria of
graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Director of the

Spanish Data Protection Agency,

                                     RESOLVES:
