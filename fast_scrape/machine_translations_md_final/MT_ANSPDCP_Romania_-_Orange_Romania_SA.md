Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in December 2024, an investigation at the operator Orange Romania SA and found a violation of the provisions of art. 12 para. (3) and (4), in conjunction with art. 17 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as of art. 5, art. 6 and art. 7 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was sanctioned with two fines in the total amount of 199,020 lei, equivalent to 40,000 EURO, as follows:

fine in the amount of 99,510 lei (equivalent to the amount of 20,000 EURO), for violating the provisions of art. 12 para. (3) and (4), in conjunction with art. 17 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679; fine in the amount of 99,510 lei (equivalent to EUR 20,000), for violating the provisions of art. 5, art. 6 and art. 7 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

The investigation was launched to verify the way in which the exercise of the right to erasure was resolved.

During the investigation, it was found that, after the unsuccessful attempt to subscribe to the mobile telephony services offered by the operator, the deletion of all personal data was requested. During the correspondence, the operator requested more personal data and no complete and adequate responses were provided to the requests received.

During the investigation, it emerged that Orange Romania SA did not properly manage the requests for deletion of personal data, thus violating the provisions of art. 12 par. (3) and (4), in conjunction with Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

At the same time, it was found that the operator had excessively collected and stored, including scanned copies of documents, although the personal data were no longer necessary for the purpose of identification related to the conclusion of a subscription contract. As such, the provisions of Articles 5, 6 and 7 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 were violated.

At the same time, as part of the investigation, the following corrective measures were also applied to the operator:

to submit a complete response to the request for deletion of his personal data, in accordance with the applicable legal provisions; to ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of personal data processing operations, by adopting the necessary technical and organizational measures, including in terms of appropriate training of the staff designated for this purpose, so that the operator is able to analyze, correctly resolve and respond appropriately to requests by which data subjects exercise their rights, within the deadlines and according to the conditions provided for in art. 12-23 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, with clear, transparent and accessible information to data subjects regarding the mechanisms for exercising rights; to remove from the database the personal data and identity documents of the affected person, collected during the failed subscription procedure to the services offered; to ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of personal data processing operations, so that the operator clearly establishes the legal basis for the collection of personal data by reference to each purpose of the processing, within the framework of the steps preceding the conclusion of a subscription contract to its services, so that personal data and identity documents are not collected and subsequently stored excessively and illegally except in compliance with applicable legislation, ensuring clear, transparent and accessible information to the data subjects, according to the provisions of art. 5-7, respectively, art. 12-14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
