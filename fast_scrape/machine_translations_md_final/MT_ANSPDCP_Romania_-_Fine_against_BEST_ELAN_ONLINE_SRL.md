Penalty for GDPR violation

Â 

The National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data completed in July 2024 an investigation at the operator BEST ELAN ONLINE SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was fined 4,977.1 lei (equivalent to 1,000 EURO).

The investigation started as a result of a complaint submitted by a targeted person who indicated that he was receiving unsolicited commercial messages from the operator. Although the natural person requested the deletion of his personal data, including by accessing a link made available to the data subjects by the operator, the petitioner did not receive any response to his request. The operator continued to send new unsolicited commercial messages to the data subject.

During the investigation, the operator did not communicate to the National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data the information requested based on its investigative powers, thus violating the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

In addition, in relation to the fine, the operator was ordered to communicate to the National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data all the information and documents requested in the investigation, pursuant to art. 58 para. (1) lit. a) and e) of the same regulation.
