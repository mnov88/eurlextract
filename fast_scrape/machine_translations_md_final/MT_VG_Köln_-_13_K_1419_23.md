The Federal Press and Information Office may continue operating its Facebook fan page. The Cologne Administrative Court ruled this following an oral hearing on July 17, 2025, thus upholding the lawsuits filed by the federal government and "Meta" (formerly "Facebook") against the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Information Security (BfDI).
 
The Federal Press Office operates a fan page on the social network Facebook. There, it provides information about the Federal Government's current political activities. When users visit the fan page, so-called "cookies" may be placed on their devices.
 
In 2023, the BfDI prohibited the Federal Press Office from operating its Facebook page ("fan page") due to violations of the law, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Federal Office for Information and Digital Infrastructure (BfDI) argued that, due to the non-compliant design of the "cookie banner" used by "Meta," there was no valid consent for the storage and reading of certain "cookies." Not only "Meta," but also the Federal Press Office, as the operator of the "fan page," is legally obligated to obtain the consent of the respective user. Furthermore, the Federal Press Office, together with "Meta," is responsible for ensuring that data processing is based on a sufficient legal basis, such as consent.
 
Both the Federal Government and "Meta" have filed lawsuits against the decision addressed to the Federal Press Office, which the court has now largely upheld. The court essentially stated the following reasoning:

Meta alone, not the Federal Press Office, is obligated to obtain the consent of end users for the placement of "cookies." There is no sufficient cause-and-effect relationship between the operation of the "fan page" by the Federal Press Office and the remote access to users' devices associated with the storage and reading of "cookies." While cookies can be placed when visiting a "fan page," they can also be placed when visiting any other "Facebook page."
Even under the GDPR, "Meta" and the Federal Press Office are not jointly responsible for the data processing operations complained of. The Federal Press Office's contribution to the storage and reading of cookies is limited to the operation of the "fan page." In particular, the Federal Press Office cannot specify parameters for the placement of cookies or the evaluation of the collected data. However, in the Chamber's opinion, merely enabling data processing does not justify the necessary joint determination of the means of data processing.
 
The court has granted leave to appeal, which the Higher Administrative Court for the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, based in Münster, would decide if the parties appeal.
