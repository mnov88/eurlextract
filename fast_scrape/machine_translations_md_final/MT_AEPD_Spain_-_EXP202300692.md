In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Protection of Personal Data and

guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures

processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

                                   Previous issues

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of article 4.1 and 4.2 of the RGPD,
involves processing personal data, since the party

treatment, given that it is the one who determines the purposes and means of such activity, by virtue
of article 4.7 of the GDPR.

                                           III

   f) processed in such a way as to ensure adequate data security
   personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and
   against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of measures

In the present case, as can be seen from the facts, A.A.A. shipped on May 19
2022 to a WECHAT group with all its employees a video in which you can
see a person leaving their job and another video in which that person
person returns. As recognized by the claimed party in its allegations, said
person was in charge of monitoring production, whose conduct qualifies

as a hot reaction (...) to the absence for a prolonged time of
someone in their workplace, a fact that results in significant harm to
the company and the other workers.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/12

However, such dissemination lacked any legal basis and violated the
confidentiality of the personal data of the aforementioned worker as well as the rest of the

employees visible in the recording.

Therefore, in accordance with the evidence available herein
moment of agreement to start the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what
results from the instruction, it is considered that the known facts could be
constituting an infraction, attributable to the claimed party, for violation of the

article 5.1.f) of the RGPD.

                                            IV
          Classification and classification of the violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD

The known facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to the party
claimed, typified in 83.5 RGPD, which under the heading “General conditions
for the imposition of administrative fines” provides:
"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20 000 000 or,
In the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the

global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:
       a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
       consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; (…)”

For the purposes of the limitation period for infringements, the alleged infringement
prescribes after three years, in accordance with article 72 of the LOPDGDD, which qualifies as very
serious the following behavior:

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

considered very serious and will prescribe violations that involve three years
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

       a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
       established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)”

                                            V
                                 Sanction proposal

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount,

in accordance with the evidence currently available
agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction, it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with
the following criteria established by article 83.2 of the RGPD:

       - The nature, severity and duration of the infraction, taking into account the
       nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
       as well as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damage and
       damages they have suffered (section a): due to the improper dissemination of two

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/12

       videos in which you can see a worker who was absent and returned to her
       job, as well as other workers on the production line, in
       a chat with all employees (at least 51 employees in 2022) of the

       company, with the presumed intention of warning - upon being classified as fact
       as a notable detriment to the company and other workers -, in order to
       to avoid possible similar behavior from other workers.

Likewise, it is considered that it is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the
following criteria established in section 2 of article 76 “Sanctions and measures

“corrective measures” of the LOPDGDD:

       - The linking of the offender's activity with the performance of treatments
       of personal data (section b): this is a company used to
       capturing images of its, at least, 51 workers in 2022, when counting

       with 37 cameras in its facilities.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with
regarding the infraction committed by violating the provisions of article 5.1.f) of the
RGPD, allows initially setting an administrative fine of €70,000
(SEVENTY THOUSAND EUROS).

                                          V
                                Adoption of measures

If the violation is confirmed, it could be agreed to impose on the person responsible the adoption of

appropriate measures to adjust its actions to the regulations mentioned in this
act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the RGPD, according to the
which each control authority may “order the person responsible or in charge of the
treatment that the processing operations comply with the provisions of the
this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain manner and within a

specified period…” The imposition of this measure is compatible with the sanction
consisting of an administrative fine, as provided in art. 83.2 of the GDPR.

It is warned that failure to comply with the possible order to adopt measures imposed by
This body in the sanctioning resolution may be considered as a
administrative offense in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD, classified as

infringement in its article 83.5 and 83.6, and such conduct may be motivated by the opening of a
subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.

Therefore, in accordance with the above, by the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection,
