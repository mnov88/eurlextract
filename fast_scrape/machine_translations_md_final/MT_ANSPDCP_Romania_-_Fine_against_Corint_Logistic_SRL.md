Penalty for GDPR violation

Â 

The National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data completed in April 2024 an investigation at the operator Corint Logistic SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) lit. a) and b), art. 6 para. (1), art. 12, art. 15 para. (1), art. 17 and art. 21 para. (3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was penalized:

1. with a fine of 4,976.3 lei (the equivalent of 1,000 EURO), for violating the provisions of art. 17 and art. 21 para. (3) from Regulation (EU) 2016/679;

2. with a fine of 4,976.3 lei (the equivalent of 1,000 EURO), for violating the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) lit. a) and b) from Regulation (EU) 2016/679;

3. with a warning, for violating the provisions of art. 15 para. (3) from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in conjunction with art. 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;

The investigation was started as a result of a notification sent by a concerned person who claimed a possible violation of the provisions of Regulation (EU) no. 2016/679. Thus, a client of the operator complained that he received commercial SMS messages from Corint Logistic SRL on his phone number, although he exercised his right to deletion and received confirmation that his personal data had been deleted.

During the investigation, it was found that the operator did not take into account the deletion/opposition requests sent by his client, so the petitioner continued to receive other commercial messages via SMS from Corint Logistic SRL, thus violating the provisions of art. 17 and 21 par. (3) of Regulation (EU) 679/2016.

Also, during the investigation, it was found that the operator did not prove the existence of the expressed consent of the person concerned for the transmission of commercial messages over the phone, thus violating the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) lit. a) and b) and of art. 6 para. (1) of Regulation (EU) 679/2016.

At the same time, during the investigation, it turned out that the operator did not communicate to the client a response to other requests through which he exercised his rights of access and deletion, sent by e-mail, although he had this obligation, the provisions of art. 15 para. (1) of Regulation (EU) 679/2016, related to art. 12 of the same regulation.

At the same time, the following corrective measures were applied to the operator:

- taking the appropriate measures in order to comply with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 679/2016, so that in the future the personal data of the persons concerned will be processed for the purpose of direct marketing aimed at the use of electronic communication services (e-mail, telephone), with obtaining their express and prior consent, including the adoption of procedures in this regard;

- the adoption of adequate and efficient internal procedures for the protection of personal data regarding the way of resolving the requests submitted by the persons concerned, pursuant to Regulation (EU) 679/2016, compliance in all cases with the applicable provisions regarding the analysis and resolution without delay of these requests, so that the operator can ensure that it effectively responds to the requests through which the rights of the data subjects are exercised, as well as regular operator training of its own staff.
