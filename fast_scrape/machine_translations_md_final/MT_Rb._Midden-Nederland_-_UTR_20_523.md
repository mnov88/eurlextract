Considerations

Introduction

1. On 9 July 2019, the Claimant submitted a request for access to his personal data to the Minister of Justice and Security, pursuant to Articles 12 and 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)1. On November 26, 2019, the claimant further specified this request during the hearing because, according to the respondent, it was formulated too generally. Plaintiff has requested access to his personal data that were processed during the exchange of documents by the IND with the registry office of the municipality \[place of residence\] and the Arnhem-Leeuwarden Court of Appeal. The claimant specifically concerns the personal data that have been processed during the proceedings before the Court of Appeal about the alleged false recognition of his daughter, and the question by which service these data have been processed. In the contested decision, the defendant declared the objection unfounded because the request does not relate to personal data processed by DT&V. Moreover, according to the respondent, the claimant initially responded insufficiently to the respondent's request to provide additional information regarding the request for inspection, so that there is no entitlement to a penalty payment for late decision.

Amended decision

2. The overview provided by the respondent as a result of the hearing and the accompanying motivation mean that the respondent has no longer upheld the contested decision. The court regards the defendant's letter of 14 September 2020 as an amended decision to that extent.

3. Pursuant to the provisions of Article 6:19 of the General Administrative Law Act (Awb), the appeal is also directed against the amended decision. In view of what was put forward by the claimant in the letter of October 16, 2020, the amended decision did not fully comply with the request. Plaintiff therefore has an interest in a substantive assessment of the amended decision. The appeal against the (contested) decision of 19 December 2019 will be declared inadmissible due to the lack of legal interest, because this decision has been replaced by the decision of 14 September 2020.

Assessment grounds for appeal

4. It has become apparent from the further grounds and from the proceedings at the hearing that the plaintiff's concern is, among other things, to provide the documents and appendices in full in which personal data concerning him have been processed. In the opinion of the court, the claimant is not entitled to this in the context of his application. Article 15 of the GDPR does not entitle you to copies of the physical or digital documents in which the personal data are processed. Article 15(3) of the GDPR only refers to the provision of a copy of the personal data itself and not a copy of the document in which the personal data has been deposited. There is, however, a right to an overview, in comprehensible form, of all personal data. That is, in a form that enables the data subject to take cognizance of his data and to check whether they are correct and have been processed in accordance with the GDPR. The Claimant cannot derive the right from the GDPR to obtain a copy of the original document or file containing the data, if the request for access can be met by means of another form of provision. The ground of appeal fails.

5. Furthermore, the claimant has submitted that it cannot be deduced from the overview provided by the respondent who provided the residence documents that were submitted in the appeal of the municipality \[residence\], what the legal basis for the submission of these documents is and what exactly has been said and written down. The interests of the claimant have been harmed by the transfer of these documents. Contrary to the claimant's view, the court sees no reason in the residence documents submitted by him on appeal to conclude that the further search made by the defendant into the processing of personal data by the defendant was incomplete. The fact that the claimant states that it has not given permission for the municipality \[place of residence\] to submit residence documents in the aforementioned appeal does not mean that the respondent has not complied with the obligation to grant access to the claimant's personal data within the framework of the AVG. The questions raised by the claimant in this regard about the submission of documents in the appeal of the municipality \[place of residence\] do not form part of the assessment in this appeal about the AVG. The ground of appeal fails.

6. Finally, the claimant has argued that it does not follow from the overview provided by the respondent which personal data of the claimant have been processed under point 15. The court follows the claimant on this point. The mere remark that the document is in the possession of the authorized representative and the applicant is not sufficient to enable the claimant to take cognizance of his data and to check whether those data are correct and have been processed in accordance with the GDPR. The claimant's appeal to that extent succeeds.
Penalty sum not making a timely decision

7. In the opinion of the court, the respondent has rightly decided, in response to the claimant's request for periodic penalty payments for late decision, that he is not entitled to this. In this situation, Article 8:55c of the Awb is not applied and the defendant does not owe a penalty. This is because a situation arises as referred to in Article 4:17, sixth paragraph, under c of the Awb, now that the application was manifestly unfounded. After the claimant had given the defendant notice of default in a letter dated September 10, 2019, he was requested by letter dated September 19, 2019 to supplement the application with information to which the request relates. Because the claimant has not clearly supplemented the application, the defendant was able to declare the application manifestly unfounded. Only in objection did the claimant make clear what his request for access to personal data was about.

8. The appeal against the decision of 14 September 2020 is well-founded, due to the lack of reasons for point 15 of the overview of personal data provided (see legal consideration 6). Respondent will have to make a new decision with due observance of this ruling. This means that the defendant will have to provide an overview with an amended motivation under point 15 in order to meet the requirements of the GDPR.

9. The court sees reason to order the defendant in the appeal costs incurred by the plaintiff. The court sets these costs on the basis of the Administrative Costs Decree for legal assistance provided professionally by a third party at €1,068 (1 point for submitting the notice of appeal and 1 point for appearing at the hearing, with a value per point of € 534,- and a weighting factor 1).

10. Since the District Court declares the appeal well-founded, the District Court determines that the defendant reimburses the applicant for the court fee paid by him.
