Sanction for violating the RGPD

In April 2022, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator Kredyt Inkaso Investments RO S.A. and found a violation of the provisions of art. 5, art. 6, art. 9 and art. 33 of the General Data Protection Regulation (RGPD).

The operator was fined as follows:

fine in the amount of 24,740 lei (equivalent to the amount of 5000 EURO) for violating the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) lit. a), c), para. (2), art. 6 and art. 9 of the General Data Protection Regulation; warning for violation of the provisions of art. 33 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

The investigation was initiated following a complaint from a data subject that Kredyt Inkaso Investments RO S.A. disclosed his personal data and that of his minor child to certain medical units.

In the course of the investigation, it was found that the operator disclosed the applicant's details (home address, personal numerical code, position held, employment contract data, medical leave certificate data) to certain doctors and certain medical units with which she did not have no legal relations.

It was also found that the processing of data on the health of the petitioner could not be carried out on the basis of legitimate interest as it is not among the processing conditions provided by art. 9 of the RGPD.

Therefore, the operator illegally processed the personal data of the petitioner by illegally and excessively disclosing them, including data on health status, in violation of the principles of processing provided by art. 5 para. (1) lit. a), c), para. (2) and the legality conditions provided by art. 6 and art. 9 of the RGPD.

At the same time, it was found that the operator Kredyt Inkaso Investments RO S.A. did not comply with the deadlines for notifying the security incident that occurred at the time of disclosing the petitioner's data to a doctor with whom the petitioner had no legal relations, thus violating the provisions of art. 33 of the RGPD.
