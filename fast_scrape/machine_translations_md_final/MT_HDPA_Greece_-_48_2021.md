    Summary
              A company that conducts long distance telephone sales, used to promote its products and services the customer data, which it collected during the purchase of products. This processing is the use of personal data for a purpose other than that for which the data were originally collected, therefore the criteria of Article 6 par. In this case, it was found that the data subject was not properly informed during the data collection stage, so that he knows that his data will be used for an additional different purpose, that customer objections were not respected and it was not clear to the data subjects the identity of the controller. Also, in relation to the satisfaction of the right of objection, the controller did not provide appropriate documents or instructions to prove that he was able to respond to such requests. The Authority imposed a fine of 20,000 euros for the violations found.
