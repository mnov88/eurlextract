Facts
1 The plaintiff, a lawyer, demands that the defendant cease and desist from unsolicited contacting by email for advertising purposes as well as payment of damages
for sending an unsolicited e-mail advertisement.
2 On 18.05.2020 at 11:26 a.m., the plaintiff received, at the email address of his law firm,
\[...\], from the defendant. In it, the defendant stated that it offered legal advice by lawyers by telephone via its website www.beratungsflat.de and that it cooperated with lawyers for this purpose who were remunerated by the defendant for this telephone advice.

3 The defendant took the address for sending the email from the contact page of the plaintiff's website at \[...\]. In addition to the contact details, including the plaintiff's e-mail address, this page contains the note that the plaintiff can usually be reached on weekdays between 12:00 and 19:00, but in any case via fax or e-mail.

4 By email dated 18 May 2020 at 11:47 a.m., the plaintiff demanded that the defendant submit a
declaration to cease and desist and to pay compensation for pain and suffering in the amount of
of € 500 by 18.06.2020. In a letter dated 16 June 2020, the defendant refused to issue the cease-and-desist declaration and to make the payment.

legal advice was part of the plaintiff's usual activities. The sending of the e-mail

are referred to.
Reasons for the decision
13 The action is admissible, but only well-founded with regard to the claim for injunctive relief.
1.
14 The plaintiff has a claim under §§ 823, para. 1, 1004, para. 1, sentence 2 of the German Civil Code (BGB) for injunctive relief against
the sending of unauthorised advertising messages to his email address by the defendant.
15 Even the sending of e-mails with advertising content only once to a lawyer who has to read his e-mail carefully for professional reasons constitutes an interference with the established and practised business.
16 Contrary to the defendant's view, the email of 18.05.2020 qualifies as advertising. Advertising is any statement made in the exercise of a trade, business, craft or profession with the aim of promoting the sale of goods or the provision of services (cf.
(cf. Art. 2 lit.a of Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising) (BGH, judgement of 20 May 2009 - I ZR 218/07). In the email of 18 May 2020, the defendant draws attention to its business activity, namely the mediation of legal advice by telephone via a website, which is already to be regarded as advertising in the aforementioned sense (BGH, loc. cit., para. 13). It is
not a request for legal advice from the plaintiff. This is because the email in dispute does not refer to a specific mandate to be taken on by the plaintiff, but contains a general enquiry as to whether the plaintiff would like to make use of the defendant's services, namely the referral of clients via the defendant's website. In this respect, it is irrelevant that the plaintiff
would not have had to pay for the defendant's referral services. For the defendant

of its own service (BGH, judgment 12.09.2013 - I ZR 208/12, para. 17f.).
17 The plaintiff did not give his consent. There was neither prior contact between the
contact or any other express consent between the parties. The defendant
took the email address from the plaintiff's website, even though the plaintiff had explicitly
explicitly objected to being contacted by advertising e-mail. The objection is
clearly distinguished from the rest of the text. Therefore, due to the fact that the plaintiff offered to be contacted by e-mail on the website, the defendant was entitled to take the plaintiff's consent,
the plaintiff's consent could not be assumed.
18 The concrete danger of repetition required for a claim for injunctive relief under § 1004 para. 1 sentence 2 BGB exists. An infringing act is already sufficient for this, as it gives rise to the factual presumption of further infringing acts in the future. The danger of repetition is only created by the issuance of an injunction.

cease-and-desist declaration. Despite the plaintiff's request, the defendant did not issue a cease-and-desist declaration.
2.
19 The plaintiff is not entitled to a claim for damages under Article 82(1) of the GDPR or any other legal ground.
20 The sending of the disputed email despite the plaintiff's express objection to advertising violates Article 6(1) sentence 1 of the GDPR. However, this infringement alone
is not sufficient to justify a claim for damages.
21 Pursuant to Article 82(1) of the GDPR, a claim for damages only exists if, because of the
material or immaterial damage has been caused by the infringement. For the
The principles developed in the context of § 253 of the German Civil Code (BGB) apply to non-material damage.
In particular, the plaintiff has the burden of proof and presentation in this respect.
22 Even if, according to the wording of Art. 82 GDPR, there does not have to be a serious violation of the right of personality, the violation of the GDPR itself is not sufficient to justify a claim for damages for pain and suffering (LG Hamburg, judgment of
04.09.2020 - 324 S 9/19). Rather, according to the wording of Art. 82 GDPR, the infringement must result in a legal violation that can be qualified as immaterial damage according to the examples listed in Recital 75 of the GDPR.
23 Compensation for pain and suffering is intended to provide compensation for pain and suffering suffered (Palandt/Grünberg, 79th edition, § 253, marginal no. 4). In this context, the criteria of Art. 83 (2) GDPR are to be applied when assessing the damages, i.e. in particular the type, severity and duration of the infringement,
seriousness and duration of the infringement (BeckOK DatenschutzR/Quaas, 34th ed. 1.11.2020, DSGVO Art. 82 marginal no. 31). Thus, there must be an objectively identifiable impairment of the injured party that goes beyond the mere annoyance or the individually perceived inconvenience of the infringement, which must then be compensated by the payment of damages for pain and suffering (AG Frankfurt a. M. Urt. v. 10.7.2020 - 385 C
155/19 (70); LG Hamburg, judgment of 04.09.2020 - 324 S 9/19; AG Hannover, judgment of
09.03.2020 - 531 C 10952/19; LG Frankfurt/M., judgment of 18.09.2020 - 2-27 O 100/20;
LG Cologne, judgment of 07.10.2020 - 28 O 71/20).
24 In the present case, the plaintiff claims to have suffered non-material damage as a result of the
damage by the fact that he was harassed by the one-time unlawful use of his data.
of his data. A specific impairment that goes beyond the perceived harassment itself, i.e. the

plaintiff.
25 The court sees no need for a preliminary ruling pursuant to Art. 267 TFEU, the initiation of which is at the discretion of the court.
26 The GDPR has a blocking effect for other tort claims (Sydow, loc. cit,
2nd ed., Art. 82 marginal no. 27).
27 The decision on costs is based on § 92 (1) ZPO.

28 The decision on provisional enforceability is based for the plaintiff on § 709 ZPO
and for the defendant on §§ 708 no. 11, 711 ZPO.

conduct in the future (OLG Hamm, judgment of 17.10.2013 - 6 U 95/13). These disadvantages are to be measured against the plaintiff's effort to receive and have to delete further emails from the defendant. Despite the special professional duties of care of a lawyer, the time required for this is to be classified as insignificant in the present case. The time between the receipt of the defendant's email and the plaintiff's sending of the
warning by the plaintiff was only 21 minutes. The amount in dispute does not have a special or general preventive function (cf. BGH decision of 30.11.2014
for reference: VI ZR 65/04).
