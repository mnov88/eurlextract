Fine proceedings against VfB Stuttgart 1893 AG end with the imposition of a fine.

LfDI Stefan Brink: “In addition to the noticeable fine, VfB is making significant organizational and technical improvements in data protection. In addition, happily, those responsible are planning to become involved in clarifying data protection issues in the future, with which young people in particular are to be addressed. "

The State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Stefan Brink, concludes the proceedings against VfB Stuttgart 1893 AG and imposes a fine of 300,000 euros for negligent breach of accountability under data protection law in accordance with Art. 5 (2) GDPR.

The responsible persons at VfB Stuttgart 1893 eV and VfB Stuttgart 1893 AG supported the educational and investigative measures of the state commissioner, promoted them on their own initiative and cooperated extensively with the authority of the state commissioner.

In addition to paying the fine and the costly restructuring and improvement of its data protection management, VfB Stuttgart 1893 AG, in coordination with the LfDI, is taking measures to make young people aware of data protection issues.

The VfB is promoting the “Data Protection Goes to School” project by supporting public relations work for regional school days of action and by making videos suitable for children and young people to raise awareness of data protection issues. In addition, the VfB designs training courses for the youth soccer teams U10 to U21 on the subject of “data protection among young people”.

LfDI Stefan Brink: “By issuing this notice of fines, we are concluding a procedure that was also unusual for us as a supervisory authority. It was not only the subject of our proceedings that was unusual, but above all the public and media interest associated with it. Unusual was also the extent of the interest in clarification evidenced by the involvement of Esecon and the willingness of the VfB to cooperate with our authority. "

This procedure results in a good chance, continues Stefan Brink, that VfB Stuttgart will be better positioned in the future when it comes to dealing fairly with members' data. “Even if we weren't able to fully investigate all publicly discussed processes with a view to the statute of limitations, the result that has now been mutually agreed is convincing: In addition to the noticeable fine, the VfB ensures considerable organizational and technical improvements in terms of data protection. In addition, happily, those responsible are planning to become involved in clarifying data protection issues in the future, with which young people in particular are to be addressed. "

The investigations against VfB Stuttgart 1893 eV and VfB Stuttgart 1893 AG are concluded with the issuance of the notice of fines.
