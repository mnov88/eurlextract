SANCTIONING PROCEDURE RESOLUTION

From the procedure initiated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based

on the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: Mr. A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complainant) filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency on July 23, 2023. The complaint is directed against PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS SA with NIF (Tax Identification Number) A70350384 (hereinafter, the respondent or PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS). The grounds for the claim are as follows:

The complainant states that on July 5, 2023, they received an email from the respondent entity, instructing them that they must provide a criminal record certificate for the job interview, establishing this documentation as necessary for the corresponding hiring.

They claim that, subsequently, on July 6, 2023, during the interview, they were provided with a form requesting information regarding their marital status and the number of children they have.

They attach the following relevant documentation:

- Email dated July 5, 2023, instructing them that they must provide a criminal record certificate because it is required for hiring.

- Procedural guide for obtaining a criminal record certificate.

SECOND: In accordance with Article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), this complaint was forwarded to the respondent so that they could analyze it and inform this Agency within one month of the actions taken to comply with the requirements set forth in the data protection regulations.

The notification, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter LPACAP) by electronic notification, was received by the controller on September 26, 2023, as recorded in the acknowledgment of receipt included in the file.

On October 26, 2023, this Agency received a response letter stating:

"It should be noted that the request for information in the context of the selection process in which the claimant participated and in the terms indicated in the claim itself is based on the legal obligations applicable to PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS, as established in aviation safety regulations and others, as explained below.

Please note that PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS's corporate purpose is the
"Storage, transportation, and distribution of all types of merchandise. Provision of logistics services. Provision of foreign trade, import, export, and customs clearance services." This means that, due to its logistics activity, it may have personnel who, on a permanent, rotating, or occasional basis, may carry out their work in air cargo areas to which aviation security regulations apply.

Therefore, it must be taken into account that, given the type of position being applied for, even if the position does not entail the employee's permanent presence in air cargo areas during their working hours, such presence is potential, depending on circumstances related to the management of the work activity. This potential requires verifying whether the candidate, if hired, could meet the requirements established in aviation security regulations when carrying out their work in air cargo areas.

Regarding the certificate of absence of a criminal record, following a query by the Inditex Group, the State Aviation Security Agency, through its Security Regulations Department (Security Division), Civil Aviation Security,

Directorate of Civil Aviation Security and User Protection), indicated the following: "(...). Persons selected to carry out inspections, access controls, or other security controls in any area that does not constitute a security-restricted area, or to assume responsibility for such controls, or with unaccompanied access to air cargo and mail, airline mail and materials, in-flight stores, and airport supplies that have been subject to the required security controls (section 11.1.2) will be subject to a normal background check (...)."

In this same sense, in relation to the certificate of absence of criminal record and the employment record document, the provisions of the Resolution of September 8, 2022, of the General Secretariat of Transport and Mobility, approving the update of the public part of the National Civil Aviation Security Program, must be taken into account. (https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?
id=BOE-A-2022-17581) (...).

Regarding marital status and the number of children, the following must be taken into account:

Resolution of January 3, 2011, of the Department of Tax Management of the State Tax Administration Agency, approving Form 145, for the communication of data from the recipient of earned income to their payer or the
change in previously communicated data
(https://www.boe.es/diario\_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2011-208), (taking into account the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/37

latest update of Form 145, which was made by Resolution of January 3, 2011). December 2015, https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2015-13690).

Form 145 includes, among others, the following fields:

- Family situation.
- Children and other descendants under 25 years of age, or over that age if they are disabled, who live with the recipient. (...)"

THIRD: On May 17, 2023, in accordance with Article 65 of the LOPDGDD (Legal and Legal Act of 2023), the claim submitted by the claimant was admitted for processing.

FOURTH: According to the report collected from the AXESOR tool, the entity
PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS SA is a medium-sized company established in 2012,

with a turnover of 31,041,021 euros in 2023.

FIFTH: On May 17, 2024, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against the respondent,
for two alleged violations of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR as a result,
respectively, of the request for a criminal record certificate during the job interview and the request for personal data for Form 145 of the Tax Agency (withholdings on employment income. Communication of data to the payer) before an employment contractual relationship existed. These violations are classified in Article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned GDPR.

SIXTH: After notification of the aforementioned initiation agreement in accordance with the rules established in Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), the respondent party requested an extension of the initial deadline for submitting allegations on May 29, 2024, which was granted. The respondent submitted a written statement of allegations on June 10, 2024, in which, in summary, it stated:

First. - Regarding the first of the alleged violations, the respondent states that an operation aimed at requesting a criminal record certificate from "selected individuals" highly likely means that a candidate, even if they pass the entire selection process, will not be able to join the company, because the aforementioned certificate is requested after they have already been selected, without having been previously informed that having no criminal record is a legal requirement (that is, not a requirement of the Company, but rather a regulatory requirement) for being hired.

Furthermore, it states that it is incomprehensible that an activity aimed at verifying the requirements established and required by regulations regarding individuals who will hold a specific position could be considered a discriminatory practice. The certificate is requested because the Company is required to check "any criminal record in all states of residence for at least the preceding five years."

Second. - Regarding the second of the alleged violations, the respondent states that it requested the information for Form 145 during the selection process, believing, in good faith, that this would improve the speed, efficiency, and effectiveness of the process, always under the unavoidable premise that this information would not be used for any other purpose, such as the qualification and evaluation of the candidate.

Third. - The respondent states that under no circumstances could it be a financial penalty, but rather, in any case, it would be a warning.

This is because: - Article 58 of the General Data Protection Regulation

establishes that "2. Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following corrective powers: (...) b) sanction any controller or processor with a warning where processing operations have infringed the provisions of this Regulation."

It states that there would be more than sufficient grounds to consider that the warning should be applied, taking due account of the following criteria established in Article 83.2 of the General Data Protection Regulation:

"a) the nature, severity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the

nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage they have suffered."

It states that:

A) The request for information in the context of the selection process in which the complainant participated and in the terms indicated in the complaint itself, is based on the legal obligations applicable to the Company established in the Regulations, specifically:

Due to the type of position for which the complainant was applying, even if the position does not entail the employee's permanent presence at airport facilities during their working hours, such presence is potential based on circumstances related to the management of the work activity. This potential requires a verification of whether the candidate, if hired, could meet the requirements established in the Air Safety Regulations when carrying out their work activity in air cargo areas.

This was stated by the State Aviation Safety Agency, through its
Safety Regulations Department (Civil Aviation Safety Division,

Civil Aviation Safety and User Protection Directorate) in its response to
the query submitted by the Inditex Group.

This is established by the Resolution of September 8, 2022, of the General Secretariat
of Transport and Mobility, approving the update of the public part

of the National Civil Aviation Safety Program. Perhaps even more relevant, this is provided for in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998 of November 5, 2015, establishing detailed measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation safety.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/37

It should be noted that the Company acts as a known Consignor (see DOCUMENT 1), a position for which the Standard establishes a series of obligations regarding the selection process for its employees, including background checks.

Specifically, this Implementing Regulation establishes: • Annex, Chapter 6.4.1.2., “The following procedure shall be followed for the accreditation of known consignors:

a) The applicant shall request the relevant accreditation from the competent authority of the Member State in whose territory the site is located. The applicant shall submit a security program to the competent authority. This program shall describe the methods and procedures to be followed by the consignor to comply with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 and its corresponding implementing acts. The program shall also describe how the consignor itself will monitor compliance with these methods and procedures. The applicant shall be provided with the Guide for Known Consignors set out in Appendix 6-B and the Validation Checklist for Known Consignors set out in Appendix 6-C.” • Annex, Chapter 6.4.2.1, “Every known consignor shall ensure that: (…)

b) all personnel carrying out security checks and all personnel with unsupervised access to recognizable air cargo or air mail who have undergone the required security checks have been selected in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 11.” • Annex, Chapter 11.1.4, “In accordance with applicable Union and national law, a standard background check shall: a) establish the identity of the person on the basis of appropriate supporting documents; b) refer to any criminal record in all States of residence for at least the preceding five years;”

“Personnel selection procedure. (…) The selection procedure shall include a pre-employment examination or a background check in accordance with point 11.1 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998.” • APPENDIX 6-C.
VALIDATION CHECKLIST FOR KNOWN SHIPPERS,
“Staff Selection and Training. (…). Objective: To ensure that all staff (permanent, temporary, agency-contracted, drivers) with access to recognizable air cargo or air mail have undergone a pre-employment screening and/or background check,” including questions “3.1. Please indicate whether there is a selection procedure for all staff with access to air cargo or air mail that includes a pre-employment screening in accordance with point 11.1.4 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998.” And "3.2. Please indicate whether this selection procedure includes a background check, including a criminal record check, in accordance with point 11.1.3 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998."

B) Furthermore, the Resolution of January 3, 2011, of the

Tax Management Department of the State Tax Administration Agency, approving Form 145, for the communication of data from the recipient of earned income to the payer or for changes in previously communicated data (https://www.boe.es/diario\_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2011-208), must be taken into account (taking into account the latest update of Form 145, which was made by Resolution of December 3, 2015, https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2015-13690).

This form requests, among other things, information related to: Family situation;
Children and other descendants under 25 years of age, or over that age if they are disabled, who live with the recipient; or Alimony for the spouse and child support, both set by court order. or "b) intentionality or negligence in the violation."

No intentionality or negligence can be attributed to someone whose sole intention is to comply with the Regulations as accurately, expeditiously, and efficiently as possible. In other words, intentionality in non-compliance or negligence in compliance cannot be attributed to someone who believed they were doing nothing other than complying with the Regulations.

Attributing to the Company any degree of intentionality or negligence regarding compliance with the Data Protection Regulations regarding the facts assessed in the Procedure contradicts the very reality of the facts:

The Company must verify that the candidate does not have a criminal record. Doing so after the selection process is complete does not, in any way, mean that requesting it during the process is intentional or negligent. Rather, doing so after the selection process is complete will pose a risk to the candidate, who may see their expectations of hiring frustrated by having passed the selection process when they are asked for a criminal record certificate, which, had it been requested during the process, would not have caused such frustration.

The Company not only needs to ensure that hiring processes are carried out as quickly as possible, but ultimately knows that this greater agility benefits the employee, whose start time is brought forward as much as possible. Hence, an attempt is being made to expedite the process of requesting information for the purposes of Form 145, given that if your request is delayed until the moment of contract formalization, it will entail a risk of delaying effective incorporation, all of which will ultimately be detrimental to the employee.

In short, it must be reiterated that attributing to the Company any degree of intentionality or negligence regarding compliance with the Data Protection Regulations with respect to the facts assessed in the Procedure would be contrary to the very reality of the facts.

And in this regard, it brings to mind the judgment of December 5, 2023, of the

Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in the Deutsche Wohnen case
(Case C807/21), which states the following:

“68. Thus, it follows from the wording of Article 83(2) of the GDPR that
only infringements of the provisions of the Regulation committed through

culpable fault by the controller, namely those committed intentionally or negligently, may give rise to an administrative fine under that article. 69. The general structure and purpose of the
GDPR corroborate this interpretation. (…) 74. However, the EU legislator

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/37

did not consider In order to ensure this high level of protection, it is necessary to provide for the imposition of administrative fines where there is no culpability. (…) 75. Consequently, it should be declared that Article 83 of the GDPR does not allow an administrative fine to be imposed for an infringement referred to in paragraphs 4 to 6 without proving that the infringement was committed intentionally or negligently by the controller and that, therefore, culpability in committing the infringement is a requirement for the imposition of the fine. 76. In this regard, it should also be clarified, with regard to the question of whether an infringement was committed intentionally or negligently and, therefore, may be sanctioned with an administrative fine under Article 83 of the GDPR, that a controller may be sanctioned for conduct falling within the scope of the GDPR when it could not have been unaware of the infringing nature of its conduct. conduct, whether or not it was aware of violating the provisions of the GDPR."

Taking into account what the CJEU establishes and comparing it to the facts at issue in the case, can it be stated that the Company "could not ignore the infringing nature of its conduct" and, consequently, establish that it committed an infringement intentionally or negligently? Under no circumstances, because the Company acted, at all times, under the good faith belief that it was collecting data to comply with a regulation, whether the regulation that applies to the request for a criminal record certificate or the regulation that applies to the completion of Form 145. or "c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damages and losses suffered by the data subjects."

Obtaining the criminal record certificate data and the information required for Form 145 was in no way detrimental to the interested party, but quite the opposite. This was because providing this information early allowed, on the one hand, verification that the candidate met the legal requirements for the position and, therefore, avoided the inconvenience of progressing through a selection process in which they would be unable to succeed if they did not meet them.

And, on the other hand, it generated efficiencies and streamlined the onboarding process for the selected employee, which not only benefits the Company but also the candidate who moved up their start date.

In this regard, the "SELECTION PROCESS FOR LOGISTICS CENTERS IN SPAIN" has been reviewed and modified. The latest version is attached as DOCUMENT 2. The Selection Form that candidates must complete, which is referenced in said Process, is also attached as DOCUMENT 3.

The document itself, including the Process and the aforementioned Form, was duly distributed on January 4 of this year, via the message attached as DOCUMENT 4. As can be seen in the body of the message, the review of the Process and the generation of the new version were motivated by the identification of areas for improvement in the Process itself from a data protection perspective.

In other words, the review was not motivated by non-compliance with the Data Protection Regulations, but rather by the identification of options for better compliance with said Regulations. Regarding the Process, it is worth noting that:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/37

When participating in the Group Dynamics, the candidate will only need to submit their CV and carry their ID for identification upon entry. A clean criminal record certificate and employment history are provided once the employment contract has been signed.

In the case of a clean criminal record certificate, the candidate will not need to send it, but rather indicate it so that they can be put in contact with an external verifier, who will contact them via video call to show them the certificate. This verifier will then inform the Company whether the candidate is suitable or unsuitable in accordance with the suitability procedure for aviation safety.

The notification to the candidate regarding the involvement of the external verifier (Serviguide) includes a data protection clause.

“e) any prior violation committed by the controller or data processor.”

The Company has not been previously sanctioned, at any time and for any reason, by the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

“f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the violation and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the violation.”

The Company has acted diligently, expeditiously, and completely transparently in relation to all actions related to the Case in which this Statement of Allegations is filed.

In no way has the Company attempted to evade, distort, or delay the actions. On the contrary, it has responded and provided all information and documentation, as a manifestation of its constant willingness to cooperate.

“g) the categories of personal data affected by the violation.”

The type of data requested by the Company merely responded to the need arising from compliance with a regulation. Therefore, this type of data cannot be applied to the detriment of the Company, because it responds to an obligation, not a unilateral decision of the Company.

“k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the violation.”

There is no financial benefit to the Company due to the dynamics that were established at the time of the events that are the subject of the File. The benefit was for the candidate, who benefits from more agile and efficient onboarding processes and, above all, avoids failed onboarding processes resulting from the fact that it becomes clear that the selected candidate who initiates the onboarding process does not meet the requirements of the applicable regulations.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/37

Furthermore, it should be noted, again with regard to the events at issue in the File, that the need for greater efficiency in the development responded to the specific circumstances at the time when these events occurred:

The interview call was issued with barely one day's notice, which already indicates that it responds to imperative and pressing needs. Furthermore, the selection process takes place during the summer, a period in which the need for personnel recruitment at the Logistics Platform increases significantly due to the dynamics of that period, when a large part of the already hired staff is or will be on vacation. This, combined with the high staff turnover inherent in the dynamics of the logistics sector, is also significant.

Fourth. - It considers that this Agency's application of the aggravating circumstance of Article 83.2.k of the GDPR in conjunction with Article 76.2.b of the LOPDGDD is not applicable given that its corporate purpose and business activity have no connection, whether evident or not, with the processing of personal data of clients or third parties, as this corporate purpose and main activity are linked to merchandise management.

The processing of personal data that the Company may carry out as part of its activity is, if not solely, then primarily, that relating to the personal data of its employees, of candidates for a position at the Entity, and the contact information and, where applicable, that relating to the function or position held by natural persons who provide services to a legal entity with which it has a relationship as a client, supplier, or collaborator.

Furthermore, it states that the existing and creditable mitigating factors that could have been applied are the following:

Regarding the factors included in Article 83.2 of the GDPR, which states that

"When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, the following shall be duly taken into account:"

1. "b) the intentionality or negligence in the violation;" There cannot be any intentionality or negligence in processing data resulting from regulatory compliance, both in relation to the criminal record certificate and in relation to the

information required for Form 145.

2. "c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damages suffered by the data subjects;" As indicated
previously in this Statement of Allegations, the processes have been improved in relation

to both aspects referred to in the Sanctioning Procedure. It should be noted that the change is not motivated by a possible breach, but rather as an improvement to the process in light of the File in which this Document is filed. However, it should be noted that this improvement, even with this origin, may be detrimental or disruptive to the candidate applying for a position, but it is an unavoidable issue for the Company if it wants to adapt to the room for improvement in its processes that the Spanish Data Protection Agency seems to propose. Specifically: The criminal record certificate is not requested until the candidate is selected during the onboarding process and the employment contract is signed. The information for completing Form 145 is not required during the selection process, but rather voluntarily once the employment contract has been signed. 3. "e) any prior violation committed by the data controller or data processor;" The Company has not been previously sanctioned, at any time or for any reason, by the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

4. "f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the violation and mitigate its potential adverse effects;" The Company has acted diligently, expeditiously, and completely transparently in relation to all actions related to the File in which this Statement of Allegations is filed. The Company has in no way attempted to evade, distort, or delay the actions. On the contrary, it has responded and provided all the information and documentation, as a manifestation of its constant willingness to cooperate.

Regarding the factors included in Article 76.2 of the LOPD (Spanish Data Protection Act), which states that
"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account:"

1. "b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data." As indicated, the Company's main activity is related to the management of goods, so it has no clients who are individuals, it does not manage goods for individuals, it does not carry out commercial activity aimed at individuals, and it has no suppliers who are individuals other than sole proprietors or independent professionals. That is, the processing of personal data that the Company may carry out in connection with its activity is, if not solely, then primarily, that relating to the personal data of its employees, candidates for a position at the Entity, and the contact information and, where applicable, information relating to the function or position held by individuals who provide services to a legal entity with which it has a relationship as a client, supplier, or collaborator.

2. "c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the violation." There is no financial benefit for the Company due to the dynamics that were in place at the time of the events that are the subject of the File. The benefit was solely for the candidate, who benefits from more agile and efficient onboarding processes, and, above all, from avoiding failed onboarding processes resulting from the fact that it becomes clear that the selected candidate, who initiates the onboarding process, does not meet the requirements set forth by the applicable regulations. Furthermore, it should be noted, again with respect to the events that are the subject of the File, that the need for greater efficiency in the process responded to the specific circumstances at the time when these events occurred: The interview call was issued with barely one day's notice, which already demonstrates that it responds to imperative and pressing needs. Furthermore, the

selection process takes place during the summer, a period in which the need for staffing at the Logistics Platform increases significantly due to the dynamics of that period, when a large part of the already hired workforce is or will be on vacation. This is coupled with the high staff turnover inherent in the dynamics of the logistics sector.

Finally, it should be noted that, currently, the following requirements are required within the selection process:

As shown in the example of the email sent to candidates, summoning them to the interview, this is provided as DOCUMENT 5: "Curriculum Vitae," in order to understand the candidate's overall education, skills, competencies, merits, awards, and work experience, although limited to training, professional experience, and information strictly relevant to the position(s) for which they are eligible. "DNI (National Identity Document) or original document proving your identity," for identification and security reasons when accessing the LOGISTICS PLATFORM facilities.

For all the above reasons, through these allegations, I hereby REQUEST that this document be deemed filed and the previous allegations formulated in the referenced file, and that, following the appropriate procedures, a resolution be issued in due course deeming that no violation has been committed against the Company, Inc. In relation to the facts described and the regulations indicated,

the proceedings are being archived."

SEVENTH: After notification of the proposed resolution on February 12, 2025, the respondent requested an extension of the deadline granted to it and submitted a written statement of allegations on March 6, 2025, in which, in summary, it argues that it reiterates

the allegations previously submitted.

First. - Regarding the review and update actions carried out by
PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS as a result of the Procedure.

Plataforma Cabanillas expresses its complete disagreement with the Investigating Judge's interpretation of the Company's update actions and the consequences drawn from them. It notes that it is incomprehensible that a breach is attributed to the fact of updating procedures and processes when said review was not motivated by breaches of the Data Protection Regulations, but rather by the identification of options for better compliance with

said Regulations solely and exclusively.

They understand that it cannot be accepted without counterargument that the Instructor attributes the
change in procedures and processes to an acknowledgment of non-compliance,
when the Company has expressly stated in its prior allegations that it

was an update.

PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS states that, at no time, to any extent, and
neither explicitly nor implicitly, has it acknowledged any non-compliance for the facts
attributed to it in the referenced Procedure. Rather, it has demonstrated, in

a clear, tangible, and irrefutable manner, that its actions were correct at all times,
always seeking to seek balance and the ability to prove that it is
complying with all applicable regulations.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/37

Second.- Regarding the adoption of measures announced by this Agency.

PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS states that it does not understand the reason for the warning of the possible requirement for corrective measures that establish an operation that is exactly the same as the one already being followed, following the aforementioned update of procedures and processes.

Third. - Regarding the interpretation of data protection regulations in relation to compliance with aviation security regulations.

PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS points out that the Instructor has ignored and does not take into account the following in his argument:

“• APPENDIX 6-B. GUIDE FOR KNOWN SHIPPERS “Personnel selection procedure. (…)

The selection procedure will include a pre-employment examination or background check in accordance with point 11.1 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998.”

• APPENDIX 6-C. VALIDATION CHECKLIST FOR KNOWN SHIPPERS, “Staff Selection and Training. (…). Objective: To ensure that all staff (permanent, temporary, agency, drivers) with access to recognizable air cargo or air mail have undergone a pre-employment screening and/or background check,” including questions “3.1.

Please indicate whether there is a selection procedure for all staff with access to air cargo or air mail that includes a pre-employment screening in accordance with point 11.1.4 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998.” AND

“3.2. Please indicate whether this selection procedure includes a background check, including a criminal record check, in accordance with point 11.1.3 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998.”

Why does the Proposed Resolution fail to take into account that the aforementioned regulation
refers to "pre-contracting" and not to contracting?

Why does it fail to take into account that it refers to a "selection process" and not to contracting? Why does it fail to take into account that entities like the Company are audited based on the provisions of this Appendix 6-C, and if they fail to comply, for example, because they fail to conduct a background check during the contracting or selection process, can they be sanctioned with effects that could lead to the

paralysis of their activity or a large part of their activity?

A simple reading and interpretation of the annexes applicable to the Company reveals the need to request a criminal record certificate during the selection process, as was being carried out by this party."

Plataforma Cabanillas states that, with regard to Article 11.1 (under the heading "Selection") of the said Implementing Regulation, which this Agency relies on,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/37

to reject the claim, the wording of the article reflected in the resolution is not current.

It indicates that the consolidated text of Article 11.1.2 is as follows:

"11.1.2. The personnel specified below must have passed a
reinforced or standard background check: a) individuals selected to carry out inspections, access controls, or any other security control, or to assume responsibility for them, in any area that is not a security-restricted area;"

"Certainly, the regulation refers to "selected individuals," but since said individuals "must have passed a background check," that is, prior to their "selection," this is reflected in the title of the article, "Selection," and by the logic of the wording itself, the opposite being a clear contradiction."

"In this case, the Company's actions in requesting data during the selection process (i) were consistent with the logical interpretation of the Air Security Implementation Regulations, taking into account the wording of both its articles and its annexes, and (ii) are consistent with data protection regulations.

The consideration reflected in the Draft Resolution that the provision of a criminal record certificate is not required during the selection process fails to take into account clear, express, and precise regulations, opting to select only those regulations and, within them, those sections that were useful for its approximation, leaving the Company in a doubly unfair and unjustified situation:

- On the one hand, because it may receive an unfair and undue sanction regarding personal data protection.

- On the other hand, because it may generate a conflict regarding compliance with aviation safety regulations, which are central to its activity and, therefore, with potential consequences that go far beyond the economic ones.

The Draft Resolution, therefore, has not analyzed and interpreted this aviation safety regulation through the lens of data protection regulations, limiting itself to understanding that "selected individuals" is outside the scope of the selection process.

PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS understands that personal data may be collected throughout the selection process, as aviation security regulations allow it to do so.

Consequently, it states that the provisions of the aviation security regulations set forth above should be taken into account, which clearly allow it to request a criminal record certificate, as it has been doing, and that, therefore, there is no reason for any sanction in relation to the resulting processing of personal data, and that it has the legitimate basis of processing required by European regulations.

Fourth. - Regarding the absence of negligence or intentionality.

The Cabanillas Platform's corporate purpose is "Storage, transportation, and distribution of all types of merchandise. Provision of logistics services. Provision of foreign trade, import, export, and customs clearance services."

"Therefore, the Company's main activity is not the processing of personal data, although it must obviously process the data of its staff members.
To say that it is "a company that processes personal data systematically and continuously" when the main processing of personal data is the same as that carried out by any company, regardless of sector or size, with respect to its staff, places the Company in a situation of complete defenselessness, since this is a maximum requirement: any company, by virtue of having employees, already has the highest level of demand and diligence in compliance with data protection regulations.

However, the Company has never sought, either by action or omission, to go beyond what is required by the regulations, insofar as:

- Regarding criminal records: If a criminal record certificate was requested, it is because there is a regulation that requires it.

- Regarding personal data for the purposes of Form 145: If the information was requested for Form 145, it is for reasons of agility, effectiveness, and efficiency.

Failing to recognize or refusing to acknowledge that the dynamics of data collection for this purpose may be conditioned by factors specific to a sector and type of activity is an action that does not defend the rights of data subjects, but rather only seeks to achieve a sanctioning result without assessing the circumstances of the specific case.

It is well known that the logistics sector is characterized, among other things, by high staff turnover, a high demand for new personnel in certain situations and times, and, even more so given the Company's position in the logistics chain, by a production pressure that, by no means precludes compliance with data protection regulations, but that does adapt compliance to its own dynamics, without this leading to automatic and unjustified attributions of non-compliance.

Therefore, it can only be stated that never and in There has been no negligence on the part of the Company in complying with the regulations.

To assert otherwise is objectively incorrect."

Fifth. - Regarding the determination of the amount of the fine.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 15/37

Therefore, it is considered that, in the hypothetical event that an undue and unfair administrative fine is ultimately imposed, its amount should be significantly reduced if it is to meet a fair, explicit, objective, and verifiable criterion.

Sixth. - Regarding the application of the warning.

"In the hypothetical case that it is concluded that there were sanctionable acts, while reiterating that there is no reason for them, it should be noted that the warning requested, in addition to meeting the requirements for this purpose as reflected in the Objections to the Start-Up Agreement, is not only a proper measure, but also a coherent and common-sense measure, considering that the Company:

- Was never negligent when all it did was comply with the regulations that required it to conduct criminal record checks during the selection process, such as air safety regulations.

- Always ensured that the onboarding processes for new employees were as agile as possible, in a sector with high turnover and a need to fill job vacancies in record time.

- At all times, it has been clear and transparent with the Supervisory Authority, which is undoubtedly its obligation, but it certainly cannot be accepted that the Company's positive, supportive, open, and collaborative attitude be used to attribute to it
nonexistent negligence, acknowledgments of liability, or malicious acts.

- It has proactively updated its processes, without even waiting for the outcome of the sanctioning procedure, which not only makes any corrective measures unnecessary, but also demonstrates a firm will to find a balance in compliance with other regulations, which should be taken into account by the sanctioning body.

It requests that a resolution be issued deeming the absence of any violation attributable to Plataforma Cabanillas in relation to the events described and the regulations indicated, proceeding to the closing of the proceedings."

From the actions taken in this procedure and from the documentation in the file, the following have been established:

PROVEN FACTS

FIRST. – On July 5, 2023, Plataforma Cabanillas sent an email to the complainant, stating the following:

“From: Human Resources Plataforma Cabanillas P&B.

To: Human Resources Plataforma Cabanillas P&B
Date: July 5, 2023 at 6:17 PM
Subject: Group interview 06/07 – 5:00 PM

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 16/37

(…).

You must bring the following documentation with you:

- (…)
- (…)
- (…)
- (…)
- (…)

Regards,”

This fact is confirmed by the screenshot of the email address provided in the complaint by the complainant.

SECOND. – The file shows that, during the selection process, the respondent collected personal data from the participants, such as marital status and number of children, for the purpose of completing Form 145.

This fact has been confirmed by the respondent in its response to the requests made by this authority during the course of the investigation:

“Obtaining the data from the criminal record certificate and those necessary for Form 145 was in no way detrimental to the interested party, but rather the opposite. This is because the early provision of the information made it possible, on the one hand, to verify that the candidate met the legal requirements for the position and, therefore, to avoid the inconvenience of progressing through a selection process in which they could not be successful if they did not meet them.”

THIRD: It is established that Appendix 6-B of the Implementing Regulation

(EU) Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1998 of 5 November 2015 laying down detailed measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security, relating to the personnel selection procedure, provides:

The selection procedure shall include a pre-employment examination or background check in accordance with point 11.1 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998. The on-site validation visit shall consist of an interview with the supervisor or the person responsible for personnel selection. This supervisor shall provide documentary evidence (e.g., blank forms) attesting to the company's procedures. This selection procedure will apply to personnel hired from April 29, 2010.

It is also confirmed that the aforementioned point 11.1 of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998 provides the following (emphasis added):

"Persons selected to carry out inspections, access controls, or any other security controls, or to assume responsibility for them, in a security-restricted area must have previously passed a background check.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 17/37

Persons selected to carry out inspections, access controls, or any other security controls, or to assume responsibility for them, in any area that does not constitute a security-restricted area must have previously passed a background check or a pre-employment examination. Except Unless otherwise specified in this Regulation, the competent authority shall determine whether it is necessary to first pass a background check or pre-employment examination in accordance with applicable national regulations."

FOURTH. - Plataforma Cabanillas, in its submissions to this Agency dated June 10, 2024, states that it has reviewed and modified the "Selection Process in Logistics Centers in Spain" and the Selection Form, and they are currently as follows:

"Regarding the Process, it should be noted that:
- When participating in the Group Dynamics, the candidate will only need to provide their CV and carry their ID for identification upon entry.
- A clean criminal record certificate and employment history must be provided once the employment contract has been signed.
- In the case of a clean criminal record certificate, the candidate will not need to send it. Instead, they must indicate it so that they can be put in contact with an external verifier. The verifier will then contact them via video call to show them the certificate. This verifier will then inform the Company whether the candidate is suitable or unsuitable in accordance with the suitability procedure related to aviation safety. The communication to the candidate regarding the intervention of the external verifier (Serviguide) includes a data protection clause.

LEGAL BASIS

I

Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR) as established in Articles 47, 48.1, and 64.3 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. 2016/679, in this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II
Preliminary Questions

Article 4 of the GDPR, under the heading "Definitions", provides as follows:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 18/37

"1) "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("the data subject"); an identifiable natural person shall be any person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person;

2) "processing": any operation or set of operations performed on

personal data or sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;

7) "controller" or "controller": the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing; if Union or Member State law determines the purposes and means of processing, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be laid down by Union or Member State law;

Plataforma Cabanillas is a logistics platform. In carrying out its activities, it processes personal data: criminal records, employment history, etc. in its capacity as data controller, given that it is the party that determines the purposes and means of such activity, pursuant to the aforementioned Article 4.7 of the GDPR.

III
Response to the allegations regarding the Start Agreement

In response to the allegations presented by the respondent entity, the following should be noted:

First. - Regarding the fact that the respondent's request for a criminal record certificate from the selected candidate could cause a frustrating and uncomfortable situation for the candidate, due to the cancellation of an expectation of hiring, it adds that discriminatory purposes cannot be attributed to the candidate for requesting said certificate.

Regarding this assertion that the candidate could not have been notified until the moment of hiring, it should be noted that it is sufficient for the interview notice or the email itself to indicate the requirement for said requirement in order to be selected. Thus, the aforementioned expectation of hiring cannot be created if such a document is not available. Therefore, it is not necessary to provide such documents during the selection process, and in no case will such a requirement create a frustrating or uncomfortable situation for the participant, given that they would be aware of the requirements and documentation necessary if selected. In fact, the change in the procedure implemented by the respondent would demonstrate its disagreement with the regulations it alleges.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 19/37

Furthermore, it adds that the respondent cannot be attributed discriminatory purposes, given that this is included in the regulations.

Well, the legal provision cited by the respondent does not provide for the possibility for the employer to request this information during an interview, but rather at a later time when the candidates have already been selected.

Second. – Regarding the request for personal data from job candidates for the purposes of Form 145.

The respondent points out that the information for Form 145 was requested during the selection process, in good faith, on the understanding that this would improve the agility, efficiency, and effectiveness of the process, always under the unavoidable premise that this information would not be used for any other purpose, such as the qualification and evaluation of the candidate.

Generally, the employee must complete Form 145 at the beginning of the employment relationship with their employer or before the first day of each calendar year. In other words, this communication of data must be made once the person is hired, which is not the case here, where it was requested during the selection process.

On the other hand, it is difficult to understand the aforementioned efficiency claimed by the respondent, since this requirement required collecting data from all interview participants, whereas if it were only collected at the beginning of the employment relationship, it would only be required from the selected candidate or candidates.

Third. – The respondent points out that in no case could it be a financial penalty, but rather, in any case, it would have to be a warning.

It indicates that the following criteria established in Article 83.2 of the General Data Protection Regulation should be taken into account:

“a) the nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the
nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered.”

The respondent again mentions that the request for information in the context of the selection process in which the complainant participated is based on the legal obligations applicable to the respondent.

b) Furthermore, the respondent points out that no intentional non-compliance or negligence in compliance can be attributed to someone who believed that they were doing nothing other than complying with the regulations.

The negligence found in the commission of the violation, taking into account that the requirements demanded by the respondent entity from the candidates go beyond what is required by the regulatory regulations.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 20/37

This circumstance, in addition to those mentioned in the previous section, demonstrates the negligent conduct of Plataforma Cabanillas. In this regard, we take into account the ruling of the National Court of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006), which, based on the fact that these are entities whose activity involves continuous data processing, indicates that "...the Supreme Court has understood that negligence exists whenever a legal duty of care is disregarded, that is, when the offender fails to behave with the required diligence. And in assessing the degree of diligence, the professionalism of the subject must be especially considered, and there is no doubt that, in the case now under consideration, when the appellant's activity involves constant and extensive handling of personal data, rigor and exquisite care must be emphasized to comply with the legal provisions in this regard."

In the present case, gross negligence is evident in the fact that, as evidenced by the allegations presented, the respondent was aware of the applicable regulations regarding the requested documentation, which did not explicitly state that a criminal record certificate was the only option, nor that such a certificate was required at the procedural stage in which it was being requested, during the interview and prior to their selection, and yet, despite this, proceeded to demand the documentation from the candidates.

This is a company that processes personal data systematically and continuously and must take extreme care in complying with its data protection obligations.

Section c) of Article 83.2 of the GDPR also states: "any measure taken by the data controller or processor to mitigate the damages and losses suffered by the data subjects."

In this regard, it indicates that the selection process has been modified and that currently, a criminal record certificate and a work history are required once the employment contract has been signed. However, it should be noted that the failure to require a criminal record certificate and a work history certificate from candidates who were not selected is in compliance with its legal obligations. The adoption of this modification to the procedure demonstrates, in itself, that there was a less invasive option for the fundamental right to data protection of the affected parties and that the prior action represented a breach of the principle of minimization in the processing of personal data provided for in the GDPR.

It also indicates section e) of Article 83.2 of the GDPR, noting that the respondent has not been previously sanctioned, at any time and for any reason, by this Agency. It should be noted that the absence of prior violations does not minimize the fact that, in the case analyzed in this proceeding, such a violation did occur and that it has a significant impact because it stems from the selection procedure applied by the respondent.

On the other hand, regarding the consideration of the provision of Article 83.2.e) of the GDPR as a mitigating factor, the National Court's ruling of May 5, 2021, rec. 1437/2020, states that "It also considers that the non-commission of a prior infraction should be considered as a mitigating circumstance. Well, Article 83.2 of the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 21/37

GDPR establishes that, for the imposition of the administrative fine, circumstance "e) any prior infraction committed by the data controller or processor must be taken into account, among others." This is an aggravating circumstance.

The fact that the grounds for its application are not met means that it cannot be taken into consideration, but it does not imply or allow, as the plaintiff claims, its application as a mitigating circumstance."

It states that the defendant has responded and provided all the information and documentation to this Agency.

The respondent, in its statements in defense of liability, considers that the aforementioned circumstance exists. However, this cannot be considered voluntary cooperation that actively seeks to mitigate the impact of the breach, but rather falls within its legal obligation to respond to the supervisory authority's requests.

According to the GDPR, data controllers are obliged to comply with requests for information and provide the documentation requested by the supervisory authorities. This obligation is an inherent part of their responsibility and does not, in itself, constitute cooperation to remedy or mitigate the effects of a breach.

It also refers to section "g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach."

Well, personal data related to criminal convictions and offenses are collected and processed, a category that particularly merits safeguards.

The respondent also refers to Article 83.2.k) of the GDPR, which refers to "any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement."

The respondent points out that no financial benefit was obtained, and that the benefit was for the candidate, who benefits from more agile and efficient recruitment processes.

In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the aforementioned provision indicates that the "benefits" obtained may be taken into account in the grading of the sanction, but not the "absence" of such benefits, which is what the respondent alleges.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 83.1 of the GDPR, the imposition of fines is governed by the following principles: they must be individualized for each particular case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive. The admission that the absence of profit operates as a mitigating factor is contrary to the spirit of Article 83.1 of the GDPR and the principles that govern the determination of the fine. If, following the commission of a GDPR violation, the absence of profit is considered a mitigating factor, the deterrent purpose served by the penalty is partially nullified. Accepting the respondent's argument in a case such as the one at hand would mean introducing an artificial reduction in the penalty that truly should be imposed, which could lead to the conclusion that violating the rule without obtaining profit, financial or otherwise, will not have a negative effect proportional to the seriousness of the infringement. The Administrative Litigation Division of the National Court has noted that the fact that, in a specific case, not all the elements that constitute a circumstance modifying liability, which by its nature is aggravating, are present, cannot lead to the conclusion that such a circumstance is applicable as a mitigating circumstance. The ruling made by the National Court in its Supreme Court of May 5, 2021 (Recital 1437/2020)—even though that ruling deals with the circumstance in section e) of Article 83.2 of the GDPR, the commission of prior violations—can be extrapolated to the question raised: the respondent's claim that the "absence" of benefits be accepted as a mitigating circumstance, given that both the GDPR and the LOPDGDD refer only to "the benefits obtained."

IV
Response to the allegations regarding the Proposed Resolution

First.- Regarding the review and update actions carried out by PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS as a result of the Procedure.

Regarding this statement, at no time, to any extent, and neither explicitly nor implicitly has it acknowledged any non-compliance due to the facts attributed to it in the referenced Procedure.

In this regard, it should be noted, as stated in the fourth proven fact, that
Plataforma Cabanillas has reviewed and modified the "Selection Process for Logistics Centers in Spain" and that currently, "Regarding the Process, it should be noted that:
- When participating in the Group Dynamics, the candidate only needs to provide their CV
and carry their ID for identification upon entry.
- A clean criminal record certificate and employment history must be provided once the employment contract has been signed.
- In the case of a clean criminal record certificate, the candidate will not need to send it, but rather indicate it so that they can be put in contact with an
external verifier, who will contact them via video call to show them the certificate. This verifier will then inform the Company whether the

candidate is suitable or unsuitable in accordance with the suitability procedure related to aviation safety. The communication to the candidate regarding the intervention of the
external verifier (Serviguide) includes a data protection clause."

The adoption of this modification in terms of the procedure demonstrates, in itself, that there was a less invasive option for the fundamental right to data protection of those affected and that the prior action represented a breach of the principle of minimization in the processing of personal data set forth in the GDPR.

Following its own reasoning, by adopting these measures, it would now be violating the regulations that, it claims, allowed it to request a criminal record certificate from job candidates. However, it appears that it is possible to change the procedures without violating these regulations while also complying with the principle of data minimization. A principle that had indeed been violated, as has been proven throughout the sanctioning procedure.

Second. Regarding the adoption of measures announced by this Agency.

Plataforma Cabanillas states that it does not understand the reason for the warning of the
possible requirement for corrective measures that establish an operational approach that is
exactly the same as the one already being followed, following the aforementioned update of procedures and processes.

Regarding this statement, it should be noted that Plataforma Cabanillas, in its
submissions to this Agency dated June 10, 2024, states that it has reviewed and
modified the "Selection Process in Logistics Centers in Spain" and the Selection Form, and that it is currently as follows:

"Regarding the Process, it should be noted that:
- When participating in the Group Dynamics, the candidate will only need to provide their CV
and carry their ID for identification upon entry.
- A clean criminal record certificate and employment history must be provided once the employment contract has been signed.

- In the case of a clean criminal record certificate, the candidate will not need to send it, but rather provide it so that they can be put in contact with an external verifier. The verifier will then contact them via video call to show them the certificate. This verifier will then inform the Company whether the candidate is suitable or unsuitable in accordance with the suitability procedure related to aviation safety. The communication to the candidate regarding the intervention of the external verifier (Serviguide) includes a Data Protection clause.

Therefore, by modifying the selection process by establishing that the criminal record certificate will not be requested until they have been hired by the respondent party and by not requiring them to complete questionnaires with the personal data required for Form 145 of the State Tax Administration Agency until they have been hired by the respondent party, it would not be appropriate to impose the corrective measure described in Article 58.2.d) of the GDPR.

Third. - Regarding the interpretation of data protection regulations in relation to compliance with aviation safety regulations.

Plataforma Cabanillas understands that personal data may be collected throughout the selection process, because aviation safety regulations authorize it to do so.

Consequently, it states that the provisions of the aviation safety regulations set forth above should be taken into account, which clearly authorize the request for a criminal record certificate. was doing so and, therefore, there is no reason for any sanction in relation to the resulting processing of personal data, and that it has the legitimate basis of being a processing required by European regulations.

As has been indicated, it is sufficient for the interview call or the email itself to indicate this requirement

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 24/37

to be selected. Thus, the aforementioned expectation of hiring cannot be created if such a document is not available. Therefore, it is not necessary to provide such documents during the selection process, and in no case will such a requirement create a frustrating or uncomfortable situation for the participant, given that they would know the requirements and necessary documentation if selected.

Well, the legal provision cited by the respondent does not It provides for the possibility that the employer may request this background information during an interview. At this stage, candidates are considered selected, and at a later stage, when the candidates submit the documentation and it is verified, it will be determined that they meet all the requirements and have been selected.

Fourth. Regarding the absence of negligence or intentionality.

Plataforma Cabanillas maintains that the Company's main activity is not the processing of personal data, although it must obviously process the data of its staff members. It points out that saying that it is "a company that systematically and continuously processes personal data" when the main processing of personal data is the same as that performed by any company, regardless of sector or size, with respect to its staff, places the Company in a situation of complete defenselessness, since this is a maximum requirement.

Therefore, it states that it can only be stated that there has never been negligence on the part of the Company in compliance with the regulations.

In the case at hand, the negligence observed is evident in the commission of the violation, taking into account that the requirements demanded by the entity in question from the candidates go beyond those required by the regulatory regulations. And all of this, in addition to the fact that ignorance of the law does not exempt one from compliance. In the same way that it indicates that it is aware of the aviation regulations and complies with them, it must be aware of and comply with the personal data protection regulations when, as data controller, it processes personal data.

This circumstance, in addition to those indicated in the previous section, demonstrates the negligent conduct of Plataforma Cabanillas. In this regard, we take into account the ruling of the National Court of 17/10/2007 (rec. 63/2006), which, based on the fact that these are entities whose activity involves continuous data processing, indicates that "...the Supreme Court has considered that negligence exists whenever neglects a legal duty of care, that is, when the offender fails to behave with the required diligence. And in assessing

the degree of diligence, the professionalism or lack thereof of the subject must be especially considered, and there is no doubt that, in the case now under examination, when the appellant's activity involves constant and extensive handling of personal data, rigor and exquisite care must be emphasized in complying with the legal provisions in this regard."

In the present case, gross negligence is evident in the fact that, as evidenced by the allegations presented, the defendant was aware of the applicable regulations regarding the requested documentation, which did not explicitly state that a criminal record certificate was required as the only option, nor that such a certificate was required at the procedural stage in which it was being requested, and despite this, the defendant proceeded to demand the documentation. the

applicants.

This is a company that processes personal data systematically and continuously and must exercise extreme care in complying with its data protection obligations.

Fifth. Regarding the determination of the amount of the fine.

Therefore, the respondent considers that, in the hypothetical event that an undue and unfair administrative fine is ultimately imposed, the amount should be significantly reduced if it is to meet a fair, explicit, objective, and verifiable criterion.

Regarding the above statement, the GDPR does not provide for a minimum fine. Rather, the GDPR only provides for maximum amounts in Article 83, paragraphs 4 to 6, of the GDPR, which groups together several different types of conduct. Ultimately, a fine can only be calculated by weighing all the factors expressly identified in

Article 83, paragraph 2(a) to (j) of the GDPR, relevant to the case, and any other relevant elements, even if not explicitly listed in those provisions (as required by Article 83(2)(k) of the GDPR, due account must be taken of any other applicable factors). Finally, the final amount of the fine resulting from this assessment must be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive in each specific case (Article 83(1) of the GDPR). Any fine imposed must sufficiently take all these parameters into account, while not exceeding the statutory maximum provided for in Article 83(4) to (6) of the GDPR.

Furthermore, Article 83(5) of the GDPR provides that the maximum amount of the penalty imposed shall be the greater of the following two amounts: €20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an "amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total fine imposed." of the total global annual turnover of the previous financial year." In this regard, as stated in Fact Four of this agreement, the turnover of PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS during the 2023 financial year was €31,041,021, and the amounts of the fines have been set at €75,000 and €25,000, respectively. Therefore, both are considered to comply with the principle of proportionality.

Therefore, this Agency cannot ignore the purpose pursued by the regulation: to decide the amount of the administrative fine in the individual case raised, always ensuring that the sanction is proportional, effective, and dissuasive.

Sixth. - Regarding the application of the warning.

"In the hypothetical case of concluding that there were punishable acts, while reiterating that there is no cause for it, it must be indicated that the warning This request, in addition to meeting the requirements for this purpose as reflected in the Objections to the Start-Up Agreement, is not only a proper measure, but also a coherent and common-sense measure, considering that the Company:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 26/37

- It was never negligent when all it did was comply with regulations requiring it to check criminal records during the selection process, such as air safety regulations.

- It always ensured that the onboarding processes for new employees were as agile as possible, in a sector with high turnover and a need to fill job vacancies in record time.

- At all times, it has been clear and transparent with the Supervisory Authority, which is undoubtedly its obligation, but it certainly cannot be accepted that the Company's positive, supportive, open, and cooperative attitude be used to attribute to it nonexistent negligence, acknowledgments of responsibility, or malicious acts.

- It has proactively updated its processes, without even waiting for the outcome of the sanctioning procedure, which not only makes any corrective measures unnecessary, but also demonstrates a firm will to find a balance in terms of compliance with other regulations, which should be taken into account by the sanctioning body."

Regarding the imposition of a warning, reprimand, or the adoption of corrective measures pursuant to Article 58 of the GDPR, a deterrent fine is one that has a genuine deterrent effect. In this regard, the judgment of the CJEU of June 13, 2013, Versalis Spa v Commission, C-511/11, ECLI:EU:C:2013:386, states: "94. With regard, first of all, to the reference to the aforementioned judgment in Showa Denko v Commission, it should be noted that Versalis misinterprets it. Indeed, the Court of Justice, in stating in paragraph 23 of that judgment that the deterrent factor is assessed taking into account a multitude of elements and not just the specific situation of the undertaking in question, was referring to points 53 to 55 of the Opinion presented in that case by Advocate General Geelhoed, who had essentially stated that the deterrent factor may have as its object not only "general deterrence," defined as an action to discourage all undertakings, in general, from committing the infringement in question, but also "specific deterrence," consisting of deterring the specific defendant from violating the rules again in the future. Therefore, the Court of Justice merely confirmed, in that judgment, that the Commission was not required to limit its assessment to factors relating solely to the specific situation of the undertaking in question. 102. According to settled case-law, the objective of the deterrent multiplier factor and of taking into account, in this context, the size and overall resources of the undertaking in question lies in the desired impact on the undertaking in question, since the penalty must not be insignificant, particularly in relation to the undertaking's financial standing (to this effect, see, in particular, Case C-413/08 P Lafarge v Commission \[2010\] ECR I-5361, paragraph 104, and the order of 7 February 2012 in Case C-421/11 P Total and Elf Aquitaine v Commission, paragraph 82). Ultimately, it is the data controller who has the obligation to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing, in order to, pursuant to the principle of proactive responsibility, comply and be able to demonstrate compliance, while respecting the fundamental right to data protection.

In conclusion, the warning is a non-punitive corrective measure and does not fit this case either under Recital 148 or Article 64 of the LOPDGDD, which leaves this corrective measure for cases of minor infractions or those committed by a natural person, two elements that do not exist in this case.

V

Unfulfilled Obligation

Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR establishes that personal data must be:

“c) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ("data minimisation")."

On the other hand, Article 10 of the GDPR, which refers to the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences, provides: "The processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures on the basis of Article 6(1) may only be carried out under the supervision of public authorities or where authorised by Union or Member State law which provides appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. A complete record of criminal convictions may only be kept under the supervision of public authorities."

Article 10 of the LOPDGDD regulates the processing of personal data of a criminal nature in terms similar to Regulation (EU) 2016/679:

"1. The processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses, as well as related proceedings and precautionary and security measures, for purposes other than the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of criminal offenses or the execution of criminal penalties, may only be carried out when covered by a rule of Union law, this Organic Law, or other legal provisions.

2. The complete recording of data relating to criminal convictions and offenses, as well as related proceedings and precautionary and security measures, as referred to in Article 10 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, may be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the regulation of the System of administrative records to support the Administration of Justice.

3. Outside of the cases indicated in the previous sections, the processing of data related to criminal convictions and offenses, as well as related proceedings and precautionary measures and security measures, will only be possible when carried out by lawyers and solicitors and whose purpose is to collect information provided by their clients in the performance of their duties.

The GDPR refers, in Recital 75, to the possibility that certain data processing may entail a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, including data relating to criminal convictions and offenses and related security measures. Therefore, Article 10 of the legal text opts to confer the legitimacy of its processing on public authorities or when there is an authorization under EU law or a national regulation that provides adequate guarantees, and to assign custody of the records where this data is recorded to public authorities as well. This regulation, far from being new at the European level, was already expressed in similar terms in Directive 95/46 EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 24 October. 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.

The origin of this special guarantee lies in Council of Europe Convention No. 108 of 28 January 1981 for the protection of individuals with regard to the automated processing of personal data, which in Article 6

stipulates that certain categories of data, including personal data relating to criminal convictions, may not be processed automatically
unless domestic law provides appropriate safeguards.

Article 10 of the LOPDGDD, for its part, specifies the reference to the law of the Member States, emphasizing that, when the processing has a purpose

other than "the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offenses or the execution of criminal penalties"—processing excluded from the material scope of data protection regulations pursuant to Article 2.1.d) of the GDPR—for its processing to be considered legitimate, it must be protected by a European standard, the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act), or another legal standard.

The criminal record certificate is the public document that certifies the absence or existence of a criminal record registered in the Central Registry of Convicted Persons. A criminal record is defined as the final decisions issued by criminal courts and tribunals for the commission of a crime that imposes penalties or security measures that are in force, in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code.

The information contained in the criminal record certificate that is the subject of this procedure constitutes personal data in light of the definition in Article 4.1 of the GDPR, since it is "information about an identified natural person," whether it is a certificate that refers to the existence of such a record or indicates its absence, and its request constitutes data processing. Regarding The category covered by this information is specifically the final criminal convictions that may have been issued against a specific person (and are still in force), both to demonstrate that these final resolutions imposing penalties or measures exist and what they are, and to prove that they do not exist. In other words, the information being processed is data relating to criminal convictions—including the absence of such convictions—that are linked to a specific individual.

It should be noted that PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS's corporate purpose is the

"Storage, transportation, and distribution of all types of goods. Provision of logistics services. Provision of foreign trade, import, export, and customs clearance services." This means that, due to its logistics activity, it may have personnel who, on a permanent, rotating, or temporary basis, may carry out their activities in air cargo areas to which air security regulations apply.

Taking the above into account, the respondent justifies the request for said report in the following terms: "It must be taken into account that due to the type of position applied for, even if the position does not entail the employee's permanent presence in air cargo areas during their workday, such presence is potential based on circumstances related to the management of the work activity. This potential requires verifying whether the candidate, if hired, could meet the requirements established in the air safety regulations when carrying out their work in air cargo areas.

Regarding the certificate of absence of a criminal record, following an inquiry from the Inditex Group, the State Air Safety Agency, through its Safety Regulations Department (Civil Aviation Safety Division, Directorate of Civil Aviation Safety and User Protection), indicated the following: "(...) Persons selected to carry out inspections, access controls, or other security controls in any area that is not a security-restricted area, or to assume responsibility for such controls, or with unaccompanied access to air cargo and mail, airline mail and materials, in-flight stores, and airport supplies that have undergone the required security controls (section 11.1.2) will be subject to a normal background check (...)."

In this same sense, in relation to the certificate of absence of criminal record and the employment record document, the provisions of the Resolution of September 8, 2022, of the General Secretariat of Transport and Mobility, approving the update of the public part of the National Civil Aviation Security Program, must be taken into account.

Generally, it is not possible to request criminal record certificates from candidates who participate in a selection process or who, after passing it, proceed to sign their employment contracts or begin providing services. However, in certain professions or sectors, it would be permissible based on the activity performed and provided there is a legal provision that allows it. The Judgment of the Social Chamber of the National Court 14/2020, of February 10, 2020, states, regarding criminal records:

“Criminal records are personal data, which are protected by the fundamental constitutional right to data protection.

Criminal records are subject to specific processing rules because they are particularly sensitive personal data.

The business practice of requesting from newly hired employees a certificate of no criminal record or a sworn declaration of no criminal record is an act of personal data processing that takes place within the framework of an employment contract.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 30/37

The act of personal data processing indicated in the previous point will be lawful if the following two requirements are met:

The processing of Personal data (request for a criminal record certificate or declaration) must be necessary for the performance of the employment contract.

A rule of European Union law or a rule of domestic law with legal force must authorize the employer to request personal data (criminal record) from the employee.

As a result of the above, once it is established that the criminal record certificate requested by the respondent constitutes information regarding the criminal convictions of an identified natural person and, therefore, constitutes personal data, subject to the special guarantees established in Articles 10 of the GDPR and 10 of the LOPDGDD, it is necessary to examine whether there is an authorization that allows the respondent to process said information.

These provisions confer the processing of the aforementioned data to public authorities,

restricting its processing to individuals only in those cases where a European law or a national law authorizes it (in addition to what is established in point 10.3 for the processing of criminal data by lawyers and solicitors).

Therefore, only in those exceptional cases where, authorized by law and with the appropriate guarantees, such a measure is contemplated, could this certificate be required; in this regard, there are specific regulations that, in different areas, expressly contemplate it.

Analyzing the sectoral regulations brought up by the respondent in its written submission, it provides the query made to the State Aviation Safety Agency, which states the following: "Regarding your query, the application for a criminal record certificate is a requirement imposed by a Community Regulation (COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2019/103 of 23 January 2019 amending Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998 as regards the clarification, harmonization, and simplification, as well as the reinforcement of certain specific aviation safety measures).

Section 11.1 "Selection" of the aforementioned regulation establishes the following:

"(…).

11.1.2. Persons selected to carry out inspections, access controls, or other security controls in any area that is not a security-restricted area, or to assume responsibility for such controls, or with unaccompanied access to air cargo and mail, airline mail and material, in-flight stores, and airport supplies that have been subject to the required security controls, must have passed an enhanced or standard background check. Unless otherwise specified in this Regulation, the competent authority shall determine, in accordance with applicable national rules, whether enhanced or standard background checks are required.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 31/37

11.1.3. In accordance with applicable Union and national law, an enhanced background check must, at least:

(a) establish the identity of the person on the basis of appropriate supporting documents;

b) report any criminal record in all States of residence for at least the preceding five years;

c) report training and professional experience, as well as any gaps existing for at least the preceding five years;

d) include intelligence and any other information available to the competent national authorities that they consider relevant for the purpose of determining a person's suitability for employment in a role requiring an enhanced background check.

11.1.4. In accordance with applicable Union and national legislation, a standard background check must:

a) establish the identity of the person on the basis of relevant supporting documents;

b) report any criminal record in all States of residence for at least the preceding five years;

c) report training and professional experience, as well as any gaps existing for at least the preceding five years.

11.1.5. The standard background check or sections a) to c) of an enhanced background check must be completed before the individual receives initial security training involving access to information that is restricted due to its security-sensitive nature. Where applicable, section d) of an enhanced background check must be completed before the individual is authorized to perform, or assume responsibility for, inspections, access controls, or other security controls.

(…)

11.1.8. The selection process for all individuals selected pursuant to

sections 11.1.1 and 11.1.2 must include, at a minimum, a written application and an interview phase to conduct an initial assessment of skills and abilities.

11.1.9. Individuals selected to perform security screening must possess the necessary physical and mental skills and aptitudes to perform the assigned tasks effectively and will be informed of the nature of these requirements at the beginning of the selection process. These skills and aptitudes will be assessed during the selection process and before the conclusion of any probationary period. (…)”

In the present case, the respondent informed the complainant, via email dated July 5, 2023, that at the time of the interview, they should bring, among other documentation, a criminal record certificate.

Although there is a European regulation requiring a criminal record certificate when workers carry out their work in air cargo areas, the same regulation refers to “selected persons.” Therefore, requesting such personal data during the candidate evaluation phase is excessive, as it is neither adequate, nor relevant, nor limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose of verifying the candidates' aptitudes. As a general rule, the privacy of the worker always prevails, since requesting this type of confidential information may constitute a discriminatory practice. part of the companies.

Secondly, regarding the fact that at the time of the interview, the respondent had to fill out a questionnaire indicating his marital status and number of children, the respondent points out that it is based on the Resolution of January 3, 2011, of the Tax Management Department of the State Tax Administration Agency, which approves Form 145, for the communication of data from the recipient of employment income to his payer or for the variation of previously communicated data.

However, it must be considered that this resolution is for the communication of data from the recipient of employment income to his payer, that is, regarding individuals who are already employed and with whom he maintains an employment relationship. Therefore, the request for such information regarding candidates for a job where no such employment relationship exists is not adequate, relevant, or limited to what is necessary for the purpose of verifying such candidates' qualifications.

Based on the available evidence, it is considered that the known facts constitute two violations, attributable to Plataforma Cabanillas, for violation of Article 5.1 c) of the GDPR.

VI
Classification and qualification of the violation

The violation is classified in Article 83.5 of the GDPR, which defines it as such:

“5. Violations of the following provisions shall be punishable, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

a) The basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9.”

For the purposes of the statute of limitations for infringements, Article 72.1 of the LOPDGD classifies as a very serious infringement, with the statute of limitations being three years, “a)

The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees established
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 33/37

in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

VII
Sanction

Determining the sanction to be imposed in this case requires observing the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 2 of the GDPR, which, respectively, provide the following:

“1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for the infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 9, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.”

“2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures provided for in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:

a) the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them;

b) the intentionality or negligence involved in the infringement;

c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects;

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account any technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;

e) any previous infringement committed by the controller or the data processor;

f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the breach and, if so, to what extent;

i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with those measures;

j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or to certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42; and

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case.

such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.”

Within this section, the LOPDGDD provides in Article 76, entitled

"Sanctions and Corrective Measures":

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria established in section 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account:

a) The continuous nature of the infringement.

b) The connection between the infringer's activity and the processing of personal data.

c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the infringement.

d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the commission of the infringement.

e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the acquiring entity.

f) The impact on the rights of minors.

g) Having a data protection officer, when not mandatory.

h) The voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.

3. It will be possible, additionally or alternatively, to adopt, where appropriate, the remaining corrective measures referred to in Article 83.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

With regard to the statements made by the complaining party regarding the circumstances taken into account for the classification, as indicated above, the allegations made regarding the aggravating circumstances considered applicable to the facts examined are not accepted.

Furthermore, Article 83.5 of the GDPR provides that the maximum amount of the penalty imposed will be the greater of the following two amounts: €20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an "amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global turnover of the previous financial year."

In this regard, as stated in Fact Four of this agreement, PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS's turnover during the 2023 financial year was €31,041,021.

In accordance with the transcribed provisions, for the purposes of determining the fine to be imposed on the entity claimed as responsible for an infringement classified as follows:

Article 83.5 a) of the GDPR and 72.1a) of the LOPDGDD, the following factors are considered concurrent in the present case:

Article 83.2.k) of the GDPR in conjunction with Article 76 b) of the LOPDGDD: "The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data."

In the course of its activities, it routinely processes personal data, which impacts the diligence required of it to comply with the principles governing the processing of personal data and the quality and effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures it must implement to ensure respect for this right.

The respondent is engaged in personnel recruitment, which involves continuous data processing and collects extensive personal information relating to candidates.

No mitigating factors are apparent.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and Article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of Article 5.1 of the GDPR, allows for the imposition of the following sanctions:

- For the infringement committed by requesting a criminal record certificate from candidates without an employment relationship, a fine of €75,000 (seventy-five thousand euros).

- For the infringement committed by requesting the personal data of job candidates for Form 145, when no contractual relationship yet exists, a fine of €25,000 (twenty-five thousand euros).

Therefore, in accordance with applicable law and having assessed the criteria for graduating the sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: TO IMPOSE on PLATAFORMA CABANILLAS SA, with NIF A70350384:

- For the alleged violation of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, defined in Article 83.5 of said law, for requesting a criminal record certificate for the job interview, a fine of €75,000 (seventy-five thousand euros).
