Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in February 2025, an investigation at the operator BEKO ROMÂNIA SA and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) letter. b) and d) art. 32 para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 49,766.00 lei (equivalent to 10,000 EURO).

The investigation was initiated following a notification of a personal data breach, in accordance with the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

During the investigation, it was found that an unauthorized person, who took advantage of a programming vulnerability, illegally accessed the operator's website containing its customer database.

Thus, the person in question had access to the personal data of a large number of the operator's customers, namely: name, surname, telephone number, e-mail address, domicile, product details.

As a result, it was found that BEKO ROMÂNIA SA did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, neither when establishing the means of processing, nor during the processing itself.

It was also found that the operator did not carry out the periodic testing, evaluation and assessment of the efficiency of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the processing.

This situation led to unauthorized access by a third party to personal data, in violation of the provisions of art. 25 para. (1) in conjunction with 32 para. (1) let. b) and d) and art. 32 para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Pursuant to art. 58 para. (2) let. d) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the operator was ordered to implement, from a technical and organizational perspective, a data volume analysis system in the IT infrastructure of the company BEKO ROMÂNIA SA, including performing a back-up on it.

We note that the operator paid the fine applied.
