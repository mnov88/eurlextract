A new fine - natural person operator

The National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data completed in June 2023 an investigation at a natural person operator and found a violation of the provisions of art. 5, art. 6 para. (1) lit. a) and art. 9 para. (2) lit. a) from Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

The operator was fined in the amount of 9919.2 lei, the equivalent of 2000 euros.

During the investigation carried out following a complaint, it was found that the sanctioned operator (doctor) filmed, with his personal phone, a patient of the hospital where he works, without her consent and later posted the footage on his Facebook page. The audio-video recording led to the disclosure of the patient's personal data, such as image, voice, name, surname and state of health.

The operator deleted the recording from its Facebook page later that day, but not before it was viewed by a large number of people and picked up and disseminated on various websites and media channels.

We emphasize that art. 20 of Law no. 46/2003 regarding the patient's rights, with subsequent amendments and additions, states that: "The patient cannot be photographed or filmed in a medical facility without his consent, except in cases where the images are necessary for diagnosis or treatment and to avoid suspicion of medical malpractice .‚Äù

In addition to the fine, the National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data also applied a corrective measure, ordering the operator to ensure compliance with the GDPR of personal data processing operations, so that patients' personal data are processed in strict compliance of the legal provisions regarding the provision of medical services and the protection of personal data, by avoiding the illegal/excessive/unauthorized collection and/or disclosure of their personal data."
