Subject: Complaint relating to the sending of an email by the ex-employer of the complainants to the ex-colleagues

of these, specifying the nature of their dismissal

The Litigation Chamber of the Data Protection Authority, made up of Mr. Hielke

Hijmans, chairman;

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the

protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and
to the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Regulation on the

data protection), hereinafter “GDPR”;

Having regard to the Law of 3 December 2017 establishing the Data Protection Authority, hereinafter

“ACL”;

Having regard to the internal regulations as approved by the House of Representatives on 20

December 2018 and published in the Belgian Official Gazette on January 15, 2019;

Considering the documents in the file;

Made the following decision regarding:

The complainants: Ms. X1, and Ms. X2 hereinafter “the complainants”; .

                                                                                                          .
                                                                                                          .
The defendant: Y, hereinafter: “the defendant” Decision 63/2023 – 2/5

I. Facts and procedure

 1. On January 24 and 27, 2023, the complainants filed a complaint with the Authority of

       Data Protection (hereinafter “the DPA”), against their former employer, the defendant.

       The subject of the complaint concerns the sending on January 15, 2023 to third parties (between twenty and thirty

       members of staff) of an email concerning the dismissal of the complainants by their ex-

       employer. The disputed email specifies that the complainants were dismissed for serious misconduct.

       However, the plaintiffs point out that specifying to third parties (their ex-colleagues) the nature of the

       dismissal, i.e. serious misconduct, was not necessary. They indicate that this can give

       the impression that they have committed a serious fault in relation to the children cared for by

       the institution of their ex-employer, while the reasons underlying the serious misconduct would be

       others.

 2. On February 15, 2023, the complaint was declared admissible by the Front Line Service on the

       basis of Articles 58 and 60 of the LCA and the complaint is forwarded to the Litigation Chamber

       under Article 62, § 1 of the LCA for file 2023-00504. On February 3, 2023, the

       complaintisdeclaredadmissiblebythePremiumLineServiceonthebasisofarticles58 and

       60 of the LCA and the complaint is transmitted to the Litigation Chamber under article 62,

          st 4
       § 1 of the ACL for file 2023-00468.

 3. On February 27, 2023, the Litigation Chamber sent a letter to the complainant in the

       file 2023-00504 to inform him that a complaint for the same facts against the same

       controller of another person was received in case 2023-00468.

       In this respect, for reasons of procedural economy and efficiency, the Chamber

       Litigation sent an e-mail to the two complainants, to indicate to them that unless the

       their part within 10 days, the two complaints will be joined. Following this, the two files have

       been joined.

 4. Pursuant to article 95 § 2, 3° of the LCA as well as article 47 of the rules of order

       inside the DPA, a copy of the file may be requested by the parties. If one of

       parties wishes to make use of the possibility of consulting the file, the latter is required to

       contact the secretariat of the Litigation Chamber, preferably via the address

       litigationchamber@apd-gba.be.

II. Motivation

 5. The data minimization principle states that personal data

       must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes

       for which they are processed (article 5.1.c) of the GDPR).

 6. The Litigation Chamber considers that it is not necessary to specify the nature of the

       dismissal in order to inform employees of the dismissal of the complainants, the only

       mention of the departure being sufficient in this regard. Insofar as the purpose pursued

       could reasonably be achieved without disclosing this information, the Chamber

       Litigation finds that the defendant violated article 5.1.c) of the GDPR by specifying in

       the disputed email that the dismissal takes place for serious misconduct, instead of being limited to the

       notification of dismissal only.

 7. This decision is a prima facie decision taken by the Litigation Chamber

       in accordance with article 95 of the LCA on the basis of the complaint lodged by the complainants,

       within the framework of the “procedure prior to the substantive decision” and not a decision on the

       merits of the Litigation Chamber within the meaning of Article 100 of the LCA.

 8. The purpose of this decision is to inform the defendant, allegedly responsible for the

       processing, because it may have violated the provisions of the GDPR,

       in order to enable it to still comply with the aforementioned provisions.

 9. If, however, the defendant does not agree with the content of this decision

       prima facie and believes that it can make factual and/or legal arguments that

       could lead to another decision, it may send the Litigation Chamber a

       request for treatment on the merits of the case via the e-mail address litigationchamber@apd-

       gba.be, within 30 days of notification of this decision. The case

       applicable, the execution of this decision is suspended for the period

       aforementioned.

 10. In the event of further processing of the case on the merits, pursuant to Articles 98, 2° and 3°

       juncto article 99 of the LCA, the Litigation Chamber will invite the parties to introduce their
       conclusions and attach to the file all the documents they deem useful. If applicable, the

       this decision is permanently suspended.

 11. In the interests of transparency, the Litigation Division finally emphasizes that a

       dealing with the case on the merits may lead to the imposition of the measures mentioned in

       section 100 of the ACL.

5
 Section 3, Subsection 2 of the ACL (articles 94 to 97 inclusive).
6Art. 100. § 1. The litigation chamber has the power to
 1° dismiss the complaint without follow-up;
 2° order the dismissal; Decision 63/2023 – 4/5

III. Publication of the decision

  12. Considering the importance of transparency regarding the decision-making process of the Chamber

        Litigation, this decision is published on the website of the Protection Authority

        Datas. However, it is not necessary for this purpose that the identification data

        of the parties are communicated directly.
