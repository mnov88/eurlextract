EDPS INVESTIGATION INTO USE OF
MICROSOFT 365
BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
(Case 2021-0518)
Decision
(8 March 2024)
EXCERPT OF FINDINGS OF INFRINGEMENTS
AND OF USE OF CORRECTIVE POWERS
Purpose limitation
I. The EDPS finds that the Commission, on 12 May 2021 (the ‘reference date’) and continuously thereafter until the date of issuing this decision:
a) has infringed Article 4(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 (the ‘Regulation’) by failing to:
- sufficiently determine the types of personal data collected under the 2021 ILA in relation to each of the purposes of the processing so as to allow those purposes to be specified and explicit;
- ensure that the purposes for which Microsoft is permitted to collect personal data under the 2021 ILA are specified and explicit;
b) has infringed Article 29(3)(a) of the Regulation by insufficiently determining in the 2021 ILA which types of personal data are to be processed for which purposes and by failing to provide sufficiently clear documented instructions for the processing;
c) has infringed Articles 4(2) and 26(1) in conjunction with Article 30 of the Regulation by failing to ensure that Microsoft processes personal data to provide its services only on documented instructions from the Commission;
d) has infringed Article 6 of the Regulation by failing to assess whether the purposes for further processing are compatible with the purposes for which the personal data have initially been collected;
e) has infringed Article 9 of the Regulation by failing to assess whether it is necessary and proportionate to transmit the personal data to Microsoft Ireland and its sub-processors (including affiliates) located in the EEA for a specific purpose in the public interest.
International transfers
II. The EDPS finds that the Commission, on the reference date and, except with regard to point b), second indent, and to point c),1 continuously thereafter until the date of issuing this decision:
a) has infringed Article 29(3)(a) of the Regulation by failing to clearly provide in the 2021 ILA what types of personal data can be transferred to which recipients in which third country and for which purposes, and to give Microsoft documented instructions in that regard;
b) has infringed Articles 4(2), 46 and 48 of the Regulation by failing to provide appropriate safeguards ensuring that personal data transferred enjoy an essentially equivalent level of protection to that in the EEA since it:
- has not appraised, either prior to the initiation of the transfers or subsequently, what personal data will be transferred to which recipients in which third countries and for which purposes, thereby not obtaining the minimum information necessary to determine whether any supplementary measures are required to ensure the essentially equivalent level of protection and whether any effective supplementary measures exist and could be implemented;
- had not implemented effective supplementary measures for transfers to the United States taking place prior to the entry into force of the US adequacy decision, in light of the Schrems II judgment, nor has it demonstrated that such measures existed;
c) has infringed Articles 4(2), 46 and 48(1) and (3)(a) of the Regulation by:
- concluding the SCCs for transfers from the Commission to Microsoft Corporation without having clearly mapped the proposed transfers, concluded a transfer impact assessment and included appropriate safeguards in those SCCs;
- failing to obtain authorisation of those SCCs for transfers from the Commission to Microsoft Corporation from the EDPS pursuant to Article 48(3)(a) of the Regulation;
d) has infringed Article 47(1) of the Regulation read in the light of Articles 4, 5, 6, 9 and 46 by failing to ensure that transfers take place “solely to allow tasks within the competence of the controller to be carried out.”
Unauthorised disclosures
III. The EDPS finds that the Commission, on the reference date and continuously thereafter until the date of issuing this decision:
a) has infringed Article 29(3)(a) of the Regulation, in particular as interpreted in the light of the Schrems II judgment, by not ensuring that, for personal data processed in the EEA, only EU or Member State law prohibits notification to the Commission of a request for disclosure, and that, for personal data processed outside the EEA, any prohibition of such notification constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society respecting the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms recognised by the Charter;
b) has infringed Articles 4(1)(f), 33(1) and (2) and 36 of the Regulation, by:
- not having assessed the legislation of all third countries to which personal data are envisaged to be transferred under the 2021 ILA and thereby failing to ensure that Microsoft and its sub-processors do not make disclosures of personal data within and outside of the EEA that are not authorised under EU law;
- failing to implement effective technical and organisational measures that would ensure processing in accordance with the principle of integrity and confidentiality within the EEA and, as part of an essential equivalence of the level of protection, also outside of the EEA.
Use of corrective powers
IV. The EDPS has decided to take the following corrective measures in respect of the infringements detailed in sections 3.1.3, 3.2.3 and 3.3.3 of the decision:
1.1. to order the Commission, under Article 58(2)(j) of the Regulation and with effect from 9 December 2024, to suspend all data flows resulting from its use of Microsoft 365 to Microsoft and to its affiliates and sub-processors, located in third countries not covered by an adequacy decision as referred to in Article 47(1) of the Regulation, and to demonstrate the effective implementation of such suspension (infringements set out in paragraphs II.a and b, first indent, and III);
1.2. to order the Commission, under Article 58(2)(e) of the Regulation, to bring the processing operations resulting from its use of Microsoft 365 into compliance, and to demonstrate such compliance, by 9 December 2024, by:
1.2.1. carrying out a transfer-mapping exercise identifying what personal data are transferred to which recipients in which third countries, for which purposes and subject to which safeguards, including any onward transfers (infringements set out in paragraph II.a and b, first indent);
1.2.2. ensuring that all transfers to third countries take place solely to allow tasks within the competence of the controller to be carried out (infringement set out in paragraph II.d);
1.2.3. ensuring, by way of contractual provisions concluded pursuant to Article 29(3) of the Regulation and of other organisational and technical measures, that:
a) all personal data are collected for explicit and specified purposes (infringements set out in paragraph I.a and b);
b) the types of personal data are sufficiently determined in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (infringements set out in paragraph I.a and b);
c) any processing by Microsoft or its affiliates or sub-processors is only carried out on the Commission’s documented instructions, unless, for processing within the EEA, required by EU or Member State law, or, for processing outside of the EEA, third-country law that ensures a level of protection essentially equivalent to that in the EEA, to which Microsoft or its affiliates or sub-processors are subject (infringements set out in paragraphs I.b and c, II.a and III);
d) no personal data are further processed in a manner that is not compatible with the purposes for which the data are collected, in accordance with the criteria laid down in Article 6 of the Regulation (infringement set out in paragraph I.d);
e) any transmissions to Microsoft Ireland or its affiliates and sub-processors located in the EEA comply with Article 9 of the Regulation (infringement set out in paragraph I.e);
f) for personal data processed in the EEA, only EU or Member State law prohibits notification to the Commission of a request for disclosure, and, for personal data processed outside the EEA, any prohibition of such notification constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society respecting the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms recognised by the Charter, as required by Article 29(3)(a) of the Regulation, in particular as interpreted in light of the Schrems II judgment (infringement set out in paragraph III.a);
g) no disclosures of personal data by Microsoft or its sub-processors take place, unless, for personal data processed within the EEA, the disclosure is required by EU or Member State law, or, for personal data processed outside of the EEA, the disclosure is required by third-country law that ensures a level of protection essentially equivalent to that in the EEA, to which Microsoft or its affiliates or sub-processors are subject (infringements set out in paragraph III.b).
1.3. to issue a reprimand to the Commission under Article 58(2)(b) of the Regulation (all infringements).
