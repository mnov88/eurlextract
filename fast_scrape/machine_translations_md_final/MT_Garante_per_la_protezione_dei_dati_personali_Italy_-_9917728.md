2. Outcome of the preliminary investigation.

Having taken note of what is represented by the AUSL Toscana Sud Est in the documentation in the deeds and in the defense briefs, it is noted that:

pursuant to the Regulation, "data relating to health" are considered personal data relating to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information relating to his or her state of health (art. 4, par. 1, no. 15, of the Regulation). Recital no. 35 of the Regulation then specifies that data relating to health "include information on the natural person collected during his registration in order to receive health care services";

pursuant to the Regulation, personal data must be "processed in a lawful, correct and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness, correctness and transparency")" and must be "adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary with respect to the purposes for which are processed ("minimization of data")" (Article 5, paragraph 1, letter a) and c) of the Regulation);

the data must also be processed "in such a way as to guarantee adequate security (...), including protection, through appropriate technical and organizational measures, against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage (principle of " integrity and confidentiality")" (Article 5, paragraph 1, letter f), of the Regulation);

the data controller is required to implement "from the planning stage", i.e. both when determining the means of processing and at the time of the processing itself, "adequate technical and organizational measures, \[...\] aimed at effectively implementing the principles of data protection, such as minimisation, and to integrate the necessary guarantees in the processing in order to meet the requirements of this regulation and protect the rights of data subjects" (privacy by design), ensuring "that they are processed, by default" (privacy by default) «only the personal data necessary for each specific purpose of the processing» (art. 25, par. 1 and 2, of the Regulation);

the regulation on the protection of personal data provides that information on the state of health cannot be disseminated and can be communicated to a person other than the interested party only on the basis of a suitable legal prerequisite or on the indication of the interested party subject to written authorization of the latter (Articles 2 septies, paragraph 8 and Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Code and Article 9 of the Regulation);

the Authority since 2014, in accordance with art. 22, ch. 8 of the Code then in force, represented that "the publication of any information from which it is possible to infer the state of illness or the existence of pathologies of the subjects concerned is prohibited, including any reference to the conditions of invalidity, disability or physical handicap and /or psychic. To this end, from the stage of drafting the deeds and documents to be published, in compliance with the principle of adequate motivation, "excess", "irrelevant", "non-essential" (and, even less, "forbidden"). Otherwise, it is necessary to provide for the relative obscuration" (see Guidelines on the processing of personal data, also contained in administrative deeds and documents, carried out for purposes of advertising and transparency on the web by public subjects and other bodies obliged, part II, paragraph 1, of 15.5.2014, web doc. n. 3488002);

from the documentation produced in the deeds and also in the light of what is indicated in the order to dismiss the criminal proceedings initiated on the facts of the appeal adopted by the Judge for preliminary investigations of Arezzo on the XX, it is noted that the name and surname were recognizable on the aforementioned billboard of the complainant present in the first aid operator screen shot on the billboard;

the presence on the aforementioned billboard of the complainant's personal data associated with the health service provided to him in an emergency integrates a dissemination of data on his health since, according to what was declared in the documents, the aforementioned billboard had been located in the main patient entrance corridor in the emergency room, or in an area accessible to anyone;

from the documentation in the documents, it is therefore ascertained that the AUSL Toscana Sud Est has disseminated information on the state of health of an interested party since in the aforementioned advertising billboard, located in a place accessible to anyone, the name and surname of the complainant was recognizable on a first aid card displayed on the operator's screen shown on the aforementioned billboard.

3. Conclusions.

In the light of the assessments referred to above, taking into account the statements made by the owner during the preliminary investigation ˗ and considering that, unless the fact constitutes a more serious crime, anyone who, in a proceeding before the Guarantor, falsely declares or certifies news or circumstances o produces false deeds or documents and is liable pursuant to art. 168 of the Code "False statements to the Guarantor and interruption of the execution of the duties or the exercise of the powers of the Guarantor" ˗ the elements provided by the data controller in the defense briefs do not allow to overcome the findings notified by the Office with the deed of initiation of the proceeding, since none of the cases envisaged by art. 11 of the Regulation of the Guarantor n. 1/2019.

For these reasons, the unlawfulness of the processing of personal data carried out by AUSL Toscana Sud Est, in the terms set out in the justification, in violation of articles 5, par.1, lett. a), c) and f), 9 and 25, paras. 1 and 2, of the Regulation, of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8 of the Code.

In this context, it being understood that the AUSL Toscana Sud Est has declared that it has removed the aforementioned advertising billboard, the conditions for the adoption of the corrective measures pursuant to art. 58, par. 2, of the Regulation.

4. Adoption of the injunction order for the application of the pecuniary administrative sanction and accessory sanctions (articles 58, paragraph 2, letter i), and 83 of the Regulation; art. 166, paragraph 7, of the Code).

The violation of the articles 5, par.1, lett. a), c) and f), 9 and 25, paras. 1 and 2, of the Regulation, of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8 of the Code, caused by the conduct implemented by the AUSL Toscana Sud Est, is subject to the application of the administrative fine pursuant to art. 83, par. 4 and 5, of the Regulation and of the art. 166, paragraph 2 of the Code.

Consider that the Guarantor, pursuant to articles 58, par. 2, lit. i), and 83 of the Regulation, as well as art. 166 of the Code, has the power to "impose a pecuniary administrative sanction pursuant to article 83, in addition to the \[other\] \[corrective\] measures referred to in this paragraph, or instead of such measures, according to the circumstances of each single case" and, in this context, "the Board \[of the Guarantor\] adopts the injunction order, with which it also orders the application of the ancillary administrative sanction of its publication, in whole or in part, on the website of the Guarantor pursuant to article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code" (art. 16, paragraph 1, of the Guarantor's Regulation no. 1/2019).

The aforementioned pecuniary administrative sanction imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, must be determined in the amount taking into account the principles of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness, indicated in art. 83, par. 1, of the Regulation, in the light of the elements provided for in art. 85, par. 2, of the Regulation in relation to which it is observed that:

the Authority became aware of the event following the violation notification presented by the AUSL on XX pursuant to art. 33 of the Regulation and of the complaint presented by the interested party to XX (art. 83, paragraph 2, letter h), of the Regulation);

the dissemination concerns the personal data related to the provision of a first aid service of a data subject present on a single billboard placed in a place accessible to the public (Article 83, paragraph 2, letters a) and g), of the Regulation) ;

the aforesaid billboard was posted for a few weeks in a room which, although it was open to the public (main entrance corridor for patients to the Emergency Department), given the concomitance of the pandemic period, was intended for the transit of only Covid-negative patients 19 and precluded to their companions (article 83, paragraph 2, letter a) and g), of the Regulation);

the facts under examination occurred during the ongoing state of health emergency from Covid-19 (Article 83, paragraph 2, letters a) and g), of the Regulation);

the AUSL promptly cooperated in order to remedy the violation by removing the aforementioned billboard and warning the companies involved in the creation of the same to cancel the complainant's personal data, promptly reporting it to the same (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter f ) of the Regulation);

the AUSL has carried out mandatory training courses for staff for the year 2022 and planned a new training cycle for the year 2023, and carried out the training course in December 2022 "Data processing - with particular reference to images - in the Healthcare Company", which was attended by numerous operators of various profiles (technical, administrative, healthcare), of which a new edition is expected in 2023 (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter c), of the Regulation );

following the facts subject to the investigation, the AUSL has prepared a company procedure which governs the provision of a centralized supervision at company level in order to create materials with the use of images on any medium (signs, brochures, videos, photos, posts , etc.) aimed at publication/dissemination as part of the Company's institutional information, communication, education/health promotion initiatives (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter c), of the Regulation);

although the AUSL has been sanctioned for previous violations of the regulation on the processing of personal data, these do not concern the dissemination of health data (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter e) of the Regulation).

Based on the aforementioned elements, evaluated as a whole, it is decided to determine the amount of the pecuniary sanction provided for by art. 83, par. 5, letter. a), of the Regulation, to the extent of 20,000 (twenty thousand) euros for the violation of articles 5, par.1, lett. a), c) and f), 9 and 25, paras. 1 and 2, of the Regulation, of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8 of the Code, as a pecuniary administrative sanction withheld, pursuant to art. 83, par. 1, of the Regulation, effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

It is also believed that the ancillary sanction of publication on the Guarantor's website of this provision should be applied, provided for by art. 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and by art. 16 of the Regulation of the Guarantor n. 1/2019, also in consideration of the type of personal data subject to unlawful processing.

Finally, it should be noted that the conditions pursuant to art. 17 of Regulation no. 1/2019 concerning internal procedures having external relevance, aimed at carrying out the tasks and exercising the powers delegated to the Guarantor.

ALL THIS CONSIDERING THE GUARANTOR

declares the unlawfulness of the processing of personal data carried out by the Local Health Unit of South East Tuscany for the violation of the articles 5, par.1, lett. a), c) and f), 9 and 25, paras. 1 and 2, of the Regulation, of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8 of the Code in the terms set out in the justification.

ORDER

pursuant to articles 58, par. 2, lit. i), and 83 of the Regulation, as well as art. 166 of the Code, to the South East Tuscany Local Health Authority, P.I. and tax code 02236310518, in the person of the pro-tempore legal representative, to pay the sum of 20,000 (twenty thousand) euros as an administrative fine for the violations indicated in this provision; it is represented that the offender, pursuant to art. 166, paragraph 8, of the Code, has the right to settle the dispute by paying, within 30 days, an amount equal to half of the fine imposed.

HAS

pursuant to art. 166, paragraph 7, of the Code, the publication of this provision in full on the website of the Guarantor and the annotation of this provision in the internal register of the Authority, provided for by art. 57, par. 1, lit. u), of the Regulation, of the violations and of the measures adopted in accordance with art. 58, par. 2, of the Regulation.

2. Outcome of the preliminary investigation.

Having taken note of what is represented by the AUSL Toscana Sud Est in the documentation in the deeds and in the defense briefs, it is noted that:

pursuant to the Regulation, "data relating to health" are considered personal data relating to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information relating to his or her state of health (art. 4, par. 1, no. 15, of the Regulation). Recital no. 35 of the Regulation then specifies that data relating to health "include information on the natural person collected during his registration in order to receive health care services";

pursuant to the Regulation, personal data must be "processed in a lawful, correct and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness, correctness and transparency")" and must be "adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary with respect to the purposes for which are processed ("minimization of data")" (Article 5, paragraph 1, letter a) and c) of the Regulation);

the data must also be processed "in such a way as to guarantee adequate security (...), including protection, through appropriate technical and organizational measures, against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage (principle of " integrity and confidentiality")" (Article 5, paragraph 1, letter f), of the Regulation);

the data controller is required to implement "from the planning stage", i.e. both when determining the means of processing and at the time of the processing itself, "adequate technical and organizational measures, \[...\] aimed at effectively implementing the principles of data protection, such as minimisation, and to integrate the necessary guarantees in the processing in order to meet the requirements of this regulation and protect the rights of data subjects" (privacy by design), ensuring "that they are processed, by default" (privacy by default) «only the personal data necessary for each specific purpose of the processing» (art. 25, par. 1 and 2, of the Regulation);

the regulation on the protection of personal data provides that information on the state of health cannot be disseminated and can be communicated to a person other than the interested party only on the basis of a suitable legal prerequisite or on the indication of the interested party subject to written authorization of the latter (Articles 2 septies, paragraph 8 and Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Code and Article 9 of the Regulation);

the Authority since 2014, in accordance with art. 22, ch. 8 of the Code then in force, represented that "the publication of any information from which it is possible to infer the state of illness or the existence of pathologies of the subjects concerned is prohibited, including any reference to the conditions of invalidity, disability or physical handicap and /or psychic. To this end, from the stage of drafting the deeds and documents to be published, in compliance with the principle of adequate motivation, "excess", "irrelevant", "non-essential" (and, even less, "forbidden"). Otherwise, it is necessary to provide for the relative obscuration" (see Guidelines on the processing of personal data, also contained in administrative deeds and documents, carried out for purposes of advertising and transparency on the web by public subjects and other bodies obliged, part II, paragraph 1, of 15.5.2014, web doc. n. 3488002);

from the documentation produced in the deeds and also in the light of what is indicated in the order to dismiss the criminal proceedings initiated on the facts of the appeal adopted by the Judge for preliminary investigations of Arezzo on the XX, it is noted that the name and surname were recognizable on the aforementioned billboard of the complainant present in the first aid operator screen shot on the billboard;

the presence on the aforementioned billboard of the complainant's personal data associated with the health service provided to him in an emergency integrates a dissemination of data on his health since, according to what was declared in the documents, the aforementioned billboard had been located in the main patient entrance corridor in the emergency room, or in an area accessible to anyone;

from the documentation in the documents, it is therefore ascertained that the AUSL Toscana Sud Est has disseminated information on the state of health of an interested party since the name and surname of the complainant was recognizable on the aforementioned billboard, located in a place accessible to anyone a first aid card displayed on the operator's screen shown on the aforementioned billboard.

3. Conclusions.

In the light of the assessments referred to above, taking into account the statements made by the data controller during the preliminary investigation ˗ and considering that, unless the fact constitutes a more serious crime, whoever, in a proceeding before the Guarantor, falsely declares or certifies news or circumstances o produces false deeds or documents and is liable pursuant to art. 168 of the Code "False declarations to the Guarantor and interruption of the execution of the duties or the exercise of the powers of the Guarantor" ˗ the elements provided by the data controller in the defense briefs do not allow to overcome the findings notified by the Office with the deed of initiation of the proceeding, since none of the cases envisaged by art. 11 of the Regulation of the Guarantor n. 1/2019.

For these reasons, the unlawfulness of the processing of personal data carried out by AUSL Toscana Sud Est, in the terms set out in the justification, in violation of articles 5, par.1, lett. a), c) and f), 9 and 25, paras. 1 and 2, of the Regulation, of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8 of the Code.

In this context, it being understood that the AUSL Toscana Sud Est has declared that it has removed the aforementioned advertising billboard, the conditions for the adoption of the corrective measures pursuant to art. 58, par. 2, of the Regulation.

4. Adoption of the injunction order for the application of the pecuniary administrative sanction and accessory sanctions (articles 58, paragraph 2, letter i), and 83 of the Regulation; art. 166, paragraph 7, of the Code).

The violation of the articles 5, par.1, lett. a), c) and f), 9 and 25, paras. 1 and 2, of the Regulation, of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8 of the Code, caused by the conduct implemented by the AUSL Toscana Sud Est, is subject to the application of the administrative fine pursuant to art. 83, par. 4 and 5, of the Regulation and of the art. 166, paragraph 2 of the Code.

Consider that the Guarantor, pursuant to articles 58, par. 2, lit. i), and 83 of the Regulation, as well as art. 166 of the Code, has the power to "impose a pecuniary administrative sanction pursuant to article 83, in addition to the \[other\] \[corrective\] measures referred to in this paragraph, or instead of such measures, according to the circumstances of each single case" and, in this context, "the Board \[of the Guarantor\] adopts the injunction order, with which it also orders the application of the ancillary administrative sanction of its publication, in whole or in part, on the website of the Guarantor pursuant to article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code" (art. 16, paragraph 1, of the Guarantor's Regulation no. 1/2019).

The aforementioned pecuniary administrative sanction imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, must be determined in the amount taking into account the principles of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness, indicated in art. 83, par. 1, of the Regulation, in the light of the elements provided for in art. 85, par. 2, of the Regulation in relation to which it is observed that:

the Authority became aware of the event following the violation notification presented by the AUSL on XX pursuant to art. 33 of the Regulation and of the complaint presented by the interested party to XX (art. 83, paragraph 2, letter h), of the Regulation);

the dissemination concerns the personal data related to the provision of a first aid service of a data subject present on a single billboard placed in a place accessible to the public (Article 83, paragraph 2, letters a) and g), of the Regulation) ;

the aforesaid billboard was posted for a few weeks in a room which, although it was open to the public (main entrance corridor for patients to the Emergency Department), given the concomitance of the pandemic period, was intended for the transit of only Covid-negative patients 19 and precluded to their companions (article 83, paragraph 2, letter a) and g), of the Regulation);

the facts under examination occurred during the ongoing state of health emergency from Covid-19 (Article 83, paragraph 2, letters a) and g), of the Regulation);

the AUSL promptly cooperated in order to remedy the violation by removing the aforementioned billboard and warning the companies involved in the creation of the same to cancel the complainant's personal data, promptly reporting it to the same (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter f ) of the Regulation);

the AUSL has carried out mandatory training courses for staff for the year 2022 and planned a new training cycle for the year 2023, and carried out the training course in December 2022 "Data processing - with particular reference to images - in the Healthcare Company", which was attended by numerous operators of various profiles (technical, administrative, healthcare), of which a new edition is expected in 2023 (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter c), of the Regulation );

following the facts subject to the investigation, the AUSL has prepared a company procedure which governs the provision of a centralized supervision at company level in order to create materials with the use of images on any medium (signs, brochures, videos, photos, posts , etc.) aimed at publication/dissemination as part of the Company's institutional information, communication, education/health promotion initiatives (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter c), of the Regulation);

although the AUSL has been sanctioned for previous violations of the regulation on the processing of personal data, these do not concern the dissemination of health data (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter e) of the Regulation).

Based on the aforementioned elements, evaluated as a whole, it is decided to determine the amount of the pecuniary sanction provided for by art. 83, par. 5, letter. a), of the Regulation, to the extent of 20,000 (twenty thousand) euros for the violation of articles 5, par.1, lett. a), c) and f), 9 and 25, paras. 1 and 2, of the Regulation, of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8 of the Code, as a pecuniary administrative sanction withheld, pursuant to art. 83, par. 1, of the Regulation, effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

It is also believed that the ancillary sanction of publication on the Guarantor's website of this provision should be applied, provided for by art. 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and by art. 16 of the Regulation of the Guarantor n. 1/2019, also in consideration of the type of personal data subject to unlawful processing.

Finally, it should be noted that the conditions pursuant to art. 17 of Regulation no. 1/2019 concerning internal procedures having external relevance, aimed at carrying out the tasks and exercising the powers delegated to the Guarantor.

ALL THIS CONSIDERING THE GUARANTOR

declares the unlawfulness of the processing of personal data carried out by the Local Health Unit of South East Tuscany for the violation of the articles 5, par.1, lett. a), c) and f), 9 and 25, paras. 1 and 2, of the Regulation, of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8 of the Code in the terms set out in the justification.
