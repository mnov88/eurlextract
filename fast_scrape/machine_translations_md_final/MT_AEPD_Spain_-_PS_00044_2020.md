                RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

In the sanctioning procedure PS / 044/2020, instructed by the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, to A.A.A., with NIF: \*\*\* NIF.1 (hereinafter, “the person
claimed ”), by virtue of the complaint presented by B.B.B., (hereinafter,“ the
claimant ”), and based on the following,
                                  BACKGROUND

FIRST: On 07/28/19, you had a written entry in this Agency, presented by
B.B.B., (hereinafter, “the claimant”), in which it stated, among others, the following:

"When I went to the notary to request a copy of the deed of my house, without informing

Regarding, they scanned my ID. When asked about how they protected that document,
They told me that they did not have the information but that they were taking my data and
they would call. I wanted to know about the security measures that were applied
because, if I had been informed, I would have given them a black and white photocopy. Two
months and a half later, as they had not contacted me, I sent them an email, in the
that they already show me the informative clauses, but they still do not inform me of how

they keep my ID. For security, I don't like having copies of my ID scanned to
good resolution and in color, so since they had not provided me with that
information, I insisted on it. They sent me to their DPD, with whom I have exchanged
emails, but ended up claiming that I did not need to be informed based on
to article 32 of Law 10/2010, of April 28, on the prevention of money laundering

capitals ”.

SECOND: In view of the facts set forth in the claim and the documents
provided by the claimant, the Subdirectorate General for Data Inspection proceeded
to carry out actions for its clarification, under the powers of

investigation granted to the control authorities in article 57.1 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 (RGPD). Thus, dated 10/18/19, an informative request is addressed
to the claimed person.

THIRD: On 11/07/19, this Agency receives a letter from the Delegate of
Data Protection of the claimed Notary, in which, among others, it indicates:

“On August 7, 2018, the claimant went to the notarial office to
request a copy of the protocol of the former notary of that city, \*\*\* NOTARY. 1.
That on December 7, 2011 as a result of the retirement of the person
was a notary of this city \*\*\* NOTARY.1, Mr. \*\*\* NOTARY.2 received the

notarial protocol of the former for safekeeping.

That the claimant's DNI not being scanned, it was considered appropriate to carry out
your scan in accordance with money laundering legislation. For this it was taken into
consideration of the fact that it was an economic operation of the protocol to

position of Mr. \*\*\* NOTARY. 2 of which identification document was lacking.

That the claimant expressed his discrepancy regarding the applied tariff by placing a
claim for the invoice issued (Doc1) before the Consumer Service of the Board of

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/12

Andalusia (Doc2). The professional services invoice contains the data
basic information on data protection for the activity of the notarial office.

That on October 31, 2018 this notarial office provided the claimant with
additional information on data protection in relation to merited activity (doc3).

That in subsequent communications he stated that he was against the scanning of his
DNI or consider that they should be aware of the security measures applied:
“… Must do a risk analysis or DPIA and determine it, according to its criticality.

This gives me little confidence in the measures implemented, which is why you requested
information",

That subsequently, and after several calls from the claimant, the incident was reported
to the Data Protection Delegate of this notarial office.

That the DPD by email of December 18, 2018 (doc5) requested
specify the request for rights exercised by the claimant. The claimant does not
He answered, so the DPD reminded him on January 14, 2019 (doc6) that
The term of the procedure was extended by two more months to be able to attend his
petition.

That same day, the claimant replies alleging that “what I am asking is the verification of
that said information was provided to me ”(doc7).

That with all of the above and having fulfilled the Notarial Office with the duty of

information regarding customer activity it was considered necessary to focus the
issue in the Money Laundering activity. Consequently, the DPD reported
to the claimant dated February 7 (doc8) on the special circumstances
that have these treatments and therefore the impossibility of meeting your request.
Later, on February 11, he was informed again (doc9-10).

Regarding the control measures applied in this Notarial Office: They accept the
ISO 27001 standard. However, in relation to the Activity Register and its
legitimation in the treatment, the following measures have been adopted:

A.18 Compliance

A.18.1 Compliance with legal and contractual requirements: RGPD: Control Measures

Consequently, the following measures were adopted: The Register of

In consideration of the nature of the Public Authority of Notaries and based on article 37.1 a)
of the European Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 was designated Dpd and

reported to the Registry of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection (Doc1).

It was agreed to implant legends in order to comply with the duty of information
of article 13 of European Regulation 2016/679. 4. A procedure was established
management of RGPD rights in the Notarial Office.

The measures were reviewed on March 19, 2019. They were agreed
recommendations to correct the deficiencies found and improve the proper
implantation. A data protection legend is included on the invoices for reason
of the "clients" activity.

The claimant was sent a copy of the additional information dated October 31
2018, in relation to customer activity and was informed and explained the
specific circumstances derived from the processing of data for the activity "laundering
Capital ”and therefore the exclusion of the duty of information.

FOURTH: In view of the denounced facts, of the documentation provided by

the parties and in accordance with the evidence available, the Inspection of
Data from this Spanish Agency for Data Protection considered that the action
of the claimed entity did not meet the conditions imposed by the regulations in force,
for which the opening of a sanctioning procedure proceeds. So dated
06/01/20, the Director of the AEPD, agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure for the per-

claimed, by virtue of the powers established, for failing to comply with the provisions of
Article 13 of the RGPD, by NOT offering the necessary information to the claimant when
The DNI was required for scanning, punishable in accordance with the provisions of art.
83 of the aforementioned RGPD, with an initial sanction of "APERCIBIMIENTO".

FIFTH: Notified the initiation agreement, the claimed person, by writing of
dated 06/15/20, made, in summary, the following allegations:

On the lack of information in relation to the treatment derived from the scan of the DNI
Of the interested. My client, in compliance with article 30, has a Record of Ac-
Treatment activities. There are, among others, two different declared activities:

1. Clients: in order to proceed with the granting of the public document and proceed
der to your billing 2. Money Laundering: for the management and registration of obligations
tions derived in matter.

These activities are different and coincide with the files declared at the time
in accordance with Law 15/1999 on data protection and Ministerial orders
of its creation to the extent that they were public files: OM de Justicia
JUS / 484/2003 and Ministry of Economy Order EHA / 114/2008, of January 29.

The Agreement that we are challenging says that the duty of information of Article 13 was omitted
of Regulation 2016/679 when the claimant's DNI was scanned in order to give
compliance with the Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and subsequently
when requested. It is true what the notified act says: the interested party was not informed

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/12

of the money laundering activity of the \*\*\* NOTARY. 2. However and how I know
You will see, there is no legal obligation to inform about the data processing in case of
money laundering.

We note that the interested party was informed in relation to the activity of "clients"
as stated in the file.

The Agreement to Initiate the Penalty Procedure forgets some information that would have
allowed the correct qualification of the facts of this procedure:

1. The notary is bound by the Money Laundering Prevention Law: ar-
Title 2.1 n) Obliged subjects: “notaries”.

2. The notary as a subject bound by Regulation 2016/679 creates his Registry of

Activities. Following the criteria of the AGPD, it makes use of the file created by the Or-
den EHA / 114/2008, of January 29, regulating compliance with certain
obligations of notaries in the field of prevention of money laundering and
This is how the "Money Laundering" treatment activity has been declared.

3. Art 32.3 of Law 10/2010 of April 28 states that: “By virtue of the provisions of the

Article 24.1, and in relation to the obligations referred to in the preceding paragraph
rior, the obligation to provide information will not apply to data processing
in article 5 of Organic Law 15/1999. Likewise, they will not apply to the
les and treatments referred to in this precept the norms contained in the
aforementioned Organic Law regarding the exercise of rights of access, rectification,

cancellation and opposition. In case of exercise of the aforementioned rights by the interested party
do, the obliged subjects shall limit themselves to making clear the provisions of this article
ass".

4. On the obligation to make copies to the DNI: Art 28. 2. Laundering Regulation

of Capitals “The obligated subjects will store the copies of the authentic documents
formal identification clients on optical, magnetic or electronic media "

5. On the term of conservation of the DNI: Art 29.1 Regulation of Laundering of
Capitals: “The obligated subjects will keep the documents and keep records
of all business relationships and operations, national and international,

final, for a period of ten years from the termination of the relationship… ”.

Therefore, in compliance with the legal obligation of article 32 of Law 10/2010, no
informed the interested party of the data processing.

It has been proven that in the communication of October 31, 2018, the
interested in the peculiarities of the processing of personal data at the headquarters of
money laundering.

Regarding the official status of the Notary Public and part of the Public Administration: It says

the website of the Ministry of Justice: “The Notary, once he obtains the title and takes
session of its Notary, will have in the district to which it corresponds the character of function-
public authority and authority in everything that affects the service of the notarial function, with
the rights granted for such purposes by the Law ”.

The OM Justice JUS / 484/2003 says: “… Notaries, Notaries Associations and the Con-
General Council of Notaries present specialties in relation to the exercise of

Moreover, the TCl says that notaries are part of the public function of the State. So,

The State is responsible for directing mandatory orders or instructions to
notaries or registrars, it being unquestionable that it is the State, through the

Law 3/2018 on the protection of personal data.

The initiation Agreement is erred by not respecting the regime provided for in article 77 of the Law

2/2018 especially in its section 2 when it says:

"When the managers or managers listed in section 1 commit any-
one of the offenses referred to in articles 72 to 74 of this organic law.
ca, the competent data protection authority shall issue a sanction resolution

warning them with warning. The resolution will also establish the
measures to be taken to stop the conduct or correct the effects of the
offense that was committed. The resolution will be notified to the person responsible or
charged with the treatment, to the body on which it depends hierarchically, where appropriate, and to
those affected who have the status of interested party, where appropriate ”.

The notary public official status and his integration into the
the State Administration and, therefore, we cannot accept the allusion, as it intimidates
toria, of the Commencement Agreement when it says that “This offense may be sanctioned with
a maximum fine of € 20,000,000… ”.

Fourth: That the Resolution of June 2, 2020, of the General Directorate of Seguri-
Legal entity and Public Faith, the Ministry of Justice notifies in the Official Gazette of the
date of June 8, 2020, the retirement of the notary (Doc No. 2).

brief of allegations, in which, in summary, it indicated the following:

complained person presents a brief of allegations, in which, among others, indicates:

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/8

1º.- On 08/07/18, the claimant went to the notarial office of A.A.A., to
request a copy of your house deed. According to the record, "by not
having the claimant's DNI scanned, it was considered appropriate to scan
in accordance with current legislation on money laundering ”. As stated in the
Claimant's announcement, “when asking the reason why the DNI was scanned, NO

received no adequate reply, informing him only that they would be in contact
with him to inform him conveniently ”.

2º.- According to the DPD's letter, the Notary Public contacted
with the claimant on 10/31/18, informing him of the special circumstances that
they have these treatments because they are subject to money laundering legislation.

In addition, it was indicated that, in the invoice for professional services delivered to the
clamoring, included the basic data of information on data protection by the
activity of the notarial office. From this date there were several exchanges of co-
electronic records between the claimant and the DPD of the Notary's Office, in relation to the
chos.

3.- The claimant responded to the DPD's answer one day later (11/01/18), at
the following terms:

months and a half plating, as well as the legitimation given that I have not been able to see
the need for the information required by law 15/2015, which was the reason

The joint assessment of the documentary evidence in the procedure brings to
knowledge of the AEPD, a vision of the denounced action that has been
reflected in the facts declared proven above related.

However, the following observations should be made:
The art. 32.3 of Law 10/2010, of April 28, on the prevention of money laundering

and the financing of terrorism, establishes that: “By virtue of the provisions of article
Article 24.1, and in relation to the obligations referred to in the previous section,

Obliged subjects will limit themselves to making the provisions of this article clear to you ”.

Well, when the claimant went to the Notary, on 08/07/18, to request a copy
of the deed of his apartment, and ask him for the ID for his scan, he asked the reasons for

which this act was now required, receiving no satisfactory answer, nor

DPD.

Therefore, although said article establishes that the duty to inform the interested party does not
It is applicable in relation to “the obligations referred to in section

above ”, that is, those related to the fulfillment of information obligations
provided for in Chapter III (which basically refer to cases in which there is
to communicate to SEPBLAC when there are indications of a possible case of money laundering
of capital or financing of terrorism), the right to information of art. 13 of
RGPD, it is completely applicable. Therefore, with that exception, you have the obligation

to provide all the information regarding the processing of personal data in
the moment to collect them from the interested parties.

Regarding the rights of citizens when they process their personal data, it says
recital 59) of the RGPD that: “(…) The data controller must be
obliged to respond to the interested party's requests without undue delay and no later than

“(60) The principles of fair and transparent treatment require that the interested party be informed

the existence of the processing operation and its purposes. The person responsible for
treatment must provide the interested party with any additional information necessary

tances and the specific context in which the personal data are processed (…) ”.

“(61) Interested parties should be provided with information on the processing of their data

In the present case, the collection of the claimant's personal data, me-

is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation applicable to the person responsible for the

treatment ”, such as compliance with the legislation on money laundering.
On the other hand, article 13.1.c) of the RGPD obliges the person responsible for the treatment of

the data to give the necessary information so that the interested party knows the purposes of the
treatment of the data and the legal basis for it: “c) the purposes of the treatment to which
the personal data and the legal basis of the treatment are destined ”.

But it is also that article 12 of the RGPD summons the person responsible for the treatment

of data to take the necessary measures to provide the interested party with the information indicated
