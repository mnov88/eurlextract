In addition, the Authority ordered the cameras to be uninstalled and any collected material deleted.

The transmission of the image of the persons in the range of the cameras on the projection screen of the computer of the manager of the company, who had the technical ability to display the complete image on the screen or to cover it by darkening the screen, at any time and with easy through a relevant setting from the logger, even if this setting required the assistance of the camera installer, constitutes the processing of personal data which violates the provisions of the GCP. Furthermore, the existence of only cameras in areas that have already been judged by the Authority Directive 1/2011 that the installation and operation of video surveillance systems, such as offices and restaurants, is prohibited, violates the rights of employees and violates the provisions of the GCC.
