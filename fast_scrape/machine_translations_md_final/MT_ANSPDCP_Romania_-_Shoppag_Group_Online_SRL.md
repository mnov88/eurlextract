Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in January 2025, an investigation at the operator SHOPBAG GROUP ONLINE SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 83 paragraph (5) letter e) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 9,949.8 lei (equivalent to 2,000 euros).

The investigation was initiated following the complaint of an individual who complained that he had not received a response to his requests to delete his account and the data associated with it from the site depozit-online.ro, owned by the operator. During the investigation, it was found that the petitioner wanted to delete his account created on the operator's website depozit-online.ro, but the operator did not respond to his request.

Also, the operator did not respond to the requests addressed by the National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data in the exercise of its investigative powers.

Thus, given that the operator did not provide the information that the National Supervisory Authority requested in order to fulfill its tasks, the operator was sanctioned with a minor offence fine, for violating the provisions of art. 83 para. (5) letter e) of Regulation (EU) 679/2016.

“Art. 83 General conditions for imposing administrative fines

(a) the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent, in accordance with Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;

At the same time, the operator was ordered to take the corrective measure of communicating to A.N.S.P.D.C.P all the information and documents requested through the addresses communicated to it.
