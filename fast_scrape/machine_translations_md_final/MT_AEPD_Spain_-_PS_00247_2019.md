He says that the head of Occupational Risk Prevention opened, scanned and
e-mailed her immediate boss, with a copy to her, the results of the
medical tests performed on him at a company sponsored examination and
not, as would have been correct, only the report issued by the Mutual with the conclusion
of fit or unfit for work. He adds that the Mutual had sent the company
claimed the result of his medical tests in a sealed envelope addressed to his
care and that their health data were also communicated to other persons in the
company as D.ª B.B.B.
The claimant explains that she has provided her services to the entity in question

send it to them online and they would send it in print to the company's headquarters and
social, in \*\*\*DIRECTION.1, indicating that it had been sent by mail on
29/10/2018 so it would be close to being received.
He explained that after the conversation with the Mutual he had sent an email to
his superior officer, D.C.C., to inform him that his medical exam was
to be received at the headquarters and ask him that, since he planned

The complainant states that on 05/11/2018, on the occasion of the visit that D.C.C.
made to the premises where she worked, she informed her that the
written medical report "but that another boss, B.B.B., already had the report of the fit
I had already gone up to the client's platform and didn't worry about it.
On 08/11/2018 reads an email received the day before sent by D. D.D.D.,
responsible for occupational hazards, to the head of the claimant, D.C.C., with a copy to her,
with which it attaches, in addition to the report of the applicant, the full result of the
medical examination photocopied and scanned in black and white.

The complainant claims that the medical information came in a sealed envelope to her
name with the indication that it was confidential and that D.D.D., after
scanned the results received, destroyed the document in which they were collected.
Attached to your claim are, among others, copies of the following documents:
- E-mail dated 05/11/2018 sent by Mr. D.D.D. "To"
prevention of occupational hazards, with a copy to the claimant, which states

with the complainant apologizing and informing her that the company has
made the necessary arrangements so that all the documentation sent is
eliminated and means have been put in place to ensure that this does not happen again.

Once the period of one month granted to evacuate the procedure has elapsed, the claimed
had not responded to the information request from the AEPD.
B. On 18 June 2009, having analysed the documentation in the file, the
The Director of the AEPD issued a resolution in the framework of E/ 7551/2019, in which she agreed
to admit the claim.
The claimant was notified of the settlement and, as a result of a
incident in the electronic management of notifications, also to the GLOBAL
BUSINESS TRAVEL SPAIN S.L.U., the claimed.
Article 65.4 of the LOPDGDD provides that "The decision on the admission or
inadmissibility, (...), must be notified to the claimant within three months".

was entitled to appeal the plea agreement.
The circumstances described above led the defendant to bring an action before

The Agency - as stated in resolution RR/120/2020 - chose to give
The applicant did not have the right to bring an action (ex
Article 112.1 of Law 39/2015 on Common Administrative Procedure, hereinafter
LPACAP). This Agency - having regard to the fact that it had been notified to the
the claimant's admission agreement and given that
the text of that agreement led to the erroneous interpretation that
was entitled to appeal - responded to the appeal made. The decision
The rejection of RR/120/2020 was notified to the respondent and the appellant on
11/05/2020 (date of acceptance of the electronic notification)
The appellant, now the respondent, has stated that the claimant spent the
medical examination before the Mutual on 15/09/2019 and informed his immediate boss,
C.C.C., who, given that the report would reach the company, "as soon as I received it, I
sent to Iberdrola (not to bring it to you, as the complaint says). Note that it was not
specified in the A.A.A. instructions how the shipment should be made, i.e., whether
by mail, email or other means, only to be sent to
Iberdrola".
He added that the report of the Mutua Valora arrived at the headquarters of the claimed entity
on 07/11/2019, by mail "in an envelope in the name of the entity" "so given the
emergency situation, as explained, the risk prevention manager
D.D.D., scanned it and sent it immediately, by email in the
chain of emails where the subject was being discussed and where it was, in addition to
A.A.A. ..., your immediate boss C.C.C."
The defendant has stated that after learning of the events he adopted several
measures: asked the people involved who might have had contact with the
file an explanation and immediate deletion of the information. The address of
HR of the entity requested information from the occupational risk prevention technician
who responded by email on 11/19/2018 a copy of which is provided. He adds that this
person, D.D.D.D. left the company on 26/03/2019 without specifying the reasons.
It also states that it requested information about the incident from D.C.C. employees and
D.ª B.B.B. and that the Technology Department proceeded to delete the
D.D.D. and Dª. C.C.C. terminals of the transmitted report.
The respondent annexed to its writ of appeal for reversal, among others
documents, the following emails:
- Sent by the claimant to D.C.C. on 11/05/2018:
"(...) I have contacted Valora prevención because I have received the email to
to ask you for a date for the medical examination when I did it in the past
October 15 (...). I am informed in Valora that ... the medical report is not

to \*\*\*DIRECTION.1 for my attention. I have been told that it was printed on
last October 29th so if he hasn't arrived yet he's about to
the office. I'll let you know in case it's delivered and if you can get it to me
to Iberdrola."
- Sent by D. D.D.D. on 09/11/2018: "(...) The full report on its

Barcelona and I accidentally scanned it and sent it to him without realizing that he was
responding to an email from C.C.C. instead of her alone..."

and to resolve this procedure.
II
Article 58 of the RGPD, "Powers", states:
"2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers
corrections indicated below:
(…)
(i) to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to or instead of
of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of the

III
Article 5 of the RGPD deals with the principles that should govern the
processing of personal data and mentions among them those of "integrity and
confidentiality":

Under Chapter IV, "Controller and person in charge of
treatment", the RGPD dedicates Article 32 to "Security of treatment" precept
that you have:

The violation of article 32 of the RGPD is typified in the article
83.4 in the following terms:
"Violations of the following provisions shall be sanctioned, in accordance
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 10,000,000 Eur or,
in the case of a company, for an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of
total annual turnover for the previous financial year, opting for
the largest:
(a) the obligations of the person responsible and of the person in charge under Articles
8,11,25 to 39, 42 and 43;"
For the purposes of the statute of limitations, Organic Law 3/2018 on Data Protection
Personal and Guaranteed Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) qualifies as an infringement
Article 73(f) "Failure to take such technical and
appropriate organizational arrangements to ensure a level of safety appropriate to the risk of

The conduct that is the subject of this complaint is specified in the opening
by an employee of the claimed entity - the head of Risk Prevention
Work - from the envelope containing the results of the medical tests carried out at
the claimant by the Mutual, which was allegedly directed to the attention of the
claimant; in scanning it and in communicating it by e-mail to other employees
of the company.
The documentation in the file provided by the claimant
corroborates that the claimant's medical report received from the
Mutua Valore was opened by D. D.D.D., scanned and emailed as

The claim does not show that the head of the Prevention of Occupational Risks would have
known the information that was included in the document.
In addition to the above, D. C.C.C., the head of the claimant, who
as demonstrated received an email from D. D.D.D. containing as a file

stated in the e-mail sent on 28/11/2018 that he only opened the page that
said that the claimant was fit to work on inplants and that the rest of the
document didn't get to look at it.
The Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the National Court has held
repeatedly in its resolutions, during the validity of the Organic Law
15/1999, on the protection of personal data (LOPD), that the violation of

disclosure of data to third parties, if this has not been done in a way
effective and has been proven - without the mere presumption being admissible - is not
possible to charge an infringement of this nature; infringement of the duty established by the
Article 10 of the repealed LOPD and which is now covered by Article 5(1)(f) of the
RGPD.
Therefore, at this stage of the proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the
There is no evidence to attribute to the Respondent, as alleged by the

The documentation in the file shows that the
The company had not implemented the criteria for action among its staff
with respect to private documents containing health data from the
employees. Furthermore, with the exception of the e-mail sent by D.C.C. at the end
November 2018, it seems that the company's personnel give the same treatment
to the report issued by the Mutual Insurance Company on fitness for work or unfitness for work
than the result of the medical tests the claimant underwent.
Article 32 of the RGPD obliges the controller to take measures to ensure that any person acting under his authority and having access
a personal data may only be processed on the instructions of the person responsible. These instructions must be based on a prior assessment by the
risk involved in each of the processing operations carried out to ensure the security of the data. This is particularly the case when the data is requested, in compliance with the

In order to specify the amount of the administrative fine that would correspond
The provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD must be complied with,
precepts that they point out:

With respect to section 83.2 (k) of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, section 76,
"Sanctions and corrective measures," he says:
"In accordance with Article 83(2)(k) of the Regulation (EU)

Aggravating circumstances are taken into account
next:
- Article 83(2)(f) of the GPRS which refers to the "extent of cooperation with the
authority in order to remedy the infringement and to mitigate the possible
adverse effects". Let us recall that the respondent did not respond to the request

that it is established that service of the application has been properly effected

- Article 83(2)(g) of the GPRS on categories of character data

- The obvious link between the business activity of the respondent and the
processing of personal data, not only of its employees but also of persons

the company (Article 83.2.k of the RGPD in relation to Article 76.2.b of the

The following circumstances would apply as mitigating factors:

taking into account, among other variables, the purpose of the processing operation and
the level of damages that the affected person has suffered. The purpose of the operation
