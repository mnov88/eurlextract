IV
In this case, a claim filed by a woman before the Civil Guard is revealed, upon learning on April 20, 2022 that a minor had used the image of her son, a minor under 13 years of age, for the creation of a fake profile on Instagram.
The investigative actions carried out by this Agency have made it possible to verify that the profile reported used as a profile the photograph of the minor subject of this claim, it was created on February 4, 2022 at 10:39 p.m. Spanish time (8:39 p.m. UTC time ), and was available until at least April 22, 2022.
Both the creation of the profile and the subsequent login were carried out from two IP addresses assigned by the operator to the father of the minor who created the false profile, whose personal data are:
· NAME AND SURNAME: A.A.A.
· DNI: \*\*\*NIF.1
· ADDRESS: \*\*\*ADDRESS.1
In his allegations, the father of the minor who used the photo of another minor as his Instagram profile, acknowledges the facts, and limits himself to stating that the violation only lasted a few hours.
In relation to the use of photographic content, it is worth mentioning STS 363/2017, of February 15, which indicates the following:
“... that, in the account opened on a social network on the Internet, the owner of the profile has “uploaded” a photograph of himself that is accessible to the general public, does not authorize a third party to reproduce it in a media without the consent of the owner because such action cannot be considered a natural consequence of the accessible nature of the data and images of a public profile on a social network on the Internet. The purpose of an account opened on a social network on the Internet is the communication of its owner with third parties and the possibility that these third parties may have access to the
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es
 
content of that account and interact with its owner, but not that the image of the owner of that account can be published in a media.
\[...\] The consent of the owner of the image so that the general public, or a certain number of people, can see his photograph on a blog or in an account opened on the website of a social network does not entail authorization to make use of that photograph and publish or disseminate it in a different way.”
It must also be taken into account that in accordance with article 1903 of the civil code, which provides that: "Parents are responsible for damages caused by children who are under their custody...", the denounced party is responsible for the actions of their minor child who was subject to the parental authority of their parents on the date of the events, since whoever holds parental authority has the obligation to monitor what their minor children do and are responsible for non-compliance or poor compliance with this duty, as stated by the TS in its ruling of May 4, 1984, which declared:
"Given the complexity of modern life and its consequent increase in risk, the tendency to make those who create them responsible for the damages derived from these risks is evident, and in this sense the parent or caregiver of a minor is responsible for the damages that he causes to third parties, since with his lack of care he created the risk of harmful conduct of the minor translated into effective and real damage and must, therefore, compensate him, unless he proves that he has used the diligence required by the Law, which is not the case. occurred in the case discussed."
In this case there is also no evidence that the accused party, the father of the minor who posted the photograph of another minor, has complied with his duty of care, which makes his responsibility clear.
In this order of ideas, it must be specified that the minor responsible for the events was 13 years old when they occurred, so the provision of article 52.4 of Organic Law 8/2021, of June 4, on protection is not applicable. integral to childhood and adolescence in the face of violence, which provides that "Persons over fourteen years of age may be sanctioned for acts constituting an administrative offense in accordance with the regulations on the protection of personal data", therefore the defendant is responsible for the infraction, since as the holder of parental authority he must comply with the duty of care and supervision of his child, which includes, for what is of interest here, the supervision of the use given to technological elements.
Therefore, this Agency, after having verified that the minor son of the accused party has used the photograph of a third party to create a false profile on Instagram, without his consent, it must be indicated that in accordance with the legal argument indicated On the above legal grounds, data processing has been carried out without legitimacy, since the contrary has not been proven by the accused party, and therefore it is considered that the accused party may have incurred a violation of article 6. of the GDPR.
In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD must be observed, precepts that indicate:

When deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account will be taken of:

j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved under Article 42, and
k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits obtained or the losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.”
Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76, “Sanctions and corrective measures”, provides:
"2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account:
a) The continuous nature of the infringement.
b) The linking of the offender's activity with the processing of personal data.
c) The benefits obtained as a consequence of the commission of the infraction.

h) The submission by the person responsible or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which there are disputes between them and any interested party.”

o Seriousness of the facts, since the image is used in a profile with images of sexual content.
o Type of data processed, since it affects a minor.
o Intentionality in action.
The sanction to be imposed on the accused party should be graduated and set at the amount of €10,000 in accordance with article 58.2 of the RGPD.

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
