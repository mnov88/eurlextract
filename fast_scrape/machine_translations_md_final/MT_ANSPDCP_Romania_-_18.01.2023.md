Penalty for GDPR violation

In December 2022, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator Dante International SA and found a violation of the provisions of art. 17 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was penalized for contravention with a fine of 4,918.6 lei (equivalent to 1000 EURO).

The investigation was started as a result of a notification sent by a concerned person, complaining that the operator Dante International SA, the owner of emag.ro, violated the right to delete personal data.

During the investigation carried out, it was found that the operator sent an SMS to the phone number of the person in question informing him about the company's commercial offers, although he had previously requested the deletion of the account and irrelevant data.

The National Supervisory Authority found that the operator Dante International SA did not adopt all the necessary measures to comply with the data subject's request to delete his personal data, so that he continued to process his data by sending unsolicited commercial messages.

At the same time, as part of the investigation, the operator was also given the corrective measure to take technical and organizational measures in order to ensure that it effectively responds to requests that exercise the rights of the data subjects provided for by Regulation (EU) 2016/679, including regarding the right to erasure.
