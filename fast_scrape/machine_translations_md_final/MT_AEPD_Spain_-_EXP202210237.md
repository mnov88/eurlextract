 On the other hand, article 4 of the GDPR, Definitions, in its sections 1, 2 and 11,
notes that:

       “1) “personal data” means any information about an identified natural person
       or identifiable ("the data subject"); Any identifiable natural person shall be considered
       person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in
       by means of an identifier, such as a name, a number

       elements of physical, physiological, genetic, psychological,

       economic, cultural or social of said person; “

       about personal data or sets of personal data, either by
       automated procedures or not, such as the collection, registration, organization,

       structuring, conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation,

In the present case, the DGT, as data controller, processed

the personal data of the claiming party, by registering their name in the Registry
General de Vehículos a vehicle, although it cannot be affirmed that said treatment is
carried out without legitimacy for it, as claimed by the claimant, since,
as established by Royal Decree 2822/1998, of December 23, by which
approves the General Regulation of Vehicles in its article 32:

       "1. Any natural or legal person who owns a vehicle registered

       section 2.c and 28, section 2 of this Regulation, for the registration of
       Vehicles will be accompanied by the following documents:

       photocopies of the same that the interested parties or their representatives must
       provide at the time of submitting your application, provided they are
       duly collated by the records of the bodies in which the
       submitted the corresponding application, in accordance with the provisions of the

       Article 38.4 a) and b) of Law 30/1992, of November 26, on the
       Legal of Public Administrations and Administrative Procedure
       Common, without prejudice to the possibility of exercising this function by
       a Collegiate Administrative Manager in the terms determined in the
       agreements that can be established with the Associations of Managers
       Administrative.

       Municipal, will be signed by the Head of the Agency or Entity to which
       belongs to the vehicle or person to whom it delegates, accompanied by the
       required documentation."

Bearing in mind that the Provincial Traffic Headquarters of Valencia presented
a request for notification of sale of the vehicle, which was accompanied by the

documentation required in the General Vehicle Regulations to carry out said
procedure, including a sales contract where the seller is identified
and the buyer, it cannot be affirmed that the DGT has incurred in an illegitimate treatment
of data of the claimant, since the registration in the Vehicle Registry
is carried out in compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the person responsible for the
treatment, and, likewise, based on the execution of a contract in which the

interested is part.

                                          II

The complaining party adds that the DGT did not act with due diligence as it had not
verified if the identification of the complaining party was correctly carried out.
However, having analyzed in the previous section the articles of the Regulation of

Vehicles applicable to the notification of sale, it must be concluded that, in the notification
of sale, the aforementioned legal text does not require verification and collation of signatures, given
also note that it is not necessary for the buyer and the seller to meet
at the same time at the Traffic Headquarters, since according to Annex XIV of the
aforementioned Regulation, with regard to the figure of the acquirer:

       "B) Obligations of the purchaser:
       In accordance with the provisions of article 32, section 3 of this Regulation,
       the purchaser of a vehicle must, within thirty days from the date

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/10

       of its acquisition, request from the Traffic Department the renewal of the permit or
       driving license, presenting the following documents:
       1st Application in official model form that will be provided by the Traffic Headquarters,

       in which the identity and address of the transferor and acquirer is stated.
       2nd Rate or rates for the legally established amount.
       3rd The documents that on the identity and representation are specified in
       section A, numbers 1 and 3 of annex XIII, on registration.
       4th technical inspection card or certificate of characteristics, with
       valid recognition.

       5th Original of the self-assessment of the Transfer Tax
       Patrimonial and Documented Legal Acts, or proof of the exemption or
       not subject to it, and photocopy.
       6th Self-assessment of the Special Tax on Certain Means of
       Transportation or justification of non-subjection or exemption in cases of

       transmission of a vehicle before four years have elapsed since its
       first definitive registration with exemption or non-subjection.
       7th Form of registration in the Tax on Mechanical Traction Vehicles.
       8th Original and photocopy of proof of payment or exemption from Tax on
       Mechanical Traction Vehicles, in the event that the transferor has not
       fulfilled the obligation to notify the transmission provided for in article 32,

       section 1 of this Regulation.
       9th Document proving the acquisition, except in the case that the seller
       and the buyer submit their applications jointly.”

Therefore, lack of diligence cannot be imputed, beyond the verification that

Provide all the documentation required in the Vehicle Regulations to carry out the
corresponding procedure. If the documentation presented is fraudulent, you do not have the
acting official capacity or possibility of verifying it.

                                           IV.

Therefore, based on what is indicated in the previous paragraphs, no
Evidence proving the existence of an infringement in the area of competence of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Thus, in accordance with what has been indicated, by the Director of the Spanish Agency for

Data Protection,
