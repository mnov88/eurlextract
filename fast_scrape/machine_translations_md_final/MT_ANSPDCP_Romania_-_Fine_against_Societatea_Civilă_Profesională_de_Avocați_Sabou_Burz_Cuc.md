The operator of the Professional Civil Law Firm “Sabou, Burz & Cuc” was sanctioned with a fine of 4946 lei, the equivalent of 1,000 EURO.

The investigation was initiated following a complaint requesting the disclosure by the operator of the personal data of a petitioner (customer of the operator) without his consent and prior information, by posting an address received by him from a public institution on a group of WhatsApp used by lawyers of a bar.

The investigation found that the Professional Civil Law Firm "Sabou, Burz & Cuc" disclosed the personal data of the data subject (name, surname, home address, information regarding a case pending before a court) on a WhatsApp group consisting of 247 members, without legal basis, excessively and incompatible with the initial purpose of their collection, as well as without the adoption of technical and organizational measures to maintain the confidentiality of these data, thus violating the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) lit. a), b), c), f) and par. (2), as well as of art. 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

At the same time, the following corrective measures were applied to the operator:
