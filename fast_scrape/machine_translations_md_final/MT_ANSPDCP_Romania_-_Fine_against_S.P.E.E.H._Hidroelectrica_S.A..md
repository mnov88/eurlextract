Sanction for violating RGPD & # 13;
& # 13;
On 01.10.2021, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the S.P.E.E.H. Hidroelectrica S.A. and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the General Regulation on Data Protection (RGPD), as well as the violation of the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) lit. a) and of art. 6 para. (1) of the RGPD. & # 13;
The S.P.E.E.H. Hidroelectrica S.A. was fined as follows: & # 13;
- fine in the amount of 24,739.50 lei, the equivalent of 5,000 EURO, for violating the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the RGPD; & # 13;
- warning, for violating the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) lit. a) and of art. 6 para. (1) of the RGPD. & # 13;
The investigation was initiated as a result of the transmission by the operator of several notifications of personal data breach. & # 13;
The national supervisory authority found that the operator did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented by the processing. & # 13;
This situation has led to the access or illicit disclosure to erroneous recipients of the personal data of a number of 325 individuals. & # 13;
Also, the operator processed the personal data of 3 individuals, own customers, after exercising the right to delete data and withdrawing consent for data processing by them. Thus, the processing was performed without the existence of one of the legal grounds provided by art. 6 para. (1) of the RGPD, although the operator had the obligation to process the data legally, fairly and transparently to the data subject. & # 13;
At the same time, the following corrective measures were applied to the operator: & # 13;
- reviewing and updating the technical and organizational measures implemented following the risk assessment for the rights and freedoms of individuals, including working procedures on the protection of personal data, and the implementation of measures on the regular training of persons acting under its authority, regarding the obligations incumbent on them according to the provisions of the RGPD, including regarding the risks involved in the processing of personal data, depending on the specifics of the activity; & # 13;
- identifying and implementing measures to ensure that the personal data processed are accurate and up-to-date, taking into account the purposes for which they are processed, including the record of the exercise by data subjects of the right to the deletion of personal data. & # 13;
