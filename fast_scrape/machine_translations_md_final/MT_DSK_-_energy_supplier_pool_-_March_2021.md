The "energy supplier pool" must not lead to transparent consumers
of 15 March 2021

Credit agencies and energy suppliers are considering creating a so-called energy supplier pool. In this central data pool, positive data of customers should also be stored and transmitted to other energy suppliers. Positive data is data on contracts where the customers do not give cause for complaint, i.e. they behave in accordance with the contract.

Information on the number of contracts concluded and the respective contract duration can indicate whether consumers intend to have a longer contractual relationship with an electricity supplier or regularly use offers for new customers. Consumers who regularly choose the cheapest offer on the market and want to switch suppliers could then be excluded by utilities when they have attractive offers.

However, every citizen has the right to take advantage of the competition between energy suppliers and to look for cheap offers on the market. The desire to record alleged "bargain hunters" in a central data pool in order to be able to identify them as such when initiating a contract and, if necessary, to exclude them from offers, does not constitute a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f) of the GDPR. It was precisely the aim of the legislator to enable effective and undistorted competition in the supply of electricity and gas by liberalising the energy market. The attempt to identify price-conscious consumers who are willing to switch and to exclude them from certain offers, if necessary, would run counter to this objective.

Even if the interests of the companies were to be considered legitimate, the interests and fundamental rights of the customers worthy of protection outweigh them in such cases. Consumers who are in compliance with the contract have the right to expect that their data will not be processed beyond the purpose of the contract, which may limit their ability to operate freely in the market. 

The storage and transmission of positive data by an energy supplier pool would contribute significantly to transparent consumers and would be illegal according to Art. 6(1) sentence 1 lit. f) DS-GVO.
