       i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition or in

       instead of the measures mentioned in this section, according to the
       circumstances of each particular case;
       (…) "

       Article 5 of the RGPD establishes the principles that must govern the treatment
of personal data and mentions among them that of "integrity and confidentiality".

       The aforementioned article points out that:

       "1. The personal data will be:

       (…)
       f) treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate security of the
       personal data, including protection against unauthorized processing or
       illicit and against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application
       appropriate technical or organizational measures ('integrity and
       confidentiality »)”.

       (…) "

                                           IV
       The denounced events materialize in the abandonment of documentation in
the public thoroughfare in which personal data corresponding to the claimed person appears,

violating the regulations on data protection.

       The security of personal data is regulated in articles 32, 33 and
34 of the GDPR.

       Article 32 of the RGPD "Security of treatment", establishes that:

       "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for people's rights and freedoms
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical measures and

appropriate organizational arrangements to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,
that in your case include, among others:

       a) pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;
       b) the ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability and

       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
       c) the ability to restore availability and access to data
       personnel quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
       d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness
       of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the safety of the

       treatment.

       2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particularly the
take into account the risks presented by the data processing, in particular as

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/10

consequence of accidental or illegal destruction, loss or alteration of data
personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to such data.

       3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved in accordance with article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the
this article.

       4. The person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to
ensure that any person acting under the authority of the controller or the
manager and have access to personal data can only process said data
following the instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so under the
Law of the Union or of the Member States ”.

       The violation of article 32 is classified in article 83.4.a) of the
cited GDPR in the following terms:

       "4. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 10 000 000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

       a) the obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to articles 8,

       11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43.
       (…) "

       For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 71, Infractions, states that:
“The acts and conducts referred to in sections 4, constitute offenses.

5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those resulting
contrary to the present organic law ”.

       And in its article 73, for the purposes of prescription, it qualifies as "Infractions
considered serious ”:

       "Based on the provisions of article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
are considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

       (…)
       g) The breach, as a consequence of the lack of due diligence,
       of the technical and organizational measures that have been implemented in accordance with
       as required by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ”.
       (…)

       The facts revealed in this claim are specified in
the existence of a security incident in the complainant's systems, making it possible to
its vulnerability by allowing documentation containing data from

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/10

personal character, were abandoned, allowing access to the data contained
in them.

                                           V
       The GDPR defines personal data security breaches as
“All those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or
accidental or illegal alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or processed
otherwise, or unauthorized communication or access to said data ”.

       From the documentation in the file there are evident indications of
that the complainant has violated article 32.1 of the RGPD, due to a breach of
security in their systems allowing access to personal data
contained in documents that were abandoned by the defendant with possible
violation of security measures.

       It should be noted that the RGPD in the aforementioned precept does not establish a list of
the security measures that are applicable according to the data that are
object of treatment, but establishes that the controller and the person in charge of the
treatment will apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk
involved in the treatment, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of

application, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, the risks of
probability and seriousness for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.

Likewise, the security measures must be adequate and proportionate to the
risk detected, noting that the determination of the technical measures and

organizational must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymisation and encryption,
ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience, the
ability to restore availability and access to data after an incident, process
verification (not audit), evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of
measures.

       In any case, when evaluating the adequacy of the security level, the
particularly take into account the risks presented by data processing, such as
consequence of accidental or illegal destruction, loss or alteration of data
personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data and that could cause damages

physical, material or immaterial.

       In this same sense, recital 83 of the RGPD states that:

       “(83) In order to maintain security and prevent the treatment from infringing the

provided in this Regulation, the person in charge or the person in charge must evaluate
the risks inherent to the treatment and apply measures to mitigate them, such as the
encryption. These measures must guarantee an adequate level of security, including the
confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of its application
with respect to the risks and the nature of the personal data that must

protect yourself. When assessing risk in relation to data security, you should
take into account the risks arising from the processing of personal data,
such as accidental or illegal destruction, loss or alteration of personal data
transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or communication or access does not

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/10

authorized to said data, susceptible in particular to cause damages
physical, material or immaterial ”.

       In the present case, as stated in the facts and in the framework of the
investigation file E / 07635/2020, the AEPD transferred to the complainant the
09/28/2020 the written claim submitted for analysis requesting the
provision of information related to the incident claimed, without having
received in this body any response.

       Responsibility of the claimed person is determined by the incident / bankruptcy
of security revealed by the Navarra Provincial Police, since it is
responsible for making decisions aimed at effectively implementing the
appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security
appropriate to the risk to ensure the confidentiality of the data, restoring its

availability and prevent access to them in the event of a physical or technical incident.
However, the documentation provided shows that the entity has not only
breached this obligation, but also the adoption of measures is unknown
respect, despite having given notice of the claim presented.

       In accordance with the foregoing, it is estimated that the claimed would be

allegedly responsible for the violation of the RGPD: the violation of article 32.1,
offense typified in its article 83.4.a).

                                           SAW

       In order to establish the administrative fine to be imposed, they must
observe the provisions contained in articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, which
they point out:

       "1. Each supervisory authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines

       b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

        f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to establish

        g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
        h) the way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement, in
        particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infraction and, in such case,
        what extent;
        i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been

Article 76, “Sanctions and corrective measures”, establishes that:

        "two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU)
2016/679 may also be taken into account:

        cases in which there are controversies between those and any
        interested."

        - In accordance with the transcribed precepts, in order to establish the amount
of the sanction of a fine to be imposed in the present case for the offense typified in the

Article 83.4.a) of the RGPD for which the claimed person is responsible, they are considered
concurrent the following factors:

        The merely local scope of the treatment carried out by the claimed person.

        The nature and severity of the offending conduct as the documentation
        Abandoned affects the personal data of many people.
