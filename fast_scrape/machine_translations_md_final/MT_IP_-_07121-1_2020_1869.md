On the basis of the information you have provided us, in accordance with Article 58 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (hereinafter: the General Regulation), point 7 of the first paragraph of Article 49 of the Personal Data Protection Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 94/07-UPB1, hereinafter: ZVOP-1) and 2 According to Article of the Information Commissioner Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 113/05, hereinafter: ZInfP), we provide our non-binding opinion regarding your questions.

The Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act requires the collection of certain data from politically exposed persons. In this part, this Act provides an appropriate legal basis for obtaining statutory personal data from individuals identified by banks as politically exposed persons and their immediate family members in accordance with Article 6, paragraph 1 (c) of the General Data Protection Regulation. . The condition for this is that the bank has established appropriate procedures and risk management systems (within which it performs a risk assessment, on the basis of which it obtains data from the individual). However, IP is not competent to assess the adequacy of these procedures and other aspects of the content of bank conditions, which the latter base on the requirements of ZPPDFT-1. This is being judged by other bodies. 

Justification:

In the first paragraph of Article 61, the said law obliges banks (and other taxpayers) to establish an appropriate risk management system, which also includes a procedure for determining whether a party or its legal representative or proxy is a politically exposed person. The procedure based on the risk assessment referred to in Article 13 of ZPPDFT-1 shall be determined by the liable parties in their internal act, taking into account the guidelines of the competent supervisory body referred to in Article 139 of this Act.

In the second paragraph of Article 61, ZPPDFT-1 defines as a politically exposed person any natural person who acts or has acted in a prominent public position in a Member State or a third country in the last year, including his immediate family members (among whom according to the fourth paragraph of the same the spouse or common-law partner, parents and children and their spouses or common-law partners) and close associates.

The Information Commissioner is not responsible for supervising and advising banks in setting up internal systems and procedures related to politically exposed persons, so we suggest that you seek an opinion on the adequacy of risk assessment procedures and systems and, consequently, the content of the bank's conditions. services for politically exposed persons, you should first contact the Office for the Prevention of Money Laundering and the Bank of Slovenia, which are responsible for guiding banks in the preparation of such internal systems, procedures and acts
 

The lawful processing of personal data in accordance with point (c) of the first paragraph of Article 6 of the General Regulation is, inter alia, the processing necessary to fulfill the legal obligation applicable to the controller. Therefore, obtaining legally required information on the assets and origin of assets and assets that are the subject of a business relationship or transaction is permissible for an individual identified as a politically exposed person and his or her immediate family members, provided that the information is they are defined by the provision of the sixth paragraph of Article 61 of ZPPDFT-1. Namely, the mentioned provision of the law creates an appropriate legal basis for obtaining the stated personal data on the mentioned persons, assuming that the bank has established appropriate procedures and a risk management system - within which it then performs a risk assessment, on the basis of which it obtains data from the individual - which the IP is not competent to judge. In any case, when the controller (bank) obtains personal data from an individual on a legal basis, he is obliged to present to him certain information on processing and reasons for processing (including purposes and legal basis) in accordance with Article 13 of the General Regulation. .
