A warning is sent to the CANARY HEALTH SERVICE, with NIF

Q8555011I, for each of the two violations committed, one for the violation of the
article 5.1.f) of the RGPD and another for the violation of article 32 of the RGPD, classified
both in article 83.5 of the RGPD.

THIRTEENTH: On June 9, 2923, the following were received
allegations by the claimed entity in response to the proposal
resolution:

“1º.- Taking into account the provisions of art. 5.1 of the GDPR, it is determined that the data

will be f) processed in such a way as to ensure adequate data security
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against
its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of technical measures

or organizational measures ("integrity and confidentiality"), it is considered that what

is being stated is that the SCS does not process data that guarantees the
application of the principles included in the aforementioned precept, not being

agree with this extreme.

Taking into account the type of services that the SCS provides to users, and so that the
health care is as comprehensive and complete as possible, there is a history

electronic clinic (hereinafter HC) that professionals can access
healthcare, through username and password, and whose access logs are recorded.
Currently and due to the activity of the SCS, it is not technically feasible to restrict the

access to users' HC only to those health workers who are providing
assistance at the exact moment to patients, since various situations can occur.
cases in which it is necessary to access specialties, or requested tests and

reviewed by another professional or center or that during assistance you have to
make a referral to another professional.

However, in the interest of exercising proactive responsibility, the SCS is
preparing an instruction to try to limit access to the
HC, starting from the previously stated premise that it is not possible to have

restricted access to the HC to guarantee the agility with which they must be developed
assistance benefits.

In this new instruction from the SCS Directorate, indications are being given to

implement justification of accesses to the HC when, for example, it is not a user
belonging to the professional's quota or is not being attended to by him in
emergencies or in some specialty (the latest draft of the instruction for

accesses to the HC as Doc. 1), as the claimant requested from a colleague
to know test statuses or try to expedite administrative procedures.

Apart from this, the SCS carries out awareness-raising and training work.

to staff and an update to the previous
Instruction 4/2010, Instruction No. 6/2023 of the Director of the Canarian Service of the
Health, related to the processing of personal data carried out by the staff of the

Canarian Health Service, in the performance of their job, which has been
disseminated among the staff and is accessible on the intranet (it is attached as

Doc. 2).

Therefore, it is not considered appropriate to affirm that

a) The processing of personal data is being carried out in violation of the principles and
guarantees established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, since the

responsible for the treatment, the SCS, has adopted measures to guarantee the
confidentiality of the data contained in the electronic HC, with various notices to the

start the session, raising awareness among staff about the need to maintain
confidentiality and access to those strictly essential for the development of
their functions, etc., measures that are also currently being reinforced with the

new Instruction for Access to the HC in the process of approval.
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/21

According to the AEPD, the claimant affirms that the health information related to her
person has been disclosed to third parties by the professionals who accessed their HC, if

Well, this fact is not proven beyond the assertion on the part and without
verification of this fact by professionals when requested in the
directed audit that was carried out on them, so said statement is not proven and

should not be taken into consideration.

2nd.- On the other hand, sanctions are imposed for non-compliance with article 32, which determines that
"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the

nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for people's rights and freedoms
physical, the person responsible and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and

appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which, where appropriate, includes, among others: \[…\]

b) the ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience
permanent treatment systems and services;”

Well, the SCS has been implementing the security measures that have been

as one of the threats present in any treatment; applying the
timely countermeasures to mitigate said risk that, to date, have proven

effective, although with this specific case it has been shown that they are not infallible.

Therefore, determine that technical and organizational measures have not been applied to
guarantee the confidentiality of the information and sanction for it, it is considered

excessive, since if measures have been established based on the risks analyzed,
although, as indicated above, they have been shown to be not invulnerable.
Being aware that there is no such thing as absolute security, the SCS has been adopting

security measures and carrying out awareness-raising tasks for its staff that have
has been demonstrating its effectiveness until this particular case, among others, with the publication
of Instruction 6/20PS/00587/2021, a PS open to the MADRID SERVICE OF

HEALTH.

23 and the development of a new instruction for access to HC by staff
of the SCS.

3º.- A double sanction is applied for the same act, whenever it is proposed
sanction as very serious the violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD and as serious the
violation of article 32 of the RGPD, among whose measures is already guaranteeing

the confidentiality of the information, which is why the sanction of the
alleged act committed.

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/21

For all the above, and considering that it is an isolated event that occurred
from the good faith of health professionals to help in the recovery of their

companion, that reinforcement measures are being taken to guarantee in
confidentiality of the information to a greater extent, WE REQUEST the archiving of the
performances.”

The processing of data from medical records is regulated in the Law

41/2002, of November 14, basic regulation of patient autonomy and
rights and obligations regarding clinical information and documentation.

Its article 3 states:

“Clinical history: the set of documents that contain the data, evaluations and

information of any kind about the situation and clinical evolution of a
patient throughout the care process.”

In article 16, the uses of medical history are established:

"1. The clinical history is an instrument designed fundamentally to guarantee
adequate patient care. The care professionals at the center who
perform the diagnosis or treatment of the patient have access to the medical history
of this as a fundamental instrument for their adequate assistance.

2. Each center will establish the methods that enable access to

the medical history of each patient by the professionals who assist them.”

                                            IV

The principles relating to the processing of personal data are regulated in the

Article 5 of the RGPD which establishes that “personal data will be:

“a) treated in a lawful, fair and transparent manner in relation to the interested party (“legality,
loyalty and transparency»);

b) collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be processed
subsequently in a manner incompatible with said purposes; according to article 89,
section 1, the further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in
public interest, scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes are not
considered incompatible with the initial purposes ("purpose limitation");

c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are processed ("data minimization");

d) accurate and, if necessary, updated; all measures will be taken

paragraph 1 and able to demonstrate it (“proactive responsibility”).”

                                            V

In the present case, a claim is filed for improper access to the history
clinic and the disclosure to third parties of the diagnosis of the complaining party.
In relation to improper access, the entity has provided:

 Report issued by the Security Office (ODS) of the Services Area
    Electromedical and Information (ASEI) on the audit prepared by the

    accesses made by Primary Care and Specialized Care in Hospital
    General of Fuerteventura in which it is revealed that the accesses were
    carried out by ten professionals, of which two of them accessed the
    history to be interested in the state of health of the claimant since the
    identified on the emergency list since he is a professional in the Area of
    Anesthesia and Resuscitation (FEA).

 There is no evidence that the claimant has made a claim to the ODS.

In relation to the Safety of the treatments, the entity has provided

 Security Policy, whose approval resolution was published in the Bulletin
    Official of the Canary Islands dated February 13, 2014.

 Instruction 04/2010 of the Director of the CANARY HEALTH SERVICE, regarding

    of security.

 Risk Analysis which includes the treatments related to the Clinical History
    defined as Critical and state that security measures are applied
    provided for in the National Security Scheme.

As indicated in the legal basis III, from the reading of article 16
of Law 41/2002, of November 14, basic regulation of the autonomy of the
patient and rights and obligations regarding information and documentation
clinic it is clearly inferred that, although the clinical history is the instrument to

provide healthcare to the patient, which must be properly
guaranteed, so is the fact that access to the

clinical history by the professionals who assist you, not in general terms, but with
particular character carrying out the diagnosis or treatment of the patient.

Despite the technical and organizational measures implemented, it has not prevented access to
the clinical history of a patient, by third parties, which denotes the absence of measures

that ensure adequate security of personal data, including the protection
against unauthorized or illicit treatment and against its loss, destruction or accidental damage.
incidental, through the application of appropriate technical or organizational measures.

And regarding the principle of data protection by design, the GDPR requires in its
article 25:

“of this Regulation and protect the rights of the interested parties.”

Therefore, it is considered that such events represent a violation of the
confidentiality, and thereby contravenes article 5.1 f) of the GDPR, which governs the principle

of integrity and confidentiality, since there have been improper accesses to the
medical history, losing the health data that it contains
confidentiality, by allowing access by third parties who were not legitimate to
it.

The AEPD's criteria in relation to this type of unauthorized access has a
clear precedent, produced in a sanctioning procedure processed after the entry
in force of the GDPR. This is file reference PS/00250/2021, in which

sanctioned the EXTREMEÑO HEALTH SERVICE for a problem identical to the one that
occupies in this file. In the narration of the events it appears:

“Inspection actions begin upon receipt of a written notice of
A.A.A. claim (hereinafter, the claimant), in which he states that
improper access to his medical history by a worker at the

Extremadura Health Service (hereinafter SES), with professional category of
nurse. The accesses are made without the authorization of the claimant and without any mediation
a relationship that justifies it.”

Therefore, this Agency considers that the reported facts consisting of the

disclosure of the claimant's medical data to unauthorized persons constitutes
a violation of article 5.1.f) of the GDPR

                                            SAW

The violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD implies the commission of the violations

typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD that under the heading “General conditions
for the imposition of administrative fines” provides:

“Infringements of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20 000 000 or,
In the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the

global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

   a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
   consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; (…)”

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72.1 a) of the LOPDGDD states that “in
Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that involve
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees

                                           VII

On the other hand, security in the processing of personal data is regulated in the
article 32 of the RGPD which establishes the following:

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the nature
za, the scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as probability risks

and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the responsibility
sable and the person in charge of the treatment will apply appropriate technical and organizational measures.

measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, which, where appropriate, includes
already, among others:

a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
b) the ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience

permanent treatment systems and services;
c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data of

d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the
technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the treatment.

2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration will be given to

4. The controller and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to ensure that
any person acting under the authority of the person in charge or in charge and having
ga access to personal data can only process said data following instructions

of the controller, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of Union law or
Member States.”

Recital 75 of the GDPR lists a series of factors or assumptions associated with
risks to the guarantees of the rights and freedoms of the interested parties:

“The risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of seriousness and
variable probability, may be due to data processing that could cause

physical, material or immaterial damages, particularly in cases where
that the treatment may give rise to problems of discrimination, usurpation of
identity or fraud, financial loss, reputational damage, loss of

confidentiality of data subject to professional secrecy, unauthorized reversal of the
pseudonymization or any other significant economic or social harm; in the
cases in which the interested parties are deprived of their rights and freedoms or are

use personal profiles; in cases in which personal data of
vulnerable people, particularly children; or in cases where the treatment

involves a large amount of personal data and affects a large number of
interested.”

The violation of article 32 of the RGPD implies the commission of the violations
typified in article 83.4 of the RGPD that under the heading “General conditions
for the imposition of administrative fines” provides:

“Infringements of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10 000 000 or,

In the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the

the largest amount:

    a) the obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to Articles 8,

    11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43; (…)”

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 73.g) of the LOPDGDD, under the heading
“Infringements considered serious provide:

“Based on article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, they will be considered serious and

Infractions that involve a substantial violation will expire after two years.
of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following:

g) The breach, as a consequence of the lack of due diligence, of the
technical and organizational measures that have been implemented as required

by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

                                          VIII

In this case, this Agency has verified that the security measures of the

claimed entity are not adequate, which constitutes on the part of the entity
claimed, violation of the provisions of article 32 of the RGPD.

The lack of adoption of measures to guarantee the principle of confidentiality makes
that it cannot be considered that there are measures that provide a level of protection
appropriate to the existing risks, this is because the Security policy

established is based on a resolution dated February 13, 2014, a
Instruction of the year 2010 dictated by the Director of the CANARY SERVICE OF THE
HEALTH, and a Decree 178/2005, of July 26, which approves the Regulation
that regulates the clinical history in hospital centers and establishments and establishes
the content, conservation and purge of your documents, all of them are standards

prior to the current regulations on data protection, the axis of which is based on
GDPR 2016/679, effective May 25, 2018.

Therefore, by not adopting the necessary security measures to guarantee the
protection of personal data of patients of this service

health, it is considered that article 32 of the RGPD has been violated.

                                          IX

In conclusion, it must be noted that in accordance with the evidence from which
provides, it is considered that the claimed entity has processed personal data of the
claimant, his medical history and diagnosis, allowing access without adopting the
appropriate technical or organizational measures, which implies a violation of the
article 5.1 f) of the GDPR, nor have security measures been adopted
required by regulations on the protection of personal data,

giving rise to a violation of article 32 of the RGPD.

Thus, this Agency considers that the claimed entity has violated the
articles 5.1 f) and 32 of the RGPD, by violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality, as well as
such as not adopting the necessary security measures to guarantee the protection of

the personal data of the patients of this health service.

Therefore, this procedure concludes with the imposition of two sanctions for
these facts: one for the violation of article 5.1.f) RGPD, and another for article 32
GDPR.

                                           x

Article 58.2 of the GDPR provides the following: “Each supervisory authority will have
of all the following corrective powers indicated below:

b) send a warning to any person responsible or in charge of processing when the
processing operations have infringed the provisions of this Regulation;

d) order the person responsible or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable,

in a certain way and within a specified period;

i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with Article 83, in addition to or instead of
the measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each
particular case;

                                          XI

Article 83 “General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines” of the
GDPR in section 7 establishes:

“Without prejudice to the corrective powers of the supervisory authorities under the
Article 58(2), each Member State may lay down rules on whether
can, and to what extent, impose administrative fines on authorities and organizations
public establishments in that Member State.”

Likewise, article 77 “Regime applicable to certain categories of
responsible or in charge of processing” of the LOPDGDD, provides, in accordance with the
wording in force at the time of the events, the following:

The resolution will be notified to the person responsible or in charge of the treatment, to the body of the

3. Without prejudice to what is established in the previous section, the authority for the protection of
data will also propose the initiation of disciplinary actions when there are
sufficient evidence for this. In this case, the procedure and sanctions to apply

will be those established in the legislation on disciplinary or sanctioning regime that
results of application.

Likewise, when the infractions are attributable to authorities and managers, and are

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and evaluated the criteria of
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: DIRECT to SERVICIO CANARIO DE LA SALUD, with NIF Q8555011I, for
