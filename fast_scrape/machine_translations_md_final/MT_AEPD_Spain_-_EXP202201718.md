made a fraudulent charge on your card, corresponding to a purchase that the

in accordance with the provisions of Title VII, Chapter I, Second Section, of the
LOPDGDD, having knowledge of the following extremes:
1. The claimant is a customer of the claimed party under a credit card agreement
credit, subscribed from remote banking on 04/28/2017. Provide a copy of the contract
card which contains an agreed limit of 1,800 euros.
The party complained against indicates that it has analyzed the operations carried out through the
credit card linked to the aforementioned contract, and in this case the operations have been
carried out by biometric signature, for which it has been necessary to activate the
biometric access on the mobile and activate the signature with biometrics. They provide a record of
sending two SMS to the mobile number indicating it was validated by the claimant, SMS
in which they inform you of the OTP keys to authenticate the request (date 11
October 2021, same date as the claimed charge).
They indicate that to register the biometric signature it is necessary to enter an OTP key
which was sent by SMS to the claimant's validated mobile phone. The signature with
biometrics allows customers to use their fingerprint, iris, or facial recognition to
sign some of the operations carried out through the entity's app.
Once activated, clients can sign their operations without the need to receive
an SMS with a signature key. They indicate that in the case at hand, the operation
with controversial credit card, the second authentication factor was the signature
biometric that had previously been activated by validating the OTP key.
The respondent reports that, as a result of the incident filed by the claimant,
on October 14, 2021, in compliance with current regulations
restored the payment account to the state it was in before the operation
questioned. They provide an annulment note for the amount of 1500 euros, dated 15
October 2021.
Next, the claimed party initiates, through the specialized fraud area, the
investigative work, collecting records and documentation, both internal and
external to determine if it is an operation carried out correctly from the
operational point of view. They conclude after the analysis of the evidence and the report of the
payment service provider, that the reported electronic commerce operation
by the claimant from a strictly operational point of view should be considered
correct, since it was carried out without errors, and without it being considered an operation not
authorized under the terms established in the Payment Services regulations.
They emphasize that at the time of the purchase the claimant had to: (i) have the
information contained in the card, this is numbering, expiration date and code
CVV; (ii) having in his possession the validated device where the complaining party had
sent the OTP key to activate the signature with biometrics; (iii) validate the operation
using facial, iris or fingerprint recognition.
They indicate that they communicated to the claimant the resolution of the incident and proceeded to
reverse the payment made to the claimant's account. Given this, the claimant
filed a complaint with the Customer Service Department expressing their
disagreement with the previous resolution. On November 23, 2021, the application was dismissed.
