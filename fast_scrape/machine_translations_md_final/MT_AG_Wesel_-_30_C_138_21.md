1Facts
2The plaintiffs were clients of defendant 1), a tax consultancy firm, for several years, whose authorized representative partners are defendants 2) - 6). On August 16, 2019, the plaintiffs informed defendant 1) by email that their previous address had changed, that the previous address "C-Straße, S" was no longer current, and that they could henceforth be reached at "A-Straße, X." As a precaution, the plaintiffs repeatedly pointed out the new address. On July 17, 2020, the plaintiffs commissioned defendant 1) to prepare their income tax return for 2019. When activating the defendant's income tax program, the contact information from the previous return, which still contained the plaintiffs' former address, was automatically imported. For this reason, the return was sent to the original address.
3The plaintiffs claim that the defendant's letter containing the tax return was received by the new residents of C Street in S, witnesses A and A. They inadvertently opened the envelope due to the similarity of their names and became aware of the contents. The plaintiffs felt exposed, stigmatized, and humiliated by the disclosure of their most sensitive and personal data, particularly health data, especially since, as residents of a rural area where there is "a lot of gossip," they are very concerned about discretion.
4The plaintiffs request that
5the defendants be ordered jointly and severally to pay to the first plaintiff and the second plaintiff appropriate compensation for pain and suffering, the amount of which is left to the discretion of the court, but should not be less than a total of EUR 15,000.00 (EUR 7,500.00 for the first plaintiff and EUR 7,500.00 for the second plaintiff), plus interest at a rate of 5 percentage points above the applicable base interest rate per annum from the day following the date of commencement of proceedings.
6The defendants request that
7the action be dismissed.
8They claim that it is likely that the plaintiffs had set up a mail forwarding order and therefore received the declaration immediately. The defendants are of the opinion that even if the witnesses had opened the letter and taken note of its contents, which they deny, this cannot be attributed to them, as this constitutes an independent and criminal act by the witnesses, which constitutes a caesura and interrupted the causal chain of the defendants' actions.
9The court took evidence by examining witnesses A and A. For the outcome of the taking of evidence, reference is made to the minutes of the oral hearing of March 4, 2022, pages 238 et seq. of the file. The court has referred several questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling pursuant to Article 267 TFEU; for the specific questions and the Court's decision, reference is made to the judgment of June 20, 2024, pages 461 et seq. of the file.
10The parties, the plaintiffs in a written submission dated April 25, 2025, and the defendants in a written submission dated May 7, 2025, agreed to a decision by written procedure.
11Reasons for the Decision
12The admissible action is only justified to the extent evident from the operative part.
13I.
14The plaintiffs are jointly and severally liable for payment of non-material damages against the defendants pursuant to Art. 82 (1) GDPR, but only in the amount of EUR 500.00 each.
15The material, spatial, and temporal applicability of the GDPR arises from Art. 2 (1), 3 (1), and 99 (2) GDPR.
16 Pursuant to Art. 82 (1) GDPR, any person who has suffered material or immaterial damage due to a violation of the GDPR has a right to compensation from the controller or processor.
17 Defendant 1, as a legal entity that, in the course of its activities, decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data, is a controller within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR. The liability of defendants 2 to 6 as shareholders of defendant 1 arises from Section 721 of the German Civil Code (BGB).
18 Defendant 1 has in any event violated Art. 5 (1) (d) GDPR. According to this provision, personal data must be factually accurate and, where necessary, up-to-date; all reasonable measures must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which it was processed, is erased or rectified without delay ("accuracy"). The defendants violated this requirement by failing to completely delete the plaintiffs' former address from the database. It is irrelevant that the address was automatically inserted by a program. According to Art. 5 (1) (d) GDPR, the defendant was specifically obligated to ensure that the address was no longer stored in the system. A violation of this data processing principle simultaneously constitutes unlawful data processing, which is capable of triggering liability for damages under Art. 82 GDPR (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 with further references).
19 The plaintiffs also suffered damages as a result of the violation.
20In the absence of a reference in Article 82(1) GDPR to the domestic law of the Member States within the meaning of this provision, the term "non-material damage" is to be defined autonomously under EU law (established case law, Federal Court of Justice, loc. cit. with further references). The term is to be interpreted broadly in view of the objective of the Regulation and is not dependent on exceeding a de minimis threshold (ECJ, judgment of June 20, 2024 - C-590/22; Federal Court of Justice, loc. cit.).
21Nevertheless, damage constitutes an independent element of Article 82(1) GDPR, which cannot be equated with a violation of the Regulation and must go beyond a mere violation (ECJ, loc. cit., Federal Court of Justice, loc. cit.).
22Both the Court of Justice and the Federal Court of Justice have clarified that even a temporary loss of control over personal data can constitute non-material damage, without this concept of "non-material damage" requiring proof of additional appreciable negative consequences (ECJ, loc. cit., BH, loc. cit.). This is based in particular on the first sentence of Recital 85 of the GDPR, which states that "a personal data breach ..., unless a timely and appropriate response is taken, may result in physical, material or non-material damage for natural persons, such as loss of control over their personal data." This wording also reflects the distinguishing elements of Article 82 GDPR: The data protection breach required by Article 82(1) GDPR may, but does not have to, lead to damage giving rise to an obligation to pay compensation; this must be determined separately but may, for example, be the loss of control, which is a possible but not mandatory consequence of the breach. For this reason, the claimant must only prove the loss of control that occurred, but this loss must be proven in full.
23 The plaintiffs already suffered such a loss of control when they sent the documents to their former address and received them there. Based on the results of the evidence, the court is convinced that the declaration sent by the defendant was received at the plaintiffs' former address and received by witness A. This is evident from the consistent and credible statements made by the witnesses during their examination.
24 As a result of the erroneous dispatch by the defendant, which was causally caused by the violation of Art. 5 (1) (d) GDPR, the plaintiffs lost control over the group of persons who had access to the personal data provided to the defendants and included in the tax return. Whether the witnesses interrupted the causal chain initiated by the defendant by opening the letter without authorization is irrelevant to the occurrence of damage, since this had already occurred with the mailing of the letter. At that point, the data was already beyond the plaintiffs' control. For this reason, whether and to what extent the witnesses were aware of the contents of the letter is also irrelevant to the existence of damage, in accordance with the principles established by the Court of Justice and adopted by the Federal Court of Justice. This circumstance is relevant to the extent of the damage, but not to the occurrence of the damage as such. By mailing the letter, the plaintiffs no longer had control over which group of people could access and use their data. This alone constitutes a negative consequence of the data protection breach, which constitutes non-material damage.
25 However, the extent of the damage incurred is considerably less than the magnitude stated by the plaintiffs.
26The compensatory function of Art. 82 GDPR requires full and effective monetary compensation, but the claim is not intended to serve a deterrent or punitive function (ECJ, loc. cit., BGH, loc. cit.). Neither the gravity of the violation nor the number of violations of the Regulation, nor any intentional intent on the part of the controller in this regard, are taken into account when assessing the damages (ECJ, judgment of June 20, 2024 - C-182/22, C-189/22; BGH, loc. cit.).
27If, according to the court's findings, damage only exists in the form of a loss of control over personal data because further damages have not been proven, the trial judge must, when estimating the damages, consider, in particular, the possible sensitivity of the specific personal data concerned and their typically intended use. Furthermore, the court must take into account the nature of the loss of control (limited/unlimited circle of recipients), the duration of the loss of control and the possibility of regaining control (BGH, ibid.).
28Taking these criteria into account, the court considers compensation of EUR 500.00 each to be appropriate, but also sufficient, pursuant to Section 287 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO). On the plaintiffs' side, only the aforementioned loss of control must be considered when determining the amount of damages and assessed based on the aforementioned criteria. The plaintiffs have failed to prove any further disadvantage. The witnesses' statements were inconclusive in that they do not positively establish that the witnesses were aware of details of the tax return and the data contained therein. There is certainly no evidence that the data reached an even larger group of people via the witnesses, as the plaintiffs fear.
29It should be noted that the data in question is inherently sensitive. A tax return reveals a large amount of data that allows conclusions to be drawn about various areas of the person's life and that is usually hidden from outsiders. Nor does the plaintiff have a comparable option, such as in the case of the unintentional publication of a telephone number or email address, which can be changed. However, the claim is limited by the fact that no further negative consequences beyond the mere loss of control are discernible and the data has reached a limited group of recipients, unlike, for example, in the case of inadequate data protection online. The sensitivity of the data requires the awarded compensation; however, damages of more than EUR 500.00 are not justified, since it could not be established that any third party had even gained knowledge of the data.
30 The claim for payment of interest arises from Sections 291 and 288 (1) of the German Civil Code (BGB).
31 II.
32 The decision regarding costs is based on Section 92 (1) Sentence 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), and the decision on provisional enforceability is based on Sections 708 No. 11, 711, and 709 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
