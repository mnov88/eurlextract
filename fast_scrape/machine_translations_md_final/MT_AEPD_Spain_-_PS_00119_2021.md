7) It is not proven that the defendant has a legitimate basis for the treatment of the
photos of the claimant.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                              I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each control authority, and

as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

                                             II

The RGPD defines data processing in article 4.2 of the RGPD:
  "Any operation or set of operations carried out on personal data or

sets of personal data, whether by automated procedures or not, such as the
collection, registration, organization, structuring, conservation, adaptation or modification,
extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, diffusion or any other form
to enable access, collation or interconnection, limitation, deletion or destruction "

The treatment of images, in this case in photos, must have a legitimation basis,
of some listed in article 6.1 of the RGPD.

By having images of the claimant, personal data, considering that no

There is a legitimate basis for this, the defendant is charged with the commission of an alleged
infringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD that indicates:

  1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/10

  The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph will not apply to the treatment carried out
by public authorities in the exercise of their functions. "

Once the positive fact of the treatment has been accredited, it corresponds to prove compliance with the

requirements to the claimed. In this sense, it is not proven that the exposure of the object photographs
of the claim in various social networks on the website itself will have one of the bases
legitimizing that indicates the article 6 of the RGPD, the commission of the infraction is accredited
charged.

                                                   III

or concerning your data, and at the same time implies an obligation of the person in charge (of the treatment

ment), indicating:

the deletion of personal data concerning him, which will be obliged to
primary without undue delay the personal data when any of the circumstances concur

following:

        a) the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which
were collected or otherwise treated;

        b) the interested party withdraws the consent on which the treatment in accordance is based

with Article 6, paragraph 1, letter a), or Article 9, paragraph 2, letter a), and this is not based on
other legal basis;

        c) the interested party opposes the treatment in accordance with article 21, paragraph 1, and does not
other legitimate reasons for the treatment prevail, or the interested party opposes the treatment

pursuant to Article 21 (2);

        d) the personal data has been unlawfully processed;

Failure to comply with the right to delete photographs exhibited by the claimed in

its website and social networks violate article 17 of the RGPD.

                                                   IV

Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides: “Each control authority will have all the
