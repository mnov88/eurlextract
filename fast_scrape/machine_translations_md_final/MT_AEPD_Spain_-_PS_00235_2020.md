in accordance with the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, of the

verification of the identity of our clients. In this verification procedure

identity are requested, in addition to the identifying data of the old and new
holder, the last 4 digits of the bank account of the former holder.
Therefore, it is interesting to emphasize that the reason for the situation exposed by the
claimant is due to the illegal obtaining and use of the personal data of the
claimant by the impersonator and subsequent deception of the commercial agent of

\*\*\* PHONE. 2 that processed the request to change the owner, and not to a treatment
illegitimate of the data of the claimant by my client.

Once the claim has been filed with TME, two days after having

Consequently, my client considers that there has been no violation of article
6.1 of the RGPD to carry out the treatment of the claimant's data on their part,

but by an impersonator, since the treatment of these data by
TME is necessary to manage the contractual relationship with the claimant, and the
effects of carrying out said treatment, TME has established an operation that covers
sufficient guarantees to ensure compliance with current regulations in
data protection matter ”.

                                FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                             I

       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of LOPDGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve
this procedure.
                                            II

       The complained party is charged with the commission of an infraction for violation
of Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", which indicates in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

        "one. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met

terms:
      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data

      personal for one or more specific purposes;
      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures

      pre-contractual;
      (…) "

       The offense is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance

with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/8

total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

       Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious ”provides:

      "one. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
in particular, the following:

        (…)
       b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
       conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
       Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                            III

      The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
claimed violated article 6.1 of the RGPD.

      In this sense, it is proven that the respondent processed the personal data of
the claimant without standing for it. It is clear that the claimed has carried out
the change of ownership of the claimant's line, without standing for it, such
as recognized by the respondent in her allegations, stating: “that it is due to the
Obtaining and illegal use of the personal data of the claimant by the
impersonator and the subsequent deception of the impersonator to the commercial agent of 1004 that

processed the request for a change of ownership ”.

       Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, it remains in
the diligence employed by the claimed party questioned.

       Respect for the principle of legality that is in the essence of fundamental right
protection of personal data requires that it be proven that the
responsible for the treatment displayed the essential diligence to prove that
extreme. If this Agency does not act in this way - and if this Agency does not demand it, it is incumbent upon
for compliance with the regulations governing the data protection right of

personal character - the result would be to empty the content of the principle of legality.

       The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the
Obligations imposed by the regulations for the protection of personal data
It is thus obvious. A diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the treatment
of third-party data requires that the person responsible for the treatment is in conditions

to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).

       Thus, it has been established that the respondent processed the data
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/8

personal data of the claimant, who denies their consent to the treatment, and as long as
the first has not provided any evidence to disprove such evidence, it is estimated
that the facts that are submitted to the assessment of this Agency could be

constituting an infraction of article 6.1 of the RGPD, infraction typified in the
Article 83.5 of the aforementioned Regulation 2016/679.
