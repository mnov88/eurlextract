                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                            I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the

European Parliament and of the Council, of 04/27/2016, regarding the protection of
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data RGPD
recognizes each control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of
Organic Law 3/2018, of 5/12, on Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

                                            II

The RGPD refers -in section 8 of its article 4-, to the person in charge of the treatment or
commissioned as “the natural or legal person, public authority, service or other

body that processes personal data on behalf of the data controller "
(here the claimed one), and article 4.7 of the RGPD "data controller" or
"Responsible": the natural or legal person, public authority, service or other
body that, alone or together with others, determines the purposes and means of the treatment; Yes
The law of the Union or of the Member States determines the ends and means of the

treatment, the person responsible for the treatment or the specific criteria for your
appointment may be established by the law of the Union or of the States
members ”, here the claimant, who clearly shows that he established orders
Regarding its servers, the service was interrupted and the data was not returned,

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 15/20

being that all of them really belong to him for the management of the business, his
collection and treatment of those who are directly responsible for the claimant.

The treatment by the person in charge will be governed by a contract or act or other legal act with
according to the law of the Union or of the Member States that binds the processor
with respect to the person in charge and establish the object, duration, nature and purpose
treatment, the type of personal data and categories of interested parties, and the obligations
tions and rights of the person in charge (28.3 RGPD). Consequently, the figure of the incarnation
The end of the treatment is due to the need to respond to phenomena such as

outsourcing of services by companies and other entities, in a way
that in those cases in which the data controller entrusts a third party
zero the provision of a service that requires access to personal data,
This access cannot be considered as a different treatment but rather serves to
the person in charge, the actions being carried out by the person in charge on behalf of the

ta of the person in charge, as if he himself were the one who carried it out. The manager must
offer sufficient guarantees to apply appropriate technical and organizational measures,
so that the treatment is in accordance with the requirements of the regulation (art 28.1
GDPR).

For these purposes, the owner of the data does not exercise and cannot exercise the right of access

to some data that are his, for which he is directly responsible, having them
collected and by establishing the data it collects and the purposes for which it is intended. The
Right of access is a very personal right of the owner of the same, which is not
must be confused with the person responsible for the treatment and the power he holds over the
themselves. When a controller signs a treatment order contract with a

third, what is done is to implement a legal business that must meet certain
requirements to understand that the data is processed not by a third party, but by a
third party on behalf of the person in charge, so there is no transfer,
transfer or transfer of data to a third party, but they continue in the circle of the
responsable.

Also and for this reason, there is the power of the person in charge and the specific obligation for the
manager, when he receives an order to comply with it according to the
Article 29 of the RGPD: “The person in charge of the treatment and any person who acts
under the authority of the person in charge or the person in charge and have access to personal data
They may only process said data following instructions from the person in charge, unless

are obliged to do so by virtue of the law of the Union or of the Member States ”.

Certainly, as has been said, the instructions of the person responsible for the treatment
they can still leave some degree of discretion on how best to serve the interests
of the person responsible for the treatment, allowing the person in charge of the treatment to choose the

more adequate technical and organizational means. In practice, if a person responsible for the
treatment hires a processor to carry out the
treatment on your behalf, it often means that the processor will be able to
make certain decisions for yourself about how to carry out the treatment.
It is recognized that there may be some room for maneuver for the person in charge of the

treatment may also make some decisions regarding treatment.
Here the complained party has a technical role inasmuch as the collection of customer data from
hotel is carried out by the claimant who introduces them into the system, serving the
claimed the technical means with material provided by the same claimant.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 16/20

Since the treatment must be carried out on behalf of a person responsible for the treatment,
but not under their direct authority or control, acting "on behalf of" means serving the

interests of another person and recalls the legal concept of "delegation". In this
In this case, the instructions for server changes were not attended, it was left without access to
the systems deliberately by the claimed and the
return of the data delaying and putting conditions on some data of the
responsible for unjustified issues.

It is the person responsible, in this case the claimant, who decides to put in the hands of the
In charge of the data so that it can carry out the tasks agreed upon in the
contract. In this case, activities of a technical nature in telecommunications,
servers and access to systems and their storage. Even using the claimed
their experience and discretion in technical matters, the control of the data resides

on the claimant.

In the present case, it is a situation that affects the claimant in the
development of its activities with the data for which it is responsible since despite
your requirements, the respondent has not delivered the personal data files or
servers, making it difficult and even impossible to carry out the activity

ordinary management of the commercial traffic of its activity.

Ultimately, the violation that is credited and attributed to the claimed is that of article
28.3.g) which indicates:

"3. The treatment by the person in charge will be governed by a contract or other legal act with
according to the law of the Union or of the Member States, that binds the person in charge
with respect to the person in charge and establish the object, duration, nature and end of
nature of the treatment, the type of personal data and categories of interested parties, and the obligations
responsibilities and rights of the person in charge. Said contract or legal act shall stipulate, in part,

ticular, that the person in charge:
g) at the discretion of the person in charge, delete or return all personal data a
once the provision of treatment services ends, and will delete the copies
existing unless the preservation of personal data is required by virtue of
of the Law of the Union or of the Member States ”.
