Fee to Krokatjønnvegen 15 AS

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has given Krokatjønnveien 15 AS an infringement fee of NOK 300,000 for two credit assessments without a legal basis. The company has also received an order to create written routines for credit assessments.

The reason for the fee is a complaint from two people who had been credit assessed without any kind of customer relationship or other connection to the company.

The Personal Data Protection Regulation requires that all processing of personal data has a processing basis. Credit information is a type of personal information that is particularly worthy of protection.

Lacks a legal basis

A credit rating is the result of a compilation of personal information from many different sources, and indicates the probability that a person will be able to pay for themselves. A credit assessment will also show details of individuals' personal finances such as any payment notices, voluntary mortgages and debt levels.

After investigating the case in more detail, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority has concluded that the credit assessment was carried out without the requirement for a legal basis in the Personal Data Protection Regulation being met. The company did not have a legitimate interest in credit rating the complainant.

Offensive

The Danish Data Protection Authority's privacy survey 2020/2021 showed that people perceive information about their private finances as particularly worthy of protection.

- Since a credit assessment contains details about personal finances, it is perceived as offensive when a business uses the information without a legal reason, says legal adviser Ole Martin Moe.

- We generally receive many complaints concerning credit assessments, and we see that many businesses do not know the rules well enough. It follows from long practice at the Norwegian Data Protection Authority and the Personal Data Protection Board that the general manager cannot use the company's credit assessment tool for private purposes. We take this type of case seriously, and usually respond with an infringement fee to this type of offence, concludes Moe.
