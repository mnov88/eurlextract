There is a close co-operation between the Importer and the Applicant. THE
Neither the Applicant nor the Importer made such a statement at the repeated request of the Authority

Applicant is considered a data processor in the above legal relationship.

In the light of the specific circumstances of the case set out in the grounds of this decision, the present proceedings
In respect of the data processing which is the subject of the data, the Importer shall be the sole data controller, the Applicant
it only acts as a data processor under the brand service contract. The data processor does not
performs independent data management, its activity is considered to be the activity of the data controller, no
acts for an independent purpose and legal basis. According to Article 4 (10) of the General Data Protection Regulation
the data controller and the person in a contractual relationship with him shall not be considered third parties
data processors. Accordingly, it does not qualify as a third party

data transfer is the data processing specified by the Importer
solely in the interest of the Importer (in case of a negative opinion, the interest of the Applicant)
against them) transfers the personal data of the data subjects to the Importer, this is only the Importer
constitutes a movement of data within its sphere of interest. 12

2. Rejection of the application

As explained above, since the request is the transmission of the Data of the Requested,
was intended to establish the illegality of its data processing and the Applicant could not follow
the infringement for which the data controller is responsible as the data subject is not the data subject under investigation

therefore the Authority rejected the request in accordance with the operative part.

However, the Authority examined the data management of the Importer ex officio as set out below
the lawfulness of the data and the general data management relating to the subject matter of the present proceedings
practice.

3. The processing of the Applicant's personal data by the Importer

measurement

3.1. Lack of adequate information

According to Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Importer as data controller
shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the person concerned:
all information on the processing of personal data referred to in Article 13 and

15–22. and Article 34 shall be concise, transparent, comprehensible and easy to use
in an accessible form, in a clear and comprehensible manner.

The system of adequate information in the General Data Protection Regulation serves to:
the data subject should be aware of which personal data, which data controller and which
purpose of how you will handle it. This is essential to be in a position to
exercise the rights of the data subject. Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation

In the case of data processing based on paragraph 47 (f), the General Data Protection Regulation
There is an increased information requirement under paragraph 1. According to this, the general
In addition to the specific information referred to in Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation, an additional condition is
that the data subject's reasonable expectation should cover the data processing in question
must be expected and there must be some direct customer or other relationship with the person concerned
and the data controller. Given that in the present case the Importer is the data controller, so
the direct legal relationship between the Importer and the Applicant shall be examined, not the motor vehicle

sales dealership or the relationship between the Applicant and the Applicant. Good

When examining individual data processing, the Authority shall establish that the specific
in the present case, whether the relevant information was provided in respect of the Applicant, ie
What information did the applicant receive about the data management? This is done individually, for all cases
the Authority, taking into account the available evidence.

It is also clear from the facts that there is no relationship between the Applicant and the Importer
direct legal relationship, client legal relationship. The fact that the Applicant’s customer is a
and the Applicant is a contractual partner of the Importer, not yet the Applicant
Importer's customer does not automatically create a general data protection regulation (47)
the relationship required under paragraph Without examining the general practice, the present 13

In this case, there would be a substantial, demonstrable relationship between the Applicant and the Importer if the
The applicant would be aware of this activity of the Importer. The Applicant in his application
specifically marked ………………. about the role of Importer by emails
he knew neither from the emails nor from the advance notice. Finding out this
retrieving from an external source is not the data subject's obligation to general data protection

but as part of the data controller obligations as explained above
to put the Applicant in a position to know this reasonably. Issued by the Applicant
an unfilled and unsigned worksheet with a completely different legal basis for a different purpose (not
satisfaction measurement) is by no means a very small reference to data management
appropriate, clear and transparent in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation
information requirement, the Applicant could not link it in any way
for measuring customer satisfaction.

In the present case, it can be stated that the Applicant under the responsibility of the Importer as
Due to the occasional omission of one of the employees of the data processor, the Applicant did not receive the
the worksheet and the data management information of the Applicant and the Importer as an annex thereto,
nor was he informed orally that he would be caught by a person other than the Applicant
manage the Applicant's email address and certain details. He only got information about it - not that
provably, verbally - that you are not required to provide your email address, but that in itself is not

sufficient information to make an informed exercise of the rights of the data subject and to become acquainted with them
exactly what your email address will be used for and what other data it affects. THE
The information not provided to the Applicant otherwise incorrectly indicated the Applicant
as the data controller of the data transmission.

The Applicant also sent a separate satisfaction survey to the Applicant. The Applicant
This is due to the direct customer relationship between the and Requested and the provision of the email address

was reasonably expected by the Applicant, the Applicant did not object. However the
In the present case, it also follows that - after a survey of the Applicant
already completed - in the absence of adequate information, the Applicant could not reasonably expect
that the Importer, with whom the Applicant had no previous relationship,
will contact you by email with another survey, plus a third party -
……………… .. in addition to an email that did not specifically identify you
neither the Importer nor the Applicant. There was no reference in the emails to the actual sender

(the Importer) and the source of the personal data, and its disclosure is not a
Applicant's role as concerned. On this basis, the Applicant could legitimately believe that
…………………. has obtained his personal data unlawfully, and that is the situation
It was caused by the improper procedure of the importer as data controller. Both the content of the application and the
Based on the facts revealed during the clarification of the facts, the Applicant did not calculate and did not

will be forwarded and will be sought by the Importer. It is alleged that at the Receptionist's Office

the relevant information exists, it was also not reasonably foreseeable that
In the absence of specific information to that effect from the applicant, it is not viable to do so
to base the information on the data subject, it does not meet the increased expectation expressed above and
responsibility. This is especially true for online data management where the right one is concise
providing the information would not have caused any real additional cost in the email.

In addition to the above, Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation explicitly states that

the burden of proving that the Applicant is adequate
whether it has been informed. The general data protection regulation does not preclude oral
however, in the event of a statement to the contrary by the data subject
In the absence of proof, the Authority shall issue a decision in accordance with Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
In principle, at the expense of the controller, in this case the Importer
evaluates. Since, according to the Applicant 's statements, the oral procedure was still pending in the individual case

nor did it cover exactly the purposes for which it would be used
personal data involved in the transfer, taking into account the above
does not fulfill the clear and unambiguous requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation,
the requirement for verifiable information.

In view of the above, the Importer violated the general rule with respect to the Applicant
lawful and transparent data processing in accordance with Article 5 (1) (a) of the Data Protection Regulation
in accordance with Article 12 (1) and Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation,
in a transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible form, in a clear and comprehensible manner
the obligation to provide the information set out in this Article and the general data protection rules
the principle of accountability under Article 5 (2) of that Regulation.

3.2. The validity of the legal basis of the data processing is the personal data of the Applicant
respect

In its information and balance of interests, the Applicant indicated that legitimate interest
data transfer as a separate data processing purpose performed by the Applicant
as a legal basis for the activity that the importer has a legitimate interest as a third party in the
………………. as the sole importer of motor vehicles in Hungary,

that the Hungarian dealership and service partners are of the expected quality
requirements. This is also the statement of the Importer of 21 June 2021
confirmed. This in itself is not an illegal interest, but a general privacy policy
appropriate for the existence of a legal basis under Article 6 (1) (f) of
identifying a non-illegal interest is only the first step, in addition to other aspects
must comply with the data processing in order to comply with the general data protection regulation
be a legitimate interest on which data management can be based.

It is also important to point out that data collection and transmission alone is not usually the case
separate data management, only the first operation of a data management process that is substantive
it prepares data management, and without meaningful data management it does not have its own purpose and results. The
the achievement of an objective and a result, in this case an assessment in the interest of the Importer,
data processing operations cannot be examined individually, their legal basis and legality
it depends on whether all data processing operations for a single purpose are lawful, none of them

implements a data breach. Because of data management - given a specific case
due to negligence - the Importer did not inform the Applicant at all, so the prospectus
The incompleteness of the content did not materially affect the information of the Applicant
a matter of general practice.

As regards the legitimate interest in the plea, it is important to emphasize that it does not serve to:
unless otherwise possible, the controller may at any time and for any reason on other grounds

Article 6 (1) (f)
personal information. Although it seems to be the most flexible legal basis for its application
the data controller has significant responsibilities - not just personal data in the strict sense
but also to meet other related warranty obligations
also by undertaking. The general interest is closely linked to the legitimate interest
the principle of accountability enshrined in Article 5 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation, which is
transparency, accuracy and fairness of the processing of personal data

obligation to meet the administrative burden of Not about "paperwork"
it is therefore a question of a substantive task, a statement which is particularly true
in the case of data processing where the controller and the data subject have no direct customers or
other legal relationship. In the absence of adequate guarantees, the rights of the data subject are
the risk of prejudice is such that the result of the balance of interests can only be that
the legitimate interest of the third party is overridden by the rights of the data subject due to the risks involved in the processing. 15

It is very important for data controllers to be aware that they are not involved as well as not
the tasks and responsibilities of the Authority in an official procedure instead of the controller shall be:
identification and justification of the purpose and legitimate interests of the processing. What it is like
for which purpose and for what legitimate interests he wishes to process personal data, the controller must

specifically, broken down into data and target levels, clearly justify, weigh up and guarantee its
create. These guarantees must ensure, inter alia, that the person concerned
be aware of the data processing and still be able to object to the data processing
prior to data processing, especially after a short period of time or once
in the case of data processing - the right to protest is already exhausted, so this right is not actually guaranteed a
for. When sending a one-time satisfaction meter email, it is specifically true that its
the protest has no material effect after it has taken place. The Importer as

it is considered a decision of the data controller that the data processing is in the legitimate interest according to the prospectus
instead of the express consent of the data subject - which is, for example, marketing
According to the worksheet, the legal basis for the requests is
Importer bears.

In the present case, on the basis of the above, it can be concluded that the general data protection
predictability and guarantee as set out in recital 47 of this Regulation

conditions were not met, the Applicant could not object in advance to the data processing,
on the basis of all the circumstances of the individual case, it and its consequences - by the Importer
data management and, in this context, the receipt of an e-mail which did not reveal exactly who
sent - he could not reasonably have foreseen. Appropriate information and, consequently, concerned
in the absence of legal capacity, the legal basis for a legitimate interest is not, irrespective of the other conditions
may be valid for the Applicant.

In view of the above, the Importer is in addition to the above as far as the Applicant is concerned
infringed Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

4. Importer's data management practices related to customer satisfaction measurement

In this regard, the Authority ex officio examined whether the Importer had customers
whether its general practice of measuring satisfaction raises any data protection issues

a problem which, if detected ex officio, the Authority should call on the controller
to remedy it.

The Authority's explanatory memorandum III.3.1. and III.3.2. The general findings in
the content and importance of the information and the validity of the legal basis for its legitimate interest
the importance of an appropriate relationship between the controller and the data subject
They also apply to the importer's general data management practices.

Based on the facts revealed, the Importer has a contract with substantially similar content
applies provisions with regard to the data management in question with brand partners, such as
The relevant provisions of the brand service contract between the Importer and the Applicant shall be a
Assessed by the Authority as a general practice of the Importer.

It is a common procedure for the Importer to use a data processor, for example

by e-mail via ……………….
to complete a measurement. The data subject may not know from the content of the email that the Importer is in question
the specific person sending the emails, who got the email address and where, and with that
where to find more information. The email "your"
"your dealer" and "email was sent on behalf of"
not only nonsensical (there is no legal entity that ……………… \[car brand\]) and 16

unsuitable for identifying a data controller, but are clearly misleading as not many
is one of the (unspecified) dealerships, but an Importer as data controller
emails were sent on behalf of. This is confirmed by the fact that up to several years may have elapsed at the time of servicing
since the purchase of the vehicle and not necessarily at the dealership that makes the purchase
all servicing. The importer's obligation as a data controller is not only appropriate

organizational measures to provide prior information, but also to individual stakeholders
Transparency, identification and, to a minimum, are also important in the communication sent to them
the existence of the necessary information to enable the data subject to link that prior
whether you received the e-mail from the person indicated in the information. Because nowadays a lot
spam is common, which is also typically a link to malicious programs
electronic message sent at the request of a person other than the data subject is of paramount importance
clear identification of the consignor and the existence of appropriate information

from prior information.

The email does not contain any information as to the source of your personal information
what was and by whom on what legal basis the Applicant handles exactly which personal data. The
the indication of the chassis number in the email is also personal data stored in connection with a person
unnecessary treatment, which does not give the data subject substantially new information, as he knows if
has recently taken his car into service, but it is unrealistic to expect the chassis number to

identify your car by heart. Neither data management information nor
there was no reference in the emails to information on specific data management,
and the e-mails would not have caused any difficulties with the e-mails
ensure that at least the most basic information is provided at the end of the year (actual consignor as
data controller, legal basis, source, information on the website). Although the emails from the Importer
the data importer is responsible for its activities as if it were a data controller
it would have acted itself, as the General Data Protection Regulation makes the controller general

responsible for compliance.

For the above reasons, data subjects are not even able to exercise their rights and information
they can ask the Importer as only the data processor could be identified in the email,
to which the data subject had no connection. The data processor with data management
was not available in the email.

In considering a legitimate interest, it is also important to do so
supporting that the personal interest is most necessary to achieve the objective pursued by the legitimate interest
data is handled by the data controller. At the request of the Authority, the Importer shall make only a general statement
in relation to its measurement of customer satisfaction
all types of data handled were absolutely necessary, but did not provide any evidence
under.

With regard to the chassis number, the Authority has already explained above that it is unreasonable to expect one
the knowledge of the data subject from the data subject, based on which the given email was automatically narrowed down
for a motor vehicle. However, in addition to suitability, the need is also debatable as an Importer
there was no evidence as to why the person concerned would not remember being a couple
has been in service with your car within one day and, if you have more than one car,
with which. Thus, the transfer of this data to the data processor and its inclusion in the email
for the most part unnecessary and unsuitable to achieve the goal.

The Importer also did not substantiate why an email was required
the address and telephone number of the person concerned. As stated by the Importer
In its response, received on September 13, 2021, the main purpose of customer satisfaction measurement
it is statistical and trend-like, so it is not necessary to identify the data subject. Like that
the Importer has also stated that the identification of the data subject is only required if there is a specific negative 17

formulates an opinion, a complaint and consents to its transmission by name
To the importer. Thus, in relation to the above statistical purpose, the names, addresses and addresses of the respondents
obtaining your phone number from a brand partner is not necessary and appropriate
to achieve this goal.

The above can be said about the age and gender of the data subject requested in the questionnaire
nor, in these respects, did the Importer substantiate that the indicated satisfaction measurement and
how this data would relate to the purpose of complaint handling and why not without it
the objective identified as a legitimate interest is achieved.

In view of the above, the importer should have examined in the interest assessment whether
the collection and storage of certain service data in connection with a specific person is mandatory

whether both statistical and complaint handling purposes are necessary or otherwise available.
For example, if the brand partner only provides aggregate statistics to the Importer
how many service jobs you have done on which parts and whether you are the customer
does not object to this by using the appropriate service
If you send an email address to a separate list, you will receive an email with a link to the questionnaire
it can be posted in the same way - with proper information in the email about why you sent it
in fact - and the complainants have the date of purchase or service on the questionnaire,

based on the brand partner and email address - can be clearly marked for the brand partner,
for which more detailed individual information is required. That contact information is enough for that
request from the person you wish to communicate through the e-mail,
address and telephone number are obviously not required for this. The complaint is named
In the case of this procedure, in contrast to the wording of the questionnaire requesting consent, not only the
name is handled by the Importer, so it is important to indicate that the contact information and
the data subject-specific vehicle data will also be processed by the Importer

in the case of consent. The Authority notes that specifically for the purpose of handling complaints
otherwise, the use of a legal basis for consent is questionable, since in the event of its withdrawal a
the investigation of the complaint is interrupted, however, it is already new after the customer satisfaction survey
data management, which is not the subject of the present proceedings. In the absence of a specific complaint and disclosure
the examination of the specific service conditions that can be linked to the given data subject is the statement of the Importer
is not part of the purpose and therefore does not justify the identification of identifiable data by the Importer
treatment. If the Importer still wishes to process the above personal data, the

in the context of measuring customer satisfaction, it must be able to substantiate it
which he was unable to do in the present proceedings. That is why it is not acceptable either
result of a balance of interests.

Given that the questions asked by the Applicant in its own questionnaire are substantive
were the same as those asked by the Importer (with the exception that the Importer
questions) should be considered in the balance of interests

whether such parallelism is required and with different, overlapping surveys involved
whether bombardment can be avoided by processing less personal data, which also did not arise
consideration of the interests of the Importer.

In this context, the Authority emphasizes the existence of a legitimate interest and legal bases in general
should be considered in the context of the data processing purpose. The fact that the Importer is different for other purposes
The legal basis handles the same type of personal data of the data subjects, so you know them, not yet

automatically authorizes the use of such data for other purposes, up to a maximum of
the legal consequence may be a factor reducing the actual data protection risk
in determining. The same is true of the importer 's argument that earlier
no stakeholder complaint has been received, and many stakeholders have not, due to a lack of transparency
was in a position to know against whom he should exercise his rights as a data subject. 18

In view of the above privacy concerns, they are clearly predominant
risks to the rights of the data subject which have not been properly considered by the Importer.
In doing so, the interests identified by the Importer take precedence
interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that protect personal data
Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation

There is no other legal basis under this Regulation for the processing of the data in question
in the form of.

Based on the above, the Importer's practice of measuring customer satisfaction violates
lawful and transparent under Article 5 (1) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation
accordance with Article 5 (1) (c) of the General Data Protection Regulation
principle of data protection, Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation and general

Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation.

ARC. Legal consequences

As the examined customer satisfaction measurement data management for the Applicant already
terminated, in this regard, an obligation to delete is not necessary for the available information

Based on.

As it does not affect the rights of the data subject under the General Data Protection Regulation, the data subject is concerned
its customer capacity does not cover the issue of imposing a data protection fine. The Authority
examined of its own motion whether it was justified to impose a data protection fine on the Importer.

As to whether the imposition of a data protection fine is justified, the Authority

Acting in accordance with the discretion based on the law, Infotv. Section 61 (1)

and Article 58 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

In ex officio proceedings concerning the illegality of a general practice examined ex officio, the Authority shall:

The Authority did not take this into account as a mitigating circumstance regarding the necessity of the fine
the economic situation referred to by the Importer, as it - indirectly, in terms of annual revenue
only if the fine is necessary, it does not affect the amount of the fine
whether it is necessary to impose a fine is determined by the infringement and its circumstances

in accordance with Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation. In this regard, the
In setting the amount of the fine, the Authority took into account that the Importer

would be the obligation of all data controllers and processors under Article

The Authority also did not consider the importer as an attenuating circumstance
that data subjects do not suffer any harm and, moreover, Article 19

it also serves the interests of data subjects, as personal data is subject to general data protection
unnecessary data which do not take into account the will of the data subject
The use of personal data violates the right to the protection of personal data and in general

unnecessary data security risk, and
presumably in a small number of cases - it is in the interest of the data subject if he or she has a complaint

The Authority took into account the market weight of the Importer as an aggravating circumstance, the potential 2
the number of stakeholders (which is the CSO 's new …… .. …… .. car sales statistics in Hungary
on the order of at least ten thousand) and that the general practice of importing it

The Authority took into account the fact that it was not available as an aggravating circumstance

effective information and redress for those concerned. In this context, the
The small number of complaints received by the authority, as an essential element of the infringement, is that those involved
they have not been adequately informed about the data processing in question and are not necessarily expected to do so,
so they can't protest in large numbers. Importer's data management
Based on its size and market position, it would be expected that the Importer would not be limited to certain
the exercise of the rights of the data subject depends on the individual and unsupervised decision of the administrator.

The Authority took into account as an aggravating circumstance the fact that the infringement lasted for several years
the result of existing, ongoing practice and its design - and the general
redesign in line with the Data Protection Regulation - was in principle ill-considered.

The Authority took into account as a mitigating circumstance the scope of the personal data processed

did not contain personal data belonging to a special category or for other reasons,
and a significant part of the personal data relates to the vehicle owned by the data subject
technical data, and some of the data is handled by the Importer for other purposes anyway, such as
the damage to those affected was not significant despite the size of the group affected.

The Authority took into account as an attenuating circumstance that in the case of an individual complaint a

The applicant, as a data processor, had an error in an individual case
word and assessed the Applicant's statement that it had taken action in similar cases

The Authority took into account as an attenuating circumstance the negligence of the infringement,
was not intended to harm the persons concerned or to gain an unlawful advantage, and the designated
interest may, where appropriate, cease to be a legitimate interest if the conditions for data processing are properly met
adapted to the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation set out in the explanatory memorandum.

The Authority took into account as an attenuating circumstance the fact that the Importer did not previously

has committed a data breach, which has not been identified by the Authority.

As a result of the Authority 's deliberations in relation to the general practice examined, the
In the light of all the circumstances of the case, it is necessary to impose a fine on both the special and the

Based on the above, the Authority considers that the maximum amount that can be imposed is approx.
considered the imposition of a data protection fine of three tenths of a thousand (0.026%)
proportionate and dissuasive in all the circumstances of the case

with regard to.
