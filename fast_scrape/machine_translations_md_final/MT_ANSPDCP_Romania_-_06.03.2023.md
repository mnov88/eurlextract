Sanctions for GDPR violations

In February of the current year, the National Supervisory Authority completed two investigations at the operators of Finopro IFN SA and Integral Collection SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and c) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (RGPD).

As such, the operators were sanctioned as follows:

Finopro IFN SA with a fine of 11,023.42 lei, the equivalent of 2,250 EURO; Integral Collection SRL with a fine of 14,697.90 lei, the equivalent of 3,000 EURO.

The investigations were started as a result of the transmission by the operators of some notifications of breaches of the security of personal data under the RGPD.

During the investigations carried out, it was found that the breach of data processing security occurred as a result of ransomware attacks, a situation that significantly led to unauthorized access and the loss of the integrity and availability of personal data (such as identification data, data from identity cards, addresses, telephone numbers, account statements).

As such, taking into account the measures announced by these operators to remedy the situation, in relation to the criteria for individualizing the sanctions provided for in art. 83 of the RGPD, the penalty for violating the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and c) and para. (2) of the GDPR, as they have not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the processing risk, including the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and continued resilience of the processing systems and services.
