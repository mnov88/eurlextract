There is a dispute as to whether Landsbanki was allowed to demand the complainant's social security number when he deposited cash in the amount of ISK 99,000 into his daughter's bank account with the bank.

The complainant believes that Landsbankin was not authorized to require his social security number during the transaction in question.

Conclusion
1.
Lawfulness of processing

This case concerns Landsbankin's registration of the complainant's social security number during cash transactions in the bank's branch. It concerns the processing of personal data that falls under the scope of Act no. 90/2018 and regulation (EU) 2016/679 and thus the authority of the Data Protection Authority. Landsbankinn is considered to be the responsible party for the processing in question according to Act no. 90/2018, on personal protection and processing of personal data, and Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

All processing of personal information must be covered by one of the authorized provisions of Article 9. Act no. 90/2018, cf. Article 6 of regulation (EU) 2016/679. For example, it is possible to work with personal data if it is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation that rests on the responsible party, cf. Number 3. of the legal provision and point c of the regulatory provision.

In addition to authorization according to the above, the processing of personal data must be compatible with all the principles of paragraph 1. Article 8 Act no. 90/2018, cf. Article 5 of regulation (EU) 2016/679. The principles stipulate, among other things, that personal data must be sufficient, relevant and not beyond what is necessary based on the purpose of the processing (item 3 of the legal provision).

Finally, the use of a social security number is subject to the fact that it has a practical purpose and is necessary to ensure secure personal identification, cf. Article 13 Act no. 90/2018.

When assessing the legality of processing according to the above-mentioned provisions, provisions in other laws that apply in each case must be taken into account. Landsbankinn is a financial company and falls under the scope of Act no. 140/2018, on actions against money laundering and terrorist financing, cf. a.-item 1. paragraph Article 2 of them, and is a reporting party according to the same law, cf. Number 17. Article 3 of the law.

The objective of Act no. 140/2018 is to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing by obliging entities that engage in activities that may be used for money laundering or terrorist financing to know the identity of their customers and their activities and to report this to the competent authorities if they suspect or become aware of such illegal activities, cf. Article 1 of the law.

Notifiable parties are also prohibited from offering anonymous transactions, cf. Paragraph 1 Article 7 Act no. 140/2018. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the reporting party must carry out due diligence according to Article 8. of the law. In the comments to Article 7 in the bill that became law no. 140/2018 says that the provision removes all doubt that notifiable parties are not allowed to offer anonymous transactions. The provision covers all transactions, by whatever name they are called, such as deposit accounts, trust accounts, safe deposit boxes, asset management, company creation, digital wallets, etc. A similar provision was not found in law no. 64/2006 on measures against money laundering and terrorist financing, which were in force when the ruling of the Personal Protection Authority in case no. no. 583/2010 was pronounced.

In the opinion of the Personal Protection Authority, the provisions of paragraph 1 should be clarified. Article 7 Act no. 140/2018 taking into account the objective of the law, as determined in Article 1. them, and the aforementioned comments in the bill that became the law. It must be aimed at banning anonymous transactions according to paragraph 1. Article 7 the law also requires reporting parties to know the identity of their customers. This obligation applies equally to account owners as well as those who intend to deposit cash into accounts with financial institutions that they do not own.

Personal protection believes that it can be agreed that the customer's name alone is not enough to ensure secure personal identification in banking transactions. As a result, it is in practice necessary for the notifying party to obtain additional information for personal identification of customers in order to fulfill the legal obligation that rests on him according to paragraph 1. Article 7 Act no. 140/2018, as the provision is explained above.

In light of this, the Data Protection Authority considers that it was necessary for Landsbanki to record the complainant's social security number in order to ensure his secure identification, in order to fulfill the requirements that rested on the bank according to Act no. 140/2018.

Taking into account all of the above, it is the opinion of the Personal Protection Authority that Landsbankin's processing of the complainant's personal information was permitted on the basis of item 3. Paragraph 1 Article 9 Act no. 90/2018, to the effect that the processing was necessary to fulfill the legal obligation that rested on the bank according to paragraph 1. Article 7 Act no. 140/2018. In addition, it will not be considered that the processing of personal information by Landsbankin has violated the principle of proportionality, item 3. Paragraph 1 Article 8 Act no. 90/2018, cf. c-point 1. paragraph Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or other principles of the legislation. Finally, the processing is compatible with the provisions of Article 13. Act no. 90/2018 concerning the use of social security numbers. The processing therefore complied with Act no. 90/2018, on personal protection and processing of personal information, cf. regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Ruling:

The processing of Landsbankinn hf. on personal information about \[A\] conformed to the provisions of Act no. 90/2018, on personal protection and processing of personal data, and Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
