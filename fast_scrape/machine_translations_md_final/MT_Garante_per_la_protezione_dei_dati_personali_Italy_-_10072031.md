this state of inaccessibility of the Site has been communicated several times to the entity in charge of managing the related platform, through the opening of multiple reporting tickets indicating various reasons for the error;

the opening of the tickets took place during the period December 2023-May 2024 and, for some reports, also at an earlier time, thus proving the good faith of the Company;

the overall assessment of the elements described leads to the belief that the application of the warning measure is proportionate in the case in question;

CONSIDERING therefore that it is necessary to address a warning to the data controller pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, letter b) of the Regulation, for failure to comply with the principles of fairness and transparency in relations with users, contained in Articles 12, paragraphs 1 and 2, 13 and 14 of the Regulation, which require the controller to provide interested parties with the necessary information on the processing, first and foremost the identification details of the controller and the contact details to contact him, as well as to facilitate the exercise of the rights pursuant to Articles 15-22 of the Regulation;
