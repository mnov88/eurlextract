in accordance with the basic principles of data processing referred to in Article 5 of the Data Regulation and Article 6 of the Data Regulation
to the established legal basis. Article 5(1)(a) of the Data Regulation provides that persons

data is processed lawfully, in good faith and in a manner transparent to the data subject ("lawfulness",

include only what is necessary for the purposes of their processing ("data minimization").
      Therefore, every processing of personal data carried out by the manager must be in accordance with Article 6 of the Data Regulation

done legally
      \[5.2.\] Regulation no. 369 4.24. subsection stipulates that there must be a security control center

security service recipients, other persons and institutions. Contact information is available
recorded and stored for at least three months.

                                                                                   6
sufficient Regulation No. 369 4.24. for the implementation of subsection, the Inspectorate asked for the opinion of the Internal Affairs
to the Ministry on whether the security merchant in the security control center should make an audio recording for them
for conversations that take place between persons in the security control center, or however this subsection
for enforcement, the security merchant must make a record only for the communication that took place through the communication
means (such as a telephone or radio).
                                                     7
      \[5.4.\] According to the opinion of the Ministry of the Interior, the security merchant is obliged to provide
the existence of means of communication (for example, a radio station, telephone) through which communication takes place between
employees of the security merchant with other employees located outside the control center,
for the security merchant's mobile groups, security service recipients, other persons and
institutions, and is also instructed to ensure the recording and storage of the mentioned communication information.

funds. The inspection takes into account that, when guarding the object, it is essential to have in the event of an incident
available as large a body of evidence as possible to help reveal both the circumstances of the incident and
actions of the security guards, therefore it is essential that the communications provided during communication are recorded

information so that, if necessary, you can listen to what both participants of the conversation said.
      When making an audio recording with video surveillance, SIA does not provide Regulation No. 369
4.24. full implementation of the subsection, because the audio recording made by the video surveillance camera records
only what the security control center employee says, but what the other participant in the conversation says is not recorded.
In addition, during audio recording with video surveillance, SIA processes (obtains, stores) conversations between

to persons who are in the security control center, and these conversations may be unrelated to anyone
security incident.
      Taking into account the above, it can be established that the data processing carried out by SIA, when making an audio recording,
does not meet the requirements of Article 5(1)(a) and (c) and Article 6(1) of the Data Regulation.
