DECISION

SPEAK

The data protection authority decides on the application of Dr. Alfons A\*\*\* (applicant), represented by D\*\*\* & Partner Rechtsanwälte GmbH & Co KG, dated 20 January 2020, to grant him party status and access to the files in possible administrative criminal proceedings against Dr. Elfriede A\*\*\*, as follows

- The motion is dismissed.

No. L 119 of 4.5.2016, p. 1; section 29 Data Protection Act - DSG, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended; section 17 General Administrative Procedure Act 1991 - AVG, Federal Law Gazette No. 51/1991 as amended.

EXPLANATIONS

A. Submission

The applicant submits the following in its application:

"In its decision of 26 January 2018 (ref. no.: DSB-D122.756/0005-DSB/2017), the data protection authority found (amended by the decision of the Federal Administrative Court on 25 June 2019 (ref. no.: W258 2187426-1/40E / W 258 2188466-1/36E) that Dr Elfriede A\*\*\* (respondent) had violated the applicant, Dr Alfons A\*\*\* (complainant), in his right to information.

On the basis of the legally binding decision of the data protection authority, it is to be assumed that the data protection authority has initiated administrative criminal proceedings against Dr. Elfriede A\*\*\* (complainant). As the aggrieved party, the applicant has a legal interest in the administrative criminal prosecution of Dr. Elfriede A\*\*\*.

The claimant therefore submits the

Motion,

1. to be granted party status in any administrative criminal proceedings against Dr. Elfriede A\*\*\* and

2. to inspect the files in these administrative penal proceedings."

B. From a legal standpoint, it follows that

In its ruling of 27 February 2019, Ra 2017/10/0121, the Administrative Court expressly stated that the parties to administrative criminal proceedings are a closed circle of persons defined by law by virtue of express provisions of the VStG.

These are the accused (see § 32 (1) VStG), the private prosecutor (see § 56 (2) VStG) and the private party (see § 57 (1) VStG). In addition, § 17 VStG provides for a party status for the owner of an object threatened with forfeiture who is different from the accused.

The applicant is not listed as an accused party in administrative criminal proceedings before the data protection authority in connection with the above-mentioned preliminary proceedings.

In any case, the present case does not constitute a violation of honour, so the applicant is not qualified as a private prosecutor within the meaning of the VStG. Moreover, this would not be a fact which the data protection authority would have to disregard.

Nor can the applicant in the present case be regarded as a person accused by (possible) different owners of an object threatened with forfeiture.

For a person to be able to obtain party status as a private party in administrative criminal proceedings, it is a prerequisite that the administrative criminal authority must also decide on the private-law claims derived from an administrative violation in accordance with individual administrative provisions in the penal code. However, the provisions of Art. 83 DSGVO and Art. 62 DSG that standardise the elements of administrative offences do not provide for anything in this regard.

For the above-mentioned reasons, the data protection authority is thus prevented from granting third parties - beyond the cases provided for by law - party status. Consequently, no inspection of files can be granted.

It was therefore appropriate to make a ruling in accordance with the Rules of Procedure.
