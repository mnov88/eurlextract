RGPD fine

The National Supervisory Authority completed in March 2022 an investigation at the Owners Association from Str. Soporului 17, Cluj-Napoca municipality, to which he imposed a fine, as a result of the fact that this operator did not provide the information requested by our institution, thus violating the provisions of art. 83 para. (5) lit. e) correlated with the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) lit. (a) and (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

As such, the owners' association was sanctioned with a fine of 2,474.5 lei (equivalent to 500 EURO).

The investigation was carried out following a complaint made by a data subject alleging that the operator revealed on the Facebook group of the block where he resides images with his person from the video surveillance system managed by the association.

As the operator did not respond to our institution's requests, although he confirmed their receipt, he was fined.

It was also ordered to transmit to the supervisory authority all the requested information, within 5 working days from the communication of the minutes.
