3\. Fine for incorrect disposal by logistics companies
The HmbBfDI has issued a fine against a Hamburg logistics company. The reason for the sanction was the repeated disposal of so-called delivery lists in public waste containers and an inadequate disposal concept. The fine is not yet legally binding.
Employees of a Hamburg logistics company had disposed of so-called delivery lists in freely accessible public waste containers in two cases. Unauthorized third parties were thus able to view them. The lists contained the first and last names of subscribers, addresses, subscribed newspapers and special delivery instructions, such as the location of mailboxes and any complaints from recipients. The lists therefore contained a not inconsiderable amount of detailed information about the people on the list.
The audit also found that the concept for disposing of such lists was inadequate. In particular, it was up to the delivery people to dispose of the lists themselves, without the delivery lists being returned. This meant that the company was unable to effectively monitor proper disposal. It was therefore also not possible to reliably comply with the reporting obligations under Art. 33 and 34 GDPR, which require reporting in the event of data breaches.

FINES, ORDERS, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

with regard to the specific disposal, on the one hand the company violated Art. 32 Para. 1 GDPR, and on the other hand the faulty disposal concept had to be sanctioned. A fine was also appropriate because the company had already been given a warning in 2019 in accordance with Art. 58 Para. 2 lit. b) GDPR due to a similar situation.

Nevertheless, the company worked with the HmbBfDI to clarify the violations, which had to be taken into account to a considerable extent when determining the fine. In addition, the information materials for delivery drivers on the data protection-compliant disposal of delivery lists were revised in order to better prevent future violations. Ultimately, no economic damage to the subscribers could be determined. On the other hand, the company gained an economic advantage from the inadequate disposal concept in the form of saved costs for its own proper disposal of the lists. The fine was therefore moderate. The company has lodged an appeal against the fine.
