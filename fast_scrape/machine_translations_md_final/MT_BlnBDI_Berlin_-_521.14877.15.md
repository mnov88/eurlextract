Buttons for giving consent and further options for action are labeled and

are designed and what additional information is provided.

In order to be able to prove that users have made an unambiguous declaration of intent

whose communication effect is equivalent. If a selection option is presented precisely and

The requirements for effective consent are not regularly met (OH Telemedien 2021

If you can simply ignore it because it obscures the content of the offer, it is therefore regularly missing
on the voluntariness of consent if the refusal is granted with a higher

effort, e.g. B. in clicks and attention (OH Telemedien 2021 Version 1.1
54, 56 f.).

In cases where there is an interactive element at the first level of the banner with which

Giving consent must clearly be considered an equivalent alternative to the “Consent
grant". What is crucial is that the alternative to consent as such
can be perceived by users. For example, it is not sufficient if:

or this in the running text of the banner without clear visual or linguistic emphasis

With regard to the criticized violations types C, D and E, it is therefore relevant whether 'despite the

                     "DECEPTIVE BUTTON CONTRAST"

                lt appears that the configuration of some cookie banners in terms of colors and contrasts of the
                buttons (contrast ratio between the accept button and the backeround" type D practice) could lead
          15- to a Clear highlight of the "accept all" button over the available options,

                The taskforce members agreed to examine type D and E practices together as the issues are linked
                and raise similar points of discussion,
          16.
                The task force members agreed that a general banner standard concerning color and/or contrast
                cannot be imposed on data controllers, in order to assess the conformity of a banner, a case-by-case

                casese although same examples of features manifestly contrary to the ePrivacy Directive provisions
                have been identified

                Based on concrete examples, the taskforce members took the view that at least this practice could be
                manifestly misleading for users:
          18- an alternative action is offered (Other than granting consent) in the form of a button where
                        the contrast between the text and the button background is so minimal that the text is

                        unreadable to virtually any use

                While the design choices above are considered problematic, the taskforce members reiterated that
                each specific cookie banner needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis,
          19-

The statements underline that there is no general standard with regard to the

design of colors and contrasts, but must always be examined on a case-by-case basis.

The members of the task force were of the opinion that only then would a clearly inadmissible

where the contrast between the text and the background of the button is so low that the

Text is unreadable for virtually every user. In all other cases an individual examination is required

to be carried out in which it must be clarified whether the users have been blatantly misled.

This corresponds to the assessment standard that the German supervisory authorities already use

Paragraph 125 of the above Orientation aid telemedia have described: “There is no general one

Standard for the design of consent banners in terms of color, size or contrast,
so that there is a certain amount of leeway for those responsible. A behavior control through the

Design, which is commonly referred to as nudging, is therefore not generally impermissible. She

However, it finds its limits where the requirements for effective consent are met

of Art. 4 No. 11 and Art. 7 GDPR are no longer fulfilled. If this limit is exceeded
"Inadmissible nudging can be assumed."

             (2) Examination standard for “Violation Type K”

                                                                                                             Page 11 of 17As a condition of effective consent, Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR also requires the following:
“The data subject has the right to withdraw their consent at any time. The revocation

“Consent must be as simple as giving consent.”

According to your assessment, withdrawing consent was not as easy as giving it
the website operator did not activate the option, a small, permanently visible

to display a "floating" symbol with which the banner can be called up again

(“Violation Type K”).

The European supervisory authorities apparently share this view
following statements from the results report of the Banner Taskforce:

          9/31 TYPE K PRACTICE: "NO WITHDRAW ICON"

                It appears that where controllers provide an option allowing to withdraw consent, different forms of
                options are displayed. In particular$ some controllers have not chosen to use the possibility to show a
                small hovering and permanently visible icon on ali pages of the website that allows data subjects to

          32. return to their privacy settings, where they can withdraw their consent.

                Website owners should put in place easily accessible solutions allowing users to withdraw their
                consent at any time, such as an icon (small hovering and permanently visible icon) or a link placed on
          33. a visible and standardized place.

                The ePrivacy Directive's reference to consent in the GDPR includes both a reference to the definition of
                consent (article 4 of the GDPR) as well as to the conditions of it (article 7 of the GDPR)
          34.
                In addition to the requirements for the collection of consent to be valid in accordance with the GDPR
                andunderArticle5(3)ePrivacythreeadditionalcumulativeconditionsaremandatory(i)thepossibility
                to withdraw consent, (ii) the ability to withdraw consent at any time, {iii) withdrawal of consent must

         35.
                However, website owners can only be imposed that easily accessible solutions are implemented and

                displayedonceconsenthasbeencollected,buttheycannotbeimposedaspecificwithdrawalsolution,
                and in particular to set up a hovering solution for the withdrawal of consent to the deposit of cookies
                and other trackers. A case-by-case analysis of the solution displayed to withdraw consent will always
                be necessary. In this analysis, it must be examined whether, as, a result, the legal requirement that it
                is as easy to withdraw as to give consent is fulfilled,

This corresponds to the assessment standard that the German supervisory authorities already use
Paragraph 60 of the above Orientation aid telemedia have described: “If links

Direct the user directly to the option of revocation and currently none

If searches are necessary, a directly discoverable revocation option can also be found in one

Data protection declaration can be placed."

      3. Evaluation in the specific case

The data protection assessment is based on the current status and design of the

Internet presence as shown in the complaint documents and ours

                                                                                                       Page 12 of 17 has (partially) confirmed my own viewing of the website. The above Findings show that

It can be left open whether these processes take place before or without interaction or only after clicking on the

Buttons "Accept" took place. Because we could not determine that the design of the
Banners was clearly suitable for obtaining effective consent for this.

 For all website visits made by the complainant or ourselves

The evaluation must also take into account the expectations of average users,

could therefore not ensure beyond doubt that there was unambiguous consent for the

Regardless of the design of the selection options, we could not determine that the
