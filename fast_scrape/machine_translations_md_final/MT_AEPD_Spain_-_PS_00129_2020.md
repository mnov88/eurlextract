                  RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on the
following

                                     BACKGROUND

FIRST: The claims filed by two CLAIMANTS, see ANNEX
GENERAL have entry dates 04/10 and 05/13/2019, respectively, at the Agency

Spanish Data Protection. The claim is directed against STATE AGENCY OF
TAX ADMINISTRATION, with CIF Q2826000H (hereinafter, the one claimed). The
reasons on which the claims are based are that in the Delegation of the State Agency
of Tax Administration of \*\*\* LOCALIDAD.1, located at \*\*\* ADDRESS.1 of
\*\*\* LOCALITY. 1, it is planned to install an access and time control system to

officials and workforce based on a fingerprint system.

The claimants state that “it has begun to require obtaining the signature of
via email ”. They indicate that an attempt has been made to obtain information regarding
the legality of the transfer of these data as well as the correct treatment of the same and

that the data that the employer intends to obtain constitutes data especially
protected (biometric data). Such data is described in article 9.1 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 04/27/2016 on protection
of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free
circulation of these data (hereinafter, GDPR). Article 9.2.b of the RGPD exempts
that prohibition of treatment if this is necessary for the fulfillment of obligations and the

exercise of specific rights of the person responsible for the treatment or of the interested party in the
field of labor law and social security and protection, insofar as it is
authorized by the Union law of the Member States or a collective agreement with
in accordance with the law of the Member States that establishes adequate guarantees,
existing the mandatory impact assessment on the protection of data derived from said

treatment violating the provisions of article 35 of the Regulation.

They consider that the implementation of the system is not proportional and does not comply with the law
planned.

Claimant 1, who claims to be a civil servant (file E / 5312/2019) provides a copy of a
e-mail "sent to the officials" of the claimed, of 04/10/2019, entitled

“New fingerprint identification system for access control and schedule
in the Delegation of \*\*\* LOCALIDAD.1 ”, in which it is reported:

  - The implementation of the system and that the employees will be summoned for the
take of the footprint. The date on which it is summoned appears.

  -The collection system registers "certain minutiae of the fingerprint, not the image of it",
"It is not possible to reconstruct the footprint they characterize." "This information is saved

encrypted "

  -The AEAT is responsible for the treatment, indicating that article 9.2.1 b) applies as
exception for the aforementioned treatment as it is deemed necessary for the fulfillment of

obligations and exercise of specific rights of the person in charge or the interested party in the
field of labor law, to the extent authorized by Union or
Member States or a collective agreement under State law
members that establish adequate guarantees of respect for fundamental rights and
of the interests of the interested party; ”, indicating that“ consent will not be required, when the

data processing is carried out for the fulfillment of contractual relationships of a nature
labor, "regardless of whether it is specially protected data or not" From
of taking the fingerprint how each employee must sign in at the lathes, indistinctly with
fingerprint or electronic ID for entering or leaving the workplace "

A pdf ANNEX document is attached: "lathe information file" although it does not refer to its

content so it cannot be read.

  -A letter is also added that is entitled "new identification system through
fingerprint to control accesses and schedules in the \*\*\* LOCALIDAD.1 ”delegation, which
contains information on legal coverage as well as “basic information on
data protection ”, purpose, legal basis, person in charge, rights and additional information

detailed by clicking link.

-Copy of the document “Quick guide for the use of AEAT access control” that
accompanies, and in addition to a graphic explanation of the position of the finger and pressure on the
reader, figure that when the fingerprint is entered, “it is being checked against 1,000”, and “it ends

when your DNI number appears on the screen "
Claimant 2 (file E / 6247/2019), adds that the electronic DNI system of each
worker is used if a fingerprint mechanism error occurs and the system is running.
progressively implemented throughout Spain, and that not previously informed each

worker of the purposes and other mandatory legal requirements for the treatment.

SECOND: Upon receipt of the claim, the General Subdirectorate for Inspection of
Data proceeded to carry out the following actions:

The claims were transferred to the respondent for analysis and communication to the
complainants of the decision taken in this regard. Likewise, he was required so that in the
within a month send the Agency certain information:

       - Copy of the communications, of the adopted decision that has been sent to the
       claimant regarding the transfer of this claim, and accreditation that the
       claimant has received communication of that decision.

       - Report on the causes that have motivated the incidence that has originated the
       claim.

       - Report on the measures adopted to prevent incidents from occurring
       Similar.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/3

       - Any other that you consider relevant.

For claimant 2, the claim is transferred and responses are received on 07/29 and 10/10/2019.
It is indicated that the processes respond to the need to homogenize the systems of

access control and presence of personnel to the various buildings of the Tax Agency
because in some there are lathes, while in others there are only wall-mounted devices for
clocking, considering the fingerprint registration system easier to use than the system
of magnetic stripe card readers, which was a weaker system and generated
many incidents in the management of the life cycle of the cards, including the management of the
loss erased and so on. With an environment of more than 26,000 employees and more than 400

buildings, the project began in 2016. This measure was selected by a series of
guarantees such as that only a few minutiae are saved at the time the
paw print. The minutiae are stored encrypted and kept in a decentralized system
from where they are distributed to building lathes when employees are
expressly authorized to access. Each employee is authorized to access the

concrete buildings and in their lathes the encrypted minutiae are downloaded so that
each time the user wants to enter or exit they can be compared with the footprint that is put on
in the reader.

In June 2017, the beginning of the deployment of the solution was addressed. In a pilot phase,
carried out work by the working group to adapt to the General Regulations of

Data Protection, of the security and control commission and tax informatics, arriving
at the conclusion of its viability and proportionality on the basis of the legitimacy of the
Tax Agency to control access and hours of its employees.

When the RGPD came into force, the existence of biometric data in the
personnel file and in the register of treatment activities.

The implementation will be carried out gradually in all the buildings of the Tax Agency.
It has no end date.

Information and instructions were distributed to the offices where the implementation was to begin
of the system for distribution to employees with system information and

guarantees of each call of the employee to go through personnel to carry out the
registration of the fingerprints before starting the integration the offices that have considered it
timely. They have distributed this information in a personalized way by sending an email
electronic to each employee. In ANNEX 1 attached in evidence of corporate mail with
the information provided to employees used in the special delegation of
\*\*\* LOCALITY. 1.

access control. From these minutiae it is not possible to reconstruct the complete footprint and
these minutiae are stored encrypted.

where technical recognition problems arise, the new system will allow

also identification by electronic DNI. In this case the identification is based on
the reading of the public part of this certificate, which allows consulting the basic data of
identification (DNI number, name and surname), without the need for the worker
provide the PIN that protects the use of the certificates for authentication purposes
in electronic services or signature processes, nor will the data that may have

archived the chip of the DNI. In this case, the legal coverage of the data processing is
based on article 6.1.b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                               I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

                                               II

Biometric data is closely linked to a person, since it can
use a certain unique property of an individual for identification or

authentication.

According to Opinion 3/2012 on the evolution of biometric technologies, “The data
biometrics irrevocably change the relationship between the body and identity, since
make the characteristics of the human body machine-readable and
subject to further use. "

In relation to them, the Opinion specifies that it is possible to distinguish different types of treatment
noting that “Biometric data can be processed and stored in different ways.
Sometimes the biometric information captured from a person is stored and processed in

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/8

gross, which makes it possible to recognize the source from which it comes without special knowledge;
For example, a photograph of a face, a photograph of a fingerprint, or a recording of
voice. Other times, the raw biometric information captured is treated in such a way that only

certain characteristics or traits are extracted and saved as a biometric template. "

The processing of these data is expressly permitted by the RGPD when the
The employer has a legal basis, which is usually the employment contract itself. TO
In this regard, the STS of July 2, 2007 (Rec. 5017/2003), which has understood legitimate the
treatment of biometric data carried out by the Administration for the time control of

its public employees, without the prior consent of the workers being required.

However, the following should be noted:

        - The worker must be informed about these treatments.

        - The principles of limitation of the purpose, necessity,
proportionality and data minimization.

In any case, the treatment must also be adequate, pertinent and not excessive in
relation to said purpose. Therefore, biometric data that are not necessary for

that purpose should be removed and the creation of a database will not always be justified
biometrics (Opinion 3/2012 of the Art. 29 Working Group).

        - Use of biometric templates: Biometric data must be stored as
biometric templates whenever possible. The template will need to be removed in a

that is specific to the biometric system in question and not used by others
data controllers of similar systems in order to ensure that a person only
can be identified in biometric systems that have a legal basis for
this operation.

        - The biometric system used and the security measures chosen must
ensure that re-use of the biometric data in question is not possible for
other purpose.

        - Mechanisms based on encryption technologies should be used in order to avoid the
unauthorized reading, copying, modification or deletion of biometric data.

        - Biometric systems must be designed in such a way that the
identity bond.

        - You must choose to use data formats or specific technologies that

prevent the interconnection of biometric databases and the disclosure of data not
proven.

        - Biometric data must be deleted when they are not linked to the purpose
that motivated their treatment and, if possible, mechanisms should be implemented

automated data deletion.

                                               III
