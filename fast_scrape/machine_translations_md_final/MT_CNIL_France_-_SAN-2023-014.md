Considering the other documents in the file;

After deliberating at the meeting of July 13, 2023, adopted the following decision:

I. FACTS AND PROCEDURE

1. Decision no SAN-2022-026 of December 29, 2022, notified to the company VOODOO on January 16, 2023, ordered the latter to:

"to collect the user's consent to the use of the IDFV for advertising purposes".

2. This injunction was accompanied by a penalty of twenty thousand euros (20,000) euros per day of delay at the end of a period of three months following notification of the deliberation of the restricted formation, the supporting documents for the in compliance must be sent to the restricted training within this deadline.

3. On April 14, 2023, the VOODOO company sent the president of the restricted training elements with a view to justifying its compliance, by presenting the implementation, during the opening of a game published by the VOODOO company on a terminal equipped with the iOS operating system, a device for collecting consent for the use of the "identifier for vendors" (IDFV) for the purposes of targeted advertising, measuring content performance and improvement of its games and applications.

4. It appears from the elements produced by the company that when opening a VOODOO game, the request it presents appears prior to that of the APPLE company (also called "ATT request"), by which the latter asks the user for permission to track their activities on all applications on their terminal by reading the “identifier for advertisers” (IDFA) for targeted advertising purposes. The company VOODOO specifies that in the event of refusal to use the IDFV, it cannot be read by the partners or by the company itself for advertising purposes, whatever the choice. made by the user at the ATT request.

II. REASONS FOR DECISION

5. The restricted training of the CNIL notes that it appears from the information provided by the company that a first window appears when one of the games it publishes is opened, prior to the ATT request. This window requests the user's consent so that the company VOODOO and its partners can collect "certain technical data, in particular the advertising identifier and the user's IP address", in order, on the one hand, to "offer personalized advertisements" and, on the other hand, to "measure the performance of content and improve VOODOO games and applications".

6. This window presents sliding buttons positioned by default on “no consent” for each of these two purposes.

7. The restricted training also notes that a second level of information makes it possible to display the list of recipient partners according to each purpose, to detail the purposes, to inform users of the possibility of withdrawing their consent at any time and to warn them that their refusal will involve access to an “alternative version of the game including a potentially greater volume of non-targeted advertising”.

8. Thus, with regard to the elements presented by the company VOODOO justifying the implementation of a means to collect the user's consent to the use of the IDFV for advertising purposes, the restricted panel considers that the company complied with the injunction within the stipulated time limit.

FOR THESE REASONS

The restricted formation of the CNIL, after having deliberated, decides:

- to say that there is no need to liquidate the penalty;

- to make public, on the CNIL website and on the Légifrance website, this deliberation which will no longer identify the company by name at the end of a period of two years, the starting point being the publication of the deliberation no. SAN-2022-026 of December 29, 2022.
