Unfulfilled Obligation
Well, the defendant is accused of committing an infraction due to violation of the
Article 6 of the GDPR, “Legality of processing”, which states in section 1 the
Cases in which the processing of third-party data is considered lawful:
"1. Treatment will only be legal if at least one of the following is met

is part of or for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures;
c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;

In the present case, it is proven that a third party on February 27, 2022
requested through a phone call to the Vodafone customer service center
a duplicate of the SIM card of the complaining party, a duplicate that was provided to him,
Therefore, said third party had access to your bank details and carried out various

that proves the legal basis of the treatment carried out.
Thus, in the response to the information request from the AEPD dated August 8,

The mobile line \*\*\*TELEFONO.1 not recognized by the claimant was declared as

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of the Regulation

instruction of the procedure, for the purposes of setting the amount of the fine sanction
impose the claimed entity as responsible for an infraction classified in the
article 83.5.a) of the RGPD and 72.1 b) of the LOPDGDD, in an initial assessment,
The following factors are considered concurrent in the present case:
As aggravating factors:
- The circumstance of article 83.2.e) RGPD: “Any previous infraction committed by the
responsible or the person in charge of the treatment”.
Recital 148 of the GDPR states “In order to strengthen the application of the rules
of this Regulation \[...\]” and indicates in this regard that “It must, however,
Special attention should be paid to the nature, severity and duration of the infringement, its
intentional character \[...\] or to any pertinent infringement \[...\]”.
Thus, in accordance with section e) of article 83.2. GDPR, in determining the
amount of the administrative fine sanction cannot fail to be valued all
those previous infractions of the person responsible or of the person in charge of treatment in
in order to gauge the illegality of the analyzed behavior or the guilt of the subject

Furthermore, a correct interpretation of the provision of article 83.2.e) RGPD does not

The allegedly infringing conduct consisted of the processing of personal data
without legitimation - fraudulent duplicate SIM - did not act diligently in the
compliance with its obligation to ensure that personal data
that deals with respect the principle of legality.
Therefore, the omission of the appropriate diligence, aimed at the
identification of the person who provided personal data of which they were not the owner as their own,
allowed identity fraud and determined that the processing of personal data
of the claimant made by the defendant lacked legal basis under the
article 5.1.a) in relation to article 6.1. GDPR.
There are numerous sanctioning procedures processed by the AEPD in which
the defendant did not act with the required diligence, since it did not apply the necessary measures
and appropriate to verify the identity of the contracting party or the third party that provided as
your data of which you were not the owner. The procedures and sanctions in them
were imposed to graduate the sanction that must be imposed for the violation of the
article 6.1. GDPR that is attributed to you in this opening agreement.
Reason why the defendant's history of violations, in which there was a
significant omission of the necessary diligence to verify the identity of the person
provided the personal data of a third party as his own, affects the guilt and
illegality of the conduct assessed here.
As an example, the resolutions issued by the AEPD are cited in the following
sanctioning procedures processed against the defendant:
i.EXP 202204287 Resolution issued on October 24, 2022 in which it was imposed
a fine of 70,000 euros. The facts concerned a duplicate of the card
Fraudulent SIM without legitimation. Vodafone took advantage of one of the two
planned reductions.

planned.

a fine of 70,000 euros. The facts concerned a duplicate of the card
Fraudulent SIM without legitimation. Vodafone took advantage of one of the two reductions
planned.
- The evident link between the business activity of the defendant and the
processing of personal data of clients or third parties (article 83.2.k, of the RGPD
in relation to article 76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD).
The Judgment of the National Court of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006), in which,
regarding entities whose activity involves continuous data processing
of clients, indicates that “…the Supreme Court has been understanding that there is
recklessness whenever a legal duty of care is neglected, that is, when the
offender does not behave with the required diligence. And in assessing the degree of
diligence, the professionalism or otherwise of the subject must be especially considered, and not

There is no doubt that, in the case now examined, when the activity of the appellant
is constant and abundant handling of personal data, it must be insisted on
the rigor and exquisite care to comply with the legal preventions in this regard.”
As mitigating factors:
The claimed party proceeded to resolve the incident that was the subject of the claim in a manner
effective (art. 83.2 c).
It is necessary to graduate the sanction to be imposed on the person complained of and set it at the amount of 100,000
