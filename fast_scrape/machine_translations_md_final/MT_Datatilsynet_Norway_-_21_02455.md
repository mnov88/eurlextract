Decision to ban "Shinigami Eyes" in Norway
The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has decided to ban the processing of personal data in the browser tool «Shinigami Eyes». The background for the decision is a violation of the requirement for a legal basis and lack of information to users.

Decision to ban "Shinigami Eyes" in Norway

As "Shinigami Eyes" has no legal basis for the processing of personal data, the Data Inspectorate imposes a ban on the browser tool in Norway.

 - This case is a matter of principle. Subjective assessments and marking of identified individuals pose a threat to the free exchange of opinions on the Internet. The person who is marked will not receive information about it himself, and will not have the opportunity to respond, says Acting Director Janne Stang Dahl.

The Data Inspectorate received several complaints about the browser extension "Shinigami Eyes", which is available for Chrome and Firefox. The purpose of the browser extension is to identify and mark people on the internet and social media so that it becomes clear to users of the browser extension whether the person who has been marked is to be regarded as pro- or anti-trans people.
Negative impact on the public conversation

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has assessed whether the use of the tool could be based on a balance of interests as the legal basis. We have concluded that "Shinigami Eyes" has no legal basis for the processing of personal data.

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has previously announced that we would make a decision against the browser extension, and we have maintained our previous assessments in this decision.

- Privacy must take care of a room where it is possible to express oneself. The assessment of the quality of the statement should not depend on which unknown labels follow the person all over the internet, Dahl says.
Mozilla and Google are informed of the final decision

Despite repeated inquiries, the Data Inspectorate did not get in touch with the developer behind the expansion during the processing of the appeal.

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority will communicate our decision to Google and Mozilla, who are the ones making the expansion available on their platforms.

The developers behind the browser extension have a three-week appeal period from the time they receive the decision.
