Although it has not been established that the processed complaint has been carried out, the Data Protection Authority considers it right to point out that, without a dispute, the complainant's request for access to the said email was processed within a month of receiving Siminn hf. The company therefore took a stand at the request of the complainant within the time limit provided for in the third paragraph. Article 12 Regulation (EU) 2016/679, cf. Paragraph 1 Article 17 Act no. 90/2018.

You can do this:
