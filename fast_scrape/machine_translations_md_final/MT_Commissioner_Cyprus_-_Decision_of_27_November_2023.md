Breach of Personal Data on the network of the Open University of Cyprus

On March 30, 2023, a Personal Data Breach Notification was submitted to my Office on behalf of the Open University of Cyprus (hereinafter the "University"). A group of "hackers" (hereafter "invader") claimed via the social networking platform Twitter that they were responsible for the attack and the University was given a deadline to pay a ransom for the return / non-disclosure of the files leaked by the attack. When the time frame for paying the ransom had passed, the stolen data was published by the attacker and made available on the dark web.

After a full investigation of the incident, it was found that the leaked data pertains to students, graduates and other subjects (contractors of the University) which were temporarily stored on an affected server and were used to process tasks by employees.

For the incident, 11 complaints have been submitted to my Office by data subjects complaining that their personal data has been leaked due to the incident under review, which have been taken into account when examining the incident.

The University also sent me a list of actions it will take to strengthen the security of its systems. These actions will be implemented gradually based on a program that has been drawn up, starting from now, with a time point of completion in 2026, depending on the criticality, cost and prerequisites for their implementation.

After a legal and technical examination of all of the above, a violation of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 was found by not applying the appropriate security measures and a violation of the principle of "accountability".

Having considered all the facts of the case, the technical and organizational measures taken by the University prior to the attack and the mitigating factors cited by the University, as well as the fact that the University is part of the wider public sector, it was imposed on the University Administrative Fine of forty-five thousand (â‚¬45,000) euros.

A Mandate was also given to the University, within six months:

(a) appoint a system security officer, even temporary / substitute, who will supervise the implementation of the measures that the University intends to take,

(b) to inform me about the progress of the implementation of the measures that it has informed me that it intends to take.
