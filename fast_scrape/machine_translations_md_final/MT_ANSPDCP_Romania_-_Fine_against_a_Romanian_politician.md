The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing, completed, in June 2025, an investigation of the operator Georgescu Călin, during which it was found that the provisions of art. 4 para. (5) let. a) and b) of Law no. 506/2004 and of art. 12-14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 were violated.

As such, the operator was sanctioned as follows:

fine in the amount of 30,000 lei for violating the provisions of art. 4 para. (5) let. a) and b) of Law no. 506/2004; fine in the amount of 20,286.80 lei (the equivalent of 4,000 euros) for violating the provisions of art. 12-14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

The investigation was initiated following a complaint reporting a possible violation of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

During the investigation, it was found that, during the period 06.12.2024 - 03.04.2025, when accessing the operator's website, it was possible to store and access information stored on users' equipment, by installing cookie modules, without obtaining the users' express consent in advance and without them being informed, in accordance with the provisions of art. 4 para. (5) of Law no. 506/2004.

As such, the operator was fined for violating the provisions of art. 4 para. (5) letters a) and b) of Law no. 506/2004 on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.

In this context, we specify that art. 4 para. (5) of the aforementioned normative act establishes the following:

"(5) The storage of information or obtaining access to information stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is permitted only with the cumulative fulfillment of the following conditions:

a) the subscriber or user in question has expressed his/her consent;

b) the subscriber or user in question has been provided, prior to expressing consent, in accordance with the provisions of art. 12 of Law no. 677/2001, as subsequently amended and supplemented, with clear and complete information which:

(i) shall be presented in an easily understandable language and shall be easily accessible to the subscriber or user;

(ii) shall include mentions regarding the purpose of processing the information stored by the subscriber or user or the information to which he/she has access.

In the event that the provider allows third parties to store or access information stored in the terminal equipment of the subscriber or user, the information in accordance with points (i) and (ii) will include the general purpose of the processing of this information by third parties and the way in which the subscriber or user can use the settings of the internet browsing application or other similar technologies to delete the stored information or to deny third parties access to this information.”

On the other hand, the investigation also found that the operator Georgescu Călin did not inform the data subjects whose personal data were collected and processed through the contact form (surname, first name, e-mail, telephone number) available on its website, during the period 06.12.2024 - 03.04.2025, thus violating the provisions of art. 12-14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, in relation to the criteria for individualizing the sanctions provided for in art. 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the operator was fined.
