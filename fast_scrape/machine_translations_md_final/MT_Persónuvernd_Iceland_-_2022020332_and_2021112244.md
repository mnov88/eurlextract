2.
Complainant's point of view

The complainant relies on the fact that Íslandspóst's Customs Agency maintains a special register of stamp collectors, including itself, for the purpose of taking all mail that the complainant and other Icelandic stamp collectors receive from abroad for customs processing. In the complainant's opinion, it cannot be considered normal that all mail he receives from abroad is taken for customs processing, regardless of whether it is traceable or general letters.

3.
Sjónarmið Íslandspósts ohf.

Íslandspóstur ohf. therefore refuses to maintain a separate register of Icelandic stamp collectors. In the aforementioned letter of Íslandspósts ohf. states that all product shipments to Iceland are subject to customs duties according to the customs law. Íslandspóstur ohf. it is therefore appropriate that over time the employees of Íslandspóst ohf. built up knowledge, which enables them to assess shipments that have the characteristics of containing value and must, according to law, be subject to customs processing. On behalf of Íslandspósts ohf. it is specifically stated that it follows from the provisions of the Customs Act and Íslandspóst's duties as a customs broker to be alert for all shipments arriving in the country, even if they are marked as gifts or sent as ordinary letters.

II.
Conclusion

Scope of law no. 90/2018, on personal protection and processing of personal data, and regulation (EU) 2016/679, cf. Paragraph 1 Article 4 of the Act, and thus the authority of Personal Protection, cf. Paragraph 1 Article 39 of the Act, covers the processing of personal data that is partially or fully automated and the processing of personal data that is or is to become part of a file by methods other than automatic.

The complainant believes that Íslandspóstur ohf. maintain a special register of stamp collectors, including himself, for the purpose of taking all correspondence received by the complainant from abroad for customs processing. Íslandspóstur ohf. therefore refuses to maintain a separate register of stamp collectors, but accepts that over time the employees of Íslandspósts ohf. built up knowledge, which enables them to assess shipments that have the characteristics of containing value and must, according to law, be subject to customs processing.

With reference to this, there is no evidence that personal data has been processed in violation of Act no. 90/2018, cf. regulation (EU) 2016/679. In addition, Personal Protection does not consider it necessary for the organization to use additional powers, which are given to it in Act no. 90/2018, in order to investigate it further.

Ruling:

It is unproven that the processing of personal information about the complainant took place at Íslandspósti ohf. which violated law no. 90/2018, on personal protection and processing of personal information.
