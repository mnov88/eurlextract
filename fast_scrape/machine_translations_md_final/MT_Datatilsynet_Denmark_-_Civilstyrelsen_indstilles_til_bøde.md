News
The Danish Data Protection Agency notifies the National Board of Health and Welfare to the police and recommends a fine of DKK 100,000. The Authority assesses that the National Board of Health and Welfare has not complied with the requirements for an appropriate level of security

The Danish Data Protection Agency became aware of the case when a complainant's party representative complained about the Danish Civil Agency's handling of complainant's information.

It appears from the case that the National Board of Health and Welfare v / Erstatningsn√¶vnet returned a USB connector for complaints, which contained more than 800 pages of information about complaints of a sensitive and confidential nature, which had been lost when the complainant was received.

The USB connector was not encrypted, and the agency did not have guidelines targeted at the agency's caseworkers regarding any handling of removable storage devices and portable media.

The Danish Civil Agency became aware of the breach on 26 August 2020, but did not report the breach to the Danish Data Protection Agency in violation of the rules in Article 33 of the Data Protection Ordinance.

Lack of technical and / or organizational measures
The Danish Data Protection Agency finds that the Danish Civil Agency's processing of personal data has not been in accordance with the rules on appropriate security.

In its assessment, the Danish Data Protection Agency has emphasized that encryption of removable storage devices that contain personal data (including USB connectors) must be regarded as a necessary and required security measure.

In continuation of this, the Authority has attached importance to the fact that removable storage means with personal data have a sharpened risk profile in relation to the handling of personal data, and that encryption is a measure that is relatively easy for the data controller to implement.

In addition, the Danish Data Protection Agency has emphasized that the agency did not have guidelines targeted and known by the agency's case officers in relation to any handling of USB connectors, including dispatch.

Why police report?
The Danish Data Protection Agency always makes a concrete assessment of the seriousness of the case pursuant to Article 83 (1) of the Regulation. 2, in assessing which sanction is, in the Authority's opinion, the most appropriate.

In its recommendation to the police, the Danish Data Protection Agency has, among other things, emphasized that it is an essential security measure to have procedures that cover all treatments and to ensure encryption of USB connectors. In addition, encryption has been a widespread and recognized technical measure for many years that should be easily counteracted by the data controller.

In addition, it is a board of a state authority that must generally be assumed to process large amounts of sensitive and confidential information, and where it must be considered essential that a guide has been prepared targeted at the agency's case officers in relation to any handling of USB -stick.
