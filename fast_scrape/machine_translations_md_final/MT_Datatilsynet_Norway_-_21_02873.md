Notice oftermination of the proceeding inregardto the protectionofpersonaldata

The proceeding of the Estonian DataProtection Inspectorate concerned the claim of a Lithuania
citizen                     (complainant) in regard to the fact that the
violated the requirements of GDPR.

Given the above, we initiated a supervision proceeding on the basis of clause 56 (3) 8) of the
PersonalData Protection Act.

During the proceeding,                      stated the following:

Our position is that in the case that was detailed in the inquiry, which includes a breach in
security regarding the processingof personaldata,                        is notat fault.

              has not processed the personal data of                        in their system in
relation to the described case because the services described in the case were notordered in
the systems of                       nor according to                       ’s guidelines. The
          application does notallow the commencementof ordering the services describedin
the inquiry and the applicationdoes nothave the functionality to do such things. The
is a tool for authentication and electronic signing which is meant for signing documents

electronically andlogging in to differentenvironments. We stress that                     does
notand has never takenpayments from               users.

It is true that on 23 March 2021 we requested on the             website that users update the
Android systemcomponents of their phones in the Google Play Store. The reasonfor this was
that Google had released a broken update for Google Chrome and Android SystemWebview
which was causing errors in differentapplications, including the             application. The

problemwasalsoconfirmedbyGooglethemselves.Googlethenreleasedanupdatewhichfixed
the issues that were caused by the previous update and the newupdate was required for not
only the seamless operation of               but also other applications. More information
regarding Google’s problemcan be found here.

Through the            website, we directedthe users ofthe service to applythe fixedupdate in
order for the service to function properly once again. Please note thatthere were no links, QR-

codes, or telephone numbers in the message we publishedon the              website. We simply
requested our clients to update their Google Chrome and Android System Webview in the
Google Play Store. The message readsas follows:                                        FORDATAPRIVACYANDFREEDOMOFINFORMATION

          application started crashing? Please update Google Chrome and Android System
Webview in Google Play Store. Google released a broken updatethatcauses applications to

crash and they have now also released fix for it. If thatdoes nothelp, please callour helpline
or contactus through the e-mailform.

In the message,                       did not request clients to scan a single QR-code, and
furthermore, the shortnumber1394is notused by us nor is itunder our control.

Therefore,                      does not knowwhere the person could have received the QR-
code for scanning or what exactly could have happened.                       doesnothave any
connections to the case besides requesting on our website that              users update their
Android components,as was described above.

                     has no knowledgeof the services provided by                        or the
details connected to the order that was described in the inquiry. Furthermore,
               does not have a contractual or any other kind of relationship with

                   .

Basedon the above, the Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate did not identify any violation of
the GDPR. For this reason, we are terminating the supervision proceedings.

This decision may be challenged within 30 days by submitting one of the two:
    -   A challenge to the Director General of the Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate
        pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act , or
                                                                                              2
    -   Anappealto anadministrative court under the Code ofAdministrative Court Procedure
