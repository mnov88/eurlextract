This situation led to unauthorized disclosure and / or unauthorized access to the personal data of a number of 6 individuals, between 16 November 2020 - 18 May 2021 (transmission of service contracts to erroneous e-mail addresses, unauthorized access of the operator's employees to the personal data of Vodafone customers without any requests from them). & # 13;
With regard to security breaches notified under Regulation (EU) no. 611/2013, the National Supervisory Authority found that the operator did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data processing, to ensure that personal data can be accessed only by persons authorized for the purposes authorized by law and protect personal data stored or transmitted against unlawful processing, access or disclosure. & # 13;
Thus, the operator processed the personal data of 64 individuals by unauthorized access to their data by the operator's employees between November 4, 2020 - June 22, 2021. & # 13;
