        parking policy, although it has joined the deliberation FO no. 14/2016 of 21 January

        2016 , but this affiliation took place through an agreement that was not finalized

       say rightly that any implementing measure that has already been taken will be immediately reversed

       to be made is declared unfounded.

        The judgment mainly contains the following points for attention:

        • Annulment of decision on the merits no. 31/2022 of 4 March 2022 of the Litigation Chamber.

        • The Marktenhof states that there is a problem of legality and substantive motivation because the

            chairman of the Litigation Chamber after the decision to sit with three members in accordance with Article

            43 RIO , has taken a new decision to single-handedly decide on the merits

            as a conflict of interest has arisen on the part of one of the sitting members

            established between the hearing and the deliberation on the decision. Furthermore, it states

            Marktenhof that the annulled decision is not in accordance with the principle of due care, the fair

            play principle, the duty to hear and the right to adversarial due to no time before

            the summary conclusion the defendants were notified that they had committed infringements of the

            obligation of transparency stipulated in Articles 5.1 a), 12.1 and 14.1 a) GDPR.

   32. Following the judgment, the Litigation Chamber decides on 21 December 2022 to proceed to the

       resume the file with a view to making a new decision. The consideration that

       This is based on the fact that, notwithstanding the annulment of

       the aforementioned decision by the judgment of the Marktenhof, is still caught by the initial complaint

       submitted on November 5, 2020 as declared admissible on January 18, 2021. To this end,

       proceeded to reopen the debates and set new deadlines for conclusion, so that

       parties can take a position on:

            • the legal basis on which the City of Kortrijk adheres for the period from 1 January 2020 to 1

                September 2020 bases personal data concerning the holder of a

                to request a number plate from the FPS Mobility and Transport for the identification of

                persons who, through the use of a vehicle, parking fee, tax or

                GDPR), and

            • to specify whether there is a sufficient legal basis after the entry into force of the GDPR

                for the City of Kortrijk is to request information from the

                DIV on the one hand, and for the FPS Mobility and Transport, Directorate-General for Road Transport and

                Road safety to disclose data on the basis of a consultation, on the other hand,

                this in light of article 6.1.e in conjunction with 6.3 GDPR (legal basis of public interest) and article 24

                GDPR (accountability)),

                controller and the legal basis in light of the principle of

                lawfulness, fairness and transparency ((articles 5. 1, a) GDPR , 12.1 GDPR and 14.1

                a) and c) GDPR) and how the accountability obligation was fulfilled (art

                5.2 GDPR and 24 GDPR).

        The parties are notified of the following deadlines for conclusion:

            • the deadline for the complainant's statement of reply is set at 24

       dated December 21, 2022.

   36. On 5 April 2023, the minutes of the hearing will be submitted to the parties

       decides to include it in its deliberations.

II. Motivation

    a) Competence of the Data Protection Authority

    37. The Marktenhof, in its judgment of 26 October 2022, rejected decision on the merits no. 31/2022 of

        4 March 2022 nullified on procedural grounds, but ruled in the same judgment that

        the plea invoked by the defendant1 in which the jurisdiction of the GBA is contested

        to monitor compliance with the GDPR by municipalities and only the Flemish supervisory committee for

        the processing of personal data is authorized to supervise the processing of

        personal data by Flemish municipalities and to handle complaints in that regard

        in accordance with Article 10/1, §1, and Article 10/7, §4, of the Decree of 18 July 2008 on the

        electronic administrative data traffic, fails by law. The complete destruction of the

        decision on the merits no. 31/2022, but at the same time the confirmation by the Market Court that the GBA,

        and therefore the Disputes Chamber, is indeed competent to take cognizance of a complaint about the

        processing of personal data by a Flemish municipality leads to the Disputes Chamber

        to resume its previous decision unchanged with regard to this part.

    38. The defendants argue that the Data Protection Authority, including its

        bodies, including the Disputes Chamber, would be without jurisdiction in this case. The

        After all, the defendants argue that the Flemish Supervisory Commission is authorized to carry out supervision

        practice compliance with (constitutional) legal and other regulatory provisions

        personal data protection carried out by an authority as referred to in Article 10/1, §1 of

        the Decree of 18 July 2008 on electronic administrative data traffic (hereinafter:

        the “decree of 18 July 2008”) when this supervision is part of a state competence.

    39. As already explained in its decision 15/2020 of 15 April 2020 15 , the

        Data Protection Authority (“DPA”) competent to handle this case.

14Cf. Article 10/1 of the Decree of 18 July 2008 “regarding electronic administrative data traffic”, as inserted by
Article 20 of the Decree of 8 June 2018 “adapting the Decrees to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the

     Regulatory Powers on Personal Data Protection

    40. First of all, the Litigation Chamber emphasizes that the GDPR is a regulation that directly

        applicable in the Union and may not be transposed into national law by the Member States.

        Provisions from the GDPR may also not be specified in national regulations,

        except on the points where the AVG expressly makes this possible. The data protection

        has therefore in principle become a matter of European law. 16

    41. The issuance of any regulatory provisions on personal data by the

        federal or state government must therefore take place within the framework that has been established

        by the GDPR. In this regard, the Litigation Chamber refers to article 22 of the Constitutional

        case law on this matter of the Constitutional Court, which states that the right to respect for the

        private life, as guaranteed in Article 22 of the Constitution (as well as in treaties), a wide

        scope and, inter alia, the protection of personal data and personal data

        information includes. 17

    42. With regard to the right to respect for private life, Article 22 of the Constitution provides that:

        “Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, except in cases

        and under the conditions laid down by law.

        The law, decree or rule referred to in Article 134 shall ensure the protection of that right.”

    43. Since article 22 of the Constitution dates from after the state reform of 1980, the

        The word “law” in that provision means a federal law. Restrictions on the by that

        rights guaranteed by a constitutional provision cannot, in principle, therefore be granted by a decree or a

        ordinance be established. This would mean that an interference in private life - including

        understood the processing of personal data – cannot result from decrees or
                       18
        ordinances.

    44. Since such an interpretation limits the powers of the Communities and Regions

        would erode, have, among others, the Constitutional Court and the Legislation Department of the Council

        of State held that imposing general restrictions is a matter for the federal legislature

        reserved matter. In that case, the sub-areas retain the possibility to, within their

        respect legislation in this regard.

    45. In short, the Litigation Chamber finds that the federal government and the communities and the

        regions are empowered to issue general and specific rules respectively

        on the protection of private and family life and this only on the points where the

        AVG allows this and within the rules of the AVG that are directly applicable in the Belgian

        legal order. 20 Also where specific rules on the protection of personal data are

        set by the federal governments, within the space that the AVG allows for this, the

        general rules arising from federal legislation on personal data protection te

        are respected.

    Supervisory authorities in the context of personal data protection

    46. The defendant refers to Article 57(1)(f) GDPR and Article 51(1) GDPR from which it follows that

        all member states determine which public authority will carry out the supervisory tasks and that it

        it is possible to designate more than one supervisory authority.

        1, second paragraph WOG expressly confirms, also the federal states themselves

    Supervisory powers of the supervisory authorities

    48. In view of the competing powers set out above

       personal data protection, Article 141 of the Constitution instructs the legislator

       procedure to avoid conflicts of competence between legislative standards. 24

       This task was entrusted to the legislation section of the Council of State. Regarding

       the powers of the aforementioned supervisory authorities refer to the Disputes Chamber

       to advice no. 61.267/2/AV of 27 June 2017 of the Legislation Division of the Council of State

       which was issued in response to the preliminary draft that led to the WOG. In this

       In its opinion, the Council discussed in detail the rules that divide competences with regard to the supervision of

       data protection. 25

    49. In the preliminary draft referred to above, the Council of State stated that the federal government should have a

       supervisory authority with “general authority (…) over all

       processing of personal data, including those that take place in matters for which

       the Communities and the Regions are competent”. Such an arrangement is without prejudice

       to the competence of the Communities and Regions, \[…\]”, said the Council of State. 27

       Consequently, according to the Council of State, the regional supervisory authorities can only

       be empowered to monitor the specific rules they have issued

       for data processing in the context of activities that fall within their competence, and this

       of course only insofar as the GDPR still allows Member States to adopt specific provisions

       and the provisions of the WOG are not prejudiced. The Council confirms this

       van State stated its position in advice no. 37.288/3 of 15 July 2004, as cited in advice no.

       61.267/2/AV of 27 June 2017, in which the Council of State considered the following about the

       competence of the Commission for the protection of privacy, the

       predecessor of the GBA:

       “The authors of the draft rightly assume that the legislature cannot detract

       to the powers of the Commission for the Protection of Privacy,

       established by the law of 8 December 1992. In implementation of the directive, the federal legislator has

       establish a supervisory body, which has general authority over all

24 Article 141 Constitution: “The law establishes the procedure to settle the conflicts between the law, the decree and the provisions referred to in Article 134,
as well as between decrees and between the rules referred to in Article 134.”

        processing of personal data, including those that take place in matters for which

        the communities and the regions are competent.” 28

    50. In short, the GBA, as a federal supervisory authority, is the competent authority for supervision

        abide by the general rules, including the mandatory provisions of the GDPR that do not contain any further

        need national implementation. 29 This is also the case if the data processing relates

        has on a matter that falls under the competence of the communities or the regions and/or

        if the controller is a public authority that falls under the communities

        or the regions, such as a municipality, even if the federal state itself has one

        supervisory authority within the meaning of the GDPR.

    51. In view of the above, the Disputes Chamber concludes that in order for a federal state

        supervisor would be competent, it is by no means sufficient that the data processing relates

        has on a federal state matter, in this case the matter of the additional traffic regulations.

        The federal state in question must also, within the space that the GDPR still leaves for the member states,

        have issued specific rules for the processing of personal data in the framework

        of that matter. It is only the supervision of compliance with those specific state rules that

        can be entrusted to the state supervisor.

    52. The Litigation Chamber emphasizes that the notion of 'specific rules' should not be interpreted too broadly.

        the cited advice of the Council of State shows that the term 'specific rules' refers to

        specific restrictions or special guarantees, which deviate from or go beyond the general ones

        provisions, warranties and limitations contained in or arising from the GDPR or the

        federal law. In other words, the mere fact that the Länder (by decree or decree)

        Implementing or confirming a general rule does not mean that rule defines the character

        gets from a ‘specific rule’. There is only a specific rule when the Länder,

        using the space that the GDPR leaves for this, additional safeguards or restrictions

        Set up.

    53. In addition, any limitations of an authority's powers for the

        data protection under the GDPR would only be possible if at the level of a

        state a supervisor would have been established that meets all the requirements under the

        European Treaties are assigned to the supervisor, which also includes all tasks and

       authority from the supervisory authority. In this connection, they refer in particular to the

       Articles 51 to 59 of the GDPR.

    54. The Litigation Chamber notes that the disputed processing operations were carried out on the basis of three
                                   30
       general deliberations granted by the sectoral committee set up by the

       Commission for the Protection of Privacy (hereinafter: “CPP”). TheCBPL end

       sectoral committees were abolished by the law of 30 July 2018 on protection
                                                                                                  31
       of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. The

       authorizations and the relevant processing of personal data by the defendant in the

       within the framework of the relevant authorizations, namely the communication of data from the

       Crossroads database of the vehicles - in particular the registration plate - to the applicant

       controller in the context of its additional powers

       parking regulations, must therefore be checked against the new legal since 25 May 2018

       framework, in particular the provisions of the GDPR.

    55. Within the current legal framework, and in particular pursuant to Article 35/1 of the Law of 15

       August 2012 on the creation and organization of a federal services integrator and the law 32

       of September 5, 2018 establishing the Information Security Committee, it is

       Information Security Committee (hereinafter: “ICC”), in particular authorized to hold deliberations

       regarding certain communications of personal data, including the notice

       of data contained in the Crossroads Bank for Vehicles. Article 35/1, § 4, of the Federal Law

       Service Integrator specifies that “the deliberations of the Information Security Committee with

       reasons and \[have\] a general binding scope between the parties and

       towards third parties”. Based on the same article, the Data Protection Authority can

       deliberation of the Information Security Committee at all times, regardless of when it became

       granted, check against higher legal standards, such as the GDPR. Consequently, the Litigation Chamber

       authorized to assess whether the authorizations and the processing based on this are

       performed comply with the obligations as provided for in the GDPR.

    56. In view of the above, the Disputes Chamber concludes that this case does not concern an assessment

       of a data processing by an authority in accordance with article 10/1, §1 of the decree

       of 18 July 2008 on electronic administrative data traffic to a specific

       rule issued by the state government within its state jurisdiction. As

    the permissions in question have been shown to be general in nature and the testing against the GDPR of these

    authorizations together with the personal data processing carried out on the basis thereof

    have been carried out thus belong to the Disputes Chamber.

 b) Controllers

57. Respondent 2 believes that it can be deduced from the judgment of the Marktenhof of 26 October 2022 that

    the current decision can only concern defendant 1, because the Court is in the ruling part

    has ordered the re-examination of the complaint 'against the City of Kortrijk' (i.e. defendant1).
    Because the new procedure for the Disputes Chamber with the letter of December 21, 2022 to

    reopening the debates was addressed to both Defendant 1 and Defendant 2, casts

    Defendant 2 argues that the Disputes Chamber thus exceeds the order of the Market Court.

58. The Disputes Chamber refutes this by pointing out that the appeal before the Marktenhof against

    decision on the merits 31/2022 was brought by only defendant 1, with admittedly
    forced intervention of defendant 2 in order to make its views known and the

    to declare the judgment common to her without making any claims as to her subjective rights

    configure. It is therefore self-evident that the operative part of the judgment is only

    pronounces on "the story set by the City of Kortrijk" and "recommends the Disputes Chamber of the

    Data Protection Authority, composed differently, the complaint against the City of Kortrijk again
    with due observance of the considerations of the Marktenhof”. The Marktenhof can

    after all, refrain from ruling on any appeal lodged by the defendant2, this in the absence of an appeal

    filed by defendant 2. Moreover, the Marktenhof does not state at any point in the judgment

    that Defendant 2 has not acted as

    controller within the meaning of Article 4. 7) GDPR. However, it is the opposite
    case, since the judgment refers again and again to 'the City of Kortrijk and the FPS'. The decision

    should therefore be that pursuant to annulment of decision no. 31/2022 relating to

    both defendants and the statement in common with regard to defendant 2 of the judgment pursuant to

    the appeal lodged by defendant 1, the proceedings before the Litigation Chamber pursuant to the order

    of the Marktenhof relates to both defendants.

59. Although Defendant 2 continues to insist that it was not targeted by the complaint and that it was only addressed

    against defendant 1, the Disputes Chamber cannot follow that argumentation. After all, it is one

    factually given that defendant 1 has submitted the assessment notice regarding the parking tax –

    which is the actual reason for the complaint – could not have been directed to the complainant without it

    the provision by defendant2 to defendant1 of the identification data of the complainant
    The complainant therefore quite rightly raises the question on which legal basis defendant 1 relies

    period from January 1, 2020 to September 1, 2020 to process personal data concerning the

    holder of a license plate to be requested from defendant 2 for the identification of persons who are Decision on the substance 105/2023 - 16/31

    due to the use of a vehicle, parking fee, tax or parking fee and on

    what legal basis defendant 2 for that same period to defendant 1

    provided personal data. Not only had, according to the complainant, defendant 1

    should not request personal data from defendant 2, but should have been defendant 2

    not be allowed to provide personal data to defendant 1 at the moment that the latter is
    such request was addressed to defendant 2. In other words: the processing of the identification data of

    the complainant by the defendant 1 in order to send him a tax assessment notice regarding the

    parking, was not possible without prior provision by defendant 2 of

    this identification data to Defendant 1. Defendant 2 believes that its argumentation is supported

    can find in the request of the complainant to impose a sanction on defendant 1, but
    ignores the substantive account of the facts of the complainant, which unmistakably shows that

    Defendant 1 was unable to process the complainant's identification data until they were

    provided by the defendant 2. The decision should therefore also be that both the City of Kortrijk (respondent

    1) if the FPS Mobility and Transport (defendant 2) must be regarded as defendants.

 c) Rights of defense and principles of good administration

     Prior

60. The Marktenhof states in its judgment that both in the conclusions and during the hearing of the

    Litigation Chamber's debate has been limited to the question of the legal basis stipulated in Article

    6.1 GDPR and that the Dispute Chamber, if this was its reading of the complainant's conclusion,

    Defendant 1 and Defendant 2 should have been informed in writing of the fact that they were by that

    terms were also accused of violations of Articles 5.1 a), 12.1 and 14.1 a) GDPR

    in order to respect the principle of due care, the fair play principle, the duty to hear and the right to
    to respect contradiction. Having regard to the complete annulment of the decision on the merits

    31/2022, the Disputes Chamber also resumes its considerations regarding the rights of

    defense and principles of good administration prior to the decision on the merits

    31/2022 were raised with the addition of its new recitals after the resumption of the

    dossier and the conclusions received in the context of the reopening of the debates, as well as her
    considerations on the legal basis, supplemented by its considerations on the

    transparency duty.

     The complaint

61. Defendant 1 asserts that the rights of defense would have been violated because it did not
    it would be clear against which complaint it should defend itself. Defendant 1 maintains that there are three

    complaints would have been submitted by the complainant and refers to the documents submitted by the complainant

    were transferred on 10 August 2020, 5 November 2020 and 7 December 2020. Substantive decision 105/2023 - 17/31

62. In this regard, the Disputes Chamber notes that the complainant has tried for the first time to file his complaint

    to be filed on August 10, 2020, but since the complaint only contains the last page of the

    complaint form – which only concerned the date of the complaint, the signature as well as the name and

    contains the complainant's first name – did the complainant submit the full complaint form on 5

    November 2020. Subsequently, documents were provided by the complainant on 6 December 2020

    substantiation of his complaint filed on November 5, 2020. Contrary to what Defendant 1
    states, the complainant has thus lodged a single complaint, namely that which was lodged on

    complete manner dated November 5, 2020. This complaint was therefore enclosed with the letter sent on 25

    February 2021 was communicated to the parties to establish the calendar of conclusions and with

    the request to file defenses. It is only after the complaint became complete

    submitted and the complainant has provided the necessary supporting documents that the complaint has been accepted by the

    First-line service could be declared admissible, as was done. In addition, has
    Defendant 1 received a copy of the file, making all elements available to him

    had to defend himself.

63. Respondent 1 argues in the statement of 28 February 2023 that both the letter dated 21 December

    2022 of the Disputes Chamber with questions to the parties and to reopen the debates, if the

    subsequent conclusion of the complainant which, according to defendant 1, would be additional allegations
    are inadmissible due to an unauthorized extension of the powers of the

    Litigation room. Defendant 2 also argues that the question asked by the Disputes Chamber whether there

    after the entry into force of the GDPR is a sufficient legal basis to be based on a

    deliberation to disclose data, in light of article 6.1 e) in conjunction with 6.3 GDPR and article 24

    AVG, is not part of the complainant's complaint.

64. The Disputes Chamber points out that the judgment of the Marktenhof of 26 October 2022 expressly

    determines the following:

     “After all, it cannot be deduced from those very brief terms that the complainant is Stad Kortrijk

     and accused the FPS of violations of the duty of transparency set out in Articles 5.1 a,

     12.1 and 14.1 a GDPR. In any case, these articles from the GDPR are not mentioned there and the
     Litigation Chamber, if this was her reading of the complainant's conclusion, City of Kortrijk and the FPS

     must inform them in writing of the fact that they have been accused of that wording

     violations of those relevant articles of law.”

65. Well, in the reading of the Litigation Chamber - of the complaint and the conclusion of the complainant - the

    complainant that he remained completely in the dark about the legal basis on which the
    processing of the personal data concerning him is based. Since it totally

    it is unclear to the complainant on what legal basis the defendants are personal data

    process, it follows ipso facto that regarding that legal basis and the identity of the

    controller, in particular defendant1 who invokes legal succession, also Decision on the merits 105/2023 - 18/31

       the required transparency is lacking. Since the defendants are in their submissions
       prior to the decision on the merits no. 31/2022 have invoked the existence of

       deliberations as a legal basis coupled with the principle of legal succession

       on the basis of defendant 1, the Disputes Chamber has therefore logically asked whether a

       deliberation may be a sufficient legal basis in light of the GDPR.

   66. In view of the above quote from the judgment of the Marktenhof and the fact that the Marktenhof

       the Disputes Chamber orders that the complaint be re-examined, with due observance of the

       considerations of the Market Court, the Disputes Chamber complied with the judgment by
       submit the three questions as included in the letter of 21 December 2022 to the parties

       to take a position on this. In no way does the Litigation Chamber go to her

       jurisdiction, contrary to what the defendants try to claim. The three

       questions are precisely set up very precisely to within the contours of the present complaint

       to find out the legal basis stipulated in the GDPR, as well as to determine the extent to which the defendants are involved

       provide transparency regarding that legal basis and the identity of the

       controller.

   67. Respondent 1 still maintains in its statement of 28 February 2023 that it is from several non-
       coordinated complaint forms, e-mails and letters should deduce which infringements her

       would be charged factually and legally, this in order to attempt to make the complaint inadmissible

       declared, or at least rejected as unfounded. The Disputes Chamber points this out

       that the complaint was submitted by a citizen for whom it is not a requirement that the complaint

       indicates legal provisions which, according to the complainant, have been infringed. It is
                                                            33
       however, from subsequent proceedings and documents, including the decision on the merits

       31/2022 and the letter of 21 December 2022, it is absolutely clear what the defendants are against

       should defend. That the defendants, including defendant 1, do indeed have a
       have a full understanding of the possible infringements that they are charged with

       also emerges from the detailed explanation of the defendants regarding the merits of the

       complaint.

   68. The Disputes Chamber adds that it complies with the judgment of the Court on all points

       Marktenhof of October 26, 2022 by making the current decision in a different composition

       than those in the decision on the merits 31/2022 taken on March 4, 2022. In this regard,

       defendant 1 must reserve all rights with regard to the letter of 21 December
       2022 addressed by the Litigation Chamber to the parties to which they have been informed

       of the new composition of the seat of which Mr. Hielke Hijmans, who as

       sole chairman of the Litigation Chamber took the decision on the merits 31/2022, did not participate

33Marktenhof judgment 2022/AR/292 Decision on the merits 105/2023 - 19/31

    matters. The fact that the aforementioned letter was signed by Mr. Hielke Hijmans brings

    Defendant 1 undertakes to reserve all rights in this respect.

69. The Disputes Chamber emphasizes that the chairperson of the Disputes Chamber by acting in this way

    act, has merely implemented Article 43 of the Rules of Procedure. It is

    after all, the chairman of the Litigation Chamber who decides on the distribution of the files among the
    members of the Disputes Chamber and it is he who decides that the Disputes Chamber will sit with three members.

    This decision of the chairman of the Litigation Chamber is strictly necessary for the composition

    of the seat and, as such, to comply with the order of the Markenhof to

    re-examine the other composition of the complaint, which then happened and this like

    imposed without any intervention by Mr. Hielke Hijmans.

     Decision on admissibility and decision on readiness for treatment on the merits

70. Respondent 1 argues that the 'alleged' decision of the First Line Service, according to her, does not

    contains clarification of the facts or the alleged infringements. Defendant 1 also believes in the letter

    of the Disputes Chamber dated February 25, 2021, it is not possible to deduce which the alleged

    infringements, nor what the possible sanctions would be. Defendant 1 adds that it
    it is unknown to her that there is still no actual decision of the Frontline Service, as well as that

    it was not notified of any decision of the Dispute Chamber regarding readiness

    preliminary treatment on the merits. This leads defendant 1 to the conclusion that the rights of defense

    have been violated, as well as the principles of good administration.

71. The Disputes Chamber clarifies that the decision of the First Line Service to admissibility of
    the complaint is included in an e-mail addressed to the Disputes Chamber and the relevant e-mail

    forms an integral part of the administrative file. As a result, the Disputes Chamber has

    the procedure for treatment has commenced on the merits. The Litigation Chamber brings the parties (both

    complainant, as defendants) in a single letter informed of both the admissibility of the complaint

    in accordance with Article 61 WOG – this provision sensu stricto requires that only the complainant be notified

    is made of the admissibility of his complaint –, as the commencement of the procedure
    grounds containing all information in accordance with Article 98 WOG in conjunction with Article 95, §2 WOG.

72. With regard to the decision on admissibility, as well as the decision that the file is ready

    is for consideration on the merits, the Disputes Chamber therefore refers to the e-mail dated 25 February

    2021 with the letter and accompanying documents attached thereto, in which the parties

    be expressly informed of the fact that the complaint will be lodged by the
    First-line service was declared admissible and the Disputes Chamber decided that the file

    is ready for treatment. This means that the letter with conclusion calendar as

    as such shall serve as notice to the parties, both of the decision on admissibility and

    regarding readiness for treatment on the merits, so that both article 61 WOG and article 98

    WOG in conjunction with Article 95, § 2 were respected. Decision on the substance 105/2023 - 20/31

        Insofar as defendant 1 raises that neither the decision of the First Line Service regarding

        admissibility, nor the decision of the Disputes Chamber regarding readiness for

        indicate the grounds on which the treatment is based on, the Litigation Chamber must do so

        to point out that the aforementioned decisions on the one hand of the Primary Service, and on the other hand of the

        Litigation Chamber are not final decisions, but merely decisions that precede the

        final decision of the Litigation Chamber. The decision on admissibility of the complaint is one

        decision taken by the First Line Service based on the submitted documents

        checked whether Article 58(1) 34and Article 60(2) 35 WOG have been complied with. The letter with

        conclusioncalendarcontainsallinformationprescribedbyArticle 98WOGeis precise

        directed to based on the defenses filed by the parties, respecting the

        rights of defence, to motivate the decision of the Litigation Chamber. The current decision

        must be justified as such.

   73. Respondent 1 also argues that it is unknown to her why the Disputes Chamber does not have

       decided to follow up on the complaint in a different way. The Disputes Chamber emphasizes that there is

       there is in no way a negative obligation to state reasons, so that it is not obliged to do so

       explain why it would not have used the other options provided for

       article 95, §1 WOG.

    d) Legal basis for transparency obligation

   74. The complainant asks what legal basis defendant 1 relies on for the period from 1 January

       2020 until September 1, 2020 to process personal data concerning the holder of a

       number plate request from defendant 2 for identification of persons affected by the use

       owe a parking fee, tax or parking fee for a vehicle and on what legal basis

       the defendant 2 has provided personal data to the defendant 1 for that same period

       provided.

34Article 58. Anyone can submit a complaint or request to the Data Protection Authority in writing, dated and signed.
\[…\]

35Article 60. \[…\]
A complaint is admissible when:

-it is drawn up in one of the national languages;
- contains a statement of the facts and the necessary indications for the identification of the processing to which it relates;

-it falls within the competence of the Data Protection Authority.
\[…\] Decision on the substance 105/2023 - 21/31

        Deliberation and legal succession

   75. Defendant 1 invokes deliberation FO no. 02/2016 of 21 January 2016, as well as 36

       deliberation FO no. 18/2015 of 28 May 2015 37to state that they already have their own access

       to the DIV directory for the identification of persons who, through the use of a

       vehicle parking tax.

   76. As defendant 1 itself points out, the beneficiaries of deliberation FO no. 02/2016 are the private

       concession holders of the Flemish cities and municipalities, as well as the municipal ones

       independent agencies. As an autonomous municipal company, AGB Parko is an external company

       independent agency from defendant 1, and AGB Parko was in that capacity on 5 May

       2015joineddeliberationFOnr.17/2010,whichwasreplacedbydeliberationFO

       no. 02/2016, but in which deliberation FO no. 17/2010 is maintained with regard to the

       validity of the approved individual commitments, including those of

       AGB Parko. This means that AGB Parko is a beneficiary of deliberation FO No. 02/2016 and

       is thus authorized to collect identification data on behalf of the Vehicle Registration Department (DIV).

       received from the holders of a registered vehicle who owe a fee or tax.

       Defendant 1 herself could not join this authorization, as she does not fall under the category

       of possible beneficiaries of that particular deliberation.

   77. Defendant 1, on the other hand, is a beneficiary of deliberation FO No. 18/2015, but this

       concerns the authorization to obtain personal data for the

       identification and punishment of violators of municipal bylaws or ordinances

       within the framework of the law of 24 June 2013 on municipal administrative sanctions. This

       means that defendant1 can obtain data from the DIV on the basis of this deliberation, but

       limited to imposing municipal administrative sanctions and therefore not for levying

       of a parking tax, as in the present case.

   78. Based on these elements, the Litigation Chamber finds that the defendant1 is trying to demonstrate that

       they at the time of the facts that are the subject of the complaint about an authorization to

       had access to the DIV directory for the identification of persons, in this case the complainant, who

       due to the use of a vehicle, you owe a parking fee, tax or parking fee

       on the one hand to rely on a deliberation of which defendant 1 is not himself the beneficiary

       (Deliberation FO no. 02/2016) and on the other hand a deliberation of which defendant 1 admittedly

the Brussels-Capital Parking Agency to receive the personal data from the Management by electronic means
Registration of Vehicles (hdern"DIV") for the identifiers and the punishment of offender of municipal

        beneficiary, but does not authorize him to obtain data for the

        levying a parking tax (Deliberation FO no. 18/2015).

   79. Such argumentation in which defendant 1 combines the two aforementioned deliberations to

        then proceeding to assert that it was authorized to disclose the identification data of the

        request the complainant from DIV in order to be able to pay the parking tax owed to him

        however, cannot be accepted, as explained below.

   80. To the extent that defendant 1 argues that in view of the dissolution and liquidation of AGB Parko

        with effect from 1 January 2020 and its incorporation into the city services, from that moment the

        rights and obligations, including those as determined in deliberation FO no. 02/2016,

        has taken over as the legal successor of AGB Parko, the Disputes Chamber

        set on the basis of article 244, §3 of the decree of 22 December 2017 on the local
                 38
        Board that Defendant 1 was by operation of law the legal successor of AGB Parko, as confirmed

        in the decision of the municipal council of the defendant 1.

                                                                                                              39
   81. With regard to legal succession, defendant 1 refers to Opinion no. 14/2004 and the

        Commission recommendation no. 03/2015 40 for the protection of privacy

        in which the principle is assumed that the legal successor does not apply for a new authorisation

        subject to the purpose for which the legal successor uses the relevant personal data

        processed, remains unchanged and can thus use the authorization as it was

        granted to his legal predecessor.

   82. However, the Litigation Chamber should note that in recommendation no. 03/2015, as a condition for

        take-over of the existing authorization by the legal successor - so without a new one

        must apply for authorization - it has been included that the relevant sectoral committee must be able to

        assess whether the applicant who wishes to continue using the existing authorization

        is indeed the legal successor. In addition, the sectoral committee should be able to assess whether the

        the legal successor offers sufficient guarantees in the field of security. Defendant 1 refers to this

38Art. 244, § 3. The rights and obligations of the dissolved autonomous municipal company are taken over by the municipality.

39Opinion No. 14/2004 of 25 November 2004 on the request for an opinion from the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Federal
Public Service Personnel and Organization with regard to the Royal Decree of 29 January 1991 by which certain

40 Recommendation no. 03/2015 of 25 February 2015 on the procedure to be followed with regard to authorisations, by both the sectoral
committees, the regional service integrators and the regional administrations in the context of the subsequent transfers of competence
of the Sixth State Reform. Decision on the substance 105/2023 - 23/31

         itself to Deliberation FO no. 31/2015 of 10 December 2015 41 in which reference is made

         to Opinion No. 14/2004, but fails to demonstrate that such notification of legal succession is

         happened, so that there is no assessment of the aforementioned conditions

         occurred. However, these conditions are also expressly included in recommendation no.
                    42
         03/2015 , but were not respected by defendant 1 who has no legal succession

         reported and has also failed to demonstrate that it offers the necessary safety guarantees as regards

         the deliberation FO no. 02/2016. It follows that Defendant 1 is therefore not validly sued

         can rely on deliberation FO no. 02/2016 to obtain data from defendant 2 with

         with a view to levying a parking tax at the expense of the complainant.

    83. Regarding Opinion No. 14/2004 and Recommendation No. 03/2015, the Litigation Chamber states that this

         although they are not directly legally enforceable, they should be

         tested against the current legal context, which means that it must be verified whether the requirements

         stipulated by the GDPR are complied with, in particular in view of the obligation of transparency (articles 5. 1,

                  43 44 45
         a) AVG , 12.1 AVG and 14.1 a) AVG ) which requires that the data subject

         personal data are processed in a transparent manner.

    84. It appears from the factual elements of the file that it was completely unclear to the complainant that

         Defendant 1 has requested his data from Defendant 2 solely as being the legal successor

         of AGB Parko, since Defendant 1 has not provided any form of transparency

         in this regard, which meant that it was therefore not possible for the complainant to make a simple claim

         accessible and understandable form of the processing of the data concerning him

41 Deliberation FO no. 31/2015 of 10 December 2015 regarding the application of the Flemish Tax Authorities (“VLABEL”) to be
legal successor of the Department of Finance and Budget of the Flemish government to be able to use the authorization that was

granted by deliberation FO Nos. 39/2013 and 40/2013 of December 12, 2013:
“The investigation of the committee can therefore be limited to verifying whether the applicant is the legal successor of the Finance Department
and Budget of the Flemish government, specifically with regard to the purposes/tasks that were the subject of deliberations
FO Nos. 39/2013 and 40/2013. In addition, the Committee also examines whether the applicant offers sufficient guarantees in terms of the

data security.”

the same purposes or only part of them, as well as providing information regarding security.”

in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form and in clear and plain language, in particular

controller;
\[…\] Decision on the substance 105/2023 - 24/31

       personal data by the defendant 1. In view of the total lack of providing the necessary
       transparency with regard to Defendant 1, Defendant 2 also did not have the correct one

       information, so that the latter therefore also stated to the complainant on 15 February 2021

       that the communication by defendant 2 of the data of the complainant to defendant 1 took place

       pursuant to deliberation 18/2015 on municipal administrative sanctions and that

       defendant 1 at the time of the levying of the parking tax in respect of the complainant about none

       legal basis for parking management. The Disputes Chamber decides on the basis of the

       above that defendant 1 at the time of the facts infringed Article 5. 1, a) GDPR,

       article 12.1 AVG and article 14.1 a) AVG committed because the complainant was not informed

       on the one hand the legal succession of AGB Parko by defendant 1, as a result of which the latter has the
       has acquired the status of controller with regard to the

       data processing as described in deliberation FO no. 02/2016, and on the other hand the resulting

       ensuing data processing on the part of the defendant 1.

        Deliberation and GDPR

                                                   47
   85. Since the GDPR has become applicable, each controller has to comply with all
       principles included. More specifically, a

       controller to rely on one of the six legal bases listed

       in Article 6 of the GDPR. In the public sector, the legal basis of Article 6.1.c) (processing

       is necessary to comply with a legal obligation on the

       controller rest) or Article 6.1.e) (processing is necessary for the fulfillment

       of a task of public interest or of a task in the context of the exercise of the public

       authority vested in the controller). In such

       cases, the processing must be based on a legal provision that meets the requirements

       of Article 6.3 GDPR.

   86. The deliberations relied on by the defendants were granted by the Sectoral Committee

       of the Federal Government, which has ceased to exist pursuant to Article 109 WOG. This takes

       although it does not alter the fact that, in accordance with Article 111 WOG, it remains possible to join

       the aforementioned general authorisations, provided that the person requesting accession submits a written and

       signed declaration of commitment in which he confirms that he agrees to the terms of

       the relevant deliberation, to the Information Security Committee, being the body

       which was established by the legislature to provide deliberations regarding the
       exchange of personal data or the use of the National Register number.

46See below under marginal nos. 87 ff.
47 The GDPR has been applicable since 25 May 2018 (article 99.2 GDPR). Decision on the substance 105/2023 - 25/31

        a) With regard to Defendant 1

   87. Defendant 1 has yet, albeit late - i.e. after the facts that are the subject of

       the complaint –, affiliated with deliberation FO No. 14/2016 of 21 January 2016, as a result of which it

       defendant 2 can obtain notification of personal data included in the DIV-

       directory for the identification of the complainant with a view to levying the parking tax.

   88. Not only did entry to deliberation FO No. 14/2016 only take place on 28 August 2020,

       so well after Defendant 1 has requested the details of the complainant from Defendant 2 and also

       has gotten. Defendant 1 believes that it can claim that in the context of this accession

       agreement concluded on September 1, 2020 between defendant 1 and defendant 2, in which is

       provide that it takes effect retroactively on 1 January 2020, is fully legally valid and
       relies on deliberation FO no. 02/2016 in its capacity as

       legal successor stating that the Accession Agreement, upon deliberation FO No. 14/2016, merely

       constitutes a legal confirmation of a factual situation, since since 1 January 2020 it has been regarded as

       legal successor believes that it can derive rights from deliberation FO no. 02/2016, of which it

       claims that it is almost identical to deliberation FO No. 14/2016.

   89. The Disputes Chamber can only establish that at the time of the facts, defendant 1 nor op

       based on legal succession (see above, marginals 52 - 61), nor on the basis of deliberation FO no.

       14/2016 in the absence of timely accession thereto, was authorized to file with defendant 2nd

       request personal data of the complainant with a view to his identification in the context of
       a parking tax. The retroactive effect of the accession agreement is thereby complete

       irrelevant. With regard to the Accession Agreement, it should be noted that, in

       contrary to what defendant 1 states, can indeed be done by the Disputes Chamber

       assessed to the extent that it has an impact on the data processing of third parties that are not a party

       to that agreement, including in this case the complainant. It is certain that at the time of the

       facts that occurred on 28 May 2020, it was completely unclear to the complainant

       the defendant 1 would still conclude an accession agreement on 1 September 2020 in the future

       during deliberation FO no. 14/2016, as a result of which the complainant did not have access at the time of the facts

       about the information to which he is entitled in accordance with Articles 5.1, a), 12.1 and 14.1 a) GDPR.

       The Disputes Chamber also notes that deliberation FO no. 14/2016 as such itself also
       already requires that the persons involved, including the complainant, serve clearly in all cases

       to be informed of the name of the controller, in this case defendant 1,

       the purpose of the processing, the origin of the data collected and the existence of it

       right to access and correct the data. The deliberation adds that a

identification of persons liable to pay a parking fee, tax or parking fee due to the use of a vehicle - Revision
of the deliberation FO n° 05/2015 of 19 March 2015 Decision on the substance 105/2023 - 26/31

       clear provision of information is also particularly important in situations where it

       less reasonable expectations of the data subjects that his/her personal data

       processed.It is undeniable from the facts that the complainant did not have this information

       as a result of which he also had no knowledge of the legal basis on which the processing of his

       personal data would be based. As already mentioned with regard to the legal basis

       (see marginal 85) answers national regulations on deliberations, together

       read with the deliberations themselves, meet the requirements of Article 6.3 GDPR and must therefore

       be regarded as a specific regulation within the meaning of Article 6.2 GDPR, but this does not count

       that, at the time of the facts, defendant 1 was not involved in deliberation FO no.

       14/2016, which means that defendant 1 was not a beneficiary of this deliberation

       and could not be a basis for requesting the data of the complainant from defendant 2. Also here

       is there therefore an infringement of Article 5 at the time of the facts. 1, a) GDPR, Article 6,

       Article 12.1 GDPR and Article 14.1 a) GDPR.

   90. In addition, a controller, in this case Defendant 1, cannot suffice with it

       to have an authorization and to proceed solely on the basis of the relevant deliberation

       of the assumption that you have the right to the personal data recorded in that authorisation

       After all, the controller has been there since the GDPR became applicable

       obliged to comply with the obligations imposed on him therein and thus the deliberation of which

       he wishes to test against the higher legal standard in order to verify whether the

       concerning deliberation permitted communication of personal data is in accordance

       with the GDPR. In this sense, the Chamber of the Federal Government of the Information Security Committee has also op

       August 28, 2020 Defendant 1 expressly pointed out that her accession to deliberation

       FO No. 14/2016 does not release it from its obligations to comply with the GDPR.

   91. However, it appears from the defense of Defendant 1 that she has completely changed her method of data processing

       has aligned itself with the relevant deliberations by being as set out in its conclusion

       relied entirely on the opinion of defendant 2 regarding the application of the three

       deliberations 49 on which it relies. For example, Defendant 1 indicates that both before and after the

       collapse of AGB Parko in the city services has inquired with defendant 2 whether there

       additional formalities had to be fulfilled. The Litigation Chamber finds that the defendant

       it takes up the parking policy itself again and already has an agreement with the

       Crossroads Bank Vehicles in function of an identification of holders of a license plate that
       cities and municipalities, … owe a parking fee, tax or money, citing

       to deliberation FOnr. 18/2015 – as according to defendant 1 – revised by deliberation FOnr.

       14/2016. In this respect, the Disputes Chamber must also establish that defendant 1

       wrongly establishes a connection between, on the one hand, deliberation on FO no. 18/2015 and that of municipal

       administrative sanctions and to which it has acceded, and, on the other hand, deliberation FO No.

       14/2016 which concerns parking fees, taxes and fees and of which they do not have the

       beneficiary. Respondent 1 therefore misrepresents the facts by stating that

       deliberation FO no. 18/2015 would have been revised by deliberation FO no. 14/2016. Defendant 2

       then fails to notice this and states that defendant 1 should not take any further action. On

       26 June 2020 Defendant 2 confirms again that Defendant 1 has access to the directory
       of the DIV, without specifying, however, on what deliberation that access is based.

   92. Defendant 1 hides behind the fact that, despite two previous confirmations

       because of defendant 2, did not have the correct authorization to consult the DIV-

       directory for penalizing infringements of the urban fee regulations regarding parking,

       but that the absence of the authorization in question is based on a misunderstanding. She adds

       admitted that the city could and should rely on the correctness of the message issued by DIV in which
                                                                                               50
       it was confirmed in writing that the required authorization from the city was in order .

   93. It is only at the moment that Defendant 2 deems it appropriate that Defendant 1 joins

       deliberation FO no. 14/2016 that defendant 1 actually does this, however for quite some time

       after the facts presented by the complainant have occurred.

   94. Defendant1 then also tries to shift its own responsibility onto the Sectoral

       Committee for the Federal Government and FPS Policy Support. Respondent 1 thus claims that

       the Sectoral Committee for the Federal Government has given the impression that it was as a city

       joined deliberation FO No. 17/2010 – as later revised by deliberation FO No.

       02/2016 – by naming the city as a beneficiary in the approval of the

       declaration of commitment during the deliberation of FO no. 17/2010, as well as because the FPS Policy and
       Support Defendant 1 would have been listed in the list of beneficiaries on its website.

   95. However, this argument is by no means convincing, since the possible beneficiaries of

       deliberation FO nr.17/2010 – later deliberation FO nr.02/2016 – in no case the municipality itself

       can be, but only the private concessionaires and municipal privatized

50Decision of the Board of Mayor and Aldermen dated 22 February 2021 regarding the objection regarding tax on the
parking, as submitted by the complainant. Decision on the substance 105/2023 - 28/31

    agencies. The entry to which respondent 1 refers is: “Parko AGB/Stad Kortrijk”,

    where the mention of the name of the cities only gives an indication of the actual value

    beneficiary, in particular AGBParko, is active. Defendant1 cannot possibly deduce from this that she herself

    beneficiary with regard to this deliberation, given the clear in the deliberation

    defined target group of possible beneficiaries, which do not include municipalities.

96. It follows from all of the above elements that the Disputes Chamber has found an infringement of the

    Articles 5.2 and 24 GDPR in respect of defendant 1 must be determined at the time the

    facts occurred.

     b) In relation to Defendant 1 and Defendant 2

97. A controller is obliged to comply with data protection principles

    and must be able to demonstrate compliance with these principles (accountability -

    article 5.2 GDPR). Defendant 1 is a data controller in relation to the

    personal data which they request and obtain from defendant2. Respondent2is also a

    controller with regard to the personal data it provides to

    Defendant 1. Although Defendant 2 denies that he is the Defendant because the complaint would only
    are directed against Defendant 1, there is no doubt whatsoever about the fact that the Complainant

    not only against Defendant 1, but also against Defendant 2 because of the finding that

    the complainant expressly states that his privacy was violated because both defendant 1, and

    Defendant 2 used an incorrect authorization as the basis to identify him to the

    on the basis of his license plate via the DIV directory for which defendant 2 de

    controller. There can be no doubt that the complainant does not act alone
    against Defendant 1, but also against Defendant 2, since the identification of the holder of the

    number plate is only possible if defendant 2 provides the necessary personal data for this purpose

    to the defendant 1. In other words: the identification of the complainant on the basis of his

    number plate is only possible if defendant 1 requests the identification data from

    Defendant 2 and Defendant 2 subsequently also provide the Defendant with identification data

    1. Without the provision by defendant 2 of the identification data concerning the complainant
    to Defendant 1 was simply an identification of the complainant based on his number plate

    not been possible. It is therefore in this sense that the complainant, as evidenced by the documents of the

    file, turns several times to defendant 2. The complaint particularly concerns identification

    on the basis of the number plate of the vehicle registered in the name of the complainant

    therefore undeniably directed against both Defendant 1 and Defendant 2.

98. Both defendants base their claims on the actions performed by each of them

    data processing (defendant 1 with regard to the processing of the requested and

    data obtained from defendant 2; defendant 2 with regard to the provision of the

    data to the defendant 1) on Article 6.1 e) GDPR. Article 6.1 GDPR which is the concretization of the Substantive Decision 105/2023 - 29/31

       lawfulness principle, as referred to in Article 5.1a) GDPR, prescribes that all processing must be

       are based on a legal basis. This means that before starting the

       processing activities the controller must determine which of the six
       legal bases applies and for what specific purpose. It appears from the file

       not that the complainant was informed of the legal basis on which the defendants relied

       currently appealed in the proceedings before the Disputes Chamber, in particular the necessity of the

       processing for the ‘performance of a task in the public interest’ (article 6.1 e) GDPR). This

       legal basis is only invoked after the facts and therefore after the processing of the

       personal data has taken place. Consequently, the defendants have the personal data

       of the complainant is processed against its expectations and thus without any information being provided by

       the defendants prior to data processing. The Disputes Chamber notes this

       Please note that this provision of information does not only concern the legal basis (article 14.1 c) GDPR), but all

       information as stipulated in Article 14.1 GDPR in order to comply with the transparency principle (Article 5.1 a) GDPR)
       to fulfill.

   99. Both defendants simply relied on the deliberations granted by the

       Sectoral Committee for the Federal Government without any review against the requirements of the GDPR

       requirements since its entry into force.

 100. Based on the factual elements of the file, it appears that neither Defendant 1 nor Defendant 2

       has complied with its accountability in relation to the principle of legality,

       fairness and transparency, which the Disputes Chamber decides that at the time of
       the facts became an infringement of Articles 5.2 and 24 GDPR on the part of both defendants

       committed.

 101. With regard to the above-mentioned infringements of the legal basis, the obligation of transparency and the

       accountability, the Litigation Chamber takes into account the circumstances invoked

       by defendant 1, where it is decisive that the current privacy statement of

       Defendant 1 contains a full list of authorizations under which Defendant 1

       may consult personal data at defendant 2, with particular access to

       deliberation FO no. 14/2016. In the meantime, the invoices for collecting parking fees have been paid

       supplemented and now also contain information about the processing of personal data.
       Defendant 1 has thus shown that he pays the necessary attention to

       provision of information, in particular regarding the legal basis and the identity of the

       controller, with the defendant 1 making every effort to obtain similar

51In accordance with Article 13(1)(c) and/or Article 14(1)(dc), the controller must
notify the person concerned. Decision on the substance 105/2023 - 30/31

       prevent future breaches of the GDPR. This is therefore decisive for the sanction that

       the Disputes Chamber imposes in this decision.

 102. Defendant 2 also refers to its privacy statement, which contains information about the

       legal bases and identity of the controller. Notwithstanding the defendant2

       the complainant had informed by e-mail of 15 February 2021 that at the time of the facts there were no
       protocol agreement in accordance with article 20 of the law of 30 July 2018 on the

       protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data

       and defendant 1 was also not a beneficiary of deliberation FO no. 14/2016, which means that

       was also not a legal basis, respondent 2 now dismisses this as 'legally incorrect'. Defendant 2 remains,

       Just like Defendant 1, Defendant 2 defends this by operation of law at the time of the facts

       had taken over all rights and obligations of AGB Parko. Given the position of the
       Litigation Chamber in this regard, as set out in this decision, cannot be this reasoning

       followed. However, in the current context in which the situation has been clarified between Defendant 1 and

       defendant 2 to prevent similar facts from happening again, the Disputes Chamber also holds

       take this into account when determining the sanction to be imposed by it.

III. Publication of the decision

 103. Considering the importance of transparency with regard to the decision-making of the Litigation Chamber,

       this decision will be published on the website of the Data Protection Authority. It is

       however, it is not necessary for the complainant's identification data to be obtained directly

       disclosed, however, stating the identification data of the defendants

       having regard to the public interest of this decision, on the one hand, and the inevitable

       re-identification of the defendants in case of pseudonymisation, on the other hand.

   FOR THESE REASONS,

       the Disputes Chamber of the Data Protection Authority decides, after deliberation, to op

       pursuant to Article 100, §1, 5° WOG, to order a disqualification for the violation of

       Article 5.1, a), Article 5.2, Article 6, Article 12.1, Article 14.1 a) and 24 GDPR.
