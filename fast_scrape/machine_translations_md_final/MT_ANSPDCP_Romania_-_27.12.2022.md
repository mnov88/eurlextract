It was found that the operator did not take measures to ensure that any natural person acting under its authority who has access to personal data does not process it except at its request and did not take adequate measures to protect the data on an ongoing basis .

Also, it has not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure a level of confidentiality and security corresponding to the processing risk generated in particular, accidentally or illegally, by the destruction, loss, modification, unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access to personal data personally transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.

At the same time, under the provisions of art. 58 para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the operator was ordered and the corrective measure to implement instructions regarding the prohibition of the use of employees' personal equipment (such as: mobile phone, tablets) to film/take photos/download/distribute video recordings by using WhatsApp or social networks.
