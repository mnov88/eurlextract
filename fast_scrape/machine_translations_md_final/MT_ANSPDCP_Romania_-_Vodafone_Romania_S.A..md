Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in December 2024, several investigations at the operator Vodafone Romania S.A. and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 paragraph (4) in conjunction with art. 32 paragraph (1) letter b of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was sanctioned with a fine of 74,526 Lei (equivalent to 15,000 Euros).

The investigations were initiated following the transmission by the operator of several notifications of personal data security breaches, according to the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, but also following some complaints.

The investigations revealed that, repeatedly, the operator Vodafone Romania S.A. failed to ensure the confidentiality of data belonging to several data subjects, customers of the company (name, surname, e-mail addresses, CNP, Customer Code and customer address), as a result of the failure to comply with the policies and work procedures regarding the processing of personal data by its employees or authorized persons.

The data security breach was determined by situations such as:

the unauthorized transmission of a photo with the details of a data subject's invoice to a third party; failure to hide the recipients' e-mail addresses and failure to select the "BCC" (blind carbon copy) option when informing data subjects of changes regarding their account manager; the transmission via WhatsApp by an employee of an authorized person of a photo containing a screenshot of data displayed in the operator's application interface; the erroneous transmission of an invoice belonging to a data subject to a third party.

The incidents led to the disclosure and unauthorized access to the personal data of several data subjects.

Thus, it was found that the operator did not take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that any natural person acting under its authority and having access to the personal data only processes them at their request and did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of data processing, including the ability to ensure their confidentiality and integrity.

For these acts, the operator was fined for violating the provisions of art. 32 para. (4) in conjunction with art. 32 para. (1) letter. b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

The operator paid the established misdemeanor fine.
