The complainant: Mrs X, hereinafter referred to as “the complainant”; .

                                                                                                  .

The controller: Y, hereinafter “the controller” Decision on the substance 189/2022 - 2/7

I. Factual Procedure

    1. On 14 December 2022, the complainant lodged a complaint with the Data Protection Authority against

        the controller.

    2. The object of the complaint concerns the exercise of the right of inspection by the complainant without

        that it has received a substantively satisfactory answer from the controller

        active in the human resources sector, within the period of one month (article 12.3 GDPR), nor
        to notify the extension of that period (article 12.4 GDPR). The specific reason for the

        exercise of the right of access was the fact that the complainant became on August 24, 2022

        contacted by the controller who stated that the file of the complainant

        located in its database, offering the complainant to provide assistance in finding

        a new professional challenge. The complainant will also be asked to renew the
        contract. On August 25, 2022, the complainant will receive a response to the effect that the

        controller explains how the complainant can obtain data erasure.

        The complainant, in turn, responds that it wishes to erase data and, for the time being, no data

        the complainant will receive on August 25, 2022 from the controller the

        privacy statement with the question whether she can find the answer to her questions
        on August 29, 2022 that this is not the case and that she still did not receive an answer to her

        ask about the origin, purpose, retention period, and legal basis for the hair

        regarding data processing. The controller informs the complainant about 30

        August 2022 that her personal data was obtained as a result of

        a registration with the \[…\] that forwards the data to employers who work with them

        the framework of job placement, with the aim of finding suitable employment. The
        the complainant subsequently stated on 2 December 2022 that he still had no answer

        received on her question about the legal basis for the data processing and the retention period

        of it, nor about the extent to which it was informed about the data processing and how

        processing fits within the principle of purpose limitation, the principle of minimum

        data processing and correctness, since she has been employed with her for more than two years
        current employer and has never lived or worked in (…), nor has any interest in doing so

        shown.

    3. On December 14, 2022, the complaint will be declared admissible by the First Line Service on the grounds

        of Articles 58 and 60 WOG and the complaint is settled on the basis of art. 62, §1 WOG transferred to

        the Disputes Chamber. Decision on the substance 189/2022 - 3/7

II. Motivation

    4. Based on the documents supporting the complaint, the Litigation Chamber determines that the complainant has its right

         has exercised access, but the controller has failed to do so

         to take appropriate action by limiting itself to only mentioning the name of the body whose

         personal data were obtained, notwithstanding the fact that the complainant also

         requested other information (including legal basis, retention period) included in Article 15.1

         AVG. As a result, the controller has acted in violation of Articles 12.3 and 12.4
              1 2
         GDPR , as well as Article 15.1 GDPR .

                                                                                                      3
    5. Specifically with regard to the origin of the personal data about which the

         controller, the Litigation Chamber states that the accountability
                            4
         (article 5.2 GDPR) of the controller entails basic information

         is provided to the person concerned, being the complainant, showing that the

         controller itself processes the data in accordance with the GDPR and prior to the

         obtaining the personal data checks whether that data is lawfully processed by

         the authority from which the personal data originates. Thus, the complainant can expect that the

1Article 12 GDPR.

no later than one month after receipt of the request why the request has not been acted upon, and informs him about this
the possibility to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and to appeal to the courts.

4 Article 5.2 GDPR: The controller is responsible for compliance with paragraph 1 and can demonstrate this

(“accountability”). Decision on the substance 189/2022 - 4/7

        controller provides information on how that body, in this case \[…\],

        came into possession of the complainant's personal data, as well as the legal basis on which it is based

        whose data are processed by that authority in order to demonstrate that the data

        from the complainant have been lawfully obtained by the controller. In order to the

        rights of the complainant, the controller must also provide it with the

        make contact details of that authority available in order to enable the complainant

        to exercise its right of access vis-à-vis that authority, being the \[…\].

    6. With regard to the other information that the complainant has requested and is entitled to

        Pursuant to Article 15.1 GDPR, the controller has left nothing there

        to provide an answer.

    7. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that on the basis of the above analysis it should be

        concluded that the controller has committed a breach of the provisions of the
        GDPR was committed, which justifies taking a

        decision pursuant to Article 95, §1, 5° WOG, more specifically the controller in

        orders to follow up on the exercise by the complainant of his right of access (art

        15.1 GDPR) and this in particular in view of the document submitted by the complainant showing that

        the complainant has indeed exercised its right of access, but the

        controller has not taken appropriate action.

    8. The present decision is a prima facie decision taken by the Litigation Chamber

        in accordance with article 95 WOG on the basis of the complaint submitted by the complainant, in the context of

        the 'procedure prior to the decision on the merits' and no decision on the merits of the

        Disputes Chamber within the meaning of Article 100 WOG.

    9. The purpose of this decision is to inform the controller of the

        fact that it may have committed a breach of the provisions of the GDPR and put it in the

        possibility to still comply with the aforementioned provisions.

    10. However, if the controller does not agree with the content of this

        prima facie decision and considers that it may leave factual and/or legal arguments

        funds that could lead to a different decision, this can be done via the e-mail address
