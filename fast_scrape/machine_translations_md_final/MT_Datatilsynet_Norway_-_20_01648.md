Fee to Waxing Palace AS
The Data Inspectorate demanded a fee of NOK 100,000 from Waxing Palace AS. The business runs a growing salon, and there they have camera-monitored the reception area in violation of the privacy ordinance.

The Privacy Ordinance requires that all processing of personal data has a legal basis. After investigating a complaint about the use of a surveillance camera in the salon premises, the Data Inspectorate's assessment is that the company did not have a legal basis for the camera surveillance. The Data Inspectorate has also concluded that the company did not provide good enough information about the monitoring.

Illegal camera surveillance
- There are strict rules for what situations it is allowed to monitor with a camera. This is especially true in the workplace. The principle that the processing of personal data must be legal and open is absolutely fundamental. Violations of these principles are serious, explains legal adviser Liv Gramer.
- You must always be open with those you register personal information about. Good information should, among other things, ensure that there is no doubt about which area is captured by the camera. The clear main rule is that no one should experience being surprised that they are being monitored by cameras, says Gramer.

Responds with fee
The Data Inspectorate thinks the case is so serious that it is necessary to respond with a fee.
Everyone has the right to privacy, and this also applies in the workplace. Illegal camera surveillance can be very stressful for employees.
- In this case, we have emphasized that the illegal camera surveillance affects both employees and customers in the salon. The camera surveillance does not include areas in the salon where the treatments took place, but we have emphasized the type of business the company conducts. Many customers will experience a visit to a growing salon as a private matter, and not a situation where one expects to be filmed, Gramer concludes.

The fee is given after an overall assessment of, among other things, how serious the breach of the rules is, and the company's finances.

Waxing Palace AS has a deadline for complaints until 20 August 2021.
