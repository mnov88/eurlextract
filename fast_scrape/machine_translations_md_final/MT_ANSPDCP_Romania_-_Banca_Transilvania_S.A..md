Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in March 2025, an investigation at the operator Banca Transilvania S.A. and found a violation of the provisions of art. 5 paragraph (1) letter a) in relation to art. 6 paragraph (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

For the act committed, the operator was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 24,883 lei, the equivalent of 5,000 euros.

The investigation was initiated following a complaint from a natural person, the data subject, who claimed that his personal data had been processed without his consent, within the framework of an insurance policy against natural disasters by an insurance company, mandated by the operator Banca Transilvania S.A..

During the investigation, it was found that the petitioner, although his real estate loan contract concluded with the operator Banca Transilvania S.A. had been terminated by payment, was erroneously issued a new insurance policy against natural disasters, accessory to the terminated real estate loan contract, without the data subject having given his consent in this regard and without permission for the use of his personal data by the insurance company.

It was also found that, erroneously, the operator requested the same insurance company to issue a significant number of insurance policies, thus using the personal data contained in these policies, including the data of the petitioner.

In this context, personal data belonging to the petitioner were processed without legal basis, in violation of the processing principle provided for by the GDPR “legality, fairness and transparency”, such as: name, surname, CNP, telephone, e-mail address, address, information on the insured location.

For this act, the operator was fined for violating the provisions of art. 5 paragraph (1) letter a) in relation to art. 6 paragraph (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

At the same time, pursuant to the provisions of art. 58 paragraph (2) letter b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the operator was ordered to take corrective action to ensure compliance with the GDPR of the collection and subsequent processing of personal data, so as to avoid their use in violation of the principles and conditions of lawfulness. In this regard, consideration will be given to the application of appropriate technical and organizational measures, by establishing written procedures and regular training of persons who process data under the authority of the operator.
