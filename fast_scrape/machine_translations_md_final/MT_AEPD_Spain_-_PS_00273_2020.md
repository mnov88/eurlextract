                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                            I
In accordance with the provisions of article 43.1, second paragraph, of the Law

                                           II

The facts presented, consisting of the sending of a commercial communication, are
constituting an infringement, by the defendant to the provisions of article 21
of the current Law 34/2002, of July 11, on Services of the Society of the
Information and Electronic Commerce (hereinafter LSSI), which provides the following:

"one. The sending of advertising or promotional communications by
email or other equivalent electronic means of communication that

had not previously been requested or expressly authorized by the
recipients of the same.
2. The provisions of the preceding section shall not apply when there is a

previous contractual relationship, provided that the provider had obtained lawfully
the recipient's contact details and will use them to send communications
commercial related to products or services of your own company that are

similar to those that were initially contracted with the client.
In any case, the provider must offer the recipient the possibility of opposing the
processing of your data for promotional purposes using a simple procedure

and free of charge, both at the time of data collection and at each of the
commercial communications that you direct.

When the communications have been sent by email, said
means must necessarily consist of the inclusion of an email address
email or other valid email address where this right can be exercised,
being forbidden the sending of communications that do not include said address. "

The aforementioned offense is classified as minor in article 38.4.d) of the LSSI,
which qualifies as such “Sending commercial communications by email or
another equivalent electronic means of communication when such shipments do not
meet the requirements established in article 21 and does not constitute a serious offense ”.

In the present case, the violation of article 21 of the LSSI that is attributed to the
claimed must be classified as a minor offense, considering the number of

commercial messages sent to the claimant.
In accordance with the provisions of article 39.1.c) of the LSSI, minor infractions may
be sanctioned with a fine of up to € 30,000, establishing the criteria for its

graduation in article 40 of the same norm, whose literal tenor is the following:
"Article 40. Grading of the amount of sanctions.

The amount of the fines imposed will be graduated according to the following
criteria:

a) The existence of intentionality.

b) Period of time during which the offense has been committed.

c) The recidivism by commission of infractions of the same nature, when thus
has been declared by final resolution.

d) The nature and amount of the damages caused.
e) The benefits obtained by the infringement.

f) Billing volume affected by the infringement committed.

g) Adherence to a code of conduct or an advertising self-regulation system
applicable with respect to the offense committed, that complies with the provisions of article
18 or in the eighth final provision and that has been favorably informed by the
competent body or bodies. "

                                             III

In relation to the criteria for graduation of sanctions contained in the transcript
Article 40 of the LSSI, with the evidence available, it is considered that in

there has been a lack of diligence on the part of the respondent when using the

e-mail address of the claimant to send him a communication
commercial after confirming that your request for deletion of

personal data, since a special knowledge of the
requirements contained in article 21 of the LSSI as it is an entity accustomed to
sending this type of message in the development of its activity.

                                            IV

exercised by the claimant on September 23, 2019, and having confirmed

download your data, the claimed entity kept your phone number, and used it to
offer their services on May 8, 2020 by SMS sent to the mobile phone
of the claimant.

In its defense, the claimed entity alleges that the telephone number appears in a

file of a client with the same surnames as the claimant, which confirms that
not all the personal data of the claimant was removed.
