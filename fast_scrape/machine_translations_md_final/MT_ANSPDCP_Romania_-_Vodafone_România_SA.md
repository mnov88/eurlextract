A new penalty for breaching GDPR

The National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the Vodafone Romania SA operator and found a violation of the provisions of art. 29 and art. 32 para. (1) lit. b), paragraph (2) and para. (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

The Vodafone Romania SA operator was fined 9,890.8 lei (the equivalent of 2000 EURO).

The investigation was started as a result of the transmission by the operator of two notifications of a breach of the security of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation.

During the investigation, it was found that the operator Vodafone Romania SA did not check compliance with the caller identification procedure by its representatives, which allowed third parties to fraudulently purchase new phones on behalf of some of the operator's customers.

Also, this situation allowed third parties to access data from contracts concluded by customers with the operator and data from My Vodafone personal accounts, such as: name, first name, address, personal code, contact phone number, PUK code, the contact number of the account holder, the SIM series of the original card, the amount of the last unpaid bill and the data traffic.

At the same time, the National Supervisory Authority found that Vodafone Romania SA did not adopt sufficient measures to ensure that any natural person who acts under the authority of the operator and who has access to personal data only processes them at the request of the operator and did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of confidentiality and security corresponding to the risk of processing.

As such, the operator Vodafone Romania SA was fined for violating the provisions of art. 29 and art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
