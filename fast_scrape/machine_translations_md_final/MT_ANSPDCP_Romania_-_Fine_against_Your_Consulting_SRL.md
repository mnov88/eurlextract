Penalty for GDPR violation

 

The National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator Your Consulting SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 25 para. (1), art. 32 para. (1) lit. a), b) and d) and art. 32 para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator Your Consulting SRL was fined 14,929.20 lei (the equivalent of 3,000 EURO) for contravention.

The investigation was started as a result of a notification that indicated that certain personal data had been disclosed through the operator's application https://your-scim.herokuapp.com.

During the investigation it was found that the operator did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures at the time of establishing the means of processing or at the time of the processing itself and did not carry out the periodic testing, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the processing.

This situation led to unauthorized access to personal data (name and surname, personal numerical code, number of nominally distributed holiday vouchers, total nominal value of holiday vouchers, date of return from child-rearing leave), of some natural persons, in period March - April 2024.

In this context, the operator Your Consulting SRL was fined for violating the provisions of art. 25 para. (1), art. 32 para. (1) lit. a), b) and d) and art. 32 para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

At the same time, under the provisions of art. 58 para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the corrective measure was also ordered to implement a mechanism regarding the periodic testing, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the adopted measures, taking into account the risk presented by the processing, in order to ensure an appropriate level of security and avoiding similar security incidents in the future.
