Sanction for violation of the GDPR

Â 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed an investigation at V&M Contab&Management SRL in December 2024 and found a violation of the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) let. a) and e) and art. 32 para. (4) in conjunction with art. 32 para. (1) let. b) and para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was sanctioned as a contravention:

1. with a fine in the amount of 9,954.00 lei (equivalent to the amount of 2,000 EURO), for violating the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) let. a) and e) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in conjunction with art. 83 paragraph (5) letter e) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;

2. with a fine of 39,816.00 lei (equivalent to 8,000 EURO), for violating the provisions of art. 32 paragraph (4) in conjunction with art. 32 paragraph (1) letter b) and paragraph (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

The investigation was initiated following a complaint alleging a possible violation of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

During the investigation, it was found that the operator did not respond to the National Supervisory Authority's requests for information, although it was obliged to allow our institution access to personal data and all information necessary to fulfill its legal duties, thus violating the provisions of art. 58 paragraph (1) letters a) and e) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Also, during the investigation, it was found that the operator had sent via Whatsapp to a third party a table with access passwords to the Revisal platform for several legal entities, through which the personal data of the employees or former employees of these companies could be accessed. This incident led to the unauthorized access and unauthorized disclosure of the personal data (such as name, surname, citizenship, personal identification number, domicile) processed. Therefore, the operator did not take measures to ensure that any natural person acting under its authority and having access to personal data only processes them at the request of the operator. At the same time, the operator did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing, including the ability to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the processing systems and services. Thus, the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) letter b) and para. (2) and para. (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

At the same time, the operator was ordered to take the corrective measure of changing all access credentials in the Revisal platform available on the website https://reges.inspectiamuncii.ro/ for all legal entities affected by the incident.
