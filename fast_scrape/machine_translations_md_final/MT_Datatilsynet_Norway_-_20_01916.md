The background for the case is a complaint from a person who experienced that the employer used automatic forwarding of e-mail.

The employer asked the employee to set up automatic forwarding from the e-mail box to a common e-mail box in the company. This must have been done out of consideration for operations.
In violation of the rules

After investigating the case, the Data Inspectorate concludes that the company lacks a legal basis for forwarding. It has taken place in violation of the rules in the regulations on the employer's access to e-mail boxes and other electronic material, in addition to the requirement for a legal basis under the Privacy Ordinance.

The company had also not prepared routines for access to e-mail. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority pointed out that an improvement of the routines could have a preventive effect against illegal inspections being carried out at a later stage.

On this basis, the Data Inspectorate has decided that the company must improve internal control and its own guidelines for access to employees' e-mail boxes. In addition, the company is ordered to pay 250,000 kroner for having monitored the complainant's e-mail box without any legal basis.

The company has a three-week appeal period from the time they receive the decision.
