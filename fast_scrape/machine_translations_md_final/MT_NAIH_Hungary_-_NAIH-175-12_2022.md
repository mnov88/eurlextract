III. Decision of the Authority

III.1. The quality of data management

III.1.1. Customer1 data management quality

Information provided to stakeholders, including in the privacy statement available on the website
the national signature collection was initiated by Customer1 and “Each of the recorded data
the controller is the Common Denominator ’. The prospectus is therefore clearly Customer1
listed as a data controller. Personal data collected in connection with the collection of signatures
One of the purposes indicated in the data management information is to collect signatures

and specifically with the organization’s sympathizers
contact, information about the organization's activities and events, and a call
to join your organization's campaigns. Also on the paper-based signature collection sheet
the Customer1 or the logo containing its abbreviated name as information referring to the data controller
is indicated.
In addition, however, there is no documentable association decision that is
may be linked to the collection of signatures or on the basis of which a body of the Client1 would have dealt

by collecting signatures.

Based on the information revealed during the proceedings of the Authority, it emerged that the Client1 is a classic
does not function as a party within the meaning of Article
the legitimacy of its operation is questionable. This is supported, inter alia, by the Authority
In the course of the proceedings, the letters sent to the Customer's registered office1 were all marked "not sought", 16

back; that the Tax and Customs Directorate of NAV-Budapest was dated 18 November 2019

deleted the Customer's tax number by its decision; that the http://kozosnevezo.hu website is also
has become unavailable, and \[…\], the statement of the party member, founder, and according to Client2
in the meantime, the renamed Customer1 no longer carries out significant activities, Customer1 as of 2018
was no longer active after the parliamentary elections, and the actual activities were no longer a
They take place behind an organization called the Party of Normal Life.

In the replies sent to the Authority's inquiries, the Client2 mentions one in several places

not named and not supported by any other data or evidence other than
A person or organization other than Customer1 or Customer2. In contrast, the procedure
from the declarations of the persons covered and from the documentary evidence obtained by the Authority
no other stakeholders in the data management operations were determined to decide on the data processing
a person who has defined the purpose or means of the processing. Such
person was not nominated by the parties heard and made a statement and is wide by the Authority
nor could it be inferred from the documentary evidence obtained.

Given that Customer1 provided the name for the signature collection, the online signature collection
The Customer1 is indicated on the interface and on the paper - based signature collection sheet, and the
The Customer1 is also explicitly designated as a data controller in the data management information, of which
consequently, the Client1 shall be considered a data controller in this respect, despite the fact that a
according to the available information, Customer1 is no longer operational in practice.

III.1.2. Customer2 data management quality

The Authority will send its first inquiries to Client1 to Client2 as Chair of Client1
addressed him and then declared him as a client in the proceedings as an individual.

Based on the evidence available to the Authority, the Client1 only operates on paper, it is actual
it does not operate legally, it does not hold regular meetings of members. Not available

a documentable decision that would demonstrate that in the context of signature collection
Customer1 would have made a decision despite the signature collection of Customer1's name
used.
In its reply to the Authority dated 31 May 2021, the Client2 - no longer the Client1
but as an independent person, he said that he was in charge of the administration
previously resigned, so he has no opportunity to answer the questions raised by the Authority
to answer, he has no information about the questions asked, the signatures are not his

has not carried out any activities in the collection of signatures and does not store them
nothing related to signature collection. As stated in the statement in the collection of signatures
did not perform any activity, only performs or performed tasks out of favor,
which, however, are not related to the questions asked by the Authority.

Client2 made several statements in the social media during the fact-finding exercise
statements made by the Authority in the course of the proceedings

however, they contradict these claims.

The role of Customer2 in data management is supported by the following:

According to his statement in his reply dated 14 December 2020, on the signature collection sheet
he receives the sheets received at the specified mailbox as the return address.
The mailbox address marked as the return address on the signature collection form is unchanged for the Customer1

change in registered data (name of organization, registered office, representative)
notwithstanding, the sheets returned by post, and thus the personal data provided by those concerned
data will continue to be in the possession of the Customer2 on the basis of a previous statement., 17

 In addition to performing data management, the quality of the Customer's 2 data controllers is supported by the following:

 i. Shipments mailed to Customer1's previous location were not picked up and marked
 there was no person at the headquarters who would have been entitled to receive the consignments. \[…\]
 the registered office of the Client1, who is only a member of the association and does not hold a senior position, was registered at the address of
 under the chairmanship of Client2. The Authority shall also send its inquiries and orders to the address of the Client2
 to which the Customer2 received the Authority's inquiries three times. Customer1-
 could only be contacted through Customer2 - which is also not the organization

 supports the proper functioning of the Client2, ie the Client2 as the Client1’s
 a separate person also had a significant influence in the affairs of the Client1 and in the collection of signatures by
 that the name of Customer1 is actually Customer2. Consequently, for data management
 decision-making related to the purpose of data management is obviously the responsibility of the Client2-
 may be related to.

 ii. Customer2 on April 27, 2018. in its statement dated the day of the Common Denominator 2018

 resigned as ‘administrator resignation’ (‘resignation statement 1’) The signature of witnesses on the deed is not
 included in the proceedings, there was no evidence that Customer2 was the “waiver
 statement 1 ”to Client1 or to a legal representative in a change registration procedure
 in the absence of these, the "waiver 1" is the intended legal basis
 was not suitable for inducing an effect. Customer2 in a statement dated June 17, 2021
 (“Waiver 2”) - when Customer2 was already aware of the data protection authority procedure -
 has repeatedly resigned from the position of managing director of the Client1, from which the

 the conclusion is that he himself did not consider "resignation statement 1" to have any legal effect
 considered it appropriate to do so again. Furthermore, in the meantime
 Signature collection has started under Customer1. The data management activity is a paper only
 it must obviously be done by someone other than an operating organization, which also proves that
 the activity of the Client2 was maintained despite his previous resignation from the management. THE
 "Resignation statement 2" was submitted in the change registration procedure on 02.08.2021. on the day. THE
 The Metropolitan Court deleted Client2 as the senior official of Client1 by the NGOs

 from the register.

iii. Client2 has repeatedly promoted signature collection, e.g. the "Doctor Stork"
 in a Facebook post posted on October 13, 2020
 “Today we are launching an important national initiative \[Ezért\] That is why the Common Denominator
 movement (http://kozosnevezo.hu) due to its public nature and opportunities
 A NATIONAL COLLECTION OF SIGNATURES is organized by social pressure

 IN THE PURPOSE OF THE SPEECH OF THE PEOPLE AND THE VALIDITY OF THE PEOPLE! About this here
 you can find out everything: https://alairasgyujtes.online ”and then in several of your posts
 encourages people to support this initiative. Plurals throughout your posts
 using it, thus naming himself as the initiator or stating that the collection of signatures
 he himself took part in launching it.

arc. Https://444.hu/2020/10/20/godeny-probaljuk-a-tomegbazist- Pick up October 2020

 According to an article published on the 20th, the Client2 stated that the questions asked of him during the interview
 that he or she was the Customer1 - of which he was the 28 September 2021
 behind the collection of signatures and said that one of the main reasons for the collection of signatures
 aimed at trying to ‘gather a mass base’. The journalist wrote in the article that
 “After I called György Gődény, he answered a bunch of questions. \[…\] Stork for a moment
 nor did it hide that one of their main goals with the whole was to try to “gather a mass base”.
 Customer2 has therefore stated that it and Customer1 are in charge of collecting signatures, ie

 behind the data processing examined in this case. And Client2 did not exalt himself as the chairman of Client1
 who, in addition to the Client1, mentioned himself separately from him, thus acknowledging that he,
 as an individual data controller., 18

 It can also be seen from the interview and the statements made during it that

 Client2 was able to answer the substantive questions related to the collection of signatures, he appeared in the
 as a competent person for the collection of signatures. Customer2 is apparently in the public mind as well
 appears as someone who has had and continues to have a decisive, influential role
 in signature collection. It can therefore be concluded that it is relevant to the collection of signatures
 information is available to Customer2, such as how the signature is collected,
 how long, so the partial decisions related to the collection of signatures can also be linked to the Client2.

v. Even in June 2021, Customer2’s social networking sites identified above
 has published a post promoting the collection of signatures, encouraging Customer1 to
 no longer referred to in his posts. Customer2 made the entries in his own name.

 For example, in his post of 10 June 2021, he called for a motion before a parliament on 20 June
 encouraged his followers to collect signatures.
 In its entry of 11 June 2021, it also called for support for the initiative, highlighting the

 the availability of a website to support the initiative.

vi. \[…\], A member of Client1 testified before the Authority and also stated that a
 provided information that Customer1 has an approx. Facebook group with 40,000 members, which
 group is still operating, although the association no longer has significant activity
 or the Client1 no longer carries out any activity, it is not already a member,
 but also supporters, some of whom are connected in Facebook groups. Within the group and

 at all, in relation to Customer1, the circle of sympathy compared to the initial composition
 exchanged, there is currently activity associated with the coronavirus. Both the former and the
 current activity can be linked to the name of the Client2, he would know the meaningful answers to the questions of the Authority
 to give according to the witness.
 The testimony also confirms that the Customer2 is the key player in the collection of signatures
 the face of both the signature collection and the organizer of the campaign on the issue,
 central person.

 III.1.3. Summarizing the above, the Authority has established that the signature collection is the name of the Customer1
 one of its purposes is to sympathize with the Customer1 organization
 further contact and information for them. Accordingly, the collection of signatures
 The Customer1 is also listed on its website and on the paper-based signature collection form, as well as on the website
 also available data management information as the data manager of the data management specifically for the Customer1
 marks. Consequently, Customer1 is named as the data controller and for the purpose of data management

 Client1 can be linked, therefore the Authority considers Client1 to be a data controller in this respect
 he looked at.

 In addition to the above, the Authority found that Customer2 is the technical background for the collection of signatures
 played a prominent role in the provision and execution of the signature, collecting signatures on its own behalf
 promoted as an activist in the field of signature collection,
 acted as his key figure. These are clearly supported by the Customer2 in the collection of signatures, respectively

 decisive factor in the management of data in connection with the collection of signatures
 which had to play a key role in data management decisions
 spread, ie decisions were made by Customer2. This role is not just about collecting signatures
 participation, the performance of certain data management operations, but also the Client2 as
 the quality of the data controller of the individual and the corresponding responsibilities. This is the data controller
 liability is supported in particular by the fact that it is decisive for Customer2
 had an influence on the decision on data management, to determine the purpose of data management, that

 he had access to the mailbox address indicated during the signature collection, he declared himself
 that he was behind the collection of signatures, as evidenced by the testimony of the witness. Therefore, the
 The Authority shall also determine the quality of the Client2 's data controller with regard to the examined data management

III.1.4. In the Authority's view, it cannot be an organization that does not actually operate
or on its behalf so that the actual
data processing is disguised and personal relationships are unclear.

                                                                          1
As emphasized by the Authority in Part I of its recommendation to political parties, no
it is an acceptable situation that no one should be held responsible for the processing of data - especially one
during the national collection of signatures, which is also ongoing online, and
they try to avoid liability by claiming that the organization is not working, is

they know nothing about data management and do nothing. It contradicts those statements
in particular, the collection of signatures is still ongoing.
According to the Authority, it is not permissible for such data controllers to be relieved of their responsibilities in this way
data controllers collect personal data irresponsibly and without consequences,
they are used.

Furthermore, the fact that Customer1 is referred to as a “movement” does not mean that
that by perceiving a legal person as a “movement”, due to the indeterminacy of the participants a
liability of the legal person and the ‘movement’ and a
compliance with the legislation could be waived.

Based on the above, the Authority considers both Client1 and Client2 to be data controllers.
turn. The Authority examined it in accordance with Article 26 of the General Data Protection Regulation
and whether they are common controllers or parallel controllers. On this
As a result of the investigation, the Authority concluded that Client1 and Client2 were common

they are considered to be data controllers because there are no two separate data management or separate data management purposes
in terms of the data management examined, but also the qualities and responsibilities of the data controller
they exist in an atypical way, yet in the data controller construct examined in the present case
are inextricably linked. The role of the two data controllers in this Decision
cannot be separated more precisely than in the light of the procedural difficulties and the

lack of cooperation.

Accordingly, the Authority considered Client1 and Client2 to be joint controllers and this
established the liability of both of them despite the fact that Customer2 is the data controller
his quality was not recognized.

The legal classification of the violations committed in the case and the established
Furthermore, with regard to the legal consequences, it is irrelevant that parallel data controllers,
or customers are considered common data controllers.

III.2. Legality of information on data processing

It is closely linked to the validity of the consent that it be preceded by appropriate information
this is necessary in order for those concerned to be aware that they are specific

what they agree to know the details of the data management and exercise their consent
their right to withdraw. The person concerned is in possession of the relevant information
make a decision on whether to consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her.
Failing this, the legal basis for consent, ie data processing, will be invalid.

1A Authority Recommendation on certain data protection requirements relating to the data management of political parties and organizations (February 2021
19.): “According to the experience of the Authority, one of the biggest shortcomings before the start of data processing is the lack of data controllers,
clear clarification. In the Authority 's view, it is no longer the obligation to provide prior information or
nor is it acceptable for a series of data processing operations not to have
so that, especially if an infringement is suspected in the course of data processing, it should be clarified
roles. ", 20

Article 5 (1) (a) and (b) of the GDPR and, in this context, Article 39

Recital 1 states that it must be transparent to natural persons,
how they collect and use their personal data about them
considered or otherwise treated, and in the context of a
the extent to which personal data is and will be processed. The principle of transparency applies
also to inform data subjects about the purposes of data processing. Personal data management is specific
their objectives are explicitly stated and legitimate, and are already personal
must be specified at the time of data collection.

Article 13 of the GDPR defines what information is available to data subjects
shall be informed at the time the data are obtained.

III.2.1. In the Authority's view, the website is not sufficiently transparent, clear and unambiguous
informing data subjects about the purposes of data processing. One of the purposes of data management is to express an opinion
(‘I agree that no one should be required to be vaccinated and that no one should be

may be penalized or restricted. ”) is highlighted only on the data collection interface,
data management information refers to it only as “support for national signature collection”, while
information that the data will be used for data processing purposes other than the original purpose
(contact) will only be handled by opening and reading the privacy statement
happens.

The fairness and lawfulness of the processing of data subjects' personal data, inter alia,

may be established if the data subject has been duly informed that:
personal data is collected for two different data processing purposes and specifically for naming purposes
what these data management purposes are. Information on the purposes of data management
its adequacy and clarity cannot be established on the basis of the above.

The legal basis in the data protection prospectus is Article 9 (2) (a) of the GDPR,
or (d). Article 9 of the GDPR provides for special categories of personal data,

which the regulation prohibits as a general rule or makes subject to strict conditions. THE
special categories of personal data may be processed, inter alia, if the
the data subject has given his or her express consent to their treatment for one or more specific purposes.

There is also no specific information in the privacy statement that the data
the duration of the collection of the data provided, nor the storage of the data provided in this context,
how long it takes to use. According to the information on the https://alairasgyujtes.online website, the

The collection of signatures is still ongoing, as determined by the Authority, or at the request of the Authority
Customer2 stated that data collection is not time-bound.

In the privacy statement, data subjects are informed that it is not automated

after what will happen to the signature collection sheets and those included in or collected online
with personal information.

III.2.2. In the Authority's view, the data collection sheet is on the signature collection sheet
a briefing should be provided to stakeholders on the planned data processing
key information set out in Article 13 of the GDPR.

With regard to the prospectus on the signature collection form, the Authority notes that
the data subjects have not been properly informed, inter alia, of the legal basis and the purposes of the data processing,
the wording refers, on the one hand, to consent based on the Information Act and, on the other hand, to 21

only for the purpose of contact, consultation and information

mentions. The prospectus does not specify which organization is responsible for data management.
The signature collection form does not specifically mention the data controller, only the Customer1
an emblem with its abbreviated name is shown on the sheet. Personal information collected
information on the duration of storage is also not included in the text on the sheet.

III.2.3. Based on the above, the Authority concludes that the controllers do not provide the
clear, adequate and real information to those concerned on paper

collection of signatures, nor in connection with the collection of signatures through the website
all relevant circumstances of the data processing and shall not be determined
clearly state the purpose of the processing, thereby violating the general data protection regulation
Article 5 (1) (a) and (b) and Article 13 (1) to (2).

III.3. Online data collection

III.3.1. Legal basis for online data collection

In addition to paper-based data collection, the signature collection is available at https://alairasgyujtes.online
also takes place on a website. To support the initiative online, the stakeholders below are personal
data are collected: name, postcode, town, name of public area, house number, floor / door, e-mail address,
phone number. From this information, entering the phone number is optional, which is in the fill-in interface

it is also indicated separately, while the other data are mandatory.

The success of the online support of the initiative, that is, to bring it to the system

Despite the call of the Authority, the Client2 did not specify the legal basis of the data processing, the
According to a statement made as a representative of Client1, the persons involved in the collection of signatures are personal
their data is provided voluntarily.

According to the data protection prospectus, the legal basis for data processing is, on the one hand, that
data management with appropriate guarantees for regular contact with the data subject
In addition, the prospectus indicated the GDPR

Article 9 (2) (d). Furthermore, the legal basis for data processing is not regular for the data subject
in the case of contact, the express consent of the data subject prior to the recording of the data
declaration, ie Article 9 (2) (a) of the GDPR.

As detailed in the Privacy Notice, making a statement of consent is subject to
Customer1 will confirm this with a message sent to the email address provided by the data subject and thereafter
the data subject must confirm the consent in the reply to the confirmation message

intention.
The Authority emphasizes that during the testing of https://alairasgyujtes.online, it found that
Contrary to what is stated in the privacy statement, when supporting the collection of signatures online
the data controller does not send the opportunity to confirm the consent for the e-mail contact provided
insurance email.

The Privacy Notice therefore collects personal data from data subjects as described above

treats it as a special category of personal data.

Pursuant to Article 6 (1) (a) of the GDPR, the processing of personal data is lawful if it
the data subject has given his or her consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes,

to treat.

Personal provided to support the initiative of a political organization
however, the data do not constitute a special category of personal data. If
however, in addition to the purpose of the petition, the data subject also has the right to process data specifically for that purpose

to inform about his / her activity, to get in touch with his / her political activity
personal data provided by the data subject for this further contact
necessary personal data as data indicating party sympathy is a special category of personal
also constitute data.

According to the data protection information sheet, the purpose of data management is to support the collection of signatures by:

Customer1's contact with the data subject as a sympathizer, informing the data subject
activities and events, and send invitations to Customer1 campaigns
to join.

Personal data processed for the purpose of political contact is therefore accordingly
information referring to the political views of data subjects and, as such, general data protection
special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9 (1) of that Regulation

are considered. The processing of special categories of personal data is, as a general rule, prohibited by the Regulation,
or subject to strict conditions. These special categories of personal data include
In accordance with Article 9 (2) of the GDPR, they may be treated if they are concerned
express consent to their treatment for one or more specific purposes.

In order for the controller to be able to legitimately invoke the legal basis of the consent, the consent
all its conceptual elements must meet the requirements that apply to it.

the Data Protection Directive issued pursuant to Article 29 of the Data Protection Directive
The Working Party’s Guideline WP259 on Consent also confirms that
that the statement or act expressing the confirmation unequivocally is lawful

In this case, it indicates the way in which the data subject expresses his or her consent. It means that
the data subject must make a statement of specific consent. Consent "explicit"
The obvious way to be convinced is that consent is given in a written statement
would be a clear confirmation.

As set out in Annex II of the Authority's Recommendation to Political Parties. also explained good practice
Takes note of the European Data Protection Board's contribution 5/2020 Guideline No

As set out in Guideline WP259 on the consent of the Working Party on Data Protection, the

to which he requests confirmation of his consent in a reply.
As stated in the privacy statement, the data controller will confirm your consent
apply the two-step verification method described above in practice
however, this method of confirming consent was not used.

In order for the data subject to be able to express his will in concrete terms, it is therefore necessary that,

data controller by obtaining consent related to data management activities

clearly separate related information from information on other issues.

Recital 42 of the General Data Protection Regulation also states that the controller
you must provide a pre-arranged statement of consent that is clear and easy to use
it must be made available in an accessible form and its language must be clear and
it must be clear and not contain unfair terms.

In the Authority's view, the provision of personal data on the online interface is on the one hand
consent to the use of personal data
on the other hand, it is not the original
for the processing of personal data for contact purposes in addition to the purpose of data processing
contribution.

Recital 32 of the GDPR states that data processing can only take place if:

by a clear affirmative action, such as in writing, including by electronic means
- or voluntary, specific, informed and unambiguous
consent to the processing of personal data concerning a natural person. If it is
data management serves more than one purpose at a time, you can contribute to all data management purposes
to be provided separately. If the data controller does not attempt to make each
ask for consent separately for this purpose, there is a lack of freedom of decision.

In the Authority's view, the lawfulness of the processing of the personal data of the data subjects at that time
can be established if the data subject is used for all data processing purposes
may have contributed separately to its management.

By giving consent as explained above, they are not concerned
clear and specific expression of his will, the data processing is not considered valid
legal basis. The Authority notes that data controllers handle it without a valid legal basis

personal data of data subjects, in breach of Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation
Paragraph 1. As these data are also data for political contacts a
special categories of personal data and their processing, among other things
it is possible, if the data subject has given his or her express consent, the
data processing also infringes Article 9 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

III.3.2. Purposefulness of data collection

Article 5 (1) (b) of the GDPR provides for the principle of purposeful data processing, which
personal data may only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes,
and may not be treated in a way incompatible with those purposes.

According to the prospectus, the purpose of data management is to support the collection of national signatures,
on the other hand, the Client1’s contact with the data subject as a sympathizer, the data subject

informing the Client about its activities and events, and sending invitations to the Client1
to join its campaigns, i.e. as in the client2’s multiple press releases
further purpose of collecting signatures is to try to “gather a mass base”.

The privacy statement refers only in general terms to the “national
However, the prospectus does not specify which signatures to collect
applies. In this connection, the Authority notes that through the website the Client1

it also refers to another ongoing signature collection or via a hyperlink to it
navigates to a page that has a similar content structure and that page is referenced
The data protection information sheet also refers to the collection of national signatures of a general nature with the same content
information., 24

In the course of the procedure, the Authority found that the data protection reference was specific
"Support for the collection of national signatures" for data management purposes only in support of the initiative
“I agree that no one should be vaccinated
no one shall be subjected to any form of restraint or punishment. " text
indicates that the data protection notice does not indicate this specific purpose, while data management is different
the purpose for which the data will be collected for subsequent contact purposes, is
the interface for collecting data and supporting the initiative does not reveal that

The Authority considers that it is misleading for supporters of the initiative. The signatories
for, in a deceptive way, only the initiative is paramount on the data collection interface
the purpose of which is communicated by the controller, while there is no invitation to the signatory
all personal data - the telephone number is optional - for contact purposes only
will also be handled by the data handler, which can only be accessed via the hyperlink
provides information in a privacy statement.

Compliance with the purpose limitation principle requires, inter alia, specificity
the definition of the purpose stated before the start of the data processing and its
understandable, non-ambiguous and non-misleading communication to stakeholders.

On the basis of the information available, the Authority shall
noted that the purpose of collecting personal data is not in fact to collect signatures,
that is, support for the petition, but also for those interested in the subject, sympathizers, or personal

collecting their data.

This is borne out, among other things, by the fact that it is literally the same as the question of collecting signatures
as a matter of referendum proposed by the initiator of the Civil Movement Association earlier
(27 August 2020) was submitted to the National Electoral Commission. For the referendum
However, the National Electoral Committee (IX.21.) NVB
in its decision, however, in the privacy statement for the collection of signatures

misleading reference or information that the signature collection sheets are
intended to be handed over, presented as a petition. This is also indicated in the statement2 of the Customer2, which a
Article published on October 20, 2020 (https://444.hu/2020/10/20/godeny-probaljuk-a-tomegbazist-
to answer the question asked during the interview: “If you succeed more than 200 thousand
to collect a signature, a referendum initiative could be considered, the
pharmacist.".

So the collection of signatures, data collection is still in progress on an issue that
referendum on this issue is not possible and the stated purpose of the petition is clearly no longer
feasible. The real purpose of data processing is, in the Authority's view, the collection of personal data
to build a sympathy database, to create a mass base, but it is not clear whose
because Customer1 exists only on paper. This establishes that data management
purpose is unclear and unrealistic, so data controllers violate the general
the principle of purpose limitation under Article 5 (1) (b) of the Data Protection Regulation.

III.3.3. Infringement of the principle of due process

Article 5 (1) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation provides for a fair procedure
the principle that personal data must be processed fairly.

In the course of the procedure, the Authority found that during the collection of signatures - Annex III.1. point

as detailed - the quality of the data controller is not sufficiently clarified, the data subjects
misleadingly informing the controller and a person not actually working
party is called data controller., 25

Information about the purpose of data processing is also misleading. A III.3.2. explained in point

on the one hand, it is misleading because the signatories on the data collection interface are not informed of the
on the other hand, for the purpose of collecting signatures
the purpose is indicated by the controller, which is a manifestly impossible purpose, as it is a well-known fact that
that the issue is not suitable for a referendum, its authentication by the National Electoral Commission
rejected it earlier for several reasons.

Based on the above, it can be concluded that the data processing is unfair, thus the data controllers

breach of Article 5 (1) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation
the principle of a fair trial.

III.4. Paper-based signature collection

During the collection of signatures, according to the signature collection form that can be downloaded from the website, the parties involved are as follows

personal data is collected: name, address (postcode, town, name of public place,
house number / em. / door), e-mail contact, telephone number and signature. Privacy is available on the website
also available on the website in the signature collection form
reference is not included anyway - an ID number is assigned to the data subject's data
the data management consent can be documented. The signature collection sheet for each data set collected
it is not specified whether they are mandatory or optional.

The following information, which can be assessed as information on the legal basis of the data processing, can be found on the signature collection form:
veg: “By providing the information on the summary form and signing the signature collection form
I consent to the disclosure of my data on the right to self-determination of information and the
CXII. pursuant to Section 5 (1) (a) of the Act, further contact,

for the purpose of requesting an opinion and providing information, the statement of consent to the
until the end of the year. "

Until 25 May 2018, the main rules on data protection in Hungary will be regulated by Infotv. contain-
From that date, the GDPR is mandatory and directly applicable to the signature collector
However, the short information text in the form is in the Infotv. Section 5 (1) a)
refers to the legal basis of the consent indicated.

According to the statement of the Customer2, the data subjects have their personal data both online and on paper
provided voluntarily during the collection of signatures on this basis.

The pre-worded statement on the signature collection form is limited to “additional
for the purpose of communication, consultation and information "
refers to consent. However, the purpose of collecting signatures is not only to maintain further contact, and

related database building, but also support for the initiative, for which only it
Signature sheet "I agree that no one should be required to be vaccinated and that no
no one shall be punished or restricted. " main title refers to.

An important conceptual element of consent is that the request for consent is preceded by appropriate information
me. Article 5 (1) (a) and (b) of the GDPR and, in this context, Article 39
Recital 1 states that it must be transparent to natural persons,

how they collect and use their personal data about them
considered or otherwise treated, and in the context of a
the extent to which personal data is and will be processed. The principle of transparency applies
also to inform data subjects about the purposes of data processing. Personal data management is specific
their objectives are explicitly stated and legitimate, and are already personal
they must be specified at the time of data collection

It can therefore be concluded that data subjects have their personal data as "support for the initiative".

for the purpose of "contact, consultation and information"
their consent is given by completing the signature collection form, ie personal data
the legal basis for the management of the data subject is the consent of the data subjects.

The Authority has determined that the information on which the statement of consent is based is correct
however, the information on the signature sheet is inadequate, as indicated in Annex III.2.2.
as detailed in point 1 - is not exhaustive and therefore the consent cannot be considered

informed. However, despite the lack of information, the Authority is concerned
does not consider its consent to data processing to be invalid if it
data controllers requesting confirmation of their consent with appropriate information
obtain a statement from those concerned.

III.5. Infringement of the principle of accountability

The Authority points out that, in accordance with Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection
essentially the objective responsibility and enhanced diligence of the controller
Due to the fundamental requirement of accountability formulating
the obligation to prove that the conditions for the lawfulness of data processing - data processing
from the beginning - they persist. To the data controller from the planning of data management
from the start of data processing to the deletion of all personal data processed

you must carry out the data processing operation in such a way that you can prove at any time that
how you complied with data protection regulations. Based on the principle of accountability,
the data controller must implement the data management throughout the data processing process
operations in order to be able to demonstrate compliance with data protection rules. The
the principle of accountability can therefore be interpreted not only in general, at the process level, but in all
specific data processing activity, the processing of personal data of a specific data subject
also applies to

The Authority states that data controllers do not guarantee the lawfulness and transparency of data processing
certified to the Authority, did not declare that the personal data collected
how and what it is used for, where the data is stored, and what the real purpose of data management is.

Based on the above, it can be concluded that the data controllers by not approaching the Authority
lawfulness of the data processing, breach of Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

principle of accountability set out in Article 2 (2).

III.6. Other findings

The Authority will, on the basis of the facts set out above, in the course of the data protection authority proceedings
found that the Client1 was operating in an illegal manner, or

inoperability.
Customer1 was not available at the registered office at the registered office
and is not currently secured, nor was it possible to deliver the items to the gatekeeper. The
Furthermore, most of the client1 was not available through his court-registered representative
case.

According to the registered data, however, in the data of the organization registered in the court register

there was a change (change of registered office, registered representative), contact details of the Customer1
however, it was not insured even after the change was recorded.

The previous registered office of the Client1 was reported to the address where the person who, a

is not a representative of the organization, only a member, thus the items mailed to the registered office of the Customer1

receipt was not guaranteed either.

The Authority has detected that Client1 is publishing the report or the public benefit annex
did not fulfill his obligation at all.

For all these reasons, the Authority initiated the Metropolitan Court with non-governmental organizations
CLXXXI of 2011 on the court register and the related procedural rules.

and Infotv. 75 / A. § considered all the circumstances of the case and found that
that in the case of infringements detected in the present proceedings, the warning is neither proportionate nor disproportionate

In setting the amount of the fine, the Authority took into account, in particular, that
Infringements by Customer1 and Customer2 are covered by Article 83 (5) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
