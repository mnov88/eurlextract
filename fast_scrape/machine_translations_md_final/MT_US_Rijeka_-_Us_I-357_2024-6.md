He stated that it is clear from the course of the proceedings so far that Special Hospital M., as the controller of personal data processing, did not deliver the requested copy of the medical documentation to the plaintiff due to the irretrievable loss of an as yet unknown number of medical documentation, and that additional supervisory activities are necessary to accurately and lawfully establish the facts, so the defendant is not able to issue a meritorious decision to decide on the plaintiff's request, but will do so immediately after collecting all evidence and establishing the facts. He noted that the defendant is conducting an extensive investigation into the compliance of Special Hospital M., as the controller, with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, all due to suspicion of violations of several provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, and in part, the proceedings are being carried out ex officio pursuant to Article 42 of the ZUP. Therefore, the defendant requested an extension of the deadline for issuing a decision on the request to establish a violation of the plaintiff's rights.3. In the submission received by this court on May 8, 2024, the plaintiff, responding to the defendant's allegations in the response to the complaint, fully maintained all allegations in the complaint and the claim, stating that it is clear from the defendant's response to the complaint that the defendant did not decide on the plaintiff's request received on November 27, 2023, so the plaintiff proposed adopting the claim by issuing a judgment without holding a hearing.4. Since the legally decisive facts in this administrative dispute are undisputed, the plaintiff disputes the application of substantive law, and the parties did not expressly request a hearing, the Court, without holding a hearing, applying the provision of Article 36, paragraph 1, item 4 of the ZUS, after reviewing the documentation attached to the file of the administrative dispute, based on consideration of all factual and legal issues, determined that the plaintiff's claim is well-founded.5. Namely, upon inspection of the documentation attached to the administrative dispute case file, it was determined that on November 24, 2023, the plaintiff submitted to the defendant a request for the determination of a violation of the right to protection of personal data against the Special Hospital M. from Rijeka, due to violations of the provisions of Regulation EU2016/679 of the General Data Protection Regulation, which the defendant received on November 27, 2023, and that the defendant, although taking certain actions, has not yet decided on the aforementioned request of the plaintiff, thus violating the provision of Article 101, paragraph 2 of the ZUP, which stipulates that an official is obliged, in cases of conducting an investigation procedure at the request of a party, to issue a decision and deliver it to the party no later than 60 days from the date of submission of a proper request. Paragraph 3 of the cited Article 101 of the ZUP stipulates that a party has the right to file an appeal or initiate an administrative dispute if the public body fails to decide on its request within the prescribed period.6. The provision of Article 34 of the Act on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (Official Gazette No. 42/18, hereinafter referred to as the Act) stipulates that anyone who believes that a right guaranteed by the Act and the General Data Protection Regulation has been violated may submit a request to the Agency for the determination of a violation of rights. A violation of the Agency's rights is decided by a decision. The Agency's decision is an administrative act. An appeal is not permitted against the Agency's decision, but an administrative dispute may be initiated before the competent administrative court (Article 34, paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Act).7. Considering that the defendant did not issue a decision within the time limit prescribed in the aforementioned provision of Article 101, paragraph 2 of the ZUP and deliver it to the plaintiff within the time limit prescribed above, the Court decided on the basis of Article 58, paragraph 3 of the ZUS as in the operative part of this judgment.8. The court's decision on the costs of the dispute is based on the provision of Article 79, paragraph 4 of the ZUS. Namely, the plaintiff requested in the claim the cost of drafting the claim in the amount of EUR 1,250.00 and the cost of drafting the submission of May 8, 2024, in which she responded to the defendant's allegations in the response to the claim in the amount of EUR 1,250.00, so the plaintiff was awarded, in accordance with Tbr. 27 and 46 of the Tariff on fees and compensation for attorneys' work (Official Gazette, No. 138/23, hereinafter: Tariff) should be awarded for each of the above actions the amount of EUR 1,250.00, or a total amount of EUR 2,500.00, which amount is increased by the VAT cost of 25%, and decided as in point II. of the operative part of this judgment.
