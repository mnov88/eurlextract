Penalty for GDPR violation

 

The National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data completed in August 2024 an investigation at the operator Constanța South Container Terminal SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

As such, Constanța South Container Terminal SRL was penalized for contravention with a fine of 14,929.50 lei (equivalent to 3000 EURO).

The investigation was started as a result of a data security breach notification, based on the provisions of art. 33 of the General Data Protection Regulation, which was sent by the operator.

The breach of data security consisted in the unauthorized access by a third party to the personal data (respectively the full name, date of birth, addresses, home telephone numbers and personal e-mails) of its employees in Romania (data subjects) located on a platform of file manager used by the operator and which was public on the Internet without having adequate security measures implemented.

From the checks carried out, it emerged that the operator did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure a level of security corresponding to the processing risk, including the ability to ensure confidentiality, although the operator had the obligation to continuously ensure the security of personal data processing for its employees, in relation to the provisions of art. 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

At the same time, the operator was also given the corrective measure to review and update the technical and organizational measures implemented regarding the security of personal data processed through the IT infrastructure used, especially those regarding the connection from outside the network to the data servers.
