File number: PS / 00050/2021

Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on the
following:

                                  BACKGROUND

FIRST: The claim filed by UNION SECTION \*\*\* SECTION 1 (in
hereinafter, the claimant) has an entry dated 02/06/2020 in the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection from the Catalan Data Protection Authority. The
claim is directed against the company, in which, they claim to represent
union: SERVICIOS LOGÍSTICOS MARTORELL SIGLO XXI, S.L., with CIF B65050247 (in

later, the claimed one), “for their opposition to the implementation of a control system
of the workers through a biometric fingerprint system in the dependencies.
of the company, through terminals that incorporate readers to capture the
fingerprint of each employee ", and" currently the system is combined with the reader of
card".

The claimed one dedicates its activity to the "transport of assembly and assembly of pieces of
motor vehicles, being the SEAT company for which they provide services as the only
customer ”with about 520 workers.

The claimant states that, in his opinion, the system that is in the "evidence" phase is not

in accordance with the regulations, by:

   a) Disproportionate: “The company's premises are located
   within the SEAT MARTORELL venue, which has its own ac-

   cease, visits and work presence, to which the workers must be submitted ”of the
   Claimed “to which must be added the card transfer system established in
   the company, so a third control system is disproportionate. "

   a) Unnecessary, due to the existence of other less invasive means to achieve the
   presence control.

   b) It is also intended with the implementation of the system, the control of the
   duction by having installed the readers in the work areas.

   c) Absence of consent: the company obliges workers to sign a document
   document of consent for the processing of your data so it is not a manifestation of
   festation of free will.

SECOND: On 03/26/2020, the claim is transferred to the claimed one, that the

In the spaces where the fingerprint records are implanted, there were historically two

card presence control terminals, which allowed presence control, and
the control of the working day - entries, exits and absences - and, on the other, the generation of
variable report for the preparation of payroll-overtime, nights.

He states that “during 2017, with the idea of replacing these card terminals,

of biometric technologies ”, the difference in biometric data is concluded:

- "Biometric identification: The identification of an individual by a biometric system

- “Biometric verification / authentication: the verification of an individual by a biometric system
is normally the process of comparison between your biometric data (acquired in the
time of verification) with a single biometric template stored on a device
(ie a one-to-one matchmaking process). "

“Only those in which they are subjected to data would be treated as special category data
technical treatment aimed at “one-to-many” biometric identification, and not in the case of
“one-to-one” biometric verification / authentication.

They state that their system is for verification / authentication, explaining that they are only looking for the
correspondence of the biometric data provided at the time of registration by the intere-
sado to prove that it is him. "This data is stored in the device in an encrypted form
and it is consulted by the authentication system to verify that there is a match ”.

     “When an employee puts his finger on the token reader, this device verifies

But if a “basic risk analysis” was carried out “to determine if it was necessary to implement

THIRD: The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to admit
Processing the claim submitted by the claimant on 09/07/2020.

FOURTH: Within the framework of the actions carried out by the General Subdirectorate of
Data Inspection, in order to clarify the response of the claimed, dated

11/23/2020, your collaboration was requested to inform you about the registration system of
footprint they use.

1) They are asked to briefly explain how the recording and keeping system is produced.
da-storage of the template What is \*\*\* PROGRAM.1 ?, What is the central base of
\*\*\* PROGRAM.1 ?, and if the template converted into each employee's algorithm is saved there,
and what relationship does it have with the device called "token"

On 12/15/2020, your response was received stating:

\*\*\* PROGRAM.1, “main server for the management of the presence system, belongs to
“Grupo Sesé”, the same group to which the claimed belongs and is implemented through a

commercial application called \*\*\* PROGRAM.1, from the company TECISA ”.” The information
for management is stored in a database included with the application, and it is in this
database what the application has, where the template collected from the
paw print".

The token, or remote terminal “acts as an interface between the employee and the \*\*\* PRO-
GRAMA.1 for the validation and collection of information ”. Through this device, “we validate

we enter the system and collect information such as the time we have interacted, for
example".

Which device are you referring to? To the tokenist ?, describing if this is how it is stored

the staff of all employees in each and every one of the five they have.
It distinguishes two phases of the process, the data recording phase and the operation phase of

presence registration.

Phase 1, Data recording:

-Human Resources records the employee's data and collects his fingerprint with a reader (called
mined in this case \*\*\* READER.1). “At the moment of capture, a template is generated
with the characteristic points of that fingerprint, which is stored encoded in the database
\*\*\* PROGRAM. 1. The fingerprint image is not stored.

When the data is recorded, the synchronization process sends the necessary data from
the \*\*\* PROGRAM.1 application to the associated loggers -five- where they are stored-
two said values. The data that is sent are the employee's ID, name and surname and the

encrypted template. "
Phase 2, Operation:

- “When an employee wants to register his presence, he places his finger on the token that me-

through the built-in reader \*\*\* READER.1, carry out the same process mentioned in phase 1
when the employee was registered in the system. So it captures the
characteristic points of the employee's fingerprint, this capture is encoded and compared with
the coded template that is stored in the memory of the card maker and associated with the ID
of the employee. If it is correct- both templates match- the logger will send the pertinent data.

nents of the employee. The coded fingerprint or name is never sent, only information is sent
mation relevant to the clocking: date, time, employee ID and any defined code of
absence. These data are transmitted to the \*\*\* PROGRAM.1 application to
further processing. "

3) About your manifestation of:

“User verification is done locally against the encrypted template stored in the file.
chadora. It is never verified against the central database of \*\*\* PROGRAM.1 ”

They are requested to expand information on:

  a) If your system uses the same template for each employee, registering different al-
gorithms, or different templates for each employee.

It states that when mentioning the template “it is actually the encoded information that
has been saved after reading the fingerprint, it is not stored as an image, but rather it is detected

and they save between 25 to 80 minutiae -they are the points of the footprint where a line ends or is
forks - these points are the ones that are encoded and stored as a template. Each one of
we have different points from each other, which is enough to be able to
identify ourselves and what is saved are these points, so there cannot be two codes
identical. "

  a) Explain how it is possible to correlate through the system one to one (authenticate
tion) the introduction of the fingerprint in the stamp, with the template (s), explain if all the

template / s are in the tab. (Apparently there will be an internal fingerprint validation
shredded versus all templates.)
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/25

It reiterates that “Each checklist stores the templates and the ID of each employee, therefore
When an employee puts the fingerprint, it is encoded in a template and the system performs the
search to see which one is equal to the one generated. The process is carried out locally, it is not

consult the application \*\*\* PROGRAM.1 "
  b) What difference would there be between the worker registering with the counter and the verification

does it locally against the encrypted template stored in the token machine, so that it does it against
the central database of \*\*\* PROGRAM.1?

“There would be no technical difference or practicality. The process would be the same, only in that
case should be compared with all the stored templates and it would be noticeably increased-
mind the time it would take to transmit the information back and forth ”.

  c) Does the tokenizer have at any one time a single data packet that identifies the
person who is signing or all packages of all workers?

He answered that “The file clerk keeps the information of all the workers of the center,
that have been configured to facilitate the signing of any of them by the worker.

dor ”.
4) In the graph, from "tab" to "\*\*\* PROGRAM.1", there is a double arrow in which

literals are contained: "automatic transfer, extradecimal frame TCP etc.", it is requested
that explain the meaning of these extremes in both senses, and that they imply
arrows, if it could be understood that there is a transfer of data from the system
central ma to the tabulator. (id employee-name / surname-fingerprint).

It reiterates that: “When an employee is registered or modified, it is done from the

     Only when an employee makes a check-in at the check-in and after the validation process
tion, the clock taker, sends the information (ID, date and time, absences) to the application
\*\*\* PROGRAM. 1 ”.

They indicate that your system works like that of a password. To this end, they must detail the
elements of said idea, user, how it is verified and what would be the password element,

how, and where they are stored and how and against what element the pairing occurs.
Responds that comparing the traditional way of identifying through user / counter-

sign, indicates that the simile with the biometric fingerprint is that it allows more authentication
stronger than the simple username / password pair, since biometric data are more complex
jos to reproduce and break that password. For that reason, they indicated that it is treated as
if it were a password, since with the fingerprint “no other employee can supplant the
identity of others in a simple way. In this case, the user is the employee ID and the

password is your fingerprint template ”.

5) Other questions that they consider clarifying or convenient about the system that according to
can searches for the correspondence of the biometric data provided by the employee when
proceeds to the action of signing, with the way in which the data is recorded, after
confrontation and coincidence that it manifests is of the "authentication" type.

It states that the biometric validation system has as its sole objective and purpose the

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/25

unequivocal identification of an employee within the system providing guarantees to it
to any attempt to impersonate your identity, making it difficult to reproduce the
fingerprint by a third party.

FIFTH: On 02/19/2021 the Director of the AEPD agreed:

"START SANCTIONING PROCEDURE for MARTORELL LOGISTICS SERVICES

SIGLO XXI, S.L., with CIF B65050247, for the alleged violation of article 35 of the RGPD
in accordance with article 83.4 a) of the RGPD. "

SIXTH: The defendant makes the following allegations:

1) Uses a minutiae-based fingerprint pattern, a limited number is identified
of footprint shapes and their position within it, associating an algorithm. The boss
it is stored encrypted, containing the position and type of minutiae, not being possible to "apply
car reverse engineering the templates to recover images from the footprints ”.

2) “A fingerprint reader is used that reads the employee's fingerprint for the first time and creates the
point pattern, but it does not save the fingerprint image as such, but a derivative algorithm
do of the points obtained in the pattern. When a worker puts his finger to clock in

3) “The system used cannot always identify the person unambiguously, unlike

according to article 4.14 of the RGPD, therefore, it is not appropriate to apply article 9 of the
RGPD as a special category of data regarding the purpose of data processing
biometric "

4) The attendance and working hours control system, to implement the system by means of
your presence management software called \*\*\* PROGRAM. 1 was contracted with the company
sa TECISA 74, S.L. and the installation of the takers (\*\*\* FICHADORAS.1) that contain the

fingerprint readers (\*\*\* READER.1) at the accesses to the work areas. TECISA uses the
\*\*\* LECTOR.1 / IDEMIA technology in relation to the identification system through
fingerprint.

5) Hired the services of TECISA 74, S.L. for being a reference provider for the Administration
Public service, as shown on the provider's own website
\*\*\* URL.1, from which it follows that “the Ministry of Justice of Spain (Audiencia Na-

tional), the General Secretariat of Penitentiary Institutions of the Ministry of the Interior of Es-
paña, the Ministry of Employment and Social Security in the Control of access of inmates in the
Temporary Stay Centers for Immigrants from Ceuta and Melilla, Getafe City Council

and the Community of Madrid in its Campus for Justice have trusted TECISA 74, S.L.
as a provider of access control and presence services. " Also, in the same
web, specifically in the section https://www.tecisa.com/quienes-somos, it is reported that
"TECISA 74, S.L. is considered by the Spanish Public Administration as the company
manufacturer of the best software and terminals for access control and work presence, according to
This is indicated in the recent resolution of the State Heritage Catalog competition by a

sas. Among the 195 products presented by national and international companies,
the access control and work presence terminals manufactured by Tecisa have been,
conclusively, the best valued by a group of experts from the Ministry of Finance
and Public Administrations on behalf of the Spanish State. "

The respondent acted in the belief that the information provided to her by TECISA
Regarding the fingerprint treatment, it was valid and in accordance with the RGPD. In addition, it has

an ISO 9001/2015 certification of quality management systems, an international standard that
accredits the ability to regularly provide products and services that satisfy
customer requirements and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

On the other hand, the complainant has the ISO IEC 27001/2013 certificate, document two,
"As it has implemented and applies an information security management system
that allows the assurance, confidentiality and integrity of data and its systems

that process them, in addition to the risk assessment and application of necessary controls
to mitigate or eliminate them. "

6) It states that despite the fact that the legal basis of the treatment could be article 6.1 b) or the
6.1 c), has chosen to request the consent of its employees as indicated in article
6.1 a) and 9.2 a) of the RGPD.

They consider that there is no pressure when giving consent if it is not
provided by the employees, since the defendant first informed the representation
of the workers of the new system, who in turn informed the employees of the

company and that the vast majority of employees did not refuse to give their consent.
not even some members of \*\*\* SECTION.1 that make up the works council
who have presented the present claim, nor has anyone revoked the consent
mentor has not opposed the treatment at any time, not even the union section
\*\*\* SECTION.1 informed the workers of their disagreement in the implementation of the system.

7) It states that the presence control and the registration of working hours with fingerprint pattern
as indicated before, they coexisted with the previous system based on the use of the reader

of cards, until the moment it was suspended due to COVID-19, on 03/14/2020
The claimant union section of \*\*\* SECTION 1, recognizes the existence of the two
systems thus listed in the initiation agreement.

During the testing phase of the new attendance and working hours control system that
has been interrupted, it becomes relevant that there are employees who have made unique use of
ca and exclusively of your card according to the previous face-to-face control, not using the
fingerprint readers according to the new system due to the fact that the

two systems.

For the total number of transfers for each month and the reference days, the new transfer system was

used by 40 or 50% of the workforce and not the whole.

The action of the Labor and Safety Inspection was already provided in previous actions
Social that analyzing the face-to-face fingerprint control system did not find any irregularities
rity, the opposite of what the AEPD states.

It adds that there is no specific instruction or circular on the treatment of data through
through biometric devices for presence control, which have acted in good faith

in the belief that the control and schedule system was in accordance with the RGPD.

They carried out an audit for the certification 27001/2013 of 2019, in which it was
an evaluation and corresponding analysis of the application \*\*\* PROGRAM.1.

8) However, and what has motivated the initiation agreement, they have carried out an evaluation
impact applying the Agency's criteria that a treatment is being carried out
of a biometric data for identification purposes, also modifying the record of activities
vity of the treatment, and provide document 3 with the impact assessment and document 4
with the record of the modified treatment activity.

They indicate that the impact assessment has been carried out, despite the fact that the
presence and working hours by fingerprint pattern was only in effect from the

01/16/2020 until 03/14/2020, that is, it is inoperative from before the transfer of the start
of the transfer. It considers that it has been complying with and observing enforceable obligations and
asks that it be noted or, where appropriate, reduced to a minimum penalty, also considering
who previously analyzed in the risk analysis the assessment of whether or not to carry out
lization of the Impact Assessment.

9) It refers to other files of the AEPD on registration with biometric data in which no

The obligation to carry out an impact assessment has been imposed as indicated in the article

The prohibition will be applied by virtue of the consent, article 9.2.a), being in addition to the

 And he points out another similar case such as PS 145/2019 to the Ministry of Education and Sports of
the Junta de Andalucía, in a similar case a warning was imposed for infringement of the
Article 13 without there being any sanction for breach of Article 35 of the RGPD.

1) The defendant dedicates its activity to the transport of assembly and assembly of pieces of
automobiles, being the SEAT company for which they provide services as the only customer with
about 520 workers. The company's offices are located within the

your client's premises, SEAT. The work center has a total surface area greater than sixty
thousand square meters, providing a graph with the location of the hourly registration points
River.

1) Historically there were two card presence control terminals. Duran-
te 2017, to replace these card terminals, five fingerprint terminals are installed in

each work area of the center, with the same purposes. When the claimed responds
upon transfer, 07/09/2020, reported that the card transfer methods and the new
footprint, using both to check correctness before implanting
definitely the footprint.

2) The respondent accredits having consulted the union representation on 11/13/2017, before
the use of the fingerprint system and individually to employees, from

01/22/2018, in accordance with the provisions of the law on the Protection of Character Data
personal 15/99 of 13/12. In allegations, the respondent indicated that the use of the fingerprint was
suspended due to COVID 19, on 03/14/2020, and that it was only in force since
01/16/2020 until 03/14/2020.

3) The reasons why the respondent prefers to use the fingerprint on the card, are

that avoids cases that have occurred to give the card between employees to sign for the holder, and
that an unequivocal identification of the employee is produced, avoiding the impersonation of the
cultar the reproduction of the footprint by a third party.

4) The purpose of the fingerprint registration is to control the time or day, in accordance with
with article 34.9 of the Workers' Statute.

5) The system for collecting and registering the employee's fingerprint and its use is divided into
two phases: 1 Data record, 2 Presence record operation.

Phase 1: it is carried out by an HR technician who, with the transfer management program of the

\*\*\* PROGRAM.1 application of the TECISA company, and through a reader called
\*\*\* READER.1, collects the fingerprint, captures it so that it identifies a limited number of forms

cation or where a line ends). The complete image of the footprint is not stored. In the

database included in the application associates and stores the fingerprint template with the ID
of the employee, name and surname, NIF. When recording the data, the punching machines or remote terminals

These values have these values: encrypted template, employee ID, first and last name.

Phase 2: When an employee wants to register their presence, they can do so at any-

ra of the five terminals or fingerprint reader-fingerprint readers \*\*\* READER.1-, place your finger on
the token that, through the built-in reader \*\*\* READER.1, performs the same process as
mentioned in phase 1 when the employee was registered in the system. In a way that performs
a capture of the characteristic points of the employee's fingerprint, this capture is encoded
and it is compared with the coded template that of each employee is stored in the

memory of each token and associated with the employee's ID. If correct- both templates co-
incide- the registrant will send the pertinent data of the employee. The footprint is never sent

operation, carried out on 04/08/2019, showing the result of the “low risk” activity, with
result that it was not necessary to carry out an impact assessment on data protection
(EIPD).

The defendant indicates that while the two transfer systems were in operation, there were
employees who have made use solely and exclusively of their card with face-to-face control, and
others over 40 or 50% used the footprint.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                             I

Biometric data is defined in article 4.14 of the RGPD:

        "Biometric data": personal data obtained from a technical treatment
specific, related to the physical, physiological or behavioral characteristics of a person
that allow or confirm the unique identification of said person, such as images
facial or fingerprint data;

The scope of the RGPD extends its protection, as established in its article
1.2, to the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, their
right to the protection of personal data, defined in its article 4.1 as “all
information about an identified or identifiable natural person ("the data subject"); I know
Any person whose identity can be determined shall be considered an identifiable natural person,
directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as a

name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or
various elements of the physical, physiological, genetic, psychic, economic,
cultural or social of said person. "

According to the information provided by the claimed, when entering the fingerprint in the

to the previously stored set of users, being able to identify their owner of
among all templates, treating personal data based on the
fingerprint processing, uniquely identifying said person.

Biometric data have the particularity of being produced by the body itself and

definitely characterize. Therefore, they are unique, permanent in time and
person cannot be freed from it, they cannot be changed in case of compromise-
loss or intrusion into the system etc.

Article 9.1 of the RGPD indicates:

"Treatment of special categories of personal data"

  1. The processing of personal data that reveals ethnic origin or
racial, political opinions, religious or philosophical convictions, or union membership,
and the treatment of genetic data, biometric data aimed at identifying in a way
univocal to a natural person, data related to health or data related to sexual life or

sexual orientation of a natural person. "

Given the growing interest in using these systems in different areas and, as they are

novel and very intrusive identification systems for rights and freedoms
fundamentals of natural persons, the constant concern of this authority of
control has been shared by the rest of the authorities for years, as they
manifested the Working Document on biometrics, adopted on 08/01/2003 by the Group of
29, or the subsequent Opinion 3/2012, on the evolution of biometric technologies,
adopted on 04/27/2012, and which has led the community legislator itself to include

these data among the special categories of data in the GDPR. In this way, being
prohibited its treatment in general, any exception to said prohibition will have
to be subject to restrictive interpretation.

In this sense, recitals 51 and 52 of the RGPD make it clear: "Such data

personal should not be treated, unless their treatment is allowed in situations
specific provisions contemplated in this Regulation, taking into account that the States
Members can establish specific provisions on data protection in order to
to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation to the fulfillment of a
legal obligation or to fulfill a mission carried out in the public interest or in the exercise

of public powers conferred on the data controller. In addition to the requirements
specific to that treatment, the general principles and other rules of the
this Regulation, especially with regard to the conditions of legality of the
treatment. Exceptions to the general prohibition of
treatment of these special categories of personal data, among other things when the
interested party give their explicit consent or in the case of specific needs, in

particularly when the treatment is carried out within the framework of legitimate activities by
certain associations or foundations whose objective is to allow the exercise of
fundamental liberties. (52) “Likewise, exceptions to the prohibition of

Union or Member States and provided that appropriate guarantees are given, in order to
protect personal data and other fundamental rights, when it is in the public interest,

in particular the processing of personal data in the field of labor legislation, the
legislation on social protection, including pensions and for security purposes,
supervision and health alert, prevention or control of communicable diseases and other
serious threats to health. (...) "

                                                II

Faced with the prohibition of starting the treatment of biometric data that identify
univocally to the persons of article 9.1), indicates article 9.2 b) and 9.4)

     2. Section 1 shall not apply when one of the circumstances occurs

     following:
   “B) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of obligations and the exercise of

  specific rights of the data controller or interested party in the field of
  Labor and social security and protection law, to the extent authorized by it
  Union or Member State law or a collective agreement pursuant to the
  Law of the Member States that establishes adequate guarantees of respect for the
  fundamental rights and interests of the interested party; "

   (…)

   4. Member States may maintain or introduce additional conditions, including
  limitations, regarding the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data
  related to health. ”´

  The correlation to this mention is found in article 9 of the LOPDGDD, which states:

   "1. For the purposes of article 9.2.a) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in order to avoid
  discriminatory situations, the sole consent of the affected party will not be enough to raise
  the prohibition of data processing whose main purpose is to identify your ideology,

  union membership, religion, sexual orientation, racial or ethnic beliefs or origin.

   The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prevent the processing of said data under
  of the remaining cases contemplated in article 9.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
  when appropriate. "

  In this sense, Article 88 of the RGPD has established that Member States may
  den, through legislative provisions or collective agreements, establish standards
  more specific to guarantee the protection of rights and freedoms in relation to
  with the processing of personal data of workers in the workplace, in particular

  lar, among others, for the purposes of compliance with the obligations established by law or by the
  collective agreement, management, planning and organization of work. These standards must
  include adequate and specific measures to preserve the human dignity of stakeholders
  rights, as well as their legitimate interests and fundamental rights, in particular, in
  relation with, among others, the supervisory systems in the workplace.

  In accordance with the provisions, the treatment must be necessary for compliance with
  legal obligations, considering that the same compliance effects were satisfied

 Opinion 3/2012, on the evolution of biometric technologies, adopted on
 04/27/2012, and that has led the community legislator itself to include these data

 among the special categories of data in the RGPD states that: “When analyzing the
 proportionality of a proposed biometric system, it is necessary to first consider whether
 the system is necessary to respond to the identified need, that is, if it is essential
 to meet that need, and not just the most suitable or profitable. A second factor
 to be taken into account is the probability that the system will be effective in
 respond to the need in question in light of the specific characteristics of the

 biometric technology to be used. A third aspect to ponder is whether the loss
 The resulting intimacy is proportional to the expected benefits. If the benefit is
 relatively minor, such as greater comfort or slight savings, then the loss
 privacy is not appropriate. The fourth aspect to evaluate the adequacy of a system
 biometric is to consider whether a less invasive means of privacy would achieve the end

 wanted".

 The Opinion 2/2017 on the treatment of data in the work of the WG29 (adopted the
 06/08/2017) states that “although the use of these technologies may be useful to detect
 o prevent the loss of intellectual and material property of the company, improving the
 productivity of workers and protecting the personal data of those who are

 commissioned by the controller, it also poses significant challenges in terms of
 privacy and data protection. Therefore, a new evaluation of the
 balance between the legitimate interest of the employer to protect his company and the expectation
 reasonable privacy of the interested parties: the workers ”.

 Therefore, “Regardless of the legal basis for said treatment, before its initiation
 A proportionality test should be performed in order to determine if the treatment
 is necessary to achieve a legitimate purpose, as well as the measures to be taken to
 guarantee that violations of the rights to privacy and to the secrecy of
 communications are limited to a minimum. This may be part of an assessment of

 impact relative to data protection (EIPD) ”.

 Before implementing a fingerprint recognition system, the person in charge must
 to assess whether there is another less intrusive system with which the same purpose is obtained. The
 section 72 of CEPD Guide 3/2019 “on processing of personal data through video

 devices ”, establishes in this sense that:“ The use of biometric data and in particular facial
 re cognition entail heightened risks for data subjects ’rights. It is crucial that recourse to
 such technologies takes place with due respect to the principles of lawfulness, necessity,
 proportionality and data minimization as set forth in the GDPR. Whereas the use of these
 technologies can be perceived as particularly effective, controllers should first of all assess

 the impact on fundamental rights and freedoms and consider less intrusive means to
 achieve their legitimate purpose of the processing ”.

 (“The use of biometric data and, in particular, facial recognition entails
 greater risks for the rights of the interested parties. It is essential that the use of
 these technologies take place respecting the principles of legality, necessity,
 proportionality and minimization of the data established in the RGPD. Considering that
 the use of these technologies can be perceived as especially effective, those responsible

 should, firstly, assess the impact on fundamental rights and freedoms and

  In this case, the respondent indicates that the legitimizing basis of the treatment, based on

  those established in article 6.1 of the RGPD, would be that of express consent. Has not been
  provided the informative clause that includes the wording of the terms of the collection of
  said express consent. He adds that there are two others, the fulfillment of an obligation

  -The very definition of consent, “any manifestation of free will, specific,
  informed and unequivocal by which the interested party accepts, either through a statement or
  a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that concerns you ”is not

  part of an equilibrium position in the relationship. As the GT29 has underlined in various
  opinions, consent can only be valid if the interested party can actually elect

  feeling will not be free in those cases where there is an element of compulsion,
  pressure or inability to exercise free will.

  -The fact that it can be withdrawn when the owner wishes, an element that must be
  cluir in the clause before it is provided, counting on the withdrawal of consent
  will not entail any cost for the interested party and, therefore, no disadvantage for those who
  ns withdraw consent.

  -The possibility of not granting the same must be given, and therefore offer alternatives.

  -Articles 16 to 20 of the RGPD indicate that (when the data processing is based on the
  consent) the interested parties have the right to the deletion of the data when the

  feeling has withdrawn.

                                                 III

  The respondent was charged that, treating personal data of a special category, and
  there is an obligation to have an Impact Assessment on the Protection of the

  Personal Data (EIPD) breached article 35 of the RGPD:

  In the development of paragraph 4, the director of the AEPD as a non-exhaustive list, the Direc-
  AEP organizer published an indicative list of types of treatment that require an evaluation

  The determination of the sanction to be imposed for the violation of article 35 of the
  RGPD in the present case requires observing the provisions of articles 83.1 and 2 of the
  RGPD, precepts that, respectively, provide the following:

  "1. Each supervisory authority will guarantee that the imposition of administrative fines
