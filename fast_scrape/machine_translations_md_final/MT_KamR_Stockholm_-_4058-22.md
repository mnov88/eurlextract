The Court of Appeal decides that Medhelp must pay a penalty fee for forwarding calls to 1177.

The Court of Appeal has concluded that the processing of personal data by forwarding calls to a Thai healthcare company is not supported in Swedish law. Medhelp must pay a penalty fee for this violation of the data protection regulation.
The Court of Appeal also states that there were deficiencies in the processing of the personal data, which was largely sensitive personal data, as well as in the information to the data subjects. The Court of Appeal determines the sanction fee to just over SEK 11 million.
- There has been no support in Swedish law for the forwarding of calls to 1177 to a Thai company. Medhelp has therefore been charged with an additional penalty fee, says the court's president, Court of Appeals Councilor Ingela Fridstr√∂m.
