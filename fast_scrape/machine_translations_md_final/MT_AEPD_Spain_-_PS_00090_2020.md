investigative powers:

very serious the following behavior:
"(ñ) Failure to provide access by staff of the data protection authority

the violation of Article 58.1 of the RGPD typified in Article 83.5 e) of the RGPD. The
The sanction that should be imposed is an administrative fine.

established by Article 83.2 of the RGPD, and with the provisions of Article 76 of the

procedures established for the fulfilment of the obligations that

the requirements of the supervisory authority.
- Art. 83.2(k) RGPD: any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the
circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits obtained or

data processing to which it refers, can potentially affect a
very high number of customers of the responsible entity or users of the
service provided by the responsible entity.
