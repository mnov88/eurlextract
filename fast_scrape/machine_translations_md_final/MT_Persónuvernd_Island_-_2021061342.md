LRH interfered with him quite a few times because it was believed that he was not following the law \[and rules\].

It also states that the law applies to the processing of personal information that is partially or fully automated and to the processing by methods other than automatic of personal information that is or is to become part of a file. what is explained above, there is no word on whether an employee of the police in the capital region recorded a video on his phone from a recording from a surveillance camera \[...\] and shared it in digital form to others. According to the respected authorities of the Personal Protection Agency, the organization does not consider it necessary to investigate further in this regard. It is therefore considered unproven that there has been processing of personal information that is considered automatic in part or in whole, or processing of personal information that was or was to become part of a file. In that case, it is also considered unproven that the processing of personal information that falls under the scope of Act no. 75/2019, cf. Article 3 of the law.
