                                Decision of the Swedish Authority for Privacy

                                Protection (IMY)

                                The Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) finds that Klarna Bank AB is processing
                                personal data in breach of Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation
                                        1
                                (GDPR) by not complying with the complainant’s request of 22 December 2019 for
                                information about the recipients to whom his personal data have been disclosed.

                                The Authority for Privacy Protection issues Klarna Bank AB a reprimand pursuant to

                                Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR for the infringement of Article 15 of the GDPR.

                                Report on the supervisory case

                                The case handling
                                The Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) has initiated supervision regarding Klarna
                                Bank AB (Klarna) due to a complaint. The complaint has been submitted to IMY, in its

                                capacity as lead supervisory authority under Article 56 of the General Data Protection
                                Regulation (GDPR). The handover has been made by the supervisory authority of the
                                country where the complainant has lodged his complaint (Germany) in accordance

                                with the Regulation’s provisions on cooperation concerning cross-border processing.

                                The investigation in the case has been carried out through correspondence. Since the
                                complaint regards cross-border processing, IMY has used the mechanisms for

                                cooperation and consistency contained in Chapter VII of the GDPR. The supervisory
                                authorities concerned have been the data protection authorities in Germany, Denmark,
                                Austria, Italy, Poland, and Finland.

                                asked for since it lacked information about the recipients to whom his personal data
                                had been disclosed. Even though the complainant came back with a request to know
                                exactly which recipients his data had sent to, Klarna has not complied with this

                                request.

                                Due to the complaint, IMY has initiated supervision in order to examine if the

                                complainant’s request has been complied with in accordance with Article 15 of the
                                GDPR.

                                What Klarna has stated
                                Klarna states that it is the controller for the processing to which the complaint relates.

                                                                                     th
                                The information sent to the complainant on the 24 of January 2020 is in accordance
                                with the obligations of the GDPR. Klarna has no duty to reply to the complainant’s
                                access request in any other way that it did. The EDPB Guidelines 01/2022 on access
                                                         th
                                was adopted on the 18 of January 2022, i.e. two years after the complainant’s case
                                regarding access request was closed.

                                Justification of the decision

                                Applicable provisions, etc.

                                Article 15 of the GDPR provides that he data subject shall have the right to obtain from
                                the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her
                                are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data. The

                                data subject shall also have the right to information about the recipients or categories
                                of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed (Article 15(1)(c)).

                                Article 19 of the GDPR requires the controller to communicate any rectification or
                                erasure of personal data or restriction of processing carried out in accordance with
                                Article 16, Article 17(1) and Article 18 to each recipient to whom the personal data
                                have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.

                                The controller shall inform the data subject about those recipients if the data subject
                                requests it.

                                According to Article 5 the controller shall be responsible for, and be able to
                                demonstrate compliance with, inter alia the obligation to processes personal data fairly
                                and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject.

                                EDPB Guidelines 01/2022 on access state that concerning the question, if the
                                controller is free to choose between information on recipients or on categories of

                                recipients, it has to be recalled, that, already under Art. 13 and 14 GDPR information
                                on the recipients or categories of recipients should be as concrete as possible in
                                respect of the principles of transparency and fairness. The controller should therefore

                                generally name the actual recipients unless it would only be possible to indicate the
                                category of recipients. Nevertheless, sometimes naming the actual recipients is not yet
                                possible at the time of the information under Art. 13 and 14 GDPR but only in a later

                                stage, for example when an access request is made. The EDPB recalls in this regard,Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten     Diarienummer: DI-2021-10263                                                              3(4)
                                 Datum: 2022-05-11

                                 that storing information relating to the actual recipients is necessary inter alia to be
                                 able to comply with the controller’s obligations under Art. 5(2) and 19 GDPR.     2

                                 Assessment of the Authority for Privacy Protection

                                 The wording of Article 15(1)(c) of the GDPR does clarify if the controller is free to
                                 choose between information on actual recipients or on only categories of recipients.

                                 However, IMY concludes that Article 15(1)(c), read together with Article 19 and in light
                                 of the principles of fairness and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)) cannot be interpreted

                                 any other way than as a right of the data subject to, especially when explicitly
                                 requested, obtain from the controller information about the actual recipients to whom
                                 the personal data have been or will be disclosed, unless this proves impossible or

                                 involves disproportionate effort.

                                 IMY notes that the complainant has explicitly requested information about actual

                                 recipients. Klarna has not proved that this has proven   impossible or to involve
                                 disproportionate effort. Klarna has thus processed the complainant’s personal data in
                                 violation of Article 15 of the GDPR.

                                 What Klarna has stated about that the EDPB Guidelines on access was adopted after

                                 the access request was complied with, does not lead to any other conclusion. IMY
                                 does not claim that Klarna has an obligation to comply with guidelines that was not
                                 available to Klarna at the time of the violation. IMY’s reason for citing the guidelines is

                                 to prove that there is wide support for IMY’s opinion, which follows from the wording of
                                 Article 19.

                                 Choice of corrective measure

                                 It follows from Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83(2) of the GDPR that the IMY has the
                                 power to impose administrative fines in accordance with Article 83. Depending on the

                                 circumstances of the case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or in
                                 place of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), such as injunctions and
                                 prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83(2) provides which factors are to be taken into

                                 account when deciding on administrative fines and in determining the amount of the
                                 fine.

                                 In the case of a minor infringement, as stated in recital 148, IMY may, instead of
                                 imposing a fine, issue a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b). Factors to consider is
                                 the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature, gravity

                                 and duration of the infringement and past relevant infringements.

                                 IMY notes that the violation has affected one person and has not involved sensitive
                                 data. Furthermore, Klarna has otherwise complied with the complainant’s request for
                                 access. Against this background IMY considers that it is a minor infringement within

                                 the meaning of recital 148 and that Klarna Bank AB must be given a reprimand
                                 pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR for the established infringement.
