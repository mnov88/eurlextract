Reasons for decision: 30

The lawsuit is partially inadmissible and otherwise unfounded. 31

As far as the PVN maintenance obligation insurance tariff maintained by the defendant is concerned, 32
the Essen Regional Court would not have jurisdiction according to § 51 Para. 2 SGG and the lawsuit would already be over
not permitted for this reason. With the request for information, the plaintiff requests information “about all

accordingly restrictive.

The declaratory application for 2) 34, which has not yet been specified for specific contribution adjustments

and the unnumbered benefit applications for 3) and 4) are inadmissible, since there is already one
specific claim within the meaning of Section 253 (2) No. 2 ZPO is missing.

These applications are also not admissible by way of a step action according to § 254 ZPO. A 35

an "excessive" request. However, the use of the word "in particular" makes
clear that the provision also intends to cover other abusive applications (cf.

Heckmann/Paschke, in Ehlmann/Selmayr, General Data Protection Regulation 2nd edition, Art. 12
paragraph 43). With the application, the plaintiff also asserts a formal legal status in which
