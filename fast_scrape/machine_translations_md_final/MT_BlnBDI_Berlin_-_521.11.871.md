This decision is based on the following considerations

I.
The Berlin DPA has established the following facts:

The above-mentioned complainant requested Outfittery GmbH to erase his
data by email from the email address \[redacted-email address 1\] on 23 Au-

gust 2019. Outfittery GmbH confirmed the erasure of the complainant's
data by email on the same day.

On 23 September 2019, you sent the complainant an email to \[redacted-
email address 1\] from team@modomoto.de with information about the mer-

ger of Curated Shopping GmbH with Outfittery GmbH, which was entered
in the commercial register on 27 June 2019, and the transfer of his data to,                                          - 2 -

the system of Outfittery GmbH, unless he objects within two weeks of re-
ceipt of the notification.

By email from \[redacted-email address 1\] of 23 September 2019, the com-
plainant requested an explanation from you and Curated Shopping GmbH
as to why the erasure of his data had not taken place, objected to the fur-
ther use of his data and again requested its erasure. Furthermore, the com-
plainant stated that he had not had a business relationship with Curated
Shopping GmbH.

In the above-mentioned statements, you credibly stated that the complain-
ant had two customer accounts with Curated Shopping GmbH under the
email addresses \[redacted-email address 1\] and \[redacted-email address
2\], independently of his customer account with Outfittery GmbH. You in-
formed the complainant of this after receiving his renewed erasure request
and confirmed to him in an email dated 26 September 2019 that you would

also erase this data for his email address \[redacted-email address 2\].

II.

Legally, we assess the facts as follows. Your company has violated the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Pursuant to Article 17(1)(a) GDPR, The data subject shall have the right to
obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or
her without undue delay. The controller also shall have the obligation to
erase personal data without undue delay if it is no longer necessary in rela-
tion to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.

According to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, personal data shall be processed law-

fully. In order for the processing to be lawful, personal data must be pro-
cessed either with the consent of the data subject or on grounds of a legal
basis, in accordance with Article 6(1) sentence 1 GDPR.

By email addressed to \[redacted-email address 1\], Curated Shopping
GmbH with the email address team@modomoto.de informed the complain-
ant on 23 September 2019 about the merger with Outfittery GmbH and the

transfer of his data into the system of Outfittery GmbH, unless he objected
within two weeks after receipt of the notification. However, this aforemen-
tioned email of 23 September 2019 is also attributable to Outfittery GmbH
as the controller, since the merger with Curated Shopping GmbH was al-
ready entered in the commercial register on 27 June 2019.

Through his erasure request of 23 August 2019, the complainant has ex-

pressed that he is no longer interested in being contacted by Outfittery
GmbH. Further storage of his data for the business purposes of Outfittery
GmbH was thus no longer necessary. The erasure request was also not
denied for other reasons.

However, an erasure did not take place with regard to the complainant's
personal data taken over by Curated Shopping GmbH with effect from 27

June 2019 by Outfittery GmbH. Rather, his data was used again by Outfit-
tery GmbH on 23 September 2019, although it should have already been
erased. The use of the data and the continued storage thus took place with-
out legal grounds.,                                          - 3 -

Outfittery GmbH has thus violated Article 17(1), Article 5(1)(a) and Article
6(1) GDPR.

III.

As a result, we have decided not to take any further supervisory measures
due to the violation, but to leave it at a reprimand.

The reprimand is based on Article 58(2)(b) GDPR.

Taking into account the specific circumstances of the established facts, we
consider a reprimand to be appropriate after completing our investigation.
We have again identified a violation on your part.

In the certain expectation that you will comply with the data protection regu-
lations in the future, we consider the matter closed.

Kind regards,

\[redacted\]
