Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data, completed, in June 2025, an investigation at the Association of Mutual Aid Houses "FLEXICREDIT" and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 paragraph (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

As such, the operator of the Association of Mutual Aid Houses "FLEXICREDIT" was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 15,141.6 lei, the equivalent of 3,000 EURO.

The investigation was initiated following a complaint sent by the Mutual Aid House Association "FLEXICREDIT", which reported that an employee of a secondary school had obtained unauthorized access to the official e-mail address of the educational institution and sent false documents to Flexicredit in order to contract 17 loans.

During the investigation, it was found that, during the period 2023-2024, the Mutual Aid House Association "FLEXICREDIT" granted 17 loans based on documents transmitted electronically by a third party, without the consent of the persons concerned on whose behalf the loan agreements were concluded.

It was also noted that the operator did not properly verify the identity of the applicants in the case of remote loan applications, in relation to the documents received from them.

At the same time, it was found that the Mutual Aid House Association "FLEXICREDIT" did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing, which led to the processing of personal data (e.g. name, surname, personal identification number, home address, ID card series/number, date of issue and issuer of ID card, ID card validity date) of a significant number of data subjects in the context of granting 17 loans based on falsified documents.

As such, in relation to the criteria for individualizing sanctions provided for in art. 83 of the GDPR, it was established that the operator of the Mutual Aid House Association "FLEXICREDIT" be sanctioned with a fine for violating the provisions of art. 32 paragraph (2) of the GDPR.
