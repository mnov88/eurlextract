Subsequently, the complainant (and already applicant) submitted the present case number
Protocol C/EIS/11343/26-10-2022 objection-request for a review of the case
which has the status of a request for treatment, in which he briefly alleges,
inter alia, the following:

It is not a scientific inquiry.
- the data of the requested search concern him and constitute his right
to access his family's historical past, and he requests a review of the data
and requests its reconsideration.
The Authority, after examining the evidence in the file and after hearing the rapporteur
and the clarifications of the Assistant Rapporteur, who was present without the right to vote,
after a thorough discussion,
HAS CONCLUDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW

complains about the legal correctness of the filing act and reiterates

The presumption of compatibility for the processing of personal data for scientific
or historical research (as further processing of data for the purposes of
