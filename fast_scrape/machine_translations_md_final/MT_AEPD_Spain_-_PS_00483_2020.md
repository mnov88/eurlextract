        The violation of article 32 of the RGPD is typified in article

83.4.a) of the aforementioned RGPD in the following terms:

        For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 73, for the purposes of prescription, qualifies
of "Violations considered serious":

        "Based on the provisions of article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

        The RGPD defines personal data security violations as “all-
those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or alteration

        “(83) In order to maintain security and prevent treatment from infringing the dis-
