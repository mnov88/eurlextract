Sanction for violating the RGPD

The National Supervisory Authority completed in February 2022 an investigation at the operator Kaufland Romania SCS and found a violation of the provisions of art. 15 para. (3) of the General Data Protection Regulation on access rights.

As such, the operator was sanctioned with a fine of 98889.4 lei (equivalent to 2000 EURO).

The investigation was initiated following a complaint, and during the investigation, it was found that the operator Kaufland did not provide the petitioner with a copy of all the recordings in the video surveillance system, which is a violation of art. 15 para. (3) of the General Data Protection Regulation

Thus, it was found that the operator did not send, at the request of the data subject, a full copy of the records concerning him from the store, although they were available at the time requested by him.

At the same time, the corrective measure was applied to the operator to communicate to the person concerned all the images requested by him, insofar as they are available, with the blurring of the images that lead to the identification of other persons, according to art. 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
