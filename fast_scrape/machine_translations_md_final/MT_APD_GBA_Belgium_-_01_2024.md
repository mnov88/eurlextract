                                                   Decision 01/2024 of January 5, 2024

personal data and regarding the free movement of such data and to the revocation of

Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), hereinafter “GDPR”;

Having regard to the law of 3 December 2017 establishing the Data Protection Authority,
hereinafter “WOG”;

Has made the following decision regarding:

Complainant: X, hereinafter “the complainant”;

The defendant: Y, with registered office in \[...\], hereinafter “the defendant”. Decision 01/2024 – 2/11

I. Facts and procedure

    1. The subject of the complaint concerns the failure to comply with a request

        inspection and failure to close the professional mailbox in time after departure
        employee.

    2. The complainant explains the facts as follows. From August 1, 2022 to June 6, 2023, the company had

        of the complainant entered into a contract with the defendant. The complainant states that he is in the

        performance of that contract has been employed by the defendant. In this context there was

        created a Microsoft account for him. According to the complainant, certain of the

        rights from the account had already been withdrawn from the defendant before his departure, but would it

        e-mail address \[...\] with mailbox still exist. The complainant states that he has addressed a letter

        to the defendant asking which of his personal data are still being processed,
        but would not have received an answer. The complainant also states that after the departure of

        an ex-colleague, emails were still sent in the name of this ex-employee.

    3. On October 16, 2023, the defendant will be given notice of default by the complainant. In this

        notice of default, a request for inspection will be included. The complainant currently has

        have not yet received a response from the defendant after filing the complaint.

    4. On October 24, 2023, the complainant will submit a complaint to the Data Protection Authority

        against the defendants.

    5. On November 13, 2023, the complainant allegedly notes that his old professional mailbox

        still existed. After all, the complainant himself sent an email to the old mailbox

        and received a delivery confirmation. The complainant forwards this confirmation to the

        First line service. On December 19, 2023, the complainant confirms that he has not yet received an answer

        received from the defendant upon his request for access. On January 3, 2024
        The complainant submits a new delivery note to the Dispute Chamber on the basis of which

        The complainant states that the mailbox in question had not yet been closed on that date.

    6. On November 17, 2023, the complaint will be declared admissible by the First Line Service on
                                                     1
        on the basis of Articles 58 and 60 of the WOG and the complaint is filed on the basis of Article 62,
                                                             2
        § 1 of the WOG transferred to the Disputes Chamber.

II. Justification

    7. The elements in this case are divided into two different processes. On the one hand it is

        there is an alleged failure to clean the complainant's former business mailbox

        removal, on the other hand there is insufficient follow-up to the
        exercising the right of inspection of the complainant. The allegations regarding the sending of

2In accordance with Article 95, § 2 of the WOG, the Disputes Chamber hereby informs the parties that the file will be sent to
has been transferred to her as a result of this complaint. Decision 01/2024 – 3/11

    emails in the name of a former employee are not part of this decision as

    the complainant, on the one hand, does not provide evidence and, on the other, the alleged dispute

    processing does not concern his personal data and he has no power of attorney to do so
    submits.

II.1. As for the failure to delete the mailbox

8. The Disputes Chamber was taken by the complaint that the professional had not been concluded

    e-mail address in the name of the complainant and the respondent concerned after the termination of

    the contractual relationship.

    Purpose limitation principle as referred to in Article 5.1.b) GDPR in combination with the non-

    compliance with articles 5.1.c) (data minimization) and 5.1.e), GDPR (storage limitation)

9. Any processing of personal data must be in line with the principles such as

    included in article 5.1 GDPR. Article 5.1.b) of the GDPR reinforces it

    purpose limitation principle, being the requirement that the data be collected for

    specific, expressly described and legitimate purposes and no further
    are processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. Also the principle

    of minimum data processing – under which only data is allowed

    processed that are adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary

    with regard to the purpose (Article 5.1.c.) of the GDPR) – and the principle of limited

    retention period - under which the data may not be retained in any form
    which allows those involved to be identified and no longer allowed to be identified

    kept as necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed

    (Article 5.1.e) of the GDPR) apply to the processing of personal data.

10. These principles and the resulting obligations for the
    controller also apply to the rights of the data subject,

    as the data subject is in accordance with Article 17.1. a) AVG has the right to obtain from the

    controller to request the deletion of data concerning him

    obtain if this data is no longer necessary for the purposes

    for which they were collected or processed.

11. The email address that is the subject of the complaint and the information constitutes a

    personal data within the meaning of Article 4.1) of the GDPR, as it relates to

    information about an identified or identifiable natural person. This email address
    and the associated mailbox, which is used for professional purposes in the context of the

    activities of the defendant were created were intended to enable the complainant

    to receive and send emails in the context of its activities for the

    defendant.

12. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that in order to comply with the purpose limitation principle

    (Article 5.1.b) GDPR), in combination with the principles of minimum data processing Decision 01/2024 — 4/11

        (Article 5.1.c) GDPR) and storage limitation (Article 5.1.e) GDPR), to the

        controller is the holder of the mailbox that fulfills his function or

        has ceased activities, and must be provided with a certificate no later than on the day of his actual departure

        automatic message. The holder must be notified in advance of this. This

        automatic message warns all subsequent correspondents that the data subject are

        no longer carries out activities within the company and provides the contact details of the

        person (or general email address) who should be contacted instead and this

        for a reasonable period (a priori 1 month). Depending on the contexts in particular

        the degree of responsibility that the person concerned exercises may be a longer period

        be allowed, ideally no longer than three months. The extension must happen

        with the consent of the person concerned or at least after the extension has been terminated

        has been notified. Moreover, an alternative solution must be found as soon as possible

        be searched for and entered without the deadline for this extension having to expire

        are awaited. However, this does not alter the fact that after the termination of his

        function that the person concerned can still have access to for a certain period

        mailbox if there is an agreement between him and the

        controller. 3 This gives the employee the opportunity to:

        for example, to complete the current files.4

    13. The Disputes Chamber establishes that prima facie the defendant has not complied with all the provisions of the

        Dispute chamber regarding the management of e-mail accounts of former employees
                                  5
        seems to have been complied with, although a processing of the business mailbox is in principle
                   6
        legitimate . Since the activities of the complainant for the defendant were terminated

        on June 6, 2023, the Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that the processing of his

        personal data based on the relevant email address and mailbox within a

        should have been terminated within a reasonable period and the complainant should have been notified

        informed.The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that this period could have varied from

        1 to 3 months where, as mentioned, the senders of messages to the

3In its recommendation CM/Rec (2015)5 on the processing of personal data in the context of the employment relationship, it states

the Committee of Minister of the Council of Europe in principle 14.5 the following: when an employee his or her job
leaves, the employer must take technical and organizational measures to ensure that the email from the

employee is automatically deactivated. If the contents of the email must be requested for good
functioning of the organization, the employer must take appropriate measures to retrieve the contents of the email

before the employee's departure and, if possible, in his presence. The explanation accompanying the recommendation states further
(para. 122) that in these situations where the employee leaves the organization, the employer retains the account of the former

employee must deactivate so that there is no longer access to the former employee's communications after his
departure. If the employer wishes to recover the contents of the employee's account, the employer must take the necessary steps

to take steps before the employee's departure, preferably in his presence. This sectoral recommendation that
and completes the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automated Processing

personal data (STE108), illustrates how the principles regarding purpose limitation, minimal data processing
proportionate retention, which are confirmed in both this Treaty and the GDPR, should be applied.

        relevant email address were automatically informed that the data subject

        was no longer active within the company, and therefore without the intervention of any third party

        person. Possibly (if so agreed between both parties) and in general

        such a period could also cause a departing employee

        still has temporary access to the information in the mailbox of his former partner

        client.

    14. The complainant indicates that the agreement between his acting defendant has expired

        since June 6, 2023. This means, given the above, that the email address would

        must be closed on July 6, 2023, or no later than September 6, 2023. The complainant argues

        that this is not the case. In support of this claim, the claimant sends a piece

        This should demonstrate that the mailbox was not closed in time. This concerns:

        a delivery note dated. November 13, 2023 that an email was successfully delivered to the

        disputed email address. This leads the Disputes Chamber to suspect that the defendant

        has committed an infringement of Article 5.1.b), Article 5.1.c) and Article 5.1.e). From the pieces

        it does not appear that the complainant had not received any information regarding the further use of his

        mailbox and his e-mail address, nor that there was anything between the parties in this regard

        agreed.

    15. This leads the Disputes Chamber to suspect that the defendant has committed an infringement

        committed under Article 5.1 b, Article 5.1.c) and Article 5.1 e) GDPR.

        Lawfulness of the processing

    16. Article 6 of the GDPR requires that all processing must be based on a

        legal basis. This means that the controller may not start or,

        as in this case, continue with data processing without relying on one of

        the legality criteria listed in Article 6.1 GDPR, which is the embodiment of the

        principle of lawfulness as referred to in Article 5.1 a) GDPR.

7Article 6.1 GDPR

The processing is only lawful if and to the extent that at least one of the conditions below is met:
a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his personal data for one or more specific purposes
purposes;

b) the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, or upon request
of the
to take measures before concluding a contract;

c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person
to protect;

e) the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in connection with the
exercise of

the public authority assigned to the controller;
f) the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller
or from one

third party, except where the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are such
protection of
personal data outweigh those interests, in particular when the data subject is a child.

Point (f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to processing by public authorities in the exercise of their tasks. Decision 01/2024 – 6/11

    17. It is true that the mailbox can, in view of the defendant's legitimate interest

        accordance with the terms of Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR, for a period of one

        certain period after the termination of the agreement between the data subject and the

        defendant, will continue to be active insofar as this is limited to automatic transmission

        of standard communication regarding the employee's departure, with a view to

        guaranteeing the proper functioning of the company and its continuity

        services. This is of course only possible provided that the other provisions of the GDPR regarding the
        legal basis must also be respected, in particular Article 13.1.c) GDPR, from which

        follows that it must be determined before starting processing activities

        which legal basis applies, and in relation to which specific purpose, with the

        obligation for the controller to inform the complainant thereof

        The file does not prima facie show that the defendant was aware of the complainant

        of the applicable legal basis. Consequently, it can be said that the

        The defendant has processed the complainant's personal data against his expectations

        in.

    18. For cases where the data subject and the controller are in mutual agreement

        agree that the person concerned will remain for a period of one year after his departure

        may have access to his mailbox for a certain period of time – for example to allow the data subject to

        to provide an opportunity to complete ongoing files - permission may be granted (Article

        6.1 a) GDPR) are a valid legal basis for continuing to use the mailbox after

        termination of cooperation. Based on the documents accompanying the complaint, the
        Disputes Chamber cannot determine whether such an arrangement had been agreed between

        the complainant and the defendant.

    19. Finally, reference should also be made to the legal basis contained in Article 6.1.b) GDPR,

        on the basis of which processing can take place if it is necessary for the

        execution of an agreement. Incaseyoucannotfallbackonhere,
        as the complainant had already terminated his contractual relationship with the defendant on 6

        June 2023.

    20. Consequently, the Disputes Chamber must determine that there is no prima facie legal basis

        is the processing of the email address after the termination of the agreement with the

        complainant can justify in the manner used by the defendant. This brings the
        Disputes Chamber to suspect that the defendant has violated Article 5.1.a in conjunction with 6.1

        GDPR has committed.

    21. Based on the above analyses, the Disputes Chamber assumes that the

        defendant infringes the provisions of the GDPR, and in particular Articles 5.1.b),

        c) and e) GDPR on the one hand and Article 5.1.a) j° Article 6.1 GDPR on the other hand, which

8
 In this regard, see Guidelines 05/2020 on consent in accordance with Regulation 2016/679 (edition nos. 121-123);
https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb\_guidelines\_202005\_consent\_nl.pdf. Decision 01/2024 — 7/11

          justifies that in this case a decision is taken on the basis of

          Article 95, §1, 4° of the WOG, more specifically a warning for the future

          formulate against the defendant with regard to the failure to conclude the

          professional mailbox after the complainant's departure.

     22. This decision is a prima facie decision taken by the Disputes Chamber

          in accordance with Article 95 of the WOG on the basis of the complaint submitted by the complainant

          complaint, in the context of the “procedure prior to the decision on the merits” and not 9

          decision on the merits of the Disputes Chamber within the meaning of Article 100 of the WOG. The

          Disputes Chamber has thus decided, on the basis of Article 58.2.a) GDPR and Article 95, §1,

          4° of the WOG, to formulate a warning regarding the defendant, for what

          concerns the failure to close the complainant's professional mailbox in a timely manner after termination

          of employment.

     23. However, if the defendant does not agree with the content of this prima facie statement

          decisions are of the opinion that they can apply factual and/or legal arguments

          that could lead to a different decision, this can be done via the e-mail address

          litigationchamber@apd-gba.beeenrequesttohandlethesubstancesofthecase

          to the Disputes Chamber within thirty days after notification of

          the decision. The implementation of this decision will be carried out if necessary

          suspended for the aforementioned period.

     24. Finally, for the sake of completeness, the Disputes Chamber points out that a substantive hearing

          of the case may lead to the imposition of the measures referred to in Article 100 of the
                 10
          WOG.

    II.2. With regard to the insufficient enforcement of the right of access

    25. To begin with, the Dispute Chamber recalls that the right of access is one of the

        most important requirements of the right to data protection. It is the

        “gateway” that allows the exercise of other rights granted by the GDPR to the

        data subject, such as the right to rectification, the right to erasure and the
                                              11
        right to restriction of processing.

    26. Pursuant to Article 12.1 of the GDPR, the controller must provide appropriate

        take measures to respond to requests from data subjects exercising their rights

        wish to exercise pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 of the GDPR.

        Pursuant to Article 12.3 GDPR, the controller must, as soon as possible and in

        in any case within one month of the request (this period may be possible under certain circumstances).

        conditions are extended by two months). As the data controller

        decides not to respond to a request from the data subject, the

        controller the data subject within one month of receipt of it

        request, provide an answer stating the reasons for the decision (Article 12.4

        GDPR).

    27. According to Article 15.1 of the GDPR, the data subject has the right to obtain from the
        to obtain a decision from the controller as to whether or not to process it

        regarding personal data. If the latter is the case, the person concerned has it

        right to inspect those personal data and information referred to in Article

        15.1.a)–h) of the GDPR is stated, such as the purpose of the processing of the

        data and the possible recipients of the data, as well as information about it

        existence of his rights, including the right to rectification or erasure of his data

        or to file a complaint with the GBA. The purpose of the right of access is the

        to enable the data subject to understand how his data are processed

        and what the consequences are as well as the accuracy of the processed data

        control without having to justify his intention.12

    28. Based on the documents in the file, the Disputes Chamber determines that the complainant was on 16

        exercised his right of inspection in October 2023, but the documents do not show that the

        complainant should receive an answer from the defendant. Consequently, the

        Dispute Chamber also stated that the defendant may have acted contrary to Article

        12.3 and 12.4 of the GDPR, as well as Article 15.1 of the GDPR.

    29. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that an analysis should be carried out on the basis of the above

        concluded that the controller may have committed an infringement of the
        provisions of the GDPR was committed, which justifies this in this case

        proceeded to make a decision on the basis of Article 95, §1, 5° WOG, more

        stipulates that the controller should be ordered to take action where appropriate

        indicate the exercise by the complainant of his right of access (Article 15.1 GDPR) and this in

        particularly in view of the document that the complainant has provided which shows that the complainant

        has indeed exercised his right of access, but the controller

        prima facie did not comply with that."

    30. This decision is a prima facie decision taken by the Disputes Chamber

        in accordance with Article 95 of the WOG on the basis of the complaint submitted by the complainant,

        in the context of the “procedure prior to the decision on the merits” 13 and none

        decision on the merits of the Disputes Chamber within the meaning of Article 100 of the WOG.

    31. The Disputes Chamber has thus decided on the basis of Article 58.2.c) GDPR and

        Article 95, § 1, 5° of the WOG, ordering the defendant to comply with the request

        of the data subject to exercise his rights, in particular the right of access such as

        determined in Article 15 GDPR.

    32. The purpose of this decision is to inform the defendant of the fact that

        it has committed an infringement of the provisions of the GDPR and this is possible
        to still comply with the aforementioned provisions.

    33. However, if the defendant does not agree with the contents of this fine

        facie decision and is of the opinion that it may allow factual and/or legal arguments

        funds that could lead to a different decision can be made via the e-mail address

        litigationchamber@apd-gba.beeenrequesttohandlethesubstancesofthecase

        to the Disputes Chamber and this within the period of 30 days after notification of this

        decision. The implementation of this decision will be carried out if necessary

        suspended for the aforementioned period.

    34. In the event of a continuation of the merits of the case, the

        Dispute Chamber the parties on the basis of Articles 98, 2° and 3° in conjunction with Article 99 WOG

        invite them to submit their defenses as well as any documents they deem useful
