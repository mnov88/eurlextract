                                            III
       The denounced facts materialize in that the defendant lacks a DPD
in contradiction with what is indicated and required by the data protection regulations.

       Article 58.2 of the RGPD establishes that “Each control authority shall have

of all of the following corrective powers listed below:

       (...)
       b) punish any person in charge or in charge of treatment with
awareness

       when the processing operations have infringed the provisions of the
       these Regulations;
       (...)
       d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of
       treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, when
       proceed, in a certain way and within a specified timeframe;

       (...)

       It should be noted that the Public Administrations act as responsible
of the processing of personal data and, on occasions, exercise functions of
those in charge of the treatment so, following the principle of responsibility

proactively, they are responsible for meeting the obligations detailed in the RGPD, among which
includes appointing a data protection officer, making your data public
contact and communicate them to the AEPD (article 37 RGPD).

       Article 37 RGPD, paragraphs 1 and 7 refer to these obligations and

establish, respectively:

       "1. The person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will designate a delegate of
data protection provided that:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/9

       a) the treatment is carried out by a public authority or body, except those
       courts that act in the exercise of their judicial function; ”.
       (…)

       "7. The person in charge or the person in charge of treatment will publish the data of
Contact
of the data protection officer and will communicate them to the control authority. "

       On the appointment of the data protection officer, sections 3 and 5

of article 37 of the RGPD state that:

       "3. When the person in charge or the person in charge of the treatment is an authority or
public body, a single data protection delegate may be appointed to
several of these authorities or bodies, taking into account their structure

organizational and size ”.

       "5. The data protection officer may be part of the staff of the
controller or processor or perform their functions within the framework
of a service contract. "

       For its part, the LOPDGDD dedicates article 34 to the “Designation of a
data protection officer ”, provision that provides:

       "1. Those responsible and in charge of the treatment must designate a
data protection officer in the cases provided for in article 37.1 of the

Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and (...) "
       (…)
       "3. Those responsible and in charge of the treatment will communicate within the period of
ten days to the Spanish Data Protection Agency or, where appropriate, to the
Autonomous data protection authorities, the designations, appointments and

terminations of the data protection delegates both in the cases in which
are obliged to their designation as in the case in which it is voluntary ”.

                                           IV
       The organs and agencies of the Public Sector are obliged to designate a
DPD that has the due qualification, to guarantee the necessary means

for the exercise of its functions and to notify the designation to the AEPD for its
inclusion in the Public Registry of DPD.

       The DPO will perform its functions paying due attention to the risks
associated with treatment operations, taking into account the nature, the

scope, context and purposes of the treatment.

       The DPD has no personal responsibility, for this mere fact, for the
possible data protection infringements committed by your
organization.

       The DPD of the Public Sector body or body must receive the
claims addressed to them by the companies, when they choose this route before

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/9

file a claim with the AEPD, and communicate the decision taken to the
administered within a maximum period of two months.
       Likewise, the DPD must receive the claims that the AEPD decides

transfer you prior to the initiation of a sanctioning file. The delegate
must communicate the decision taken to the company and the AEPD within the maximum term
of one month.
       In this way, in general, if the DPO achieves that the person responsible
resolve the claim by either of these two ways, and without prejudice to the fact that the
The interested party later goes to the AEPD, a file of

declaration of infringement of that Public Administration.

       Article 83.5 b) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the obligations
of the person in charge and the person in charge in accordance with articles 8, 11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43 ”, is

punishable, in accordance with section 4 of the aforementioned article 83 of the aforementioned
Regulation, “with administrative fines of 10,000,000 EUR maximum or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount ”.

       The LOPDGDD in its article 71, Infractions, states that:

       “The acts and conducts referred to in the
paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that
are contrary to this organic law ”.

       The LOPDGDD indicates in article 73, "Violations considered serious":

       "Based on the provisions of article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
are considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a

substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

       (...)

       Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and article 34 of this organic law. "
