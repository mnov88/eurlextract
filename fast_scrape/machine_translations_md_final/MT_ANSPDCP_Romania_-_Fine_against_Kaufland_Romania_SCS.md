Sanction for RGPD & # 13;
& # 13;
The National Supervisory Authority completed in December 2021 an investigation at the operator Kaufland Romania SCS and found a violation of the provisions of art. 15 para. (3) of the General Data Protection Regulation, regarding the right of access. & # 13;
As such, the operator was sanctioned with a fine of 14846.4 lei (equivalent to 3000 EURO). & # 13;
The investigation was initiated following a complaint from a data subject that the operator did not provide a full copy of the video recordings for a certain time during which it was in the commercial premises. & # 13;
In the investigation, it was considered that it is the obligation of the operator to communicate a video containing images concerning the data subject, as a result of the exercise of the right of access by him, and the communication of images can be done by the operator by taking shutter action ( "Blurring") of those images that could infringe the rights and freedoms of other individuals, if any. Therefore, the operator is obliged to adopt a series of technical and organizational measures, in order to allow the full exercise of the access right of the data subject, while respecting the rights of other individuals. & # 13;
As such, the National Supervisory Authority found that the operator did not fully communicate the respective video recordings requested, which constitutes a violation of art. 15 para. (3) of the General Data Protection Regulation. & # 13;
