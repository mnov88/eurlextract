                               Account of the supervisory matter

                               The Swedish Privacy Protection Agency (IMY) has started supervision regarding Nordea Bank Abp,

                               branch in Sweden (hereinafter Nordea or the bank) for the purpose of investigating a complaint about the right to
                               access according to Article 15 of the Data Protection Regulation.

                               The appellant has essentially stated the following. The complainant has requested access from Nordea

                               regarding a recording of a conversation between the complainant and one of Nordeas
                               coworker. The complainant has not received a copy of the conversation between Nordea's employees
                               vote appears, which the appellant has requested.

                               Nordea has essentially stated the following. The appellant has requested to be informed of
                               the recording of the current call. Nordea has complied with the request by the appellant
                               have been able to listen to the recording on site at Nordea. The appellant has further been offered

                               transcription of the conversation as well as a copy of the audio file with recording there Nordeas
                               employee's voice is edited out, as it has been judged to have a negative impact on
                               the employee's rights to disclose his vote.

                                 personal data relating to the registered person is processed or not. Treated as such

                                 data, the personal data controller must e.g. provide the data subject with a copy
                                 on the personal data that is being processed. This right to a copy shall not, however
                                                                                      4

                                 The purpose of the right of access is for the data subject to become aware that
                                 the processing takes place and be able to check that it is legal. The right to receive a copy of

                                 personal data includes a right for the data subject to receive an accurate and comprehensible
                                 reproduction of all personal data processed by the personal data controller

                                 IMY's assessment

                                 The complainant's voice, appearing in a telephone conversation, constitutes personal data about him

                                 the appellant, which the appellant is thus entitled to receive a copy of in an audio file. Nordeas
                                 however, the employee's voice does not constitute personal data about the complainant. As for that part

                                 of the current telephone conversation which consists of statements from Nordea's employees is
                                 therefore sufficient that the data, to the extent that they constitute personal information about

                                 the appellant, provided by a transcript of the conversation.

                                 In the case, it has emerged that Nordea has provided access by offering the audio file
                                 containing the complainant's voice and transcription of the conversation. IMY states

                                 thus that Nordea has satisfied the complainant's request for access. Against this one
                                 background, the Swedish Privacy Authority finds no reason to take any further action

                                 action in the matter.

                                 The case must therefore be closed.
