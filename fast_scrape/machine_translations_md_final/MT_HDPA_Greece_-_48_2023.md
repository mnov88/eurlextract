The Authority ruled that the collection and use of name and VAT number by an accountant on behalf of an heir without a relevant order constitutes a violation of articles 5 par. 1 item. a) and 6 para. 1 GDPR, while also ruling that the complained data controller violated the provisions of article 15 GDPR in combination with the provisions of article 12 paras. 3, 4 GDPR, as he improperly responded to the subject's access request.

The Authority imposed by a majority a total fine of 1,000 euros on the complained controller for the above infringements.
