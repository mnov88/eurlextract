The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in June 2025, an investigation at the operator of the Alliance for the Unity of Romanians Party (AUR) and found a violation of the provisions of:

         a) art. 32 para. (1) let. b) and d) and para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in conjunction with art. 25 para. (1) and (2) of the same regulatory act;

          b) art. 5 para. (1) let. c) and para. (2), in relation to the provisions of art. 6 para. (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.  

For the acts committed, the following sanctions were applied to the operator:

         a) fine, in the amount of 50,587.00 lei, the equivalent in lei of the amount of 10,000 euros

         b) fine, in the amount of 75,880.50 lei, the equivalent in lei of the amount of 15,000 euros

The investigation was initiated following the transmission by the operator of the Alliance for the Unity of Romanians Party (AUR) of two notifications regarding the breach of personal data security, according to the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as following some notifications received by the Authority.

a) One of the notified security breaches concerned the aur.mobi application used and managed by the operator, whose vulnerability was exploited by a third party by accessing the source code of the application.

The investigation found that, due to a configuration error, at the time of the incident, the following categories of personal data of its users (supporters/members, individuals who provided personal data in the operator's application) could be viewed in the aur.mobi application: first and last name, telephone number, e-mail address, residence address, personal identification number, date of birth, nationality, citizenship, gender, religion, profession, occupation, field of activity, experience in other fields, studies (institution, specialization, start date, end date), political experience (party, position, start date, end date), administrative experience (institution, position, start date, end date), foreign languages spoken (language, level).

Therefore, it was found that the operator violated the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) letters b) and d) and para. (2), in conjunction with art. 25 para. (1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) 679/2016, since it did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that, by default, personal data cannot be accessed, without the intervention of the person, by an unlimited number of persons, including the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality and resilience of the processing systems and services, as well as a process for periodically testing, evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the processing, respectively, it did not implement, both when establishing the means of processing and during the processing itself, such appropriate technical and organizational measures. This led to the unauthorized disclosure and unauthorized access to the personal data of the application users (supporters/members of the AUR party), by accessing the source code of the aur.mobi application by third parties, as a result of querying a vulnerable programming interface.

b) The Permanent Electoral Authority forwarded two notifications to the National Supervisory Authority reporting a possible violation of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 by the AUR operator, by collecting personal data (surname, first name, ID number and series, home address, date of birth, email, telephone number, signature) through the platforms www.semnezsivotez.org and www.semnezsivotez.ro for a significant number of data subjects.

During the investigation, it was found that the personal data were processed by the operator for the purpose of informing the data subjects about an AUR campaign and for statistical purposes, as well as that the processed data are not adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the declared purposes of the processing.

As such, it was found that the operator violated the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) letter c) and para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in relation to the provisions of art. 6 par. (1) of the Regulation, since it processed without legal basis, through the websites semnezsivotez.ro and semnezsivotez.org, personal data that are not adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary, in relation to the declared purposes of the processing.

During the investigation, the operator deactivated the IT platforms semnezsivotez.ro and semnezsivotez.org.
