Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in December 2024, an investigation at the operator Omniasig Vienna Insurance Group S.A. and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 paragraph (4) in conjunction with art. 32 paragraph (1) and paragraph (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

For the act committed, the operator was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 14,931 lei, equivalent to the amount of 3,000 euros.

The investigation was initiated following the transmission by the operator Omniasig Vienna Insurance Group S.A. of a notification of a personal data breach, according to the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Thus, the operator notified that an employee of a processor (legal entity) with whom it collaborated, collected undue amounts by completing compensation claims for non-existent events, using the identity of clients, insured individuals.

During the investigation, it was found that the employee of the processor, who had access to the operator's claim files, had unauthorized access to personal data, such as: name, surname, home address, image of the person, personal identification number, number and series of the identity card, medical data, financial data of the data subjects.

In this context, the security breach occurred as a result of unauthorized access over a determined period of time to personal data belonging to a significant number of data subjects.

Thus, it was found that the operator did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing, including the ability to ensure integrity, to guarantee the security of the processing and did not take appropriate measures to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the operator or the person empowered by the operator and having access to personal data does not process them except at the request of the operator.

At the same time, the corrective measure of establishing an inspection/audit plan at the level of the person empowered by the operator was ordered against the operator, so as to avoid similar security incidents.

The operator paid the established contravention fine.
