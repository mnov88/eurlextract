FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

I
By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

II
Caja Rural is accused of committing an offense for violation of the Article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, which states that:

"1. The personal data will be:
(…)
f) treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate data security personal data, including protection against unauthorized or illegal processing and against
its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of technical measures or appropriate organizational ("integrity and confidentiality").
(…) "
Article 5, Duty of confidentiality, of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 of December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
hereinafter LOPDGDD), points out that:

"1. Those responsible and in charge of data processing as well as all people who intervene in any phase of this will be subject to the duty of confidentiality referred to in article 5.1.f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

2. The general obligation indicated in the previous section will be complementary to the duties of professional secrecy in accordance with its applicable regulations.

when the relationship between the obligated party and the person in charge of the treatment".

On the other hand, article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the basic principles for processing, including conditions for consent pursuant to articles 5, 6, 7 and 9 ”is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the mentioned article 83 of the aforementioned RGPD, “with administrative fines of € 20,000,000 at most or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% as maximum total annual global business volume of the previous financial year,
opting for the highest amount ”.

The regulation of infractions in the LOPDGDD is more precise in terms of the
situations that give rise to an infringement and its consideration, so that it is
much easier to know the statute of limitations for that offense (that is, if it is
considered mild, serious or very serious) and in view of the administrative sanction to be imposed for its breach.

The LOPDGDD in its article 72, for the purposes of prescription, indicates that they are: "Violations considered very serious:

1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:

a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
(…) "

The documentation in the file offers clear indications that Caja Rural violated article 5 of the RGPD, principles relating to treatment, in relation with article 5 of the LOPGDD, duty of confidentiality, when considering proven the public exposure of a document on the notice board of the cafeteria of the Caja Rural premises a list of partners (among them is the claimant), showing their personal data, and therefore it is understood that the entity claimed violated article 5.1 f) of the RGPD, which governs the principles of integrity and confidentiality of personal data, as well as the proactive responsibility of the responsible for the treatment to demonstrate its compliance.

It is important to note that Caja Rural recognizes that the notice board is
always used for this purpose, and that once the period of fifteen days of
audience, the entity proceeded to withdraw the advertisement; and in this sense you have to point out that the hearing procedure is only for those interested, not for everyone who stop by the cafeteria and be unaffected. This is why the
Article 5.1 f) of the RGPD.

The claimant provided the photograph of the Caja Rural notice board, where the data of the claimant, which is perfectly identifiable, where their surnames and names are listed (in alphabetical order) (…).

The duty of confidentiality, previously the duty of secrecy, must It is understood that its purpose is to prevent leaks of data not consented by the owners thereof.

Therefore, this duty of confidentiality is an obligation incumbent upon not
only to the person in charge and in charge of the treatment but to everyone who intervenes in any phase of the treatment and complementary to the duty of professional secrecy.

Regarding what is alleged by Caja Rural, it is clear that in this specific case,
acted contrary to the principle of confidentiality enshrined in article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, in relation to article 5 of the LOPDGDD, since Caja Rural revealed through the public exhibition of a document on the notice board announcements of the personal data of the claimant.

will have all of the following corrective powers listed below:
