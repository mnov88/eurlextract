Dear Mr. XXX,
 
We come back to your data protection complaint against \[...\], Munich concerning the use of "Mailchimp". As a result of our intervention, the company has now informed us that it had used Mailchimp twice to send newsletters. As a result of our intervention, the company has now informed us that it will no longer use Mailchimp with immediate effect.
 
The company also informed us that it had only transmitted e-mail addresses to Mailchimp in the context of the above-mentioned use. It had also stated that the recommendations of the European Data Protection Board on the so-called Supplementary Measures for transfers of personal data to third countries are not yet available in a final version, but are still the subject of a public consultation; this is true (cf. According to our https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/public-consultations-art-704/2020/recommendations-012020-measures-supplement-transfer\_en, EDPB Recommendations 01/2021). 
 
According to our assessment, the use of Mailchimp by \[...\] in the two cases mentioned - and thus also the transfer of your email address to Maichimp, which is the subject of your complaint - was unlawful under data protection law because \[...\] had not examined whether, in addition to the EU standard data protection clauses (which were used), "additional measures" within the meaning of the ECJ decision "Schrems II" (ECJ, Rt. v. 16. 7.2020, C-311/18) are necessary to make the transfer compliant with data protection, and in the present case there are at least indications that Mailchimp may in principle be subject to data access by U.S. intelligence services on the basis of U.S. law FISA702 (50 U.S.C. ยง 1881) as a possible so-called Electronic Communications Service Provider and thus the transfer could only be permissible by taking such additional measures (if suitable). 
 
We informed the company that the above-mentioned transfers of personal data to the USA were therefore impermissible.
 
Beyond this determination of the inadmissibility of the above-mentioned data transfers, we do not consider supervisory measures pursuant to Article 58 (2) of the GDPR to be necessary in this specific case by way of a discretionary decision. We have made it clear to the company that the above-mentioned transmission of your e-mail address was illegal under data protection law. We do not consider it necessary to impose a fine - as requested by you. In this respect, we hereby inform you that, in our opinion, a data subject has no legal entitlement to the imposition of a fine in the event of a data protection violation, and in our opinion, no entitlement to a discretionary decision on the imposition of a fine.
This is because, unlike some of the other remedial powers referred to in Article 58(2) GDPR (such as the power to instruct the controller to comply with requests by the data subject to exercise his or her rights (Article 58(2)(c) GDPR), the power to impose a fine under Article 83 GDPR (Article 58(2)(i) GDPR) does not serve to safeguard the rights and freedoms of a data subject, but rather the public interest in enforcing the law. Consequently, a data subject does not have a subjective right against data protection supervisory authorities to decide on the imposition of a fine under Article 58(2)(i) GDPR. However, even if one were to recognize such a subjective right of a data subject, there would be no claim on your part for the imposition of a fine against \[...\] in the present case. Taking into account the relevant factors listed in Article 83 of the GDPR that play a role in this decision, it is within the scope of discretion to refrain from imposing a fine in the present case. This is particularly the case because in the present case only a few cases of inadmissible data were transmitted, and secondly because the data involved - in the form of e-mail addresses - is still relatively manageable in its sensitivity; the latter alone would not be sufficient to justify a waiver of the fine. As a result, however, the waiver of the fine is free of discretionary error in the present case, particularly in light of the fact that the above-mentioned recommendations of the European Data Protection Board have not been implemented.
Recommendations of the European Data Protection Board are declared to be still in a public consultation and therefore not yet available in the final version, so that the present infringement is still to be classified as minor with regard to its nature and gravity (Article 83 (2) (a) of the GDPR), and in particular only a slight degree of negligence at most is to be affirmed (Article 83 (2) (b) of the GDPR). 

The processing of your complaint is thus completed on this side. This letter is the legally required information about the result of the processing of your complaint according to Art. 77 (2) DSGVO.
