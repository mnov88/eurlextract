                  RESOLUTION OF ACTIONS FILE

Of the actions carried out by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and
based on the following:

                                       FACTS

FIRST: Don A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claiming party), dated August 21,
2020, filed a claim with the Spanish Agency for Data Protection. The
The claim is directed against GOOGLE LLC and the ROYAL SPANISH ACADEMY (in
forward, this last RAE or the claimed party).

The reasons on which the claim is based are the following:

- Through HTML code embedded in the WWW.RAE.ES web page,
collected personal data from the claimant and have transferred it to the US through the
Google Analytics and Google Ads services contracted by the person in charge of the portal,

the RAE.

- During the visit of the complaining party to the mentioned website, the person in charge treated
your personal data (at least IP address and "cookies"), and, apparently,
some of this data was transferred to Google LLC. The complaining party had

signed in to your Google account associated with your email inbox.

- The complaining party maintains that the transfer of personal data to the US by
part of the person in charge through his treatment manager has no legal basis,
since the CJEU has invalidated the decision on the "EU-US Privacy Shield" in the
ruling C-311/18 ("Schrems II"), and the controller can no longer base the transfer of

data to Google in the USA in an adequacy decision pursuant to Art. 45 of the
GDPR.

- The person in charge cannot base the transfer of data on the clauses
contractual type provided for in arts. 46.2.c and 46.2.d of the GDPR, if the third country of
destination does not guarantee adequate protection of the personal data transferred

under those clauses, in accordance with EU law. The CJEU has ruled
explicitly that onward transfers to companies covered by the
Article 50 of the United States Code (USC), as is the case of Google,
violate the relevant articles of Chapter 5 of the GDPR, since, by virtue of this
regulations (50 USC Par. 1881, or "FISA 702"), are subject to surveillance by the

US intelligence. As can be seen from the "Snowden Slides" and from the
Google Transparency Report, this entity is actively providing data
personal data to the US government under that precept.

- The controller and Google have continued to rely on the "EU-US Privacy Shield" and on
the standard data protection clauses for the aforementioned transfers

of data.

 Therefore, it requests that the claim be fully investigated and that the following be established:
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/15

 1. What personal data was transferred from the controller to Google LLC in
 USA or any other third country and international organization.

 2. In which transfer mechanism under article 44 et seq. of the

 GDPR the controller based this data transfer.

 3. If the provisions of the Google Analytics Terms of Service and the
 new Conditions for the treatment of data of Google Ads in its current version
 and with effect from 08/31/2020 they comply with the requirements of article 28 GDPR
 regarding the transfer of personal data to third countries.

 4. Immediately impose a ban or suspension of any
 flow of data to Google LLC in the USA and order the return of that data to the
 EU/EEA or to another country offering adequate protection under Articles
 58(2)(d), (f) and (j) GDPR.

 5. That an administrative fine be imposed on the person responsible and on Google.
