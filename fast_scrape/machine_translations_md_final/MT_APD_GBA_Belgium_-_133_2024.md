Decision 133/2024 of 25 October 2024

File number: DOS-2024-01206

Subject: complaint regarding use of photos by former employee, among others, brochures and mailings

The Dispute Resolution of the Data Protection Authority, composed of Mr

Hielke HIJMANS, sole chair;

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016

on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of

personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing

Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), hereinafter referred to as the “GDPR”;

Having regard to the law of 3 December 2017 establishing the Data Protection Authority,

hereinafter referred to as “WOG”;

Having regard to the internal rules of procedure, as approved by the Chamber of

Representatives on 20 December 2018 and published in the Belgian Official Gazette on

15 January 2019;

Having regard to the documents in the file;

Has taken the following decision regarding:

Complainant: X, hereinafter referred to as “the complainant”

Defendant: Y, hereinafter referred to as “the defendant” Decision 133/2024 — 2/5

I. Facts and procedure

1. The subject of the complaint concerns the fact that the complainant is depicted inappropriately in the

brochures of her former employer, which is a security company. The complainant sends

in support of the foregoing copies of the brochures on which photos of a woman are indeed

shown. 2. On 5 March 2024, the complainant files a complaint with the Data Protection Authority

against the defendant.

3. On 2 April 2024, the complaint is declared admissible by the First Line Service on the basis

of Articles 58 and 60 WOG and the complaint is transferred to the Dispute Resolution Chamber on the basis

of Article 62, § 1 WOG.

II. Reasoning

4. Based on the elements in the file known to the Dispute Resolution Chamber and on the basis

of the powers assigned to it by the legislator on the basis of Article 95, § 1 WOG,

the Dispute Resolution Chamber decides on the further follow-up of the file; in this case

the Dispute Resolution Chamber proceeds to dismiss the complaint in accordance with Article 95,

§ 1, 3° WOG, on the basis of the reasoning below.

5. When a complaint is dismissed, the Dispute Chamber must motivate its decision in stages and:

- pronounce a technical dismissal if the file contains no or insufficient

elements that could lead to a conviction, or if there is insufficient

prospect of a conviction due to a technical impediment,

which prevents it from reaching a decision;

- or pronounce a policy dismissal if, despite the presence of

elements that could lead to a sanction, continuing the investigation of the file

does not seem appropriate in light of the priorities of the Data Protection Authority, as

specified and explained in the Dispute Chamber's policy on dismissal. 2

6. In the event that a complaint is dismissed on more than one ground, the

grounds for dismissal (respectively 3
technical dismissal and policy dismissal) must be dealt with in order of

importance. 1Court of Appeal Brussels, Market Court Section, 19 Chamber A, Market Affairs Chamber, judgment 2020/AR/329, 2 September 2020,

In this regard, the Dispute Chamber refers to its policy of dismissal as set out in detail on the website of the GBA:

dismissal policy of the Dispute Chamber. Decision 133/2024 — 3/5

7. In the present file, the Dispute Chamber will dismiss the complaint,

on the basis of the policy of dismissal. There are two reasons for the decision of the Dispute Chamber why it considers it undesirable to continue with the case and therefore decides not to proceed, inter alia, to a hearing on the merits.4

8. Firstly, the complainant has not been able to demonstrate that she has exercised her rights vis-à-vis the controller. After all, her complaint is not accompanied by

any evidence showing that she has exercised her rights to have her photos deleted in accordance

with Article 17 GDPR. Furthermore, the complainant states that

her employment with the controller was terminated in an unpleasant manner.

She therefore does not wish to contact her former employer.

9. Secondly, according to the Dispute Chamber, the complainant has not substantiated with sufficient

evidence that the defendant has processed her photos unlawfully. The complainant states in the complaint that her photos were used more often in the past

in brochures, mailings and additional training. Although she indicates that she did not

give prior permission for this, the Dispute Chamber concludes from the above that the

complainant agreed to be depicted in the brochures and other material of the processor for a longer period of

time. Furthermore, it is not clear whether, and if so, what agreements existed in this regard between the

complainant and the defendant. The Dispute Chamber therefore has insufficient evidence

to be able to pass judgment on the lawfulness of the processing by the

defendant.

III. Publication and communication of the decision

10. Given the importance of transparency with regard to the decision-making of the

Dispute Chamber, this decision is published on the website of the

Data Protection Authority. However, it is not necessary for the identification

data of the parties to be made public directly for this purpose.

11. In accordance with its policy on dismissal, the Dispute Chamber will communicate the decision to the defendant
5
. After all, the Dispute Chamber has decided to notify its decisions on dismissal

ex officio to the defendants. However, the Dispute Chamber will refrain

from such notification if the complainant has requested anonymity with regard to

the defendant and notification of the decision to the defendant(s), even

4Cf. criterion A.2 in the Dispute Chamber's policy on dismissal.
5Cf. Title 5 – Will the dismissal of my complaint be published? Will the opposing party be informed of this?

of the Dispute Chamber's policy on dismissal. Decision 133/2024 — 5/5

In order to enable the complainant to consider other possible remedies, the

Dispute Chamber refers the complainant to the explanation in its policy on dismissal. 9
