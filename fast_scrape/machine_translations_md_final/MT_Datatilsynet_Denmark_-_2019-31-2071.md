After a review of the case, the DPA finds grounds for reprimanding Reto Moto for not provid-
                                                                                                          VAT No. 11883729
ing a copy of in-game chat messages sent directly to and from the complainant in accordance
                                                                          1
with Article 15(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) .

However, the DPA finds that Reto Moto was entitled not to provide a copy of other in-game

chat messages, cf. GDPR Article 15(4).

Furthermore, the DPA finds that Reto Moto was entitled not to provide a copy of any personal

information in relation to anti-cheat measures, cf. section 22(1) of the Danish Data Protection
             2
Act (DDPA) .

Below is a detailed examination of the case and an explanation of the DPA’s decision.

2. Statement of the facts

The complainant requested access on 30 May 2019.

Reto Moto replied to the complainant’s request on 26 June 2019. Reto Moto wrote in the reply,

that data about game replay, anti-cheat related information, server logs and in-game chat mes-

sages would not be disclosed to the complainant, as this is property of Reto Moto and/or con-
stitutes trade secrets

On 28 June 2019, the complainant contacted Reto Moto regarding the reply, as the reply in

his opinion was incomplete.

Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General
Regulation on data protection).
2Law No 502 of 23 May 2018 supplementing the Regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of
personal data and on the free movement of such data (the Data Protection Act).2.1. Reto Moto’s comments                                                                           Page2of8

Reto Moto has stated that Reto Moto replied to the complainant’s access request on 26 June
2019.

Reto Moto did not provide a copy of the following data:

    •    Game replay data
    •    Anti-cheat related information

    •    Server logs
    •    In-game chat messages

A copy of game replay data and server logs was not provided as Reto Moto had deleted these
before receiving the complainant’s access request.

Reto Moto has stated that when the company received the access request, the company as-

sessed the data subject’s wish to gain access to his personal data and the protection of the
rights or freedoms of other persons, including business secrets and intellectual property rights

of Reto Moto. As a result, Reto Moto did not provide a copy of personal data containing anti-
cheat related information and in-game chat messages.

Reto Moto has explained that anti-cheat information is a sort of a technical log with data ex-

plaining why a given player is excluded from the game. Anti-cheat information contains very
few personal data. In connection with the complainant’s cheating, he was given the reasons

for his exclusion and made aware of the time of the cheating in the game. The anti-cheat
related information that was not disclosed consists of information used to determine whether

a player should be excluded from playing because the player has attempted to cheat in viola-
tion of Reto Moto’s terms of business and the rules of the game. This includes information

about the software used by the user to cheat the game. Reto Moto does not consider this
information to be personal data, as it is software and other technical aspects that are not per-

sonal data in itself, even if it is linked to the complainant. In addition, Reto Moto considers this
information strictly confidential, because disclosure of this information, including the software

type and properties of Reto Moto’s game, might reveal how players can cheat the game and
the underlying logic, which harms Reto Moto and other players.

In regard to in-game chat messages, Reto Moto has explained that this includes messages
that players can exchange with each other during their online games at Reto Moto. Such mes-

sages can be provided in the form of files in which chats are logged.

Reto Moto has not provided copies of these conversations and their content to the complainant
as this will involve disclosure of personal data of other people. Reto Moto cannot remove other

people’s data from in-game chat messages. This is due, among other things, to the fact that
in-game chat messages take place in a multitude of different languages that Reto Moto does

not understand. In-game chat messages are also often written in “jargon”, for example using
national abbreviations for actions, users etc. that Reto Moto does not understand either. In

addition, even where Reto Moto understands in-game chat messages linguistically, there may
be context in the messages that Reto Moto does not understand, which means that the mes-

sages might relate not only to the complainant but also to another player. Thus, Reto Moto
cannot guarantee that a copy of in-game chat messages will not result in disclosure of personal

data of other players.

Consequently, Reto Moto is of the opinion that the protection of the rights and freedoms of the
other players outweighs the interest of the complainant in recieving access to personal data.In-game chat messages with the technical aids available within reasonable limits cannot be              Page3of8

made public without also publishing the personal data of others.

2.2. The complainants comments
The complainant has stated that Reto Moto has refused to grant him access to all the personal

data they have collected about him.

In regards to the anti-cheat related information, the complainant has stated that, that kind of
information usually is highly private since anti-cheat software employs techniques usually only

used by intelligence agencies and hackers to get an exceptional level of access on the com-
puter. The user has no control over that software once it is installed, and that the data is per-

sonal data covered by the GDPR.

The complainant has also stated that the software regularly gets defeated by cheaters and

gets adapted and updated, and therefore Reto Moto will keep updating and adapting the soft-
ware even though, they might reveal some critical information.

Finally, the complainant has stated, that he only wants data about him related to in-game chat

messages.

3. Reasons for the decision of the DPA

3.1. It follows from Article 15 of the GDPR that the data subject has the right to obtain confirm-
ation by the controller of whether personal data relating to him or her are processed and, where

appropriate, access to the personal data and a number of additional data. In addition, it follows
from paragraph 3 that the controller in principle is required to provide a copy of the personal

data processed.

However, a data controller may refuse to comply with an access request from a data subject

if one of the exceptions to the right of access under Article 15(4) of the GDPR or section 22 of
the DDPA can be invoked.

It follows from Article 15 (4), that the right to obtain a copy referred to in paragraph 3 shall not

adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

According to section 22(1) of the DDPA, Article 15 of the GDPR does not apply if the data
subject’s interest in this information is found to be overridden by essential considerations of

private interests, including the consideration for the data subject himself.

The controller must make an assessment of the opposing interests.

                                                                       3
It is clear from the preparatory work of section 22(1) of the DDPA that the private interests
which may, among other things, justify secrecy are decisive considerations of business secrets

or decisive considerations of people involved other than the data subject, e.g. a minor child of
the data subject. Furthermore, it appears that the provision can only be applied where there is

an obvious danger that the interests of individuals will be adversely affected.

3.2. The DPA finds that Reto Moto by not provinding a copy of in-game chat messages sent

directly to and from the complainant has infringed Article 15(3) of the GDPR as there was no
basis for exempting this information.

3L 68 Proposal for a law supplementing the regulation on he protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal
data and on the free movement of such data.                                                                                                  Page4of8
The DPA has emphasised that the complainant already would have knowledge about the con-

tent of these messages.
3.3. However, the DPA finds that other in-game chat messages may be exempt according to
Article 15(4) of the GDPR.

The DPA has attached weight on the fact that chats are conducted in different languages and
in jargon, and therefore it cannot be ruled out that Reto Moto will disclose information about

other people when disclosing the messages.

In addition, the other participants in the game must be assumed to expect a certain degree of

confidentiality regarding messages sent in the heat of the moment.

3.4. Furthermore, the DPA finds that Reto Moto was entitled not to provide a copy of any

personal information in relation to anti-cheat measures, cf. section 22(1) of the Danish Data
Protection Act (DDPA).

The DPA has emphasised the fact that disclosure of the information in question can reveal
how players can cheat the game and the underlying logic, which harms Reto Moto and other

players. In the light of this, the complainant’s interest in obtaining any such information is over-
ridden by Reto Moto’s interest in not disclosing how the company identifies cheating.

3.5. In regards to game replay data and server logs, the DPA finds no reason to disregard the
statement by Reto Moto, that the company has deleted the information before receiving the

access request.

4. Final remarks
A copy of this letter is sent to the complainant for information.

The DPA’s decision may be appealed to the courts, cf. Article 63 of the Danish Constitution.

The DPA thus considers the case closed and does not take any further action.

further copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee
based on administrative costs. Where the data subject makes the request by electronic

means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information shall be
provided in a commonly used electronic form.
