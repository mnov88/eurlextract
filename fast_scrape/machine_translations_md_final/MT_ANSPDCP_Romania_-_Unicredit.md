Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing, completed, in December 2024, an investigation at the operator Unicredit Bank SA and found a violation of the provisions of art. 25 paragraph (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

As such, the operator was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 74,652 lei, the equivalent of 15,000 EURO.

The investigation was initiated following the transmission by the operator of two notifications of violation of personal data security under the GDPR.

The investigation found that, in the first case, the data processing security breach occurred as a result of the operator's application for creating the username malfunctioning without prior testing in a test environment.

This situation led to the unauthorized disclosure of processed personal data of some customers, such as: name, surname, current account information, account transactions, account balance, card transactions, card balance.

In the second case, the data processing security breach occurred as a result of the operator's implementation of a solution for communicating with the bank without conducting adequate prior testing in the test environment, which led to the unauthorized disclosure of personal data (cardholder name, telephone number, transaction date, currency, email address, transaction amount, reason for payment refusal) of a significant number of Unicredit Bank SA customers.

As such, in relation to the criteria for individualizing sanctions provided for in art. 83 of the GDPR, a fine was imposed for the violation of the provisions of art. 25 paragraph (1) of the GDPR, since the operator did not implement, both when establishing the means of processing and during the processing itself, appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to effectively implement the principles of data protection and to integrate the necessary guarantees into the processing.

At the same time, the operator was also ordered to take the corrective measure of technically and organizationally implementing a test plan for all components/applications that are intended to be introduced into the activities that include personal data processing by analyzing all their functionalities in a test environment, which simulates the real scenario in the production environment.

We note that the operator paid the fine imposed.
