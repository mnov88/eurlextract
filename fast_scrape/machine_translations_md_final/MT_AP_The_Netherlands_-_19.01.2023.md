Fine for SVB after faulty identity check
Press release/April 13, 2023
The Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) has imposed a fine of 150,000 euros on the Social Insurance Bank (SVB) for inadequate identity checks by the telephone helpdesk. As a result, clients with a state pension benefit ran the risk that sensitive information would end up with persons who are not entitled to it. The SVB has now taken measures.

In 2019, data from an SVB client came into the hands of someone who should not have received that data. The client discovered that someone had managed to request benefit information via the telephone helpdesk of the SVB. The client then filed a complaint with the AP.

Privacy risks insufficiently weighed
In an average week, the SVB answers up to 20,000 people who have questions about social security laws, including the state pension. In addition, the approximately 1,500 SVB service employees all have access to client data.
In such a situation it is very important that the rules for the provision of information by telephone are clear. However, research by the AP shows that the SVB did too little to map out the privacy risks of telephone services.
In practice, the system for verifying the identity of callers was inadequate. Control questions were often about things that are fairly easy to find out for outsiders (such as someone's first name, address and zip code).
The SVB also insufficiently checked whether service employees actually adhered to the inspection policy. The SVB did not make employees sufficiently aware of the importance of the secure management of personal data. These violations lasted from May 2018 to May 2022.

Very personal information
The SVB pays benefits to more than 5 million people. With so many Dutch people relying on the SVB for benefits, it is very important that the privacy policy is in order,' says AP director Katja Mur.
'Information about benefits is very personal, such information tells a lot about someone's life. Callers must therefore be able to assume that the SVB checks whether they have the right person on the line.'
Immediately after the AP's findings, the SVB improved its telephone services. A new, unambiguous work instruction prescribes exactly how service employees must check the identity of callers. The SVB will evaluate the new policy every two years.

Broader interest
"Agencies with telephone helplines can learn from this," says Mur. â€œPrivacy policy is not only about digital services, but also about telephone services. People do more and more via the internet, of course, but telephone helpdesks are also widely used. So make sure that you also arrange privacy protection for telephone services.
