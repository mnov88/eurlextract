Privacy Policy Instructions

Following the aforementioned on-site visit, the Data Protection Authority considered that the security of the paper data at Vogi ​​was adequate.

II.

Assumptions and conclusion

1.

Scope - Guarantee

Scope of Act no. 90/2018, on privacy and processing of personal information, and Regulation (EU) 2016/679, cf. Paragraph 1 Article 4 of the Act, and thus the authority of the Data Protection Authority, cf. Paragraph 1 Article 39 of the Act, covers the processing of personal data that is partially or fully automated and processing by methods other than automatic processing of personal data that is or should be part of a file.

Personal information includes information about a person or person who is personally identifiable and can be considered as personally identifiable if he or she can be directly or indirectly identified by reference to his or her identity or one or more of the characteristics characteristic of him, cf. Item 2 Article 3 of the Act and Paragraph 1. Article 4 Regulation.

Processing means an action or series of actions in which personal information is processed, whether the processing is automatic or not, cf. Item 4 Article 3 of the Act and Paragraph 2. Article 4 Regulation.

A register also means a structured collection of personal information that is accessible according to certain criteria, whether it is centralized, distributed or divided according to use and location, cf. Item 5 Article 3 of the Act, cf. Item 6 Article 4 Regulation.

This case concerns the processing of personal information by a medical institution. Respectfully, and with due regard to the foregoing provisions, this matter concerns the processing of personal information that falls under the sphere of privacy. However, it should be noted that some of the data listed in Section 2 of Section I above fall outside the scope of the data in the case of manual processing without being or should be part of a file in the above sense. More specifically, here refers to a diary from the work of S.A. from 2015, guestbook from Sogni and meeting books of the Fjalladeild AA at Sogni, but the names of the attendees are not widely registered there and if they are mentioned it is usually only the first names. It should also be noted that photographs among the data may fall outside the scope, ie. if taken by analogy. However, this is only a small part of the data.

The person responsible for processing personal data complies with Act no. 90/2018 is named as the guarantor. According to paragraph 6. Article 3 the Act refers to an individual, legal entity, governmental authority or other party who decides alone or in collaboration with other purposes and methods for the processing of personal information, cf. also point 7. Article 4 Regulation. As used herein, S.A. medical institutions are responsible for the processing in question.

2.

Legality of processing

All processing of personal data must be subject to any of the provisions of Article 9. Act no. 90/2018, cf. Paragraph 1 Article 6 Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may be mentioned that personal data may be processed if it is necessary to fulfill the legal obligation that rests with the responsible party, cf. Point 3 the provision of the Act, cf. point c of the provision. In addition, the processing of sensitive personal data must be compatible with any of the additional requirements of the first paragraph. Article 11 of the Act, cf. Paragraph 2 Article 9 Regulation. According to point 3 (b). Article 3 the law is health information, ie. personal information relating to the physical or mental health of a person, sensitive, cf. also paragraph 1 Article 9 Regulation. As is the case here, especially in point 8. Paragraph 1 Article 11 provided that the processing of sensitive personal data is permissible if it is necessary to prevent disease or occupational disease, to assess the workability of an employee, diagnose illness and provide care or treatment in the field of health or social services, and for which there is a special law; provided that it is performed by an employee of such a service that is bound by confidentiality, cf. also paragraph 1 (h) Article 9 Regulation. In this context it may be mentioned that in accordance with Article 4 Act no. 55/2009 on medical records, a healthcare professional who receives a patient for treatment must keep a medical record, and in addition the law stipulates, among other things, the security of medical records, cf. Article 8 the Act, and access to it, cf. IV. section of the Act.

In addition to the authorization according to the above, the processing of personal data must satisfy all the basic requirements of the first paragraph. Article 8 Act no. 90/2018, cf. Paragraph 1 Article 5 Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It provides, inter alia, for personal data to be processed in a legitimate, fair and transparent manner towards the data subject; that they are derived for clearly stated, legitimate and objective purposes and not further processed for other and incompatible purposes; that they should be preserved in such a way that it is not possible to identify registered persons for longer than is necessary for the purpose of processing; and that they should be processed in such a way as to ensure the proper security of personal information.

According to Art. Act no. 90/2018, cf. Article 24 Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the guarantor shall take appropriate technical and organizational measures that take into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing and the risks to the rights and freedoms of registered persons to ensure and demonstrate that the processing of personal data complies with the regulatory requirements. Appears in Article 24. of the Act, cf. Article 25 Regulation, that these measures should ensure that privacy is built-in and default. The second paragraph of Art. Article 24 of the Regulation, where it is in proportion to the average proportionality of the processing activities, the measures shall include, inter alia, the guarantor's implementation of appropriate privacy policies. Regarding the measures that need to be taken for the processing of personal data, it must be considered that they must, among other things, ensure that it is of course possible that personal data will not be made available to unauthorized parties and thus an unlimited number of people, cf. Paragraph 2 Article 25 Regulation.

The above rules of Act no. 90/2018 and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are highlighted in the first paragraph. Article 27 the Act, which states that the controller and processor must take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the adequate security of personal information, taking into account the latest technology, cost, implementation, nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing and the risks, misconduct and misconduct, the freedom of individuals in accordance with further instructions of Art. of the Regulation, but that article will be considered its main provisions on information security. Says in the second paragraph. the article states that when assessing whether the appropriate security is present, particular attention should be paid to the risks involved in the processing, including with regard to how personal information is transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, the risk of being lost, changed , will be published or granted access to them unauthorized.

From the evidence of the case it is clear that information on the medical history of patients at S.Á.Á. were made available to the former employee of the association, who received data from S.Á.Á. after he left there. The fact that he himself was involved in unwrapping them cannot justify the lack of technical and organizational measures that would have prevented such delivery and had to be present at S.A.A., as the responsible for the processing , because of the processing of such sensitive personal information in question.

In light of the cases and the requirements laid down in Act no. 90/2018 and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 make it safer for the processing of sensitive personal information, it is the Privacy Statement that S.Á.Á. has not sufficiently ensured that sensitive personal information on alcohol and drug abuse treatment by thousands of individuals would not be available to unauthorized persons. Although significant work has been done to bring security issues to an acceptable level, the appropriate security of the information in question was therefore not guaranteed as required by paragraph 6. Paragraph 1 Articles 8, 23, 24 and 27 Act no. 90/2018, cf. paragraph 1 (f) Articles 5, 24, 25 and 32 Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Therefore, the conclusion of the Data Protection Authority is that the processing of S.Á.Á. the personal data of patients has violated the above provisions of the Act and the Regulation.

3.

The point of view of the application of penalties

Given the above, it is therefore considered whether S.A. administrative fines for this, cf. Article 46 Act no. 90/2018, cf. Article 83 Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In deciding this and the amount of the fine, paragraph 1 shall be considered. Article 47 Act no. 90/2018, cf. Paragraph 2 Article 83 Regulation. These include items which may either be of interest to the beneficiary or to his detriment. The following issues are considered in this case:

a. Nature, scope and purpose of processing

According to point 1. Paragraph 1 Article 47 Act no. 90/2018 ,cf. paragraph 2 (a) Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, should consider the nature, severity and duration of violations, with regard to the nature, scope and purpose of processing, as well as the number of registered individuals who suffered and the serious damage they suffered. It is clear that this was the processing of sensitive personal data, over a long period, that affected over 3,000 patients at S.A., but also provided information about their relatives. Were here, among other things, medical records, including on m. patient check-in books, but also much more detailed data, such as therapists' notes from interviews with patients, which include items related to health and criminal behavior. In particular, there are so-called treatment sheets, as well as supporting documents, which protected 252 individuals.In addition, detailed information was provided about several other individuals, such as email communications about them and documents with descriptions of them.

The purpose of the process is to provide people with alcohol and drug problems with health care. It must therefore make extremely stringent requirements for safety. It is clear that adequate measures were not taken to ensure that medical records were not released when a former employee of S.A. were provided with data containing sensitive personal information and stored by the organization.

b. A subjective attitude

According to paragraph 2. Paragraph 1 Article 47 Act no. 90/2018, cf. paragraph 2 (b) Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, should consider whether a violation was committed intentionally or negligently. There is nothing other than the fact that human error has occurred here and nothing has been stated in the case which indicates that this is a deliberate violation.

c. Measures to reduce the loss of registered persons

According to paragraph 3. Paragraph 1 Article 47 Act no. 90/2018, cf. paragraph 2 (c) Article 83 Regulation (EU) 2016/679, should take into account the measures taken to reduce the loss of registered persons. In this context, it is important to S.A. immediately contacted the said former employee of the organization when informed of the security breach, and requested that the data be returned. The security breach was also reported to the Data Protection Authority.

d. Responsibility of the guarantor or processor with regard to technical and organizational measures

According to paragraph 4. Paragraph 1 Article 47 Act no. 90/2018, cf. paragraph 2 (d) Article 83 Regulation (EU) 2016/679, should take into account the level of responsibility of the guarantor or processor with regard to the technical and organizational measures they have implemented. This is explained in more detail in Article 32. of the Regulation, in the light of the latest technologies, costs of operation and nature, scope, coherence and purpose of processing and risks, improper and irreversible, for the rights and freedoms of individuals, the guarantor shall take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure appropriate safeguards. at risk. Therefore, in the light of the process in question, there should have been organizational measures which would have prevented the transmission of the data concerned and thus a security breach.It is clear that despite a lot of work that had been done on security issues at S.Á.Á. no such measures were in place at the time of delivery. However, it should be noted that on July 9, 2019, ie. shortly before S.Á.Á. became aware of the security breach, the organization had established working rules on the treatment of workers on work documents. Appears in the second paragraph. Article 4 the rule that an employee should be given the opportunity to review work space and compile their private documents and other belongings before leaving his place of business. Also states, among other things, that he is totally not allowed to bring work documents with him, in addition to that mentioned in the third paragraph. The article states that a supervisor may be present when an employee completes his or her private documents upon retirement, as he respects the employee's privacy rights.no such measures were in place at the time of delivery.
