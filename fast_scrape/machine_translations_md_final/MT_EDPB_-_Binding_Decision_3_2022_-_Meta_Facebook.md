Adopted 112
legitimate interests explicitly states that “the fact that some data processing is covered by a contract
does not automatically mean that the processing is necessary for its performance. For example,
Article 7(b) is not a suitable legal ground for building a profile of the user’s tastes and lifestyle choices
based on his click-stream on a website and the items purchased. This is because the data controller
has not been contracted to carry out profiling, but rather to deliver particular goods and services, for
example. Even if these processing activities are specifically mentioned in the small print of the contract,
this fact alone does not make them ‘necessary’ for the performance of the contract”892.
453. It stems from the above that Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the infringement of
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. However, this mere element is not sufficient to consider an infringement
intentional, as stated above, since the “aim” or “wilfulness” of the action should be demonstrated.
454. The EDPB recalls that that having knowledge of a specific matter does not necessarily imply having the
“will” to reach a specific outcome. This is in fact the approach adopted in the EDPB Guidelines on
calculation of fines and WP29 Guidelines on Administrative Fines, where the knowledge and the
“wilfulness” are considered two distinctive elements of the intentionality893. While it may prove
difficult to demonstrate a subjective element such as the “will” to act in a certain manner, there need
to be some objective elements that indicate the existence of such intentionality894.
455. The EDPB recalls that the CJEU has established a high threshold in order to consider an act intentional.
In fact, even in criminal proceedings the CJEU has acknowledged the existence of “serious negligence”,
rather than ‘intentionality’ when “the person responsible commits a patent breach of the duty of care
which he should have and could have complied with in view of his attributes, knowledge, abilities and
individual situation”895. In this regard, the EDPB confirms that a company for whom the processing of
personal data is at the core of its business activities is expected to have sufficient measures in place
for the safeguard of personal data896: this does not, however, per se change the nature of the
infringement from negligent to intentional.
456. In this regard, the SE SA puts forward that Meta IE based its processing of personalised advertisement
on consent until the GDPR came into force on 25 May 2018, and at this time switched to relying on
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR for the processing in question instead. The timing and the logistics for this switch
suggests this act was done with the intention of circumventing the new rights of users under
Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. The SE SA adds that “\[the\] proposed finding of infringement concerning
information deficits about the processing, namely on what legal basis it is based, further supports this
conclusion, since it goes to show that Facebook was aware of the questionable legality of that basis
and tried to conceal the infringement to avoid scrutiny by supervisory authorities and data subjects”897.
457. The EDPB considers the timing of the changes made by Meta IE to its Facebook Terms of Service as an
objective element; however, this alone does not indicate intention. Around this time period, many
controllers updated their data protection policies. The objection suggests that the conclusion on
intentionality is corroborated by the shortcomings to the transparency obligations: in the EDPB’s view,

897 SE SA Objection, p. 4.
Adopted 113
the combination of the timing of the change of legal basis with the lack of transparency is not sufficient
to indicate intention either.
458. Therefore, on the basis of the available information, the EDPB is not able to identify a will of Meta IE
to act in breach of the law, as it cannot be concluded that Meta IE intentionally acted to circumvent
its legal obligations.
459. Therefore, the EDPB considers that the arguments put forward by the SE SAs do not meet the
threshold to demonstrate the intentionality of the behaviour of Meta IE. Accordingly, the EDPB is of
the view that the Draft Decision does not need to include this element.
460. At the same time, the EDPB notes that, even establishing that the infringement was committed
negligently, a company for whom the processing of personal data is at the core of its business activities
should have in place sufficient procedures for ensuring compliance with the GDPR898.
461. The EDPB does not accept Meta IE’s claim of “good faith”, but is of the view that Meta IE was certainly
seriously negligent in not taking adequate action, within a reasonable time period, following the
adoption of Guidelines 2/2019 on 9 April 2019. Even before that date, the EDPB considers there was
at the very least negligence on Meta IE’s part considering the contents of WP29 Opinion 02/2010 on
online behavioural advertising and WP29 Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interests (see
paragraphs 452 - 453 above), which mean Meta IE had (or should have had) knowledge about the
infringement of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, the fact that processing of personal data is at the core of its
business practices, and the resources available to Meta IE to adapt its practices so as to comply with
data protection legislation.
The degree of responsibility of the controller taking into account technical and organisational
measures implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32(Article 83(2)(d) GDPR)
462. The EDPB considers the degree of responsibility of Meta IE’s part to be of a high level, on the same
grounds as set in the Draft Decision with regard to the transparency infringements899.
The manner in which the infringement became known (Article 83(2)(h) GDPR)
463. The DE SAs identify an aggravating factor in the fact that the “infringement became known by a
complaint of a data subject, not by chance or report by the controller itself”900.
464. The EDPB considers that, as a rule, the circumstance that the infringement became known to the LSA
by way of a complaint should be considered neutral901. The DE SAs do not put forward reasons that
would justify a departure from the rule in the present case.
465. Therefore, the EDPB is of the view that the Draft Decision does not need to include this element as an
aggravating or mitigating factor.
898 See Binding Decision 01/2020, paragraph 195.
899 Draft Decision, paragraphs 9.32 - 9.33.
900 DE SAs Objection, p. 19.
901 EDPB Guidelines on calculation of fines, paragraph 99. The EDPB Guidelines on Administrative Fines (p. 15)
do not identify this element as being, as a rule, an aggravating element.
Adopted 114
The financial benefit obtained from the infringement (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)
466. The DE SAs and SE SA argue Meta IE gained financial benefits from their decision to rely on contract
as legal basis for behavioural advertising, rather than obtaining consent from the users of Facebook902.
The DE SAs engaged in a detailed calculation to justify their estimation of the benefit, although
acknowledging it was based on assumptions903. While not providing an estimate of its size, the SE SA
considers the existence of financial benefit sufficiently proven on the basis of “the self-evident fact
that Facebook has made significant financial gain from being able to provide personal advertisement
as part of a whole take it or leave it offer for its social media platform service, as opposed to
establishing a separate legal basis for it. By also being unclear in the information to data subjects, it is
a reasonable assumption that more data subjects have been misled into being subject to the
processing, thus increasing the financial benefits gained by Facebook pursuant to personal
advertisement”904.
467. The EDPB recalls that financial benefits from the infringement could be an aggravating circumstance
if the case provides information about profit obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR905.
468. In the present case, the EDPB considers that it does not have sufficiently precise information to
evaluate the specific weight of the financial benefit obtained from the infringement.
469. Nonetheless, the EDPB acknowledges the need to prevent that the fines have little to no effect if they
are disproportionally low compared to the benefits obtained with the infringement. The EDPB
considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the financial benefit from the infringement
is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of the fine proposed,
the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.
The profitability of the undertaking - other factor (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)
470. For the reasons stated above (paragraphs 378 - 381), the EDPB is of the view that the Draft Decision
does not need to include this element as aggravating or mitigating factor as put forward by the DE
SAs906.
Competitive advantage - other factor (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR)
471. The NO SA identifies an aggravating factor in that “that the unlawful processing of personal data in all
likelihood has contributed to the development of algorithms which may be harmful on an individual
or societal level, and which may have considerable commercial value to FIL. The algorithms may have
contributed to giving FIL a competitive advantage vis-à-vis its competitors”907.
472. On principle, the EDPB agrees that a competitive advantage could be an aggravating factor if the case
provides objective information that this was obtained as a result of the infringement of the GDPR908.
In the present case, the EDPB considers that it does not have sufficiently precise information to
evaluate the existence of a competitive advantage resulting from the infringement. The EDPB
considers that the IE SA should ascertain if an estimation of the competitive advantage derived from

the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as this results in the need to increase the amount of
the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.
\*\*\*
473. Taking into account the nature and gravity of the infringement as well as other aspects in accordance
with Article 83(2) GDPR, the EDPB considers that the IE SA must exercise its power to impose an
additional administrative fine. Also, covering this additional infringement with a fine would be in line
with the IE SA’s (proposed) decision to impose administrative fines in this case for the transparency
infringements relating to processing carried out in reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR909. The EDPB
underlines that, in order to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, a fine should reflect the
circumstances of the case. Such circumstances not only refer to the specific elements of the
infringement, but also those of the controller or processor who committed the infringement, namely
its financial position.
9.2.4.2.2 Assessment of whether an administrative fine should be imposed for the infringement of
the fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR
474. The EDPB recalls its conclusion in this Binding Decision on the infringement by Meta IE of the fairness
principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR910 and that the objection raised by the IT SA, which was found to
be relevant and reasoned, requested the IE SA to exercise its power to impose an administrative
fine911.
475. The EDPB takes note of Meta IE’s view that the IT SA objection is not relevant and reasoned912 and
also notes that Meta IE does not provide further arguments on the content of the IT SA objection in
this regard913.
476. The EDPB recalls that the decision to impose an administrative fine needs to be taken on a case-by-
case basis in light of the circumstances and is not an automatic one914. In the same vein, the EDPB’s
assessment of Meta IE’s compliance with the principle of fairness is carried out by taking into account
the specificities of the case, of the particular social networking service at hand and of the processing
of personal data carried out, namely for the purpose of online behavioural advertising915.
477. As previously established, the principle of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, although intrinsically
linked to the principles of lawfulness and transparency under the same provision, has an independent
meaning916. It underpins the whole data protection framework and plays a key role for securing a
balance of power in the controller-data subject relationship917.
478. Considering the EDPB’s findings in Section 6 that Meta IE has not complied with key requirements of
the principle of fairness as defined by the EDPB, namely allowing for autonomy of the data subjects as
to the processing of their personal data, fulfilling data subjects’ reasonable expectation, ensuring
power balance, avoiding deception and ensuring ethical and truthful processing918, as well as the
909 Draft Decision, paragraphs 9.45 - 9.51.

overall effect of the infringement by Meta IE of the transparency obligations and of Article 6(1) GDPR,
the EDPB reiterates its view that Meta IE has infringed the principle of fairness under
Article 5(1)(a) GDPR and agrees with the IT SA that this infringement should be adequately taken into
account by the IE SA in the calculation of the amount of the administrative fine to be imposed
following the conclusion of this inquiry.
479. Therefore, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to take into account the infringement by Meta IE of the fairness
principle enshrined in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR as established above when, re-assessing the administrative
fines for the transparency infringements and the determination of the fine for the lack of legal basis.
If, however, the IE SA considers an additional fine for the breach of the principle of fairness is an
appropriate corrective measure, the EDPB requests the IE SA to include this in its final decision. In any
case, the IE SA must take into account the criteria provided for by Article 83(2) GDPR and ensuring it
is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in line with Article 83(1) GDPR.
Adopted 117
10 BINDING DECISION
480. In light of the above, and in accordance with the task of the EDPB under Article 70(1)(t) GDPR to issue
binding decisions pursuant to Article 65 GDPR, the EDPB issues the following Binding Decision in
accordance with Article 65(1)(a) GDPR.
481. The EDPB addresses this Binding Decision to the LSA in this case (the IE SA) and to all the CSAs, in
accordance with Article 65(2) GDPR.
On the objections concerning whether the LSA should have found an infringement for lack of
appropriate legal basis/unlawful data processing
482. The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT, DE, FR, IT, NL, NO, PL, PT and SE SAs regarding Meta
IE’s reliance on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of the Facebook Terms of Service
meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.
483. On the parts of the DE SAs objection requesting the finding of an infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR,
and the parts of the DE, IT and NO SAs objections requesting specific corrective measures under
Article 58 GDPR for the infringement of Article 6(1) or 6(1)(b) GDPR, namely the imposition of an
administrative fine, a ban of the processing of personal data for the purpose of behavioural
advertising, an order to delete personal data processed under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, and an order to
identify a valid legal basis for future behavioural advertising or to abstain from such processing
activities, the EDPB decides that these parts of their objections do not meet the threshold of
Article 4(24) GDPR.
484. The EDPB instructs the IE SA to alter its Finding 2 of its Draft Decision, which concludes that Meta IE
may rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the context of its offering of the Facebook Terms of Service, and
to include an infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR, on the basis of the conclusion reached by the EDPB in
this Binding Decision.
On the objections concerning whether the LSA’s Draft Decision includes sufficient analysis and evidence
to conclude that Meta IE is not obliged to rely on consent to process the Complainant’s personal data
485. The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT, DE, FR, NL, and PT SAs regarding the LSA’s Finding 1
that Meta IE is not legally obliged to rely on consent to process personal data to deliver the Facebook
Terms of Service meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.
486. On the part of the NL SA objection asking the IE SA to include in its Draft Decision the elements
concerning the need to rely on consent for the placing of tracking technology on end users devices
under ePrivacy legislation, the EDPB decides that this part falls outside the scope of the EDPB’s
mandate.
487. The EDPB instructs the IE SA to remove from its Draft Decision its conclusion on Finding 1. The EDPB
decides that the IE SA shall carry out a new investigation into Meta IE’s processing operations in its
Facebook service to determine if it processes special categories of personal data (Article 9 GDPR), and
complies with the relevant obligations under the GDPR, to the extent that this new investigation
complements the findings made in the IE SA’s Final Decision adopted on the basis of this Binding
Decision, and based on the results of this investigation, issue a new draft decision in accordance with
Article 60(3) GDPR.
Adopted 118
On the objection concerning the potential additional infringement of the principle of fairness
488. The EDPB decides that the objection of the IT SA regarding the infringement by Meta IE of the principle
of fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.
489. The EDPB instructs the IE SA to find in its final decision an additional infringement of the principle of
fairness under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR by Meta IE.
On the objection concerning the potential additional infringement of the principles of purpose
limitation and data minimisation
490. On the objection by the IT SA concerning the possible additional infringements of the principles of
purpose limitation and data minimisation under Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR, the EDPB decides this
objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.
On the objections concerning corrective measures other than administrative fines
491. The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT and NL SAs requesting additional and/or alternative
specific corrective measures to be imposed meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.
492. On the objection by the PL SA concerning the order to bring processing into compliance with the GDPR,
the EDPB decides that this objection does not meet the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.
493. The EDPB instructs the IE SA to include in its final decision an order for Meta IE to bring its processing
of personal data for behavioural advertising purposes in the context of the Facebook service into
compliance with Article 6(1) GDPR within three months.
494. The EDPB also instructs the LSA to adjust its order to Meta IE to bring its Facebook Data Policy and
Terms of Service into compliance with Articles 5(1)(a), 12(1) and 13(1)(c) GDPR within three months,
to refer not only to information provided on data processed pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, but also
to data processed for the purposes of behavioural advertising in the context of Facebook service (to
reflect the finding of the EDPB that for this processing the controller cannot rely on
Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).
On the objections concerning the determination of the administrative fine for the transparency
infringements
495. The EDPB decides that the objections of the DE, FR, NL, NO and PL SAs regarding the determination of
the administrative fine for the transparency infringements, meet the requirements of
Article 4(24) GDPR.
496. Regarding the turnover of the undertaking, the EDPB instructs the IE SA to take into consideration the
total turnover of all the entities composing the single undertaking (i.e. consolidated turnover of the
group headed by Meta Platforms, Inc.) for the financial year preceding the date of the final decision.
497. On the number of data subjects affected (Article 83(2)(a) GDPR), the EDPB finds that the IE SA is not
required to amend its Draft Decision in this regard.
498. Concerning any action taken by the controller to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects
(Article 83(2)(c) GDPR), the EDPB finds the IE SA does not provide sufficient justification for the
mitigating factor identified, and instructs the IE SA to modify its Draft Decision on this matter by
considering this criterion as neither aggravating nor mitigating.
Adopted 119
499. Regarding the financial benefit gained from the infringements (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR), the EDPB
instructs the IE SA to ascertain if further estimation of the financial benefit from the infringement of
transparency obligations is possible in this case. Insofar as further estimation of the financial benefit
from the infringement is possible in this case and results in the need to increase the amount of the
fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.
500. Concerning the relevance of the profit of the undertaking (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR), the EDPB finds that
in the present case the IE SA does not have to amend its Draft Decision to additionally consider the
annual profit of the undertaking pursuant to Article 83 GDPR.
501. The EDPB instructs the IE SA to modify its Draft Decision to elaborate on the manner in which the
turnover of the undertaking concerned has been taken into account for the calculation of the fine, as
appropriate, to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with
Article 83(1) GDPR.
502. The EDPB considers that the proposed fine does not adequately reflect the seriousness and severity
of the infringements nor has a dissuasive effect on Meta IE. Therefore, the fine does not fulfil the
requirement of being effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with Article 83(1) and
(2) GDPR. In light of this, the EDPB directs the IE SA to set out a significantly higher fine amount for
the transparency infringements identified, in comparison with the upper limit for the administrative
fine envisaged in the Draft Decision. In doing so, the IE SA must remain in line with the criteria of
effectiveness, proportionality, and dissuasiveness enshrined in Article 83(1) GDPR in its overall
reassessment of the amount of the administrative fine.
On the objections concerning the imposition of an administrative fine for the lack of legal basis
503. The EDPB decides that the objections of the AT, DE, FR, NO, and SE SAs regarding the imposition of an
administrative fine for the infringement of Article 6(1) or Article 6(1)(b) GDPR meet the requirements
of Article 4(24) GDPR.
504. The EDPB decides that the relevant parts of the objections of the IT and PL SAs specifically relating to
an administrative fine for the lack of legal basis do not meet the threshold of Article 4(24) GDPR.
505. In relation to intentionality under Article 83(2)(b) GDPR, the EDPB considers that the arguments put
forward by the SE SA in their objection do not contain sufficient objective elements to demonstrate
the intentionality of the behaviour of Meta IE.
506. Concerning the manner in which the infringement became known (Article 83(2)(h) GDPR), the EDPB
decides the IE SA has no cause to amend the Draft Decision.
507. Regarding the possible financial benefit obtained from the infringement as well as the competitive
advantage (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR), the EDPB instructs the IE SA to ascertain if an estimation of the
financial benefit from the infringement is possible in this case. Insofar as further estimation of the
financial benefit from the infringement is possible in this case and results in the need to increase the
amount of the fine proposed, the EDPB requests the IE SA to increase the amount of the fine proposed.
508. Concerning the relevance of profit of the undertaking (Article 83(2)(k) GDPR), the EDPB finds that in
the present case the IE SA does not have to amend its Draft Decision to additionally consider the
annual profit of the undertaking pursuant to Article 83 GDPR.
509. The EDPB instructs the IE SA to cover the additional infringement of Article 6(1) GDPR with an
administrative fine that is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with
Adopted 120
Article 83(1) GDPR. In determining the fine amount, the IE SA must give due regard to all the applicable
factors listed in Article 83(2) GDPR, in particular the nature and gravity of the infringement, the
number of data subjects affected and the seriously negligent character of the infringement.
On the objection concerning the imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of the
fairness principle under Article 5(1)(a) GDPR
510. The EDPB decides that the objection of the IT SA regarding the imposition of an administrative fine for
the infringement of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR meets the requirements of Article 4(24) GDPR.
511. The EDPB instructs the IE SA to factor the additional infringement of the principle of fairness enshrined
in Article 5(1)(a) GDPR into its adoption of appropriate corrective measures. In this respect, the IE SA
is instructed to take due account of this infringement when re-assessing the administrative fines for
the transparency infringements and the determination of the fine for the lack of legal basis. If,
however, the IE SA considers an additional fine for the breach of the principle of fairness is an
appropriate corrective measure, the EDPB requests the IE SA to include this in its final decision. In any
case, the IE SA must take into account the criteria provided for by Article 83(2) GDPR and ensuring it
is effective, proportionate and dissuasive in line with Article 83(1) GDPR.
On the objection concerning the imposition of an administrative fine for the infringement of
Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR
512. The EDPB decides that it does not need to examine the objection of the IT SA regarding the imposition
of an administrative fine for the infringement of Article 5(1)(b) and (c) GDPR.
11 FINAL REMARKS
