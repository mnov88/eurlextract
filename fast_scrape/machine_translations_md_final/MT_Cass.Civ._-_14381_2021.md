Legislative Decree no. 186 of 2003 and 7.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of

     II.- The first four reasons, to be examined jointly, u
are well founded.
     It must be said that contrary to what is maintained by the PG n

the ric o rs o, n e l refer to d e c is iv ity d e l p ro thread in e s s i
mentioned, does not lack self-sufficiency, since on p. 6 is
                                                                          c
duly reported the corresponding section of the deduction a -
his time made by the Guarantor in response to the adverse appeal. is
      On the other hand, it also emerges from the sentence (page 8) that it was
                                                                          the
the question of the impossibility of being raised by the G arante

                                                                          to

      III.- Now the R om a tribunal has deemed the d

between tta m e n to d e i d a ti p e rs o n a li d e g li a d e re n ti a l sris te m a
M evalaute because validated by consent, and therefore why
expression of private autonomy. C.

      He then supported the claim by adding that "the
current reality, national and supranational, is widely known

a phenomenon of evaluation and certification by private individuals,

intercept a defect in the lawfulness of the system.
     IV. - Except that this C orte has already had a way of
consider that, for the purposes of the lawfulness of the treatment based on

consent, art. 23 of Legislative Decree no. 196 of 2003 (so-called privacy code)
presupposes not only consent, but also that consent is
validly loaned (see Cass. n. 17278-18, Cass. n. 16358-18).
                                                                      L
     Specifically, art. 23 provides that (a) the treatment of i
personal data from private individuals or public economic bodies is i
admitted only with the express consent of the interested party; (b) the u

consent may concern the entire treatment or one or more n
operations of the same; (c) the consent is validly given
only if it is expressed freely and specifically in reference to i
                                                                      p
a "clearly identified" treatment, if it is documented for c
registered, and if the information referred to has been provided to the interested party -
                                                                      is
to art. 13; (d) consent is given in writing when
the processing concerns sensitive data. the
     V I. - Sim ile framework of rules and principles the expression
                                                                      s
"clearly identified" - which distinguishes the treatment a
of personal data - assumes that consent must be C.
previously informed in relation to a well-defined treatment d

in its essential elements, so as to be able to say that it is r
s ta to e s p re s s o, in q u e lla p ro s p e ttiv a, lib e ra m e n te e
specifically. C.

     In this regard, it is the responsibility of the data controller to provide the
proof that the contested access and processing are traceable
the purposes for which it was validly requested - e

validly obtained - suitable consent.

                             6 V II. - N e l c a s o d i s p e c ie the tra tta m e n to e ra (e d √®)

functional to the determination of the reputational profile of
subjects.

     The assessment of the lawfulness of such treatment, based on the
consent, could not be proposed by the court without one
after consideration of the elements likely to affect the

seriousness of the manifestation, and among these also and precisely the
elem ents implied and considered in the algorithm or afferent, the
                                                                         L

specific purpose was not very true disavowed by the contested u
sentence, which simply considered the doubts not decisive
relating to the automated calculation system for the definition of no

reputational rating, on the finding that the validity of formula i
it would concern "the m oment of evaluating the procedure", a
                                                                         c

     This motivation cannot be shared

confinable to the perishing of the "market" response - summary C
metaphoric to indicate the place and time in which they come d

commercial exchanges carried out at various levels - with respect to r
preparation of the ratings assigned to the various operators. or
     The problem a, for the lawfulness of the treatment, was instead (and C

is) constituted by the validity - precisely - of the consent that yes

logically state that joining a platform aside
of the associates also includes the acceptance of a system a

considered for this purpose.

     VIII. - The sentence must therefore be quashed, with absorption of the
remaining grounds for appeal.
     The case must be referred back to the m edesim or tribunal of

Rome, in different composition, for new examination.
     The court will comply with the following principle of law: in
subject of personal data processing, consent is valid
lent only if freely expressed and specifically in l
                                                                     the
reference to a clearly identified processing; it follows f
that in the case of a w and b platform (with attached archive u
IT) preordained for the elaboration of reputational profiles

of individual natural or legal persons, centered on a system no
calculation based on an algorithm or aimed at establishing i
reliability scores, the awareness requirement can not

the elements of which it is composed remain unknown or unknowable by and
