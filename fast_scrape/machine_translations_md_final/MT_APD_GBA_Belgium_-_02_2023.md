The defendant: Y, hereinafter “the defendant”. Decision 02/2023 - 2/5

I. Factual Procedure

    1. On January 3, 2023, the complainant filed a complaint with the Data Protection Authority against the

        defendant.

    2. On 1 December 2022, the complainant addressed the defendant with a request for the

        delete the relevant personal data pursuant to Article 17.1 GDPR, in accordance with the

        privacy policy of the defendant. The complainant has sent a reminder to the defendant
        December 19, 2022. As of January 3, 2023, the complainant has not yet received a response from the defendant

        in connection with the data erasure request. Received on December 28, 2022

        however, the complainant still receives an email with promotions from the defendant. Following this, the

        complainant lodged a complaint with the Data Protection Authority.

    3. On January 9, 2023, the complaint will be declared admissible by the First Line Service on the basis of the

        Articles 58 and 60 WOG and the complaint pursuant to Article 62, §1 WOG is transferred to the

        Litigation room.

II. Motivation

    4. The Disputes Chamber determines on the basis of the documents that substantiate the complaint that the complainant is entitled

        to data erasure in accordance with Article 17.1 GDPR has exercised on December 1, 2022, and a
        sent a reminder on December 19, 2022. From the documents accompanying the complaint, the

        Litigation Chamber that the complainant has carried out his request for data erasure by sending

        of an e-mail to the designated e-mail address of the defendant. Pursuant to Article 12.3 GDPR

        the controller, in this case the defendant, must respond to the request

        to respond to data erasure within one month of receipt of the request. Possibly possible

        this period may be extended by a further two months, given the complexity of the
        request. The complainant must then inform about this within one month of the request for data erasure

        extension will be notified. If the defendant decides not to comply with the

        request of the complainant, it must communicate this within one month of receipt of the request

        to the data subject, in accordance with Article 12.4 GDPR. It does not appear from the file that the complainant has any

        received an answer about the consequence of the data erasure by the defendant
        is given. In addition, it appears from the documents that were added to the complaint that the complainant

        received another email with promotions from the defendant on 28th December 2022. because of this

        the controller has acted in violation of Articles 12.3 and 12.4 GDPR, as well

        Article 17.1 GDPR.

    5. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that on the basis of the above analysis it should be

        concluded that a breach of the provisions of the GDPR has been committed by the defendant,

        which justifies that in this case a decision is taken on the basis of Decision 02/2023 - 3/5

        of Article 95, §1, 5° WOG, more specifically to order the defendant to comply with the

        exercise by the complainant of his right to erasure (article 17.1 GDPR).

        the 'procedure prior to the decision on the merits' and no decision on the merits of the

        Disputes Chamber within the meaning of Article 100 WOG. The Disputes Chamber has thus decided on the basis

        of Articles 58.2. c) and 95, §1, 5° of the Law of 3 December 2017, to order the defendant

        decision and is of the opinion that it can assert factual and/or legal arguments that lead to
