Notice of decision in the Google Analytics case

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority's preliminary conclusion is that the use of Google Analytics is not in line with the Personal Data Protection Regulation. The parties in the cases are given the opportunity to comment on the case before we make a formal decision.

The organization noyb has lodged a complaint against a number of European websites to the data supervisory authorities in the EEA. The background is that noyb believes the websites transfer personal data out of the EEA in violation of the Personal Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by using the American analysis tool Google Analytics.

One of the complained websites, telenor.com, is Norwegian and previously used Google Analytics. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has therefore investigated this matter. Our preliminary conclusion is that the use of Google Analytics was in breach of the GDPR's transfer rules. We have now sent an advance notice to the parties in the case, so that they have the opportunity to comment on the findings before we make a decision.

European coordination

Since there have been so many complaints about the use of Google Analytics at the European level, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has set up a separate working group to coordinate the handling of complaints. The data supervisory authorities have a duty to interpret the GDPR in the same way throughout the EEA.

- The EDPB does a good job in ensuring that the supervisory authorities apply the law in a harmonized way. When it comes to the use of Google Analytics, a clear European consensus has emerged, says section manager Tobias Judin in the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.

The data supervisory authorities in Austria, France and Italy, as well as the data supervisory authority for the EU bodies (EDPS), have already decided that the use of Google Analytics is in breach of the privacy rules. Moreover, the Danish Data Protection Authority draws the same conclusion in a guide on the topic, and the data supervisory authority in Liechtenstein has also commented critically on the tool.

Further process

The next step in the case is that the parties are given three weeks to comment on our preliminary conclusions. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority must then decide on any input we receive.

This case is so-called cross-border. This means that before we can make a decision, we must send a draft decision to other affected data supervisory authorities in the EEA. They then have the right to raise objections within one month if they disagree with our assessments.

It is only after this that the Norwegian Data Protection Authority will make a decision on the matter.

What about Google Analytics now?

If the Norwegian Data Protection Authority makes a decision that the website's use of Google Analytics was in breach of the GDPR, this could also have consequences for other Norwegian websites. Therefore, we reiterate our recommendation to explore alternatives to Google Analytics. We will provide more detailed information about what applies and what our expectations are for Norwegian websites when a decision has been made. This may not come until the end of April at the earliest.

Google Analytics 3 or 4?

At the time of the complaint, the website in question was using Google Analytics 3, and we have therefore taken this as a starting point for the assessment. We have received several questions about whether, hypothetically speaking, we would move towards a different conclusion with Google Analytics 4. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has not taken a position on this in the specific case, but as far as we can see, Google Analytics 4 will not necessarily correct those problems we have so far identified. In this context, it may be useful to refer to the Danish Data Protection Authority's guidance, which states exactly this (datatilsynet.dk).
