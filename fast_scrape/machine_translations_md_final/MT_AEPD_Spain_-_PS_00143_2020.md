control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve
this procedure.
II
Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the assumptions that allow considering
lawful processing of personal data.
For its part, article 5 of the RGPD establishes that personal data will be:
"A) treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party
("Lawfulness, fairness and transparency");
b) collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be processed
subsequently in a manner incompatible with said purposes; in accordance with article 89,
section 1, the further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in
public interest, scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes are not
deemed incompatible with the original purposes ("purpose limitation");

c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes
for those who are processed ("data minimization");
d) accurate and, if necessary, updated; all measures will be taken
reasonable so that the personal data that
are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are processed ("accuracy");
e) maintained in a way that allows the identification of the interested parties
for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of data processing
personal; personal data may be kept for longer periods
provided that they are treated exclusively for archival purposes in the public interest,
scientific or historical research or statistical purposes, in accordance with article

freedoms of the interested party ("limitation of the conservation period");

III
In the present case, it has been verified that in the convocation of the
Ordinary General Meeting to be held on March 21, 2019 of the COMMUNITY OF
OWNERS RRR, located on a notice board, consists, within the
section of the debt, the name and surname of the claimant together with the amount of
€ 286.81.
The claimed neighborhood community states that since 2014 the
distribution of the call is made by mailing to the owners
residents in the property, sending by ordinary mail to non-resident owners
in Calanda 19, by email to all the owners who so requested and
by placing it on the bulletin board surface for three days.
In addition, notifications that require it are sent through burofax
with delivery notification and content certificate. However, the claimant
He usually claims that he does not receive the notifications that the rest of the neighbors do
receive with ordinary character.
The defendant justifies his action by noting that as the call for the
Meeting of the Ordinary General Meeting of March 21, 2019 was held between
March 12 and 13, 2019, and the maximum period to collect a burofax is 30 days and
this owner always usually runs out of time, the probability that it was not
notified in time said call, was very high.

This argument is not in accordance with the law, since, if the
claimed decides to notify by burofax, the denounced facts would be solved,
simply issuing said communication with enough time for the
claimant receives it.
Also note that as a means of personal and individualized notification to the
owner, the Horizontal Property Law, indicates the assumptions in which the
exposure of personal data related to matters derived from the
management of the Community of Owners. Its article 9. h) indicates as an obligation of the
owner “Communicate to whoever exercises the functions of secretary of the community,
any means that allows proof of receipt, the address in Spain
for the purposes of citations and notifications of all kinds related to the community.
In the absence of this communication, the address will be for citations and
notifications of the apartment or premises belonging to the community, having full effect
those delivered to the occupant thereof. If you attempted a subpoena or notification
it was impossible for the owner to practice it in the place provided in the previous paragraph,
It will be understood as carried out by placing the corresponding communication in
the community bulletin board, or in a visible place of general use enabled by
effect, with expressive diligence of the date and reasons why this
notification form, signed by whoever exercises the functions of Secretary of the
community, with the approval of the President. The notification practiced in this way
it will produce full legal effects within a period of three calendar days ”.
Article 19.3 of the LPH, second paragraph, indicates: " The minutes of the meetings are
will forward to the owners in accordance with the procedure established in article
9. "
According to the available evidence, it is considered
proven the public exposure of a document on the notice board of the aforementioned
community, showing the claimant's personal data, and therefore it is understood that
the claimed entity has violated article 5.1 f) of the RGPD, which governs the principles
integrity and confidentiality of personal data, as well as responsibility
proactive of the person in charge of the treatment to demonstrate its fulfillment ”.
IV
