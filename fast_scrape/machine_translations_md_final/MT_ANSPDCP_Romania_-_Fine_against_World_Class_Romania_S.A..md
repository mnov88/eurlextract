The National Supervisory Authority completed, in April 2021, an investigation of the controller World Class Romania S.A., finding the violation of the provisions of art. 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

As such, the controller World Class Romania S.A. was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 9,851.00 RON (the equivalent of 2000 EUR).

The investigation was initiated following a notification and the National Supervisory Authority found that the controller World Class Romania S.A. posted on the WhatsApp group of its employees a resignation request of one of its employees, thus allowing unauthorized access of all members of that WhatsApp group to certain personal data (name, surname, address, personal number and identity card, code personal information, information related to the request for termination of employment).

In this context, the National Supervisory Authority considered that the controller World Class Romania S.A. did not take sufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure the confidentiality of the data subject's personal data.

Thus, within 30 days from the communication date, the controller was ordered to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation, personal data processing operations, by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures in case of remote transmission of personal data, including in terms of regular employee training.
