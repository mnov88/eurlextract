    Applicable provisions
          
              Article 5.1.d: Principle of accuracy
          Article 5.1.f: Principle of integrity and confidentiality
          Article 32: Processing security
              
      

  
    Summary
              The Authority reprimanded a controller who sent e-mails to a large number of recipients, placing the recipients' details in the "To" field. When an e-mail address is addressed to a large number of recipients who are natural persons, the controller must take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipients' addresses are not disclosed to a large number of persons. Therefore, in these cases it is better to use the "hidden notification" option or to send individual messages, when possible.
