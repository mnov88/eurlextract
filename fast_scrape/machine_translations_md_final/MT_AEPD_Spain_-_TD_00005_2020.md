FOURTH: Regarding the nature of the searcher as responsible for treatment, it should be noted that a search engine is a tool that provides the user access to certain websites. To do this, the tool accesses a list of pre-indexed links and offers the user a list of web addresses that point to pages containing the selected words by the user.
The Judgment of the Court of the European Union of 13 May 2014, in its paragraph 28, states that "by exploring the Internet in an automated, constant and The manager of a search engine will systematically look for the information published there. search collects such data which it extracts, records and subsequently organizes in the indexing programs, keeps on its servers and, where appropriate, communicates and provides access to its users in the form of result lists of its searches. Since these operations are explicitly and unconditional in Article 2(b) of Directive 95/46, must be regarded as treatment within the meaning of that provision, without it being relevant whether the search engine also perform the same operations with other types of information and does not distinguish between these and personal data.
(…)
Paragraph 33:
However, it is the search engine manager who determines the ends and means of this activity and, thus, of the processing of personal data carried out by the same in the framework of the latter and should therefore be held responsible for it processing under the said Article 2(d).
(…)
Paragraph 35:
In this connection, it should be noted that the processing of data The search engine activity is carried out in the context of a distinguishes it from that of Internet site publishers, which consists of making This data is displayed on a web page and added to it.
Paragraph 41:
(...) the activity of a search engine, which consists of finding information published or placed on the Internet by third parties, automatically indexed, to store it temporarily and finally to make it available to Internet users according to a certain order of preference, must be qualified as data processing personal, within the meaning of Article 2(b), where such information contains personal data and, on the other hand, the manager of a search engine should be considered the controller of such processing within the meaning of the aforementioned Article 2(d).
Consequently, the Court considers that the manager of the search is the data controller in determining the purposes and means of their activity.

FIFTH: With regard to the applicable regulations, the following should be noted: The judgment of the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union of dated 13 May 2014, considers in accordance with Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 95/46, in paragraphs 55, 56, 57 and 60, the following: "it should be considered that the processing of personal data carried out in order to operation of a search engine such as Google Search, managed by a company which has its registered office in a third country but has a establishment in a Member State, is carried out in the context of the activities of that establishment if it is intended to be promoted and sold in that State member of the search engine advertising spaces, which serve to to make the service proposed by the engine profitable.
Indeed, in such circumstances, the activities of the search engine manager and those of its establishment situated in the Member State concerned are The activities related to the spaces are inextricably linked, since the activities related to the advertising are the means for the search engine in question to be economically profitable and given that this engine is, at the same time, the medium that allows the above-mentioned activities to be carried out. (...) the very presentation of personal data on a result page of a search results page constitutes a processing of such data. So or, since this presentation of results is accompanied, in the same page, of the advertising presentation linked to the search terms, is obliged to declare that the processing of personal data in question is carried out in the context of the advertising and commercial activity of the establishment of the person responsible of processing in the territory of a Member State, in this case the territory Spanish.
(...) should be interpreted as meaning that data processing is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of the person responsible for such treatment in the territory of a Member State, within the meaning of that provision, where the manager of a search engine creates in the Member State a branch or a subsidiary intended to ensure the promotion and sale of spacevadvertising proposed by the above-mentioned engine and whose activity is aimed at inhabitants of this Member State."
SIXTH: In relation to the possibility of exercising the right of withdrawal before the search engine without going to the person responsible for the website, the aforementioned The Court of Justice of the European Union, in paragraphs 80 and 88, states that "a data processing (...) carried out by the manager of a search engine, you can significantly affect the fundamental rights of respect for privacy and protection of personal data when the search carried out using that search engine is carried out from the name of a natural person, each time that such treatment allows any Internet user to obtain through the list of results a structured view of information about this person that can be on the Internet, potentially affecting a multitude of aspects of their lives Without this engine, they would not have been interconnected or could only have been It was very difficult and thus allows you to establish a profile more or less detailed information on the person concerned. In addition, the effect of interference in such rights of the data subject is multiplied because of the important role played by The Internet and search engines in modern society, which give information contained in such a result list is ubiquitous (see, in this eDate Advertisin and others, C-509/09 and C-161/10, EU:C2011:685, paragraph 45). (...) to respect the rights set out in these provisions, provided that actually meet the requirements laid down in them, the manager of a search is required to remove from the list of results obtained after a search carried out on the basis of a person's name links to web pages, published by third parties and containing information relating to this person, alsoin the event that this name or this information is not previously deleted orsimultaneously from this website, and, where appropriate, although the publication in thesepages is in itself lawful." Consequently, the processing of personal data by the search engine manager allows a "name" to be listed as a results that provide information about a person that may affect their private. Once the person concerned has submitted his request for removal of his personal data to the search engine, you must examine it and proceed, in your case, to the removal of the specific links from the list of results, without prior or simultaneously have to go to the person responsible for the website.
SEVENTH: Regarding the opening of a sanctioning procedure for alleged violations of data protection regulations, with the processing of claim in accordance with the provisions of Article 63.1 of the LOPDGDD, has given The Committee is concerned about the fact that the issues raised have not been resolved, without the need for administrative responsibilities in the framework of a sanctioning procedure. In this connection, mention should be made of the exceptional nature of the sanctioning procedure, from which it follows that - wherever possible - it should The prevalence of alternative mechanisms should be chosen if they have protection in the regulations in force, as is the case here. It should be noted that this procedure is established to ensure the exercise of the rights of access, rectification, deletion, limitation, portability and opposition that the above-mentioned standard enshrines. On the other hand, the sanctioning procedure, as its The name itself indicates, it has a sanctioning nature and as such constitutes one of the manifestations of the "ius puniendi" of the State. So, while in any case the constitutional function of this Agency is to guarantee the fundamental right to protection of personal data, it should be noted that with the sanctioning procedure the aim is to establish whether any infringements have been committed and where appropriate, the imposition of appropriate sanctions. It is the exclusive competence of this Agency to assess whether there are liabilities
administrative procedures that must be purged in a sanctioning procedure and, in Consequently, the decision on its opening, there being no obligation to initiate a procedure for any request made by a third party. Such a decision must be based in the existence of elements that justify the initiation of the sanctioning activity, circumstances not present in the present case, in view of the proceedings therefore, the guarantees and rights of the affected party are duly restored.
