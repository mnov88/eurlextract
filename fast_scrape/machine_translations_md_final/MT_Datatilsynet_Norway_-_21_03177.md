Fee to Lillestrøm municipality

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has given Lillestrøm municipality an infringement fee of NOK 300,000 for breach of the Privacy Ordinance's requirements for confidentiality.

The municipality published a document in its public postal journal where 10 of 21 attachments contained personal data of special categories, cf. Article 9 no. 1 of the regulation. The municipality forgot to mark the 10 relevant attachments except for the public as they should. This was not detected by the case officer, and the document went through two more manual quality checks in the documentation center without the error being detected.

The municipality was made aware that the document with attachments was made available on the municipality's website on 27 September 2021 by a journalist in Romerikes Blad. The Data Inspectorate also received a report of a breach of personal data security from Lillestrøm municipality on 29 September.

Violation of confidentiality

Investigations showed that four different IP addresses (including Romerikes Blad) had accessed the document. The documents were removed from the mailing list and exempted from public access immediately after the incident was discovered. The affected were then notified.

The Data Inspectorate's assessment is that when a document with an appendix about a student is published on the municipality's website, it is clear that a good enough level of security has not been established, or that it does not work as intended. The fact that the incident is not detected by the municipality, but by a third party, also indicates deficient routines in this area.

The incident would involve a breach of Article 32 (1) (b) of the Privacy Regulation, which requires the establishment of a level of security that is suitable for ensuring continued confidentiality. Personal information that should have been protected had been made available to unauthorized persons on the internet. This applies to information about, for example, students' names, date of birth, test results, assessments of behavior and challenges and any diagnoses.

The Danish Data Protection Agency previously sent a notice of infringement fines of NOK 500,000. It is pointed out in the municipality's response to the notice of fee that they have routines, and that the discrepancy is due to human failure. The Data Inspectorate has noticed this and resulted in the fee being reduced from NOK 500,000 to NOK 300,000.
