2021/450 Court of 1st Instance and Instruction No. 1 of Villena.

FOURTH: On November 29, 2022, the Director of the Spanish Agency
of Data Protection agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against the claimed party,

for the alleged violation of Article 32 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.4 of the
GDPR.

Once the initiation agreement was notified, the SGIP presented a written statement of allegations, in which, in
synthesis stated:

-The SGIP alleges that any decision adopted in the disciplinary field must
be governed by the principle of presumption of innocence.

-The SGIP alleges that, in addition to having known the images, the Administration
Penitentiary (Alicante Penitentiary Center I and General Subdirectorate of Analysis and

Inspection) there were two judicial bodies to which, by legal imperative, they were sent
the aforementioned images (Guard Court of Investigation and Surveillance Court
Penitentiary), and that they cannot be held responsible for the use and treatment granted
for these.

-The SGIP alleges that the need for the access profile to be broad has its origin
in the very organization and work needs of the General Subdirectorate of
Analysis and Inspection, and that in relation to the lack of traceability, it is possible to know
which person accesses which images - that is, access to the shared folder leaves
trace -, the impossibility of identification to which reference had been made was that of the

specific person who has made said images in question public.

FIFTH: On 05/05/2023, the procedure instructor agreed to practice the
following tests:

       “It is also requested that the following documentation be sent

       related to the Prior information procedure 2021/122:

              c) Existing procedures for user management (detailing the
              registration, cancellation, identification, authentication and control processes
              logical access).

              d) Analysis of the records of the users who had access to the system
              (logs)”

On 05/23/2023, a written response was received, complying with the test.
requested.

SIXTH: On June 8, 2023, a proposed resolution was formulated,
proposing:

That the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency imposes
GENERAL SECRETARIAT OF PENITENTIARY INSTITUTIONS, with NIF

S2813060G, for a violation of Article 32 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.4
of the GDPR, a warning sanction.

Once the proposed resolution has been notified, the SGIP presents a new document in which
states:

“In the Reference File, what was contributed throughout the
procedure, remaining available for the implementation of those measures
technical and organizational to the extent that it is budgetarily possible”

In view of everything that has been done, by the Spanish Data Protection Agency
In this procedure, the following are considered proven facts:

                                PROVEN FACTS

FIRST: According to documentation in the file, there is a lack of profiles,

since any inspector could access the recorded images, without having been
specified whether or not they are authorized to do so, whether any system has to be enabled
specific, or if access to the images is free for all inspectors, since the
response to the requested evidence has not clarified this aspect.

SECOND: According to documentation in the file, there is a lack of
traceability, since it has not been proven that there are records of users who
may have accessed the system.

                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the

Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures

processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

                                           II

In response to the allegations presented by the claimed entity, it should be noted
the next:

-The SGIP alleges that any decision adopted in the disciplinary field must
be governed by the principle of presumption of innocence.

       In this regard, this Agency expresses its total and absolute agreement,
       indicating that all sanctioning procedures are carried out according to

       established in articles 64 and following of the LOPDGDD, respecting
       scrupulously the established legislation.

       The presumption of innocence, a fundamental right of citizenship according to art.
       24.2 of the Constitution and art. 6.2 of the European Convention of Rights

       Humans, is expressly included in our regulations for
       administrative sanctioning procedures in art. 53.2.b) of Law 39/15
       where among the rights of the interested party in the administrative procedure
       sanctioner will have the right

               "To the presumption of non-existence of administrative responsibility

               until proven otherwise."

       As established by STS 04/28/2016 (RC 677/2014): "it can be said that the
       right to the presumption of innocence, which applies without exception in the field of
       administrative sanctioning procedure, according to the Court

       Constitutional ruling 66/2007, of March 27, means that "no
       any sanction may be imposed that is not based on a prior
       lawful evidentiary activity", and also implies the recognition of the right to
       an administrative sanctioning procedure due or with all guarantees,
       that respects the principle of contradiction and in which the alleged responsible

       have the opportunity to defend their own positions, prohibiting the initiation
       of disciplinary proceedings when it is unequivocally appreciable
       or manifests the absence of rational indications that a crime has been committed

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/12

       infringing conduct, or in which illegality or illegality is absent
       culpability"

-The SGIP alleges that, in addition to having known the images, the Administration
Penitentiary (Alicante Penitentiary Center I and General Subdirectorate of Analysis and
Inspection) there were two judicial bodies to which, by legal imperative, they were sent
the aforementioned images (Guard Court of Investigation and Surveillance Court
Penitentiary), and that they cannot be held responsible for the use and treatment granted
for these.

       In this regard, this Agency indicates that, in this specific procedure
       sanctioner, no infringement is being charged for the leak of images
       in itself, but for lacking technical and organizational measures that result
       appropriate to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk of the

       treatment, in the terms required by article 32.1 of the RGPD.

-The SGIP alleges that the need for the access profile to be broad has its origin
in the very organization and work needs of the General Subdirectorate of
Analysis and Inspection, and that in relation to the lack of traceability, it is possible to know
which person accesses which images - that is, access to the shared folder leaves

trace -, the impossibility of identification to which reference had been made was that of the
specific person who has made said images in question public.

       In this regard, this Agency refers to the Report issued by the
       General Subdirectorate of Analysis and Inspection, recorded in the file, in

       whose point 2 is quoted verbatim (the underlining corresponds to the AEPD):

               “Once the images are brought to the attention of the Unit
               of Inspection were treated, in compliance with their functions of
               investigation legally established by the Guard Inspection, the

               Instructor of Previous Information 2021/122, and where they could also
               the rest of the Inspectors of the
               “Unity, without being able to prove such an extreme”

       It does not make reference, therefore, as alleged in the allegations, to the
       impossibility of determining the specific person who made public the

       images, but because it has not even been possible to prove which people have
       accessed the subsequently leaked images.

       It should also be noted that, requested by this Agency, information about
       of the records of the users who had access to the system (logs), the

       response is limited to stating: “The file server logs are saved
       for a specific time, without being able to have access at this time.
       the logs of those dates.”

                                           III

Article 32 “Security of processing” of the GDPR establishes:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/12

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as risks of

variable probability and severity for people's rights and freedoms
physical, the person responsible and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which, if applicable, includes, among others:
       a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
       b) the ability to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and

       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
       c) the ability to restore availability and access to data
       personnel quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
       d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness
       of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the

       treatment.

2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration will be given to
takes into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
consequence of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of data
personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication or

unauthorized access to said data.

3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved pursuant to article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the

present article.

4. The controller and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to ensure that
any person acting under the authority of the person responsible or in charge and
has access to personal data can only process said data following

instructions of the person responsible, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the Law of
the Union or the Member States.

In the present case, although it is true that it has not been possible to determine when
or by which organ of those who have had access to the images the leak occurred
of the same, if it becomes clear that the SGIP did not have the measures

appropriate to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk.

From the instruction carried out in this procedure, it is concluded that the SGIP
has failed to comply with the provisions of article 32 of the RGPD.
