(hereinafter referred to as EYDAP), the company proceeded to thoroughly inform the counterparty of both the availability restriction incident and the confidentiality restriction incident. In particular, the ELTA informed in this respect and EYDAP that they act as processor on its behalf only in respect of the services referred to in Article 1, subpara.

THOUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW

1. According to Article 5(1)(f) of the GDPR, personal data "shall be processed in a way that ensures appropriate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction or deterioration, using appropriate technical or organisational measures ('integrity and confidentiality')."
2. In accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR:
"1. Taking into account the latest developments, the cost of implementation and the

7

the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security against the risks, including, inter alia, where appropriate:
(a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;
(b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and reliability of
the processing systems and services on a continuous basis,
(c) the possibility of restoring availability and access to personal data in due time in the event of a physical or technical incident,
(d) a procedure for the regular testing, assessment and evaluation of the
effectiveness of technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of processing;
2. When assessing the appropriate level of security, particular account shall be taken of the risks arising from the processing, in particular from  accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
(...)
4. The controller and the processor shall take measures to ensure that any natural person acting under the supervision of the controller or the processor who has access to personal data processes them only on the instructions of the controller, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law."

3. In the present case, the examination of the technical report of the cybersecurity incident shows that the Post Office did not maintain adequate technical security measures on the system, as described in detail in Annexes D and E to the Decision, in breach of Article 32 of the GDPR.
4. In addition, the examination of the security policy reveals the incorrect application of policies as described in detail in Annex F to the Decision, in breach of Article 32 of the GDPR.
5. Furthermore, from the notification of an incident of infringement
No.C/EIS/9170/27-07-2022, it is clear that the restriction of access only to
authorised persons, as described in detail in Annexes D and E of the decision, was not ensured, in violation of Article 5 par. 1(f).
6. Moreover, the examination of the technical report of the cybersecurity incident shows that the perpetrator's tracking and identification activities and the disabling of security mechanisms as a consequence of the execution of malware processes, as described in detail in Annexes D and E of the Decision, were not detected and prevented, in violation of Article 32 of the GDPR.
7. In particular, in relation to the infringements referred to in paragraphs 3-6 above, from all the evidence in the file and the hearing, it appears that the ELTA:
α. They have not ensured, by implementing the required technical and
organisational measures, the protection of personal data against
unauthorised or unlawful processing, resulting in the loss of the right to the
protection of personal data pursuant to Article 5(5)(a) of the GDPR. 1(f) of
the GDPR.
β. They have not implemented appropriate data protection policies to ensure
t h a t t h e y a r e a b l e t o demonstrate that they have carried out
processing in accordance with the definitions in Article 32 of the GDPR.
c. They did not ensure the confidentiality, availability and reliability of the systems and processing services on an ongoing basis and the integrity of the procedures for the regular testing, assessment and evaluation of the
effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for the security of
processing, so as to ensure an appropriate level of security against risks to
the rights of data subjects, as referred to in Article 32(2)(a), (b), (c) and (d). 1(b) of the GDPR.
8. On the basis of the above, the Authority considers that there have been
infringements of the obligations under Articles 5(5)(a) and (b) of the EEA
Agreement. 1(f) and 32 of the GDPR. For the breaches of those articles, which
constitute separate infringements, there is a case for the exercise of the Authority's remedial powers by imposing, pursuant to Article 58(5)(a) and (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the imposition of a penalty in accordance with Article 58(3)(a) of the GDPR. 2(i) of the GDPR, on the basis of the circumstances found, an effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative fine pursuant to Article 83 of the GDPR.
9. For the calculation of the fine, the following criteria are taken into account in accordance with the 4/2022 guidelines of the NAPC for the calculation of administrative fines:2
I. Turnover data, in particular:
a. Latest available turnover: 140.051.0003 € (01/01/2022- 30/06/2022).
b. Latest available annual turnover 2021: 299.514.0004 € (01/01/2021-31/12/2021).
c. Turnover decrease of 5.4% between the six months
01/01/2021-30/06/2021 and 01/01/2022-30/06/2022.5
II. That the gravity of the infringements found is i n all cases considered to be high, taking into account:

administrative-fines-under\_en - version 2.0, after consultation.

a. the wide range of persons affected, i.e. 4.000.000 - 5.000.000.000,
including ELTA employees, executives, board members, lessors, customers, external partners, distributors, contractors, pensioners, postal agents, borrowers, guarantors and
β. The high level of damage, i.e. extensive data leakage involving personal
data, financial data, etc. and loss of service availability.
c. That a breach of the controller's system, unauthorised access to resources,
installation of malicious software and disclosure of data on the dark web
has taken place, as described in detail in Annexes C, D, E and F.
δ. That there were failures to implement the security policy, failure to secure access to data by unauthorised users, insufficient technical
documentation on the issues of collecting domain passwords and failure to use the unusual activity warning messages by the protection mechanisms, as detailed in Annexes D and E.
ε. That categories of personal data of particular importance were affected,
such as financial data of the controller and affected companies/providers,
employee data, correspondence, competitions, board minutes, personal and customer file photos, witness summons data, witness testimony report, universal inspection report, database records, list of OGA pensioners, customer/supplier data, affidavits/authorisations.
f. The fact that no historical application data was recovered. No measures
were taken to limit the posting of data on the dark web.

10

III. The Authority will take into account the following as mitigating circumstances:
α. Following the incident, the security of the system was reinforced by taking
both technical and organisational measures.
β. There was no leakage of sensitive personal data.
c. The controller has contracted a third party company to carry out a standard
incident management and response procedure and has implemented all
steps of the procedure.
δ. There was a significant amount of data restoration from backups. There was a restoration of service availability.
ε. The controller has submitted an additional breach notification which includes details of the data leakage to the dark web.
f. At the time the attack occurred, the controller was in a difficult financial situation. The company was experiencing a loss in turnover until 30/6/2022.
10. After taking into account the above aggravating and attenuating circumstances (paragraph 9(ii) and (iii) above), as well as the turnover data of the HR (paragraph 9(i) above), the Authority considers that a fine should be imposed on the company called "HELLENIC TEXT PROPERTIES ANONYMOUS COMPANY" close to the lower end of the static range set by the Guidelines 4/2022 of the CPC for the type of infringements with high gravity and equal to 1% of the last available annual turnover of the SO.

FOR THESE REASONS
The Authority

Exercising the corrective powers under Article 58(1)(b) of the Treaty. 2(i) of the GDPR, impose a fine of two million nine hundred and ninety-five thousand nine hundred and fifty-five thousand one hundred forty euros (2.995.140) to the company called 'HELLENIC TEXT PROPERTIES S.A.', for the
reasons set out in detail in the grounds.
