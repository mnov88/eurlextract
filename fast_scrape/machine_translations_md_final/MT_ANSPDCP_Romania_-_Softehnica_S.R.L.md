Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in December 2024, an investigation at the operator Softehnica S.R.L and found a violation of art. 32 par. (1) letter. b), d) and par. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 24,866 lei (equivalent to the amount of 5000 Euros).

The investigation was initiated following the transmission by the operator Softehnica S.R.L of a notification of a personal data security breach, according to the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

The investigation found that, following a Ransomware-type cyber attack, the operator's IT infrastructure was accessed.

In this context, it was found that the operator did not implement appropriate technical and organizational measures and did not periodically test, evaluate and assess the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of data processing, including the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and continuous resilience of the processing systems and services.

This led to the unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to personal data of a significant number of natural persons concerned, such as: name, surname, domicile, e-mail address and contact details, thus violating the provisions of art. 32 par. (1) let. b), d) and par. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
