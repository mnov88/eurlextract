Order

The value of the dispute for the appeal proceedings is set at €7,500.

Reasons

1. I. Pursuant to §§ 540 (2), 313a in conjunction with 544 (2) No. 1 ZPO, the presentation of the parties' submissions and the applications is omitted.

2. II. The plaintiff's admissible appeal, which was filed and substantiated in due form and time, is partially successful on the merits.

3. The plaintiff is entitled to compensation for non-material damage against the defendant pursuant to Article 82 (1), (2) Sentence 1 GDPR in the total amount of €4,000.

4. The defendant, as the "controller" within the meaning of Article 4 No. 7 GDPR, violated its obligations under Articles 5, 6 in conjunction with Article 4 (2) GDPR by reporting its claims against the plaintiff to Schufa twice, although the conditions for this were not met. Reference is made to the correct statements of the Regional Court, which the Court of Appeal fully endorses.

5. As a result, the plaintiff also suffered compensable non-material damage. The Regional Court carefully and convincingly reasoned that the plaintiff had to endure an impairment of his social reputation due to the double unauthorized report to Schufa, portraying him as an unreliable debtor.

6. The plaintiff also demonstrated that the Schufa report and the resulting worsened credit risk assessment had specific negative consequences regarding the granting of a loan by I. (Exhibit K16) and the blocking of his credit card by H. Bank (Exhibit K17).

7. However, the Court of Appeal believes that not all circumstances were adequately considered in determining the compensation for pain and suffering.

8. The CJEU (judgment of 4 May 2023, C-300/21, para. 51) stated that the GDPR does not contain any provisions regarding the criteria for determining the amount of compensation to which a person is entitled under Article 82 GDPR if damage has been caused by a breach of the regulation. It is the responsibility of each Member State's law to establish the criteria, ensuring compliance with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness.

9. Accordingly, the criteria for assessing compensation for pain and suffering under German law are decisive, whereby the amount of the claim is to be determined based on an assessment of the overall circumstances of the case, considering the compensatory and satisfactory functions of the compensation.

10. Consequently, particular importance must be attached to the fact that conditional intent must be assumed on the part of the defendant. The defendant made the first report even though the plaintiff had expressly disputed the claim in response to the defendant's notification that a report to Schufa would be made if he did not contest the claim (letter of 1 December 2019, Exhibit K7). The second report was also made despite further disputes by the plaintiff (letter of 29 December 2019, Exhibit K11), his request for deletion, and an interim deletion by Schufa itself (Exhibit K14). Such behavior can only be interpreted as the defendant knowingly and at least with reckless acceptance of the possible wrongful outcome, violating its obligations under the GDPR. Additionally, the defendant refused to revoke the negative entry despite the plaintiff's request and explanation of its illegality.

11. Considering the described circumstances and a recently decided comparable case by the Senate, where no concrete impacts resulted from the Schufa report and no intentional conduct by the defendant was found (13 U 71/21) and a compensation of €1,000 per report was awarded, a significantly higher amount of €2,000 per report, totaling €4,000, is deemed appropriate and sufficient, thus the further appeal is dismissed.

12. 2.) The appeal is also partially justified concerning the claimed pre-litigation attorney fees. Given the need to await the damage development until deletion, the plaintiff's legal representative was not required to assert the compensation claim simultaneously with the deletion request. The fact that the claim for pre-litigation attorney fees against the defendant, which was settled, may have been calculated based on an overly high dispute value and fee rate is irrelevant since this is not disputed between the parties.

13. The claim for payment of pre-litigation attorney fees exists only to the extent stated in the tenor. The value of the pre-litigation activity is generally calculated only from the legitimate principal claim. The legitimate claim for non-material damage, as previously stated, is only €4,000. However, considering that the final amount of the claim is subject to judicial discretion, the Senate follows the OLG Munich (judgment of 23 February 2022, 7 U 1195/21, juris para. 50, 54 f) that a 20% overclaim in compensation requests is not detrimental to costs, thus the plaintiff is to be treated as if he had prevailed with €4,800 (= 120% of €4,000). Adding the claimed material damage of €4,771.39 results in a dispute value of €9,571.39.

14. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal considers a 1.3 fee for pre-litigation activity appropriate. According to the legal fee provision in No. 2300 VV-RVG, a fee higher than 1.3 can only be demanded if the activity was extensive or difficult. This is not evident in this case. The fact that, according to the Federal Constitutional Court, the scope, impact, and requirements for non-material damage claims under the GDPR are still unclear is not sufficient, especially as it is not apparent that pre-litigation activities addressed these unresolved issues.

15. Accordingly, the business fee amounts to €725.40. Since the plaintiff demands reimbursement of the remaining business fee after offsetting per Vorb. 3 (4) VV RVG at a rate of 0.55 (plus expenses and VAT), the claim regarding attorney fees is justified only in the amount of €498.57 (0.55 of €725.40 = €398.97 + €20.00 expenses + €79.60 VAT) plus interest from the date of lis pendens.

16. The decision on costs follows from § 92 (1) ZPO, considering that a 20% overclaim is not detrimental to costs (see above).

17. The decision on provisional enforceability follows from §§ 708 No. 10, 711, 713 ZPO.

18. The conditions for allowing a revision are not met.
