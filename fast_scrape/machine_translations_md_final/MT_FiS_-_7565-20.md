Google's routine violates the GDPR
Dimensions: 7565-20
Google has a routine of informing webmasters when a search result has been removed from the list of search results in accordance with the "right to be forgotten". In a judgment today, the Administrative Court has found that this is not permitted under the Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The right to be forgotten means that an individual has the right to have one or more links to web pages with personal data deleted from the list of search results displayed during a search on the person's name.

Google believes that webmaster information is necessary for purposes relating to the fundamental right of search engine providers, webmasters and internet users to freedom of expression and information.

On the other hand, the Court has ruled that Google's routine of regularly sending information to webmasters constitutes a processing of personal data which is incompatible with the purpose for which the data was originally collected, and that there is no legal basis for the processing.

- The court has found that Google's procedures regarding requests to remove search hits are contrary to the Data Protection Ordinance, says lawyer Stefan Holgersson

However, the Court finds that the penalty charge imposed for Google's failure to delete individual search results without undue delay should be significantly reduced. The Administrative Court therefore reduces the sanction fee from a total of SEK 75 million to SEK 52 million.
