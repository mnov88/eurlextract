In November of this year, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator of SC Nobiotic Pharma SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation. & # 13;
As such, SC Nobiotic Pharma SRL was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 9890 lei, the equivalent of 2000 EURO, for violating art. 58 para. (1) of the General Regulation on Data Protection, regarding the obligation of the operator to provide the necessary information to the National Supervisory Authority. & # 13;
In this context, we specify that art. 58 para. (1) lit. a) and e) of the General Data Protection Regulation provide as follows: & # 13;
"(1) Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers of investigation: & # 13;
a) to order the operator and the person authorized by the operator and, as the case may be, the representative of the operator or the person authorized by the operator to provide any information that the supervisory authority requests in order to carry out its tasks; & # 13;
e) to obtain, from the operator and the person empowered by the operator, access to all personal data and to all information necessary for the performance of his tasks ‚Äù. & # 13;
The investigation was carried out as a result of complaints by the petitioner claiming that the operator had sent him unsolicited commercial SMS messages without his consent. & # 13;
As the operator did not comply with the request for information addressed by the National Supervisory Authority in the exercise of its powers, it was sanctioned with a fine. & # 13;
