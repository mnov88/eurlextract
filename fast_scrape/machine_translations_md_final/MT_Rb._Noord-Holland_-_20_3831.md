      Process sequence
    
  
  
    In the decision of November 18, 2019 (primary decision), the respondent rejected the claimant's request to delete telephone notes and the respondent explained why information is exchanged between the various departments of the UWV.
  
  
    In the decision of 14 July 2020 (contested decision), the respondent dismissed the claimant's objection against the primary decision with regard to the telephone notes, while adjusting the motivation, and declared the objection with regard to the internal data exchange inadmissible.
  
  
    Plaintiff has appealed against the contested decision.
  
  
    Defendant has filed a statement of defence.
  
  
    The court heard the appeal on August 11, 2021. Plaintiff appeared, assisted by her attorney. Defendant was represented by his attorney.
  
  
    
      Considerations
    
  
  1. The run-up to the primary decision has been atypical. Plaintiff has requested defendant in several letters and e-mails for information and clarity regarding the information processing and flows. These letters and e-mails on the part of the claimant have led to the decision to be taken on 18 November 2019. Plaintiff cannot agree with the defendant's position that the telephone notes will not be removed, nor can it agree that information about Plaintiff and personal data is shared between the departments of the UWV.
  2. At the hearing, the court established that Plaintiff not only wishes to have the telephone notes removed, but has also – at some point – requested access to those notes. The data protection officer made an overview of the telephone notes available to the claimant by e-mail dated 28 February 2020. The court therefore finds that the request for access pursuant to Article 15 of the GDPR has been complied with and that this is not subject to further review.
  3. In the contested decision, the respondent has substantiated that the UWV must view the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)1 and the Archives Act in relation to each other when managing personal data. Drawing up telephone notes, insofar as personal data is collected, falls under the scope of the GDPR. The Respondent processes the personal data in the telephone notes pursuant to Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR. It follows from this article that the processing must be necessary for the fulfillment of (statutory) tasks of general interest that have been assigned to the defendant. The telephone notes contribute to the handling and accountability of tasks performed by the defendant and have therefore been lawfully processed. The telephone notes are part of the claimant's file that is kept on the basis of the Archives Act. Archives that are kept on the basis of the Archives Act cannot simply be destroyed, this may only take place after the expiry of the retention periods specified in the selection list. The retention period follows from the 'Selection List of the Employee Insurance Agency'. This is an exception to the right to erasure within the meaning of Article 17 of the GDPR.
  With regard to the exchange of information within various departments, the respondent is of the opinion that it has not taken a decision on this within the meaning of the General Administrative Law Act (Awb) because the letter of 18 November 2019 is not aimed at legal consequences. The claimant's objection to this, therefore, was dismissed by the respondent as inadmissible.
  4. The legal framework is included in the appendix.
  
    
      5 The Phone Notes
    
      5.1
      Plaintiff disputes that the processing of telephone notes is necessary. According to the claimant, the retention of telephone notes is not in line with the principle of minimum data processing pursuant to Article 5(1) of the GDPR. The consequence of this is that the telephone notes have been processed unlawfully and for that reason the assessment framework and the retention periods of the Archives Act are not met. After all, the selection list concerns data that have already been archived, which presupposes that the archiving is lawful in itself and that, according to the claimant, is not the case. Plaintiff therefore has the right to erasure.
      
    
    
      5.2
      Respondent takes the position that pursuant to Article 30 of the Structure of the Implementation Organization for Work and Income Act the UWV has been assigned the task of the public interest. Plaintiff has applied for unemployment benefits and in order to determine entitlement to that benefit, defendant has created a file containing the telephone notes, containing personal data of Plaintiff. Respondent has therefore lawfully processed this data in view of its task. Under the Archives Act, the claimant's file is regarded as an archive document that must be kept on the basis of this Act. The telephone notes that are kept as part of the file therefore fall under the retention periods of the selection list. With regard to the request for erasure of data, the defendant is of the opinion that the plaintiff has not argued what its interest is in that right. Respondent is therefore unable to assess whether this interest outweighs the interest in keeping the telephone notes. The fact that the claimant no longer has any current benefits is not of sufficient weight.
      
      
        
          Which personal data and which processing operations are involved?
        
      
    
    
      5.3.
      
        The defendant has explained that the telephone notes contain at least the name of the claimant and that the telephone notes therefore contain personal data.
        The court further establishes that the claimant's request concerns both the filing of files in the context of the assessment of the right to benefit and the storage of those telephone notes in an archive after the benefit has been terminated.
       
      
      
        
          Is the processing of the personal data lawful?
          5.4. The request for erasure must be regarded as a request for erasure of personal data as referred to in Article 17(1) of the GDPR. That article provides that the data subject has the right to erasure – inter alia – when the personal data have been unlawfully processed. Plaintiff has requested the destruction of the telephone notes in their entirety, but in view of Article 17 of the GDPR, only the removal of the personal data can be requested and not the removal of the entire telephone notes. In which cases personal data has been lawfully processed is regulated in Article 6 of the GDPR.
       
      
    
    
      5.5.
      The court can follow the defendant in its position that the creation of a file of the plaintiff is necessary for the performance of its duties (Article 6, first paragraph, under e of the GDPR). In the opinion of the court, it is not unreasonable that telephone notes are also kept as part of this file, because they may contain information that is important for the file and the claimant's right to payment. It is therefore considered that the personal data included in the telephone notes have in principle been processed lawfully.
      
      
        
          Can the telephone notes also be kept?
        
      
    
    
      5.6.
      Plaintiff has put forward on appeal that she does not agree with the fact that the telephone notes – after completion of the benefit file – are kept.
      
    
    
      5.7.
      
        As the Division has previously considered2, it follows from Article 17(3) of the GDPR that the board is under no obligation to delete personal data without undue delay if it is subject to a statutory processing obligation.
        It follows from Article 3 of the 1995 Archives Act that the Commission is obliged to bring and keep the archive documents held by it in a good, ordered and accessible state. The UWV Selection List has been drawn up on the basis of Article 5 of the 1995 Archives Act. It follows from the UWV Selection List that the retention period for information for the purpose of deciding on entitlement to benefits, the amount and the duration of the benefits, is 5 years. Since the telephone notes, as the defendant argues, are kept in connection with the entitlement to benefits and the obligation to retain them is based on a legal basis, the defendant was right to take the position that it was not obliged to delete the plaintiff's telephone notes. .
       
      
      
        
          Should the personal data be removed from the telephone notes?
        
      
    
    
      5.9.
      
        Plaintiff argues that, in view of Article 5, first paragraph, under e, of the GDPR, the defendant must remove or erase the personal data from the telephone notes.
        The court does not follow the plaintiff's position. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (the Division) determined on 8 March 2017, ECLI:NL:RVS:2017:620, that the Archives Act, in contrast to, for example, the Government Information (Public Access) Act, which has an information system, contains a system of documents. . According to the Division, editing documents, for example by making them anonymous, does not fit in with the document system. The defendant therefore rightly took the position at the hearing that archive documents cannot be changed. This is also in accordance with Article 3 of the Archives Act, which stipulates that the board has the duty to bring and keep the archive documents held by it in a good, orderly and accessible state, as well as to ensure the destruction of the relevant records. eligible records.3
       
      
      
        
          Correction (superfluous)
        
      
    
    
      5.10.
      Plaintiff argues that the content of the telephone notes is incorrect and therefore wishes to rectify the notes. Firstly, the court considers that this is not the subject of these proceedings. In doing so, the court considers that it has not been shown that the personal data included in the archive documents are incorrect. In addition, Article 45, first paragraph, of the General Data Protection Regulation Implementation Act (UAVG) states that the right to rectification does not apply to archive records.
      
    
  
  
    
      6 Data exchange within the UWV
    
      6.1
      Plaintiff argues that the data exchange between different departments is unlawful because this is contrary to the principle of minimization of data processing as referred to in Article 5 of the GDPR. Plaintiff also refers to Article 32 of the GDPR and argues that the security of her personal data is insufficiently guaranteed due to data exchange. Finally, it is not clear to Plaintiff how her personal data is secured and that is not in accordance with Article 12 of the GDPR.
      
    
    
      6.2
      The respondent takes the position that, pursuant to Article 34 of the UAVG, a written decision on a request as referred to in Articles 15 to 22 of the GDPR, insofar as it has been taken by an administrative authority, is a decision within the meaning of the AWB. Article 15 of the GDPR contains the right to access personal data and information about the processing of those personal data. According to the defendant, no information is required under that article about the security and control of the data exchange when processing personal data. Nevertheless, Plaintiff can put questions to Defendant about this, which she has done, and Defendant answered Plaintiff's questions and complaints during the interview on December 13, 2019. The respondent has explained the way in which the UWV implements the security and control of data exchange within the UWV. However, the defendant is not obliged to take a decision in this regard within the meaning of the Awb, since the provision of this information is not intended to have legal consequences under public law.
    
    
      6.3
      The court states first and foremost that the administrative judge's assessment is in principle limited to the question of whether the plaintiff has rightly been declared inadmissible. The court can follow the defendant's position and is of the opinion that the plaintiff's request is not a situation as referred to in Article 34 of the UAVG. Defendant could therefore not be obliged to take a decision in that regard and has not done so with the letter of 18 November 2019, because it provided an explanation that did not create any legal consequences. The court therefore finds that the defendant has rightly dismissed the claim of the plaintiff on this point.
      
      7. In view of all the foregoing, the appeal is unfounded.
      
      8. There is no reason for an order to pay costs.
