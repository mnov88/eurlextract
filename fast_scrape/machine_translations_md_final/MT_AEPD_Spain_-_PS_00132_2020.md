LEGAL FOUNDATIONS
I
By virtue of the powers conferred on each of the parties by Article 58(2) of the GDPR authority, and in accordance with the provisions of Articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

II
The defendant is charged with an infringement of Article 6 of the GPRS, "Lawfulness of processing", which states in paragraph 1 the cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:
 "1. Processing shall be lawful only if at least one of the following conditions is met conditions:
a) the data subject has given his consent to the processing of his data for one or more specific purposes;
(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the interested is a party to or for the application at his request of measures pre-contractual;
(…)”
The infraction is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers it as such:
“5. Infringements of the following provisions shall be sanctioned, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 20 000 000 or in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual turnover for the previous financial year, opting for the largest:

(a) The basic principles for treatment, including the conditions for consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9.  Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements considered to be very serious" he states:

"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and will expire after three years if constitute a substantial breach of the articles mentioned in that one and, in In particular, the following:

 (…)
b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions for the lawfulness of processing laid down in Article 6 of Regulation (EU)2016/679.

III
The documentation in the file provides evidence that the party claimed violated Article 6.1 of the RGPD.
In this sense, it is accredited that the defendant processed the personal data of the claimant without legitimizing it. It is clear that the claimant (marketer the claimant's contract with the company (the
(Endesa Energía), which is done through the number of CUPS that is associated with housing.

It should be taken into account, without prejudice to the above, that the claimed party provides the contract for the change of ownership, for the aforementioned point of supply, but it is noted that it is completed by a person as representative of the new owner. They provide the representative's ID card and the signed contract by the latter, but in no case the consent of the new owner.

And, for this purpose, Law 24/2013, of 26 December, on the electricity sector (in the "Electricity Sector Act"), establishes the consumer's right to change as a marketing company in accordance with the European directives of the internal electricity market.

To this end, the legislation sets out the general process to be followed between the new marketer or incoming marketer, the distributor, and the existing or outgoing marketing company. This change implies the registration of a new energy supply contract with the incoming marketer and the withdrawal of the existing contract with the outgoing marketer, through an agent who executes the change that is the distributor.

Likewise, Article 46 of the Electricity Sector Law establishes among the obligations of marketers, in paragraph 1(g) that of "Formalising the supply contracts with consumers in accordance with the regulations
that is applicable". The mention by the Law of the obligation to formalize the contract between the obligations of the marketers shows that it is the The marketing company is the holder of the supply contract with the consumer. Therefore, corresponds to the marketer and, in the event of a change of marketer, to the
incoming marketer, check the identity and the voluntary, correct and informed provision of consent by the consumer, who is his counterpart in the supply contract.

In this sense, the new marketer (the one claimed) will have to manage the termination of the claimant's contract with its outgoing trading company (Endesa Energía), this is done through the number of CUPS associated with the home. At definitively, it treats your personal data.

Therefore, having established that the data was processed by the respondent the claimant's personal data, who refuses to consent to the processing, and insofar as the first has not provided any evidence to disprove such evidence, it is estimated that the facts submitted for assessment by this Agency constitute a
violation of Article 6.1 of the RGPD, violation of Article 83.5 of the same Regulation 2016/679.

IV

In determining the administrative fine to be imposed, the following must be observed provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, which state "Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of the fines administrative offences under this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 9 and 6 are on a case-by-case basis effective, proportionate and dissuasive".
