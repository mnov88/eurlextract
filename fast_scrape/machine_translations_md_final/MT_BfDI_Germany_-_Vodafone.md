BfDI Imposes Fines on Vodafone

The BfDI, headed by Prof. Dr. Louisa Specht-Riemenschneider, has imposed two fines totaling €45 million on Vodafone GmbH. Malicious employees in partner agencies that broker contracts to customers on behalf of Vodafone have led to cases of fraud, including fictitious contracts or contract changes to the detriment of customers.

A fine of €15 million was imposed because Vodafone GmbH failed to adequately review and monitor partner agencies working for it in accordance with data protection law (Article 28 (1) Sentence 1 GDPR).

In addition, the BfDI issued a warning to Vodafone for a violation of Article 32 (1) GDPR due to vulnerabilities identified in certain sales systems.

A further fine of €30 million was imposed for security deficiencies in the authentication process when using the "MeinVodafone" online portal combined with the Vodafone hotline. The discovered authentication vulnerabilities enabled, among other things, unauthorized third parties to access eSIM profiles.

Vodafone GmbH has since improved its processes and systems and, in some cases, even completely replaced them to prevent such risks in the future. It has also revised its processes for selecting and auditing partner agencies and has separated from partners identified as having engaged in fraud. The Federal Institute for Information Security (BfDI) will review the practical effectiveness of the measures taken by Vodafone in a follow-up audit.

"I would like to emphasize that Vodafone has cooperated with me continuously and without restriction throughout the entire proceedings and has also disclosed circumstances that have incriminated the company," emphasizes Specht-Riemenschneider. The fines have been accepted and have already been paid in full to the Federal Treasury.

The experience of data protection authorities shows that companies in many industries are experiencing an investment backlog in the modernization and consolidation of IT systems. As a result, some cutbacks are made in security. The use of data processors is also often not adequately monitored in practice. New technological possibilities and more complex threat scenarios lead to increased risks for customers, who can suffer damage due to a lack of data protection.

Data protection is often mistakenly viewed as an obstacle to IT investments. The opposite is true: Without IT investments, security incidents and even sanctions from data protection regulators are imminent. Hence my appeal: Invest instead of risk!

In the case of Vodafone GmbH, the company has changed course and prioritized IT consolidation and modernization projects, and strengthened the areas of compliance and data protection. Vodafone has thus committed itself to strong data protection and fundamental digital rights and sees them as the basis for customer trust. As a commitment to the importance of data protection, Vodafone GmbH has also donated a total of several million euros to various organizations dedicated to promoting data protection, media competence and digital literacy, and combating cyberbullying.

Specht-Riemenschneider concluded: "Where data protection violations occur, sanctions must be imposed. However, I also want my work to prevent data protection violations from occurring in the first place. Companies that want to comply with data protection law must be empowered to do so. Data protection is a factor of trust for users of digital services and can therefore become a competitive advantage. More and more companies are understanding this."
