\[plaintiff\] from \[place of residence\] , plaintiff

and

\[lecture\]

(Agent: mr. F. Heijne).

Process flow

On May 6, 2021, the claimant requested the Board to rectify all changes that were made without his knowledge after July 3, 2008 in his personnel file and in the Board's archives. The claimant also requests that the Board indicate which file documents played a role in the decision of 8 July 2008 to terminate his position, and which file documents were not included in the considerations.

After the claimant served notice of default on the Board, he lodged an appeal on 24 June 2022 because the Board allegedly failed to decide on his request in time.

The college has filed a statement of defence. Plaintiff subsequently responded in writing.

The court heard the appeal at a hearing on 3 November 2022. Plaintiff appeared. The council was represented by its authorized representative.

After the hearing of the case, the court immediately ruled at the hearing, pointing out to the parties the possibility of appealing against the oral decision.

Decision

The court declares the appeal inadmissible.

Considerations

1. The court gives the following grounds for this.

Relevant legal provisions

2. Pursuant to Article 34 of the AVG Implementation Act, a written decision on a request as referred to in Articles 15 to 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is taken within the period referred to in Article 12, third paragraph, of the AVG. time limits and, insofar as it has been taken by an administrative body, it applies as a decision within the meaning of the General Administrative Law Act (Awb).

3. Pursuant to Section 1:3(3) of the Awb, an application is understood to mean: a request from an interested party to take a decision.

4. Pursuant to Article 6:2, preamble and under b, of the Awb, the failure to make a decision on time is equated with a decision for the purposes of statutory provisions on objections and appeals.

Court assessment

5. Plaintiff has requested changes to the file that the Board manages of him as a former employee. The court rules that this request cannot be regarded as a request within the meaning of the GDPR. Plaintiff's request aims to reverse all changes in his personnel file after July 3, 2008. That is not a rectification within the meaning of Article 16 of the GDPR, as the claimant argues. That provision is limited to the rectification of incorrect personal data and to the completion of incomplete personal data. That is not the purport of plaintiff's request. Only at the hearing did the claimant make his request more explicit and point out matters that he believes to be incorrect, but it also does not sufficiently follow that it concerns a request for rectification within the meaning of Article 16 of the GDPR.

6. The request is also not aimed at obtaining access to personal data, deleting personal data or limiting the processing of personal data within the meaning of Articles 15, 17 and 18 of the GDPR. Plaintiff has also not been able to make clear to which other provision in the GDPR his request would relate.

7. Because claimant's request is not a request within the meaning of the AVG, a response to that request is not a decision within the meaning of the Awb. Plaintiff's request cannot be regarded as an application within the meaning of the Awb in any other way either. There is therefore no appeal to the administrative court against the failure to respond to the request.

Conclusion

8. The appeal is inadmissible. There is no justification for an order for costs.

This ruling was pronounced in public on November 3, 2022 by mr. K. de Meulder, judge, in the presence of mr. K.E. Pruntel, clerk.
