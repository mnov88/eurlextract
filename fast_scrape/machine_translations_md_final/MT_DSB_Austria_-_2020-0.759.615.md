A. Submissions of the parties and course of the proceedings

In addition to checking the validity of the lift ticket for access control, a photo is also taken

that it is correct that, for the purpose of access control, a reference photo of the

Lift ticket holder when first stepping through the equipped with a camera
Turnstile at the valley station of the Z\*\*\*bergbahn I and at the valley station of the \*\*\* gondola

were posted and on the homepage it was pointed out that a

This access control is permissible, especially since it is only at special entry points, namely the

As a result, access control with image comparison protects those who are authorized

Lift tickets, which is why there are no violations of the GDPR or the DSG.

3. With a statement dated April 15, 2020, the complainant - if
relevant to the procedure - from the fact that in the best case it would require twice the financial effort,

to cover a day's skiing with hourly tickets, which is why the complainant did not

recognize proportionality. It can also be expected from the classic skier that this

spend at least one day on the slopes. The references given are only at or

B. Subject of Complaint

Based on the submissions of the complainant, the object of the complaint is whether

the Respondent informed the complainant by processing his image data for the

Purpose of access control to cable car and ski lift systems in the period from 27. to

December 29, 2019 violated his basic right to secrecy according to ยง 1 paragraph 1 DSG
Has.

C. Findings of Facts

1. The Respondent operates a cable car and ski lift company in \*3 St. U\*\*\* am
Z\*\*\*berg. There it becomes more abusive for the purpose of access control or delaying

Use of ski passes (unauthorized transfer of ski pass) a reference photo of a

every lift ticket holder when crossing the turnstile for the first time

north-western access to the valley station of the Z\*\*\*bergbahn I and at the valley station of the
\*\*\* Gondola made and subsequently a control photo. ski passes are

according to point. \* of the Respondent's general tariff provisions

transferable. The image capture is through appropriate stickers as well as information signs respectively
marked.

The position of the turnstiles with image control is as follows:

\[Editor's note: the graphic file (piste map) was removed because it was not in the RIS

can be represented.\]

Evidence assessment: The findings made are based on the credibly presented

Respondent's statements. The General Tariff Conditions

Appropriate image capturing is installed at the turnstiles

Complainant confirms, even if he complains, that after viewing this
Due to the large crowds, it was not possible to turn back.

2. The complainant has for the period from December 27 to 29, 2019

Purchased ski day tickets from the Respondent for the Z\*\*\*berg and the facilities of

Respondent used. On the respective day ticket - in accordance with the tariff provisions of the Respondent - there is a note that the ski pass is not

is transferrable. Furthermore, there is a reference on the ski pass that the

Tariff regulations as posted apply.

This information is shown as follows (excerpts) on the ski pass:

\[Editor's note: the graphic file (photograph of the ski pass) was removed because it

cannot be represented in the RIS.\]

As described above, a reference photo was taken for the purpose of access control

as well as subsequently control photos of the complainant to the appropriate

turnstiles made. The reference and control photos were compared using a
Control person who had to log in to a password-protected system.

The reference photo was used until the ski pass expired

saved. The respective control photo was taken within 30 minutes after walking through

of the turnstile deleted.

Assessment of evidence: The findings that the complainant is the subject
has used the facility and that the ski passes are not transferable are based on the

undisputed information provided by the complainant and the submitted photos of the ski passes

from December 27th and 28th, 2019 and the ski pass number from December 29th

2019. The findings made on the handling of the control and reference photos
based on the credibly presented statements of the Respondent.

D. In legal terms it follows that:

1. ยง 1 para. 1 DSG stipulates that everyone, in particular with regard to respect

of his private and family life, right to secrecy of those concerning him
personal data, insofar as there is a legitimate interest in it.

The affected data of the complainant (photographs) are undisputed
personal data.

However, the fundamental right to data protection is not absolute, but may be

According to ยง 1 para. 2 DSG, a restriction of the right to secrecy in

vital interest of the person concerned or with his consent, otherwise

only to protect overriding legitimate interests of another, namely at

Interpretation of the right to secrecy must be taken into account in any case (cf. the

Notice of July 4, 2019, GZ: DSB-D123.652/0001-DSB/2019).

2. The complainant sometimes justified his complaint with the fact that he had no free

would have had a choice and to use the appendices of the Respondent in the
had to consent to data processing. He also explained that, as with e-mail

Registrations, an โopt-in procedureโ is used. That's what he's pointing to

Complainant states that consent to data processing within the meaning of Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit

DSGVO has not occurred voluntarily or can never occur voluntarily, since the
Use of the facilities is linked to the consent. According to recital 42 of

DSGVO should only then be assumed that consent is voluntary

considered if the data subject has a genuine and free choice and is able
to refuse consent without suffering any detriment. On this subject has

the OGH with a decision of August 31, 2018, according to which the coupling of the

consent to the processing of non-contractual personal data

the conclusion of a contract, the consent is generally not voluntary, unless in individual cases
special circumstances speak for their voluntariness (cf. OGH 31.8.2018, 6 Ob 140/18h,

RS0132251).

However, these considerations can be left aside, especially since the Respondent

The data processing in question expressly does not rely on the consent of the

3. The Respondent submits that the data on the basis of their predominant

can:

On the one hand, the processing must be carried out to protect the legitimate interests of the

Controller or a third party may be required, on the other hand, fundamental rights and

Fundamental freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data,
do not predominate (cf. on Art. 7 lit. f of Directive 95/46/EC the judgment of the ECJ of

24 November 2011, C-468/10 and C-469/10 \[ASNEF and FECEMD\] para. 38) (cf. the

Notice of the DSB from 4.7.2019, GZ: DSB-D123.652/0001-DSB/2019, RIS,
license plate recognition).,4. In this context it should be noted that the present

Data processing system essentially the same as those under the designation

"PHOTOCOMPARE - access control in connection with the use of personal (image) data
of ski lift card usersโ by the Data Protection Authority until the end of May 25, 2018 in

Data processing register in accordance with ยงยง 17 ff in conjunction with ยงยง 8 Para. 1 Z 4 (mainly authorized

interests), 8 Para. 3 Z 4 (performance of contract), 6 Para. 1 Z 5 and ยง 24 DSG 2000 registered

became.

In the course of these registrations, the existence of overriding legitimate interests

of those responsible affirmed, which is why the complainant's complaint is already settled
for this reason proves to be unfounded.

5. The details are as follows:

On the one hand, the complainant has a legitimate interest in keeping his information secret

to concede data, specifically his photograph. If the complainant submits
that sensitive personal data are affected by the image recording is dem

to counter that the processing of photographs only has a special category

of personal data if this differs from the definition of the term
"biometric data" is collected; in other words, if those with special technical

Means are processed that uniquely identify or authenticate a

natural person (DSGVO recital 51, see also Guidelines 3/2019 on
processing of personal data through video devices of the European

Data Protection Committee, version 2.0, page 17 para. 62). A simple digital photo that like

stored here for visual comparison purposes only and displayed on a screen

without being subjected to "special technical processes" therefore does not meet any
Fact of the processing of special data categories according to Art. 9 Para. 1 DSGVO.

On the other hand, the Respondent has a legitimate interest in it
recognize that their contractual partners behave in accordance with the contract and are therefore in their own interest

that compliance with the tariff conditions is monitored by controls in order to

unauthorized transfer of the ski pass, which - as stated - is expressly prohibited

Complainant recognizes - are more cost-effective than hourly tickets. Is to

day tickets. Accordingly, the complainant's argument that no

Proportionality is given, especially since almost twice the financial effort is required

be, to cover a day's skiing with hourly tickets, into emptiness. That from the
The system implemented by the Respondent is quite suitable to ensure effective access control and therefore to fulfill its purpose. Due to the

established facts that the acquisition of reference or control images only

two important hubs of the system takes place as well as the storage period only in this way

long as necessary, the measures taken turn out to be not
overly intrusive. Furthermore, the control is carried out exclusively by authorized persons

Employees, which is why the respective photographs do not have a significant group of recipients

get.

It must also be taken into account that according to recital 47 first sentence GDPR

reasonable expectations of a data subject regarding the use of their

data is to be considered as an important factor when weighing up interests
(cf. Heberlein in Ehmann/Selmayr, General Data Protection Regulation Commentary \[2018\] Art. 6

para. 28). It should be noted that access control systems, such as those used by the Respondent

starts, at least โ like the numerous registrations mentioned above in the former

data processing register - are now not uncommon (cf. the
Considerations of the data protection authority in the decision of July 4th, 2019 already cited, GZ: DSB-

D123.652/0001-DSB/2019, number plate recognition). In addition, the complainant had

infer that the complainant had already sent an email dated December 24, 2019 - hence

before using the Respondent's facilities - inquired whether the acquisition of a

ski pass without image capture is possible. If the complainant submits that

The answer given by the Respondent's employee was incorrect, since it was obviously possible
insisted on purchasing hourly tickets for which no photographs were taken

to counter that this was not part of the complainant's request.

Apparently he had only asked about ski passes and not about hourly tickets.

6. Based on the above, the Data Protection Authority concludes that

here the legitimate interests of the respondent are those of the complainant

predominate, which is why the Respondent is right to rely on its legitimate
Interests as the basis for the lawfulness of the processing in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1

lit. f GDPR. The Respondent therefore does not have the Appellant in its

violated the right to secrecy.

It had to be decided accordingly.
