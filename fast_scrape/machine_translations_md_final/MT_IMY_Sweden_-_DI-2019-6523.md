                               The Privacy Protection Authority states that Expressen Lifestyle AB (556025-4525),
                               has processed personal data in violation of Article 13.1 c of the data protection regulation
                               by stating an incorrect legal basis for the processing of the data subject
                               personal data during May 2018 until 4 June 2019.

                               The Privacy Protection Authority gives Expressen Lifestyle AB a reprimand according to article

                               Account of the supervisory matter

                               On June 4, 2019, the Swedish Privacy Protection Authority (IMY) began an investigation against Bonnier
                               Magazine and Brands AB. The supervision was not prompted by any complaint but aimed at

                               to review the consents obtained to fulfill the obligation to have one
                               legal basis according to Article 6.1 of the data protection regulation met the requirements of
                               the data protection regulation on voluntariness, information and clarity and that the legal
                               the basis clearly appears. Bonnier Magazine and Brands AB was in charge

                               introducing a checkbox on their web page along with the text. "I approve
                               the subscription terms. I hereby consent to the processing of personal data within
                               The Bonnier Group.”

                               In its statement to IMY, Bonnier Magazines and Brands has stated that the information in
                               the registration flow in the company's webshop, Magasinshoppen, was accidentally not updated
                               in the same way as on other web pages. In accordance with the data protection regulation

                               coming into force in 2018, Bonnier Magazine and Brands AB carried out an extensive
                               work which meant, among other things, that the company reassessed its legal basis for
                               Processing of personal data. Instead of consent, Bonnier Magazine founded and

                                Bonnier Magazines and Brands AB has been dissolved by merger on June 1, 2022 and
                                joined Expressen Lifestyle AB (556025-4525).

                                Justification of the decision

                                Of ch. 23 Section 1 of the Companies Act (2005:551) follows that the effects of a merger mean that
                                all assets and liabilities are taken over by another company at the time of the merger. The
                                The acquiring company is therefore responsible for the obligations that existed in the company that

                                taken over. In light of this, IMY makes the assessment that the acquiring company
                                after the time of the merger is a party to IMY's supervision matter and this supervision is therefore aimed at
                                against Expressen Lifestyle AB.

                                When a personal data controller collects personal data from a registered person shall
                                information regarding the legal basis for the processing appears, according to Article 13.1

                                c in the data protection regulation. The person in charge of personal data must, according to Article 12.1 i
                                data protection regulation take measures to provide this to the data subject
                                information in a concise, clear and clear, comprehensible and easily accessible form, with
                                the use of clear and unambiguous language. IMY considers that the text next to the checkbox on

                                the company's website "I accept the subscription terms. I hereby agree
                                personal data processing within the Bonnier Group", gives the registered impression that
                                the company's legal basis for processing personal data is consent according to article

                                6.1. a in the data protection regulation. The information text that was under the link with
                                the text of the subscription terms further reinforces this through wording
                                "When ordering, you agree that your personal data including email address,

                                mobile number for calls and text messages and any other digital
                                addresses, may be stored and used within Bonnier for digital services, marketing,
                                as well as for statistical and analysis purposes.”. Furthermore, information is provided in the same place

                                about the terms of consent including the right to withdraw consent.

                                The company has stated that the company does not base its processing on customers' personal data
                                on consent but mainly on the legal grounds agreement or justified

                                interest according to Article 6.1 b and f of the data protection regulation.

                                Against this background, IMY notes that the company has processed personal data in violation of

                                Article 13.1 c of the Data Protection Regulation by stating the wrong legal basis for
                                the processing of data subjects' personal data.

                                Choice of intervention

                                From article 58.2 and article 83.2 of the data protection regulation, it appears that IMY has

                                power to impose administrative penalty charges in accordance with Article 83.
                                Depending on the circumstances of the individual case, the administrative sanction
                                fees are imposed in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), which
                                for example injunctions and prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83.2 states which factors

                                which must be taken into account when deciding whether administrative penalty charges must be imposed and at
                                determining the size of the fee. If it is a question of a minor violation, IMY gets
                                as set out in recital 148 instead of imposing a penalty charge issue one

                                reprimand according to article 58.2 b. Consideration must be given to aggravating and mitigating factors
                                circumstances of the case, such as the nature, severity and duration of the infringement
                                as well as previous violations of relevance.

                                IMY notes the following relevant circumstances. Bonnier Magazines and Brands
                                AB immediately took measures when IMY began its supervision to update the Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: DI-2019-6523 3(3)
                                Date: 2023-06-26

                                the information in the registration flow on its website so that it registered accordingly
                                neither met with a consent request nor informational text about consent. Instead
                                the data subject is asked to accept the subscription terms (ie the terms of purchase)

                                and confirm that he has read the company's data protection policy. The website has not been
                                the page through which most of the company's customers signed their subscriptions.
                                The use of the web shop has therefore been limited, which is why only 1372 customers
                                signed their subscriptions via this website during the current time period. Further where

                                it was a mistake that the website was not updated in connection with the company's review
                                its routines in connection with the entry into force of the data protection association. IMY assesses that
                                the shortcoming in question did not have serious consequences for the data subjects. Against this one

                                background, IMY assesses that it is a question of such a minor violation in that sense
                                which is referred to in reason 148 which results in Expressen Lifestyle AB being given a reprimand
                                according to article 58.2 b of the data protection regulation for the identified deficiency.

                                This decision has been taken by the unit manager Catharina Fernquist after a presentation by
                                lawyer Ulrika Bergström.
