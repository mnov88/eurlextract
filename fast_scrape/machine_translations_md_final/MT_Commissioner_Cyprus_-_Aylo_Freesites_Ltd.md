Inspection under Article 58(1)(b) of the Regulation
My Office carried out an ex officio inspection at the premises of Aylo Freesites Ltd (formerly Mindgeek), which owns and operates world-renowned adult content websites. The inspection focused on issues such as cookie consent, processing of biometric data by a third party, data protection impact assessments and data processing agreements. Several breaches of the Regulation were found, leading to a prima facie decision with a compliance order. In summary, a lack of compliance with several key data protection principles was found, including accountability, transparency, lawfulness, data minimisation, storage limitation, data security and the necessity of a legal basis for processing. These gaps were considered significant because they occurred four years after the implementation of the Regulation. The Company responded to the instructions I gave it in the context of my Mandate and implemented corrective measures. I then issued a final Decision where, after taking into account the Company's compliance with my recommendations, I imposed an administrative penalty of a fine of €48,000 for violations of the Regulation that took place before its compliance. In addition, I imposed an administrative penalty of €10,400 for the illegal use of cookies. The Company paid the imposed fine within the deadline.
