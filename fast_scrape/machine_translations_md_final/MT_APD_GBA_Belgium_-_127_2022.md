Having regard to the documents in the file;

Complainant X, hereinafter "the complainant
Defendant: Medical Analysis Laboratory, represented by Sébastien Popijn, hereinafter
"the defendant"
Decision on the merits 127/2022 - 2/17
I. Facts and procedure
1. On 4 October 2019, the complainant filed a complaint against the respondent with the
Data Protection Authority.
2. The complainant suspects that the Medical Analysis Laboratory (hereafter: Medical
Analysis Laboratory) did not carry out a data protection impact assessment, did not
inform individuals correctly and processed special categories of data, in this case health-
related data, through an unsecured website.
The complainant states that he had several dealings with the Medical Analysis Laboratory in
the context of medical analyses. He was told that his doctor had electronic access to his
analysis results. However, he notes that the website of the medical analysis laboratory
contains a page for accessing medical analysis data under the name "Cyberlab" in an
unsecured HTTP protocol.
3. On 29 October 2019, the complaint was declared admissible by the Honours Department
under Sections 58 and 60 of the WOG and was referred to the Dispute Resolution
Chamber under Section 62(1) of the WOG.
4. On 27 November 2019, the Disputes Chamber decides to request an investigation by the
Inspectorate under sections 63, 2° and 94, 1° of the CPC.
5. On 29 November 2019, pursuant to Article 96 § 1 of the WOG, the Dispute Resolution
Chamber's request for an investigation is forwarded to the Inspectorate, together with
the complaint and the inventory of documents.
6. On September 8, 2021, the investigation of the Inspectorate is concluded, the report is
added to the file and the latter is transmitted by the Inspector General to the President
of the Litigation Chamber (art. 91, § 1 and § 2 of the WOG).
The report contains a number of findings relating to the subject matter of the complaint
and reaches the following findings:
1. The defendant may be considered a data controller
2. Insufficiently secure health data in violation of Articles 5.1(f), 24, 25 and 32 of the
AVG.
3. No data protection impact assessment in breach of Articles 35.1 and 35.3 of the
AVG.
4. Lack of information regarding data processing in violation of Articles 12 to 14 of
the AVG.
Decision on the merits 127/2022 - 3/17
7. On 21 September 2021, the Disputes Chamber decides under Article 95, §1, 1° and
Article 98 of the CPC that the case can be heard on the merits.
8. On 21 September 2021, the parties concerned will be notified by registered letter of the
provisions of Article 95 §2 and Article 98 of the CPC. They are also notified of the deadlines
for submitting their defences, in accordance with Article 99 of the CPC.
The deadline for receipt of the defendant's defences of reply is set at 2 November 2021,
that for the complainant's defences of reply at 23 November 2021 and finally that for the
defendant's defences of reply at 14 December 2021.
9. On 27 September 2021, the defendant requested a copy of the file (art. 95, §2, 3° of the
CPC), which was sent to her on 6 October 2021.
10. On 2 November 2021, the Dispute Resolution Chamber received the respondent's defences.
11. On 7 November 2021, the Disputes Chamber receives the complainant's defences to the
reply.
12. On 9 December 2021, the Dispute Resolution Chamber received the respondent's
defences.
13. On 25 July 2022, the Disputes Chamber notified the defendant of its intention to proceed
with the imposition of an administrative fine, as well as its amount in order to give the
defendant an opportunity to defend itself, before the sanction is effectively imposed.
14. On 15 August 2022, the Disputes Chamber received the respondent's response to the
intention to impose an administrative fine and the amount thereof.
II. Reason
II.1. Responsibility for processing
15. In its investigation report, the Inspectorate (hereinafter ID) determines that the
defendant can be considered a data controller. That position is initially disputed by the
defendant, but eventually accepted in its summary conclusions, following the
complainant's defences to its reply.
16. The Disputes Chamber decides that the defendant can be considered a data controller as
it determines the purposes and means of processing.
Decision on the merits 127/2022 - 4/17
17. It recalls, however, that in accordance with the principle of responsibility under Article 24
of the AVG, the defendant itself must be able to determine its responsibilities and
obligations under the AVG. Moreover, the Disputes Chamber adds that the changes in the
defendant's position during the course of the proceedings led to an apparent confusion in
its defence, since it initially argued, for example, that it was not obliged to carry out an
EIO because it is only a processor1 (and processors are not obliged to carry out an EIO)
and then stated that the failure to carry out an EIO was due to the fact that the
processing activities did not initially meet the criteria under which it was required to carry
out an EIO. 2 These views are clearly incompatible.
II.2. Interest of the complainant.
18. The file shows that the complainant's doctor had several medical analyses performed for
his patient by the defendant. Thus, the defendant processes or has processed the
complainant's personal data. The complainant therefore has an interest in appearing in
this file.
II.3. Finding 1: Inadequately secured health data (AVG Articles 5.1(f), 24, 25 and 32)
19. The investigation report shows that the defendant has a website. The homepage of this
website contains another page of the medical analysis laboratory under the heading
"Consult results", which links to the "Cyberlab", the defendant's online results server,
where doctors can consult the results and histories of their patients' analyses in real time.
20. In its first technology investigation report of 14 January 2021 (hereinafter: the first
technology report), the ID found that this website does not contain encryption (the
collected login and password are sent unencrypted), as it uses an "http" protocol instead of
an encrypted "https" protocol.
21. In this regard, ID notes that "Cyberlab's access site is thus not secure and is susceptible to
man-in-the-middle attacks. The login and password collected are transmitted unencrypted
\[...\]".
22. Following the answers provided by the respondent during the course of the
investigation, a follow-up report to the technological investigation report will be issued
on July 6, 2021
