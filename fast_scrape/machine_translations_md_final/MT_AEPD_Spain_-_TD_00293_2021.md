They were paid for and closed.

(...) Although it is true that the Spanish Data Protection Regulation provides that

when the laws applicable to certain treatments establish a regime
that affects the exercise of rights, the provisions of those will be followed;

already exposed during the processing of the procedure.

certain documents or other information associated with a business relationship,
labor, contractual or administrative”. The affected person must go to the authorities
competent since, as the Agency indicates, "the requested documents do not

are part of the access regulated in the data protection regulations as they are
documents linked to the contractual relationship between the parties.”

                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

dismissive. However, and despite the time that has elapsed, the Administration is

                                           III

Based on these rules and in consideration of the facts considered proven,
determined that:

agreement between the parties, and the claimant must go to the authorities
corresponding to your request.

Therefore, taking into account the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, that access to
said contractual data is independent of the right of access regulated in the
data protection regulations, and that the respondent has provided access to their
data, it is appropriate to dismiss the claim of rights.”

                                           IV

The purpose of this resolution is the reversal appeal filed on the date

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency, agreeing to the
dismissal of the claim initially filed.

In the arguments presented by the defendant, in relation to the appeal for
replacement presented by the appellant, ratifies what was already stated during the
processing of the procedure.

“(…) the right of access does not cover, in general, “obtaining a copy of

certain documents or other information associated with a business relationship,
labor, contractual or administrative”. The affected person must go to the authorities
competent since, as the Agency indicates, "the requested documents do not
are part of the access regulated in the data protection regulations as they are
documents linked to the contractual relationship between the parties.”

                                           IV

Article 4, Definitions, of the GDPR, provides that:

“For the purposes of this Regulation, the following shall be understood as:

1) "personal data": any information about an identified natural person or
identifiable ("the interested party"); An identifiable natural person shall be deemed to be any person
whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by
an identifier, such as a name, an identification number,

location, an online identifier or one or more elements of the identity
physical, physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social of said person;
(…)”

After reviewing the documentation in the file again, it is verified

that, taking into account that bank movements are data of a
personal and that must be supplied by the data controller, and given that
the information was partially provided, it is appropriate to uphold the present appeal of
replacement so that the claimed entity provides the claimant with the information
requested.
