2. The reprimand

   2.1.      The Commissioner has decided to issue a reprimand to
       Levales Solicitors LLP in respect of the following infringements of
       the UK GDPR:

   •  Article 32(1)(b) which states organisations should be able to
      “ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and

      resilience of processing systems and services.”

   •  Article 32(1)(d) which states “Taking into account the state of the

      art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and
      purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and
      severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the

      controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical
      and organisational measures to ensure a level of security
      appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate”

   2.2.      Our investigation found infringements in relation to the
       security requirements of the UK GDPR. The reasons for the

       Commissioner’s findings are set out below.

3. Article 32(1)(b)

   •  Levales Solicitors LLP were not ensuring the ongoing confidentiality
      of it’s processing systems as per Article 32(1)(b).

   3.1.      Levales Solicitors LLP did not have Multi-Factor Authentication
       (MFA) in place for the affected domain account. Levales relied on

       computer prompts for the management and strength of password
       and did not have a password policy in place at the time of the
       incident. The threat actor was able to gain access to the

       administrator level account via compromised account credentials.
       Levales Solicitors LLP have not been able to confirm how these
       were obtained.

   3.2.      MFA is a basic measure we would expect to see organisations
       processing personal data implement, regardless of risk of                                       The ICO existstoempoweryou throughinformation.

                                                              1           2
       processing. Guidance was available on both the ICO and NCSC ’s
       websites highlighting the importance of using MFA when storing

       sensitive data or data that could cause significant harm if
       compromised.

4. Article 32(1)(d)

   •  Levales Solicitors LLP did not implement appropriate organisational
      measures as per Article 32(1)(d).

   4.1.      Levales Solicitors LLP did not implement appropriate technical
       and organisational measures to ensure their systems were secure.

       Levales outsourced their IT management to a third party and were
       unaware of security measures in place at the time of the incident,

       such as detection, prevention, and monitoring. Levales had not
       reviewed if the technical measures associated with the contract,

       were appropriate for the personal data they were processing since
       the contract was first signed in 2012.

   4.2.      When using a managed service provider, the ICO would
       expect that contracts are reviewed and that the responsibilities

       within the contract are fully understood to ensure the security of
       the data being processed is upheld. The NCSC provides a 12 step

       guide, which highlights that any vulnerabilities within the contract
       between provider and controller, with regards to security, can be
       exploited easily by threat actors.

5. Remedial steps taken by Levales Solicitors LLP

   5.1.      The Commissioner has also considered and welcomes the
       remedial steps taken by Levales Solicitors LLP in the light of this

       incident. In particular the introduction of MFA for all user accounts,
       updated service contracts with third party providers, and a

       complete review of their existing systems to prioritise work and
       upgrades to the firewall.

6. Decision to issue a reprimand

    6.1.       Taking into account all of the circumstances of this case,
        including the remedial steps taken, the Commissioner has decided

        to issue a reprimand to Levales Solicitors LLP in relation to the
        infringements of Article 32(1)(b) and Article 32(1)(d) of the UK
                                 4
        GDPR set out above.
