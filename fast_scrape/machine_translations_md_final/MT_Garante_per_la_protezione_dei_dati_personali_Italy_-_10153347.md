WHEREAS

1. Introduction.

With a complaint filed pursuant to Article 77 of the Regulation against the Municipality of Agliana (hereinafter, the "Municipality"), Ms. XX, then an employee of the said Municipality, complained that:

City Council Resolution No. XX of XX, containing her personal data, including criminal convictions and offenses, was allegedly published in the "Transparent Administration" section of the Municipality's institutional website, resulting in the unlawful dissemination of the personal data in question; this was because, "despite the wording omitted, \[that resolution\] was clearly attributable to \[the complainant\], the role being indicated as XX";

On XX, the complainant, with an email message registered in the Municipality's registry no. XX, submitted a request to exercise the rights pursuant to Articles 12 and 15-22 of the Regulations, but received no response.

2. The preliminary investigation.

In response to a request for information from the Authority (see note prot. no. XX of XX), the Municipality, with a note dated XX (prot. no. XX), stated, in particular, that:

"with \[…\] certified email of XX \[…\] the Municipal Secretary responded to the request of XX with which the \[complainant\] requested a copy of City Council Resolution no. XX of XX";

"Resolution no. XX of XX does not contain any personal data of the \[complainant\]";

"Resolution no. XX of XX - adopted in secret session - on the basis of a Council question \[…\] concerns facts widely reported by the local press due to the seriousness of the allegations against the two individuals whose personal freedom was restricted, and for which the City Council meeting was required to be held in secret session in compliance with privacy regulations”;

“\[…\] no name (omitted) is indicated in the subject line \[of the resolution in question\], nor is any name included in the text of the resolution”;

“\[…\] Legislative Decree No. 33/2013 establishes that information published in the Transparent Administration section must remain accessible for at least five years \[…\]”;

“\[…\] the complainant, although no personal information about her is contained in the Transparent Administration resolution, believes that she could be recognized by her qualification as XX. This concern is also misplaced, as this qualification has varied over the years in the Municipality of Agliana, with XX in the XX, XX in the XX, XX in the XX, and XX in the XX. This fact excludes the possibility of his identification within the resolution, since "omissis" is correctly indicated in place of XX's name”;

“\[the resolution\] had to be necessarily adopted pursuant to art. 39 of the TUEL as it is “indispensable” for the performance of the institutional activity fulfilled, in this specific case, through the publication of anonymous data”;

“in relation to the exercise of rights \[…\], it is clear that this involves the use of a request form that contains clauses not relevant to any of the data specifically subject to the complaint. Such data, in fact, are not present in either the subject line or the text of resolution no. XX \[…\]. Therefore, it was not possible to provide any response other than transmitting resolution no. XX, as there was no correlation between the requested data and the data not processed in the resolution itself”;

“It is true that Article 12 of the \[Regulation\] requires the data controller \[…\] to provide the data subject with information relating to the request pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 of the \[Regulation\]. However, in the case in question, the data subject's requests were deemed manifestly unfounded and excessive. Therefore, the data controller, in perfect good faith, deemed that the transmission of resolution no. XX nevertheless constituted sufficient information for the applicant. Resolution no. XX does not, in fact, contain any personal data of the complainant, and therefore there was nothing subject to the necessary scrutiny to respond to each of the rights exercised with the request. The latter was then deemed confirmed with certified email no. XX of XX \[…\], to which Council resolution no. XX was attached, as the same official had already provided the same response (the same one) with ref. XX of XX \[…\]”.

With note dated XX (ref. no. XX), the Office, based on the information acquired, the investigations carried out, and the facts emerging from the preliminary investigation, notified the Municipality, pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 5, of the Code, of the initiation of proceedings for the adoption of the measures referred to in Article 58, paragraph 2, of the Regulation:

for having disclosed the personal data of the then XX and the complainant—including those relating to crimes (see the references to the arrest and the specific charges) and otherwise sensitive matters (see the reference to the complainant's dismissal from an XX and the alleged defamatory statements against other Municipal employees)—in a manner that did not comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency and in the absence of a legal basis, in violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter a), 6, and 10 of the Regulation, as well as Articles 2-ter and 2-octies of the Code;

for failing to respond to the request to exercise the rights of the data subject of XX within the maximum deadline set by Article 12, paragraph 3, of the Regulation, failing to inform the data subject of the reasons for non-compliance and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking judicial remedy, in violation of Article 12, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Regulation.

With the same note, the aforementioned data controller was invited to submit written statements or documents to the Data Protection Authority or to request a hearing with the Authority (Article 166, paragraphs 6 and 7, of the Code, as well as Article 18, paragraph 1, of Law No. 689 of 24 November 1981).

With a note of XX (ref. No. XX), the Municipality submitted a statement of defence, declaring, in particular, that:

"If personal data has already been made public by the press, the Its disclosure by the Authority does not constitute a "new" disclosure for the purposes of data protection legislation, since the information has already been made publicly available";

"\[…\] the publication of a City Council resolution referring to criminal proceedings – without any identification of the individual – is justified as necessary to ensure the transparency of administrative activity – the assessment of facts constituting criminal acts by its employees, which is a matter of public importance, aimed at preserving the integrity of public institutions and citizens' trust therein, in accordance with the principle of accountability of administrative action";

"\[…\] information relating to the arrest and charges against public officials is a matter of significant public importance";

"\[…\] Article 2-ter of the Code establishes that the dissemination of personal data by public bodies is permitted – as in this case – when necessary – as in this specific case – for the performance of institutional functions";

"\[…\] the role of the administration was not to reveal new or confidential information, but rather than responding to a need for clarity and transparency regarding facts already known to the public \[…\]”;

The interested party's requests to exercise her rights “were correctly deemed manifestly unfounded and excessive.”

During the hearing, requested pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 6, of the Code and held on XX (see minutes, file no. XX of XX), the Municipality stated, in particular, that:

“The Municipality acted in complete good faith, in the belief that the need to inform citizens of facts of extreme importance to the Authority and the underlying public interest in knowing such facts must prevail, following a necessary balancing exercise, over the data subjects' expectation of confidentiality, also taking into account that, as mentioned, the events involving the data subjects were widely known to the community”;

“Interpreted differently, any document published by the Authority, even if already disseminated and relating to known facts, would systematically imply a violation of data protection legislation. "personal";

"The publication of the resolution could not, in any case, have caused any harm to the interested parties, given that the matters in question were absolutely public knowledge";

"Regarding the failure to respond to the request for access submitted by the complainant, it must be considered that she had submitted multiple requests for access to the Authority, thus hindering administrative activity, to the extent that this could constitute an abuse of rights."

3. Outcome of the preliminary investigation.

3.1 Lawfulness of processing.

The processing of personal data must comply with applicable data protection legislation and, in particular, the provisions of the Regulation and the Code.

In order to ensure a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data, enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (see Article 1 of the Regulation), any processing of personal data must, in particular, comply with the principles set out in Article 5 of the Regulation and meet the conditions for lawfulness set out in Article 6 thereof (see Court of Justice of the European Union, judgment C‑621/22, 4 October 2024, paragraphs 26 and 27, and the precedents cited therein).

Within this framework, public bodies, even when acting in the performance of their duties as employers, may process employees' personal data if the processing is necessary, in general, for the management of the employment relationship and for fulfilling specific obligations or tasks under national legislation (Articles 6(1)(c), 9(2)(b), 9(4), and 88 of the Regulation) or "for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller" (Article 6(1)(e) of the Regulation).

European legislation provides that "Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing in accordance with paragraph 1(c) and (e) by determining more precisely specific requirements for processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing \[...\]" (Article 6(2) of the Regulation). In this regard, it is emphasized that processing operations consisting of the "dissemination" (Article 2-ter, paragraph 4, letter b), of the Code) of personal data are permitted only when the conditions set out in Article 2-ter of the Code are met.

Specifically, with regard to the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences, it is emphasized that this is permitted only if it occurs "under the control of official authority or if the processing is authorized by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects" (Article 10 of the Regulation; see also Article 2-octies of the Code).

As the Court of Justice of the European Union has repeatedly stated, the processing of data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures may, due to the particularly sensitive nature of such data, constitute a particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles 15 and 16 of the GDPR. 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Specifically regarding processing involving the public disclosure of such data by public bodies, the Court noted that "since such data relate to conduct that arouses the disapproval of society, granting access to such data may stigmatize the data subject and thus constitute a serious interference with his or her private or professional life" (see judgments C-740/22, Endemol Shine Finland, of 7 March 2024, para. 54, and C-439/19, Latvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty Points), of 22 June 2021, paras. 74, 75, and 112).

That said, following the investigation into the complaint, it emerged that the Municipality published City Council Resolution No. 111/2020 in the "Transparent Administration" section of its institutional website. XX of XX, which acknowledged, in relation to a council question, the circumstances that "a summary report of the discussion, which took place behind closed doors, was drawn up by the Secretary General, filed in the records, withheld from publication as required by art. 38, paragraph 5 of the Regulations for the functioning of the City Council" and that the councilors who asked the question declared themselves "partially satisfied with the response." The preamble to this resolution states, in particular, that "news of the arrest of XX and an XX on XX day has emerged in the main local newspapers and broadcasters" and that "the accusations that have emerged in the press refer to XX." In the section relating to the questions raised by the questioning councilors, it is also stated that "XX "omissis1" \[had\] been hit by a final judgment for XX's crime and had previously been fired by XX" and that "the XX newspaper of XX \[reported\] conversations between the councilors and XX "omissis2" \[...\] or XX "omissis1" regarding defamatory remarks against municipal employees."

Contrary to what the Municipality claimed during the investigation, the resolution in question contains personal data relating to both the then XX and the complainant.

In fact, “personal data” means “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’)”, with “an identifiable natural person being considered one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person” (Article 4, No. 1, of the Regulation). By “identification” “we mean not only the possibility of recovering the name and/or address of a person, but also the potential identifiability through identification, correlation and deduction” (Art. 29 Working Party, “Opinion 05/2014 on anonymization techniques”, WP216; see also provisions of 27 November 2024, no. 728, web doc. no. 10097324; 18 July 2023, no. 311, web doc. no. 9920562; 2 March 2023, no. 65, web doc. no. 9874480; 25 February 2021, no. 68, web doc. no. 9567429; 2 July 2020, nos. 118 and 119, web doc. 9440042 and no. 9440025).

In this case, despite the obscuring of the name and surname, the XX of the Municipality is certainly identifiable, both because of the temporal reference to the date of the arrest ("XX"), which allows tracing the office holder during that period (also due to the obligations to publish data relating to holders of political, administrative, management, or government positions, pursuant to Article 14, paragraph 1, Legislative Decree 33/2013) and because, as reported in the resolution and as confirmed by the Municipality during the investigation, the facts involving the then XX had been widely reported in the press.

For the same reason, namely, given the widespread media coverage of the matter, the complainant must also be considered identifiable. However, the reference to her is made using the feminine gender and mentioning specific circumstances surrounding her career ("XX \[...\] had previously been fired by an XX"), further restricting the possibility of identifying the complainant within the XX group, which, as stated by the Municipality, had a modest workforce in the XX group, with only XX employees in service.

Having clarified this, it is noted that, with regard to the legal basis that would have justified the disclosure of the personal data of the aforementioned interested parties, the Municipality's reference to Article 39 of Legislative Decree no. 18 of August 18, 2000, appears irrelevant. 267 (Consolidated Law on the Organization of Local Authorities), which, concerning the "Presidency of Municipal and Provincial Councils," does not provide—as does the aforementioned Legislative Decree No. 33 of March 14, 2013—anything regarding the deemed obligation to publish the resolution in question in the "Transparent Administration" section of the Institution's website.

In any case, it should be noted that the Guarantor has over time provided specific guidance to public administrations regarding the precautions to be taken for the dissemination of personal data on the Internet for the purposes of transparency and publicity of administrative action, in particular, in 2014, with the "Guidelines on the processing of personal data, including those contained in administrative acts and documents, carried out for publicity and transparency purposes on the web by public bodies and other obliged entities" (provision no. 243 of 15 May 2014, web doc. no. 3134436, part I and II, especially paragraph 3.b), clarifying, also through numerous decisions on individual cases adopted against specific administrations, that the presence of a publicity regime cannot lead to any automatic mechanism with respect to the online dissemination of personal data, nor a derogation from the principles regarding the protection of personal data, as confirmed by the personal data protection system contained in the Regulation, in light of which it is required that the data controller must "implement technical and organizational measures adequate to ensure that, by default, only personal data necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed” and must be “able to demonstrate” – in light of the “accountability” principle – that it has done so pursuant to Articles 5, paragraph 2, 24, and 25, paragraph 2, of the Regulation (see, among others, Decision No. 287 of 6 July 2023, web doc. No. 9920145 and the provisions cited therein).

In particular, in numerous decisions regarding the obligations arising from Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Regulation, the controller must be able to demonstrate that the data subject has complied with the obligations arising from Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Regulation. 124 of Legislative Decree 267/2000, regarding the publication of municipal resolutions on the public notice board, the Guarantor reiterated that all the limits set by the principles of personal data protection also apply to the publication of documents or resolutions on the online public notice board, taking into account first of all the prior verification of the existence of suitable conditions for the lawfulness of the online dissemination of the personal data contained therein (see, among others, provision of 15 September 2022, no. 299, web doc. no. 9815665 and provision of 25 February 2021, no. 68, web doc. 9567429).

Contrary to the aforementioned instructions provided over time by the Guarantor, the Municipality published City Council Resolution No. XX of 2020 in a manner that still allowed the identification of the data subjects, even though their names and surnames were not expressly mentioned.

Nor is it relevant, in this regard, that the events in question were already known in whole or in part due to the publication of related press articles. Public bodies may, in fact, disclose personal data only where permitted by a law, regulation, or general administrative act (see the aforementioned Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter a), and 6, paragraph 1, letters c) and e), and paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Regulation, and 2-ter of the Code, as well as, with regard to personal data relating to crimes, Articles 10 of the Regulation and 2-octies of the Code), regardless of whether the same data has already been disclosed elsewhere, even by the same interested party, for other purposes (see, among others, provision no. 418 of December 15, 2022, web doc. no. 9855545; no. 45 of February 10, 2022, web doc. no. 9751549, and the precedents cited therein).

In light of all the foregoing considerations, it must be concluded that the Municipality disclosed the personal data of the then XX and the complainant—including those relating to crimes (see the references to the arrest and the specific charges) and otherwise sensitive matters (see the reference to the complainant's dismissal from an XX and the alleged defamatory statements against other employees of the Municipality)—in a manner that does not comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency and in the absence of a legal basis, in violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter a), 6, and 10 of the Regulation, as well as Articles 2-ter and 2-octies of the Code.

3.2. Failure to respond to a data subject's request to exercise their rights.

Article 12 of the Regulation requires the controller to provide the data subject with information free of charge on action taken on a request pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 of the Regulation without undue delay and, in any event, within one month of receipt of the request (paragraph 3).

If the controller does not take action on the data subject's request, it must inform the data subject without delay, and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request, of the reasons for its failure to act and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy (paragraph 4).

In this case, the complainant had submitted to the Municipality, on XX, a request to exercise her rights as an interested party, recorded in the Municipality's registry of XX (no. XX). Specifically, she requested:

Pursuant to Article 15 of the Regulations, she requested access to her personal data contained "in the summary minutes drawn up by the Secretary General filed with the Municipality, referred to in City Council Resolution No. XX of XX" and "in the audio recording of City Council No. XX of XX," as well as, "with reference to City Council meeting No. XX of XX," to obtain the information referred to in letters a) to h) of Article 15 of the Regulations;

Pursuant to Article 21 of the Regulations, she objected to the processing consisting in the disclosure of her personal data following the publication of City Council Resolution No. XX of XX in the "Transparent Administration" section of the Institution's website.

Following the investigation into the complaint, it was found that the Municipality neither responded to the aforementioned request nor informed the complainant of the reasons for its non-compliance and of the possibility of filing a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking judicial review within thirty days of receiving the request.

In this regard, the Municipality's defense argument that the complainant's requests "were deemed manifestly unfounded and excessive" cannot be accepted, as the Municipality "deemed that the transmission of Resolution No. XX constituted sufficient information for the applicant."

In this regard, it should be noted that, pursuant to Article 12, paragraph 5 of the Regulation, "where requests from the data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may: (a) charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested; or (b) refuse to act on the request." Even in cases where the controller decides to refuse to act on the request, its decision must, however, be communicated to the data subject within a maximum of thirty days, informing him or her of the reasons for non-compliance and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy, as provided for in Article 12, paragraph 4, of the Regulation (see paragraph 193 of the "Guidelines 1/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access", adopted by the European Data Protection Board on 28 March 2023). In this case, however, the Municipality did not provide any response to the complainant.

Moreover, note prot. no. XX of XX, with which, in the Municipality's opinion, the interested party's request to exercise her rights was fulfilled in good faith by forwarding a copy of "resolution no. XX" (already sent with note prot. XX of XX), refers to the "note \[of the complainant\] of XX prot. no. XX," which, as is evident from the subject of the Municipality's response, concerns "access to documents," thus carried out pursuant to Articles 22 et seq. of Law 241/1990, and not, instead, the exercise of the rights under Articles 15-22 of the Regulation, which the complainant had exercised with a subsequent note of XX.

In light of the foregoing considerations, it must be concluded that the Municipality failed to respond to the request to exercise the rights of the data subject of XX within the maximum deadline set by Article 12, paragraph 3, of the Regulation, failing to inform the data subject of the reasons for its failure to comply and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking judicial remedy. Therefore, it acted in violation of Article 12, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Regulation.

4. Conclusions.

In light of the above considerations, it is concluded that the statements made by the data controller during the investigation—the veracity of which may be held accountable pursuant to Article 12, paragraph 3, of the Regulation—are not accurate. 168 of the Code, although worthy of consideration, do not overcome the concerns notified by the Office with the notice initiating the proceedings and are insufficient to allow the dismissal of this proceeding, since none of the cases provided for by Article 11 of the Guarantor Regulation No. 1/2019 apply.

The Office's preliminary assessments are therefore confirmed and the Municipality's processing of personal data is found to be unlawful, having processed the personal data of the complainant and another interested party, in violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter a), 6, 10, and 12, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Regulation, as well as Articles 2-ter and 2-octies of the Code.

\[OMISSIS\]

5. Corrective measures (Article 58, paragraph 2, letters c) and f), of the Regulation).

Given that the documentation does not provide evidence that the Municipality has taken steps to put an end to and remedy the alleged violations, it is necessary to order the Municipality, pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, letters c) and f), of the Regulation, where it has not already done so, to immediately cease the online dissemination of the data subjects' personal data and to respond to the complainant's request to exercise her rights, if she still has an interest in doing so, within thirty days of notification of this order.

Pursuant to Articles 58, paragraph 1, letter a), of the Regulation and 157 of the Code, the Municipality must inform the Authority, providing adequately documented feedback, within thirty days of notification of this order, of the steps taken to implement the above-mentioned order pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, letters c) and f), of the Regulation.

\[REDACTED\]

Finally, it is noted that the conditions set forth in Article 17 of Regulation No. 1/2019 are met.

NOW CONSIDERING ALL THE ABOVE, THE AUTHORITY

declares, pursuant to Article 57, paragraph 1, letter f), of the Regulation, the unlawfulness of the processing carried out by the Municipality of Agliana due to violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter a), 6, 10, and 12, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Regulation, as well as Articles 2-ter and 2-octies of the Code, in the terms set out in the grounds;

It shall also provide the Data Protection Authority, within the same deadline, pursuant to Articles 58, paragraph 1, letter a), of the Regulation and 157 of the Code, with adequately documented feedback regarding the initiatives undertaken to implement the order;

WHEREAS

1. Introduction.

With a complaint filed pursuant to Article 77 of the Regulation against the Municipality of Agliana (hereinafter, the "Municipality"), Ms. XX, then an employee of the said Municipality, complained that:

City Council Resolution No. XX of XX, containing her personal data, including criminal convictions and offenses, was allegedly published in the "Transparent Administration" section of the Municipality's institutional website, resulting in the unlawful dissemination of the personal data in question; this was because, "despite the wording omitted, \[that resolution\] was clearly attributable to \[the complainant\], the role being indicated as XX";

On XX, the complainant, with an email message registered in the Municipality's registry no. XX, submitted a request to exercise the rights pursuant to Articles 12 and 15-22 of the Regulations, but received no response.

2. The preliminary investigation.

In response to a request for information from the Authority (see note prot. no. XX of XX), the Municipality, with a note dated XX (prot. no. XX), stated, in particular, that:

"with \[…\] certified email of XX \[…\] the Municipal Secretary responded to the request of XX with which the \[complainant\] requested a copy of City Council Resolution no. XX of XX";

"Resolution no. XX of XX does not contain any personal data of the \[complainant\]";

"Resolution no. XX of XX - adopted in secret session - on the basis of a Council question \[…\] concerns facts widely reported by the local press due to the seriousness of the allegations against the two individuals whose personal freedom was restricted, and for which the City Council meeting was required to be held in secret session in compliance with privacy regulations”;

“\[…\] no name (omitted) is indicated in the subject line \[of the resolution in question\], nor is any name included in the text of the resolution”;

“\[…\] Legislative Decree No. 33/2013 establishes that information published in the Transparent Administration section must remain accessible for at least five years \[…\]”;

“\[…\] the complainant, although no personal information about her is contained in the Transparent Administration resolution, believes that she could be recognized by her qualification as XX. This concern is also misplaced, as this qualification has varied over the years in the Municipality of Agliana, with XX in the XX, XX in the XX, XX in the XX, and XX in the XX. This fact excludes the possibility of his identification within the resolution, since "omissis" is correctly indicated in place of XX's name”;

“\[the resolution\] had to be necessarily adopted pursuant to art. 39 of the TUEL as it is “indispensable” for the performance of the institutional activity fulfilled, in this specific case, through the publication of anonymous data”;

“in relation to the exercise of rights \[…\], it is clear that this involves the use of a request form that contains clauses not relevant to any of the data specifically subject to the complaint. Such data, in fact, are not present in either the subject line or the text of resolution no. XX \[…\]. Therefore, it was not possible to provide any response other than transmitting resolution no. XX, as there was no correlation between the requested data and the data not processed in the resolution itself”;

“It is true that Article 12 of the \[Regulation\] requires the data controller \[…\] to provide the data subject with information relating to the request pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 of the \[Regulation\]. However, in the case in question, the data subject's requests were deemed manifestly unfounded and excessive. Therefore, the data controller, in perfect good faith, deemed that the transmission of resolution no. XX nevertheless constituted sufficient information for the applicant. Resolution no. XX does not, in fact, contain any personal data of the complainant, and therefore there was nothing subject to the necessary scrutiny to respond to each of the rights exercised with the request. The latter was then deemed confirmed with certified email no. XX of XX \[…\], to which Council resolution no. XX was attached, as the same official had already provided the same response (the same one) with ref. XX of XX \[…\]”.

With note dated XX (ref. no. XX), the Office, based on the information acquired, the investigations carried out, and the facts emerging from the preliminary investigation, notified the Municipality, pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 5, of the Code, of the initiation of proceedings for the adoption of the measures referred to in Article 58, paragraph 2, of the Regulation:

for having disclosed the personal data of the then XX and the complainant—including those relating to crimes (see the references to the arrest and the specific charges) and otherwise sensitive matters (see the reference to the complainant's dismissal from an XX and the alleged defamatory statements against other Municipal employees)—in a manner that did not comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency and in the absence of a legal basis, in violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter a), 6, and 10 of the Regulation, as well as Articles 2-ter and 2-octies of the Code;

for failing to respond to the request to exercise the rights of the data subject of XX within the maximum deadline set by Article 12, paragraph 3, of the Regulation, failing to inform the data subject of the reasons for non-compliance and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking judicial remedy, in violation of Article 12, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Regulation.

With the same note, the aforementioned data controller was invited to submit written statements or documents to the Data Protection Authority or to request a hearing with the Authority (Article 166, paragraphs 6 and 7, of the Code, as well as Article 18, paragraph 1, of Law No. 689 of 24 November 1981).

With a note of XX (ref. No. XX), the Municipality submitted a statement of defence, declaring, in particular, that:

"If personal data has already been made public by the press, the Its disclosure by the Authority does not constitute a "new" disclosure for the purposes of data protection legislation, since the information has already been made publicly available";

"\[…\] the publication of a City Council resolution referring to criminal proceedings – without any identification of the individual – is justified as necessary to ensure the transparency of administrative activity – the assessment of facts constituting criminal acts by its employees, which is a matter of public importance, aimed at preserving the integrity of public institutions and citizens' trust therein, in accordance with the principle of accountability of administrative action";

"\[…\] information relating to the arrest and charges against public officials is a matter of significant public importance";

"\[…\] Article 2-ter of the Code establishes that the dissemination of personal data by public bodies is permitted – as in this case – when necessary – as in this specific case – for the performance of institutional functions";

"\[…\] the role of the administration was not to reveal new or confidential information, but rather than responding to a need for clarity and transparency regarding facts already known to the public \[…\]”;

the interested party's requests to exercise her rights “were correctly deemed manifestly unfounded and excessive.”

During the hearing, requested pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 6, of the Code and held on XX (see minutes, file no. XX of XX), the Municipality stated, in particular, that:

"The Municipality acted in complete good faith, in the belief that the need to inform citizens of facts of extreme importance to the Authority and the underlying public interest in knowing such facts must prevail, following a necessary balancing exercise, over the data subjects' expectation of confidentiality, also taking into account that, as mentioned, the events involving the data subjects were widely known to the public."

"Interpreted differently, any document published by the Authority, even if already disclosed and relating to known facts, would systematically imply a violation of personal data protection legislation."

"The publication of the resolution could not, in any case, cause any harm to the data subjects, given that the events in question were absolutely in the public domain."

"Regarding the failure to respond to the request for access submitted by the complainant, it should be noted that the complainant had submitted multiple requests for access to the Entity, thus hindering the administrative process, to the extent that this could constitute an abuse of rights."

3. Outcome of the investigation.

3.1 Lawfulness of processing.

The processing of personal data must comply with applicable data protection legislation and, in particular, the provisions of the Regulation and the Code.

In order to ensure a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data, enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (see Article 1 of the Regulation), any processing of personal data must, in particular, comply with the principles set out in Article 5 of the Regulation and meet the conditions for lawfulness set out in Article 11 of the Regulation. 6 of the same (see Court of Justice of the European Union, judgment C-621/22, 4 October 2024, paragraphs 26 and 27, and the precedents cited therein).

In this framework, public bodies, even when acting in the performance of their duties as employers, may process workers' personal data if the processing is necessary, in general, for the management of the employment relationship and to fulfill specific obligations or tasks under national sector-specific regulations (Articles 6(1)(c), 9(2)(b), 9(4), and 88 of the Regulation) or "for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller" (Article 6(1)(e) of the Regulation).

European legislation provides that "Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing in accordance with paragraph 1, points (c) and (e), by determining more precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing \[...\]" (Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Regulation). In this regard, it is noted that processing operations consisting of the "dissemination" (Article 2-ter, paragraph 4, letter (b) of the Code) of personal data are permitted only when the conditions set out in Article 2-ter of the Code are met.

Specifically, with regard to the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences, it is noted that this is permitted only if it occurs "under the control of official authority or if the processing is authorised by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects" (Article 10 of the Regulation; see also Article 2-octies of the Code).

As the Court of Justice of the European Union has repeatedly stated, the processing of data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures may, due to the particular sensitivity of such data, constitute a particularly serious interference with the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. With specific regard to processing involving the public disclosure of such data by public bodies, the Court noted that "since such data relate to conduct that arouses the disapproval of society, granting access to such data may lead to the stigmatization of the data subject and thus constitute a serious interference in his or her private or professional life" (see judgments C-740/22, Endemol Shine Finland, of 7 March 2024, para. 54, and C-439/19, Latvijas Republikas Saeima (Penalty Points), of 22 June 2021, paras. 74, 75, and 112).

That said, following the investigation into the complaint, it emerged that the Municipality published City Council Resolution No. 111/2020 in the "Transparent Administration" section of its institutional website. XX of XX, which acknowledged, in relation to a council question, the circumstances that "a summary report of the discussion, which took place behind closed doors, was drawn up by the Secretary General, filed in the records, withheld from publication as required by art. 38, paragraph 5 of the Regulations for the functioning of the City Council" and that the councilors who asked the question declared themselves "partially satisfied with the response." The preamble to this resolution states, in particular, that "news of the arrest of XX and an XX on XX day has emerged in the main local newspapers and broadcasters" and that "the accusations that have emerged in the press refer to XX." In the section relating to the questions raised by the questioning councilors, it is also stated that "XX "omissis1" \[had\] been hit by a final judgment for XX's crime and had previously been fired by XX" and that "the XX newspaper of XX \[reported\] conversations between the councilors and XX "omissis2" \[...\] or XX "omissis1" regarding defamatory remarks against municipal employees."

Contrary to what the Municipality claimed during the investigation, the resolution in question contains personal data relating to both the then XX and the complainant.

In fact, “personal data” means “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’)”, with “an identifiable natural person being considered one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person” (Article 4, No. 1, of the Regulation). By “identification” “we mean not only the possibility of recovering the name and/or address of a person, but also the potential identifiability through identification, correlation and deduction” (Art. 29 Working Party, “Opinion 05/2014 on anonymization techniques”, WP216; see also provisions of 27 November 2024, no. 728, web doc. no. 10097324; 18 July 2023, no. 311, web doc. no. 9920562; 2 March 2023, no. 65, web doc. no. 9874480; 25 February 2021, no. 68, web doc. no. 9567429; 2 July 2020, nos. 118 and 119, web doc. 9440042 and no. 9440025).

In this case, despite the obscuring of the name and surname, the XX of the Municipality is certainly identifiable, both because of the temporal reference to the date of the arrest ("XX"), which allows tracing the office holder during that period (also due to the obligations to publish data relating to holders of political, administrative, management, or government positions, pursuant to Article 14, paragraph 1, Legislative Decree 33/2013) and because, as reported in the resolution and as confirmed by the Municipality during the investigation, the facts involving the then XX had been widely reported in the press.

For the same reason, namely, given the widespread media coverage of the matter, the complainant must also be considered identifiable. However, the reference to her is made using the feminine gender and mentioning specific circumstances surrounding her career ("XX \[...\] had previously been fired by an XX"), further restricting the possibility of identifying the complainant within the XX group, which, as stated by the Municipality, had a modest workforce in the XX group, with only XX employees in service.

Having clarified this, it is noted that, with regard to the legal basis that would have justified the disclosure of the personal data of the aforementioned interested parties, the Municipality's reference to Article 39 of Legislative Decree no. 18 of August 18, 2000, appears irrelevant. 267 (Consolidated Law on the Organization of Local Authorities), which, concerning the "Presidency of Municipal and Provincial Councils," does not provide—as does the aforementioned Legislative Decree No. 33 of March 14, 2013—anything regarding the deemed obligation to publish the resolution in question in the "Transparent Administration" section of the Institution's website.

In any case, it should be noted that the Guarantor has over time provided specific guidance to public administrations regarding the precautions to be taken for the dissemination of personal data on the Internet for the purposes of transparency and publicity of administrative action, in particular, in 2014, with the "Guidelines on the processing of personal data, including those contained in administrative acts and documents, carried out for publicity and transparency purposes on the web by public bodies and other obliged entities" (provision no. 243 of 15 May 2014, web doc. no. 3134436, part I and II, especially paragraph 3.b), clarifying, also through numerous decisions on individual cases adopted against specific administrations, that the presence of a publicity regime cannot lead to any automatic mechanism with respect to the online dissemination of personal data, nor a derogation from the principles regarding the protection of personal data, as confirmed by the personal data protection system contained in the Regulation, in light of which it is required that the data controller must "implement technical and organizational measures adequate to ensure that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed” and must be “able to demonstrate” – in light of the “accountability” principle – that it has done so pursuant to Articles 5, paragraph 2, 24 and 25, paragraph 2, of the Regulation (see, among others, provision no. 287 of 6 July 2023, web doc. no. 9920145 and the provisions cited therein).

Specifically, in numerous decisions regarding the obligations arising from Article 124 of Legislative Decree 267/2000, regarding the publication of municipal resolutions on the public notice board, the Authority has reiterated that all the limitations set forth by the principles of personal data protection also apply to the publication of documents or resolutions on the online public notice board, taking into account, first and foremost, the prior verification of the existence of suitable conditions for the lawfulness of the online dissemination of the personal data contained therein (see, among others, Decision No. 299 of September 15, 2022, web doc. No. 9815665 and Decision No. 68 of February 25, 2021, web doc. 9567429).

Contrary to the aforementioned guidance provided over time by the Authority, the Municipality has instead published City Council Resolution No. XX of XX in a manner that still allows the identification of the data subjects, even if their first and last names are not expressly mentioned.

It is also relevant, in this regard, that the events in question were already known in whole or in part due to the publication of related press articles. Public bodies may, in fact, disclose personal data only where permitted by a law, regulation, or general administrative act (see the aforementioned Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter a), and 6, paragraph 1, letters c) and e), and paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Regulation, and 2-ter of the Code, as well as, with regard to personal data relating to crimes, Articles 10 of the Regulation and 2-octies of the Code), regardless of whether the same data has already been disclosed elsewhere, even by the same interested party, for other purposes (see, among others, provision no. 418 of December 15, 2022, web doc. no. 9855545; no. 45 of February 10, 2022, web doc. no. 9751549, and the precedents cited therein).

In light of all the foregoing considerations, it must be concluded that the Municipality disclosed the personal data of the then XX and the complainant—including those relating to crimes (see the references to the arrest and the specific charges) and otherwise sensitive matters (see the reference to the complainant's dismissal from an XX and the alleged defamatory statements against other employees of the Municipality)—in a manner that does not comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency and in the absence of a legal basis, in violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter a), 6, and 10 of the Regulation, as well as Articles 2-ter and 2-octies of the Code.

3.2. Failure to respond to a data subject's request to exercise their rights.

Article 12 of the Regulation requires the controller to provide the data subject with information free of charge on action taken on a request pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 of the Regulation without undue delay and, in any event, within one month of receipt of the request (paragraph 3).

If the controller does not take action on the data subject's request, it must inform the data subject without delay, and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request, of the reasons for its failure to act and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy (paragraph 4).

In this case, the complainant had submitted to the Municipality, on XX, a request to exercise her rights as an interested party, recorded in the Municipality's registry of XX (no. XX). Specifically, she requested:

Pursuant to Article 15 of the Regulations, she requested access to her personal data contained "in the summary minutes drawn up by the Secretary General filed with the Municipality, referred to in City Council Resolution No. XX of XX" and "in the audio recording of City Council No. XX of XX," as well as, "with reference to City Council meeting No. XX of XX," to obtain the information referred to in letters a) to h) of Article 15 of the Regulations;

Pursuant to Article 21 of the Regulations, she objected to the processing consisting in the disclosure of her personal data following the publication of City Council Resolution No. XX of XX in the "Transparent Administration" section of the Institution's website.

Following the investigation into the complaint, it was found that the Municipality neither responded to the aforementioned request nor informed the complainant of the reasons for its non-compliance and of the possibility of filing a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking judicial review within thirty days of receiving the request.

In this regard, the Municipality's defense argument that the complainant's requests "were deemed manifestly unfounded and excessive" cannot be accepted, as the Municipality "deemed that the transmission of Resolution No. XX constituted sufficient information for the applicant."

In this regard, it should be noted that, pursuant to Article 12, paragraph 5 of the Regulation, "where requests from the data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may: (a) charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested; or (b) refuse to act on the request." Even in cases where the controller decides to refuse to act on the request, its decision must, however, be communicated to the data subject within a maximum of thirty days, informing him or her of the reasons for non-compliance and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy, as provided for in Article 12, paragraph 4, of the Regulation (see paragraph 193 of the "Guidelines 1/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access", adopted by the European Data Protection Board on 28 March 2023). In this case, however, the Municipality did not provide any response to the complainant.

Moreover, note prot. no. XX of XX, with which, in the Municipality's opinion, the interested party's request to exercise her rights was fulfilled in good faith by forwarding a copy of "resolution no. XX" (already sent with note prot. XX of XX), refers to the "note \[of the complainant\] of XX prot. no. XX," which, as is evident from the subject of the Municipality's response, concerns "access to documents," thus carried out pursuant to Articles 22 et seq. of Law 241/1990, and not, instead, the exercise of the rights under Articles 15-22 of the Regulation, which the complainant had exercised with a subsequent note of XX.

In light of the foregoing considerations, it must be concluded that the Municipality failed to respond to the request to exercise the rights of the data subject of XX within the maximum deadline set by Article 12, paragraph 3, of the Regulation, failing to inform the data subject of the reasons for its failure to comply and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking judicial remedy. Therefore, it acted in violation of Article 12, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Regulation.

4. Conclusions.

In light of the above considerations, it is concluded that the statements made by the data controller during the investigation—the veracity of which may be held accountable pursuant to Article 12, paragraph 3, of the Regulation—are not accurate. 168 of the Code, although worthy of consideration, do not overcome the concerns notified by the Office with the notice initiating the proceedings and are insufficient to allow the dismissal of this proceeding, since none of the cases provided for by Article 11 of the Guarantor Regulation No. 1/2019 apply.

The Office's preliminary assessments are therefore confirmed and the Municipality's processing of personal data is found to be unlawful, having processed the personal data of the complainant and another interested party, in violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter a), 6, 10, and 12, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Regulation, as well as Articles 2-ter and 2-octies of the Code.

\[OMISSIS\]

5. Corrective measures (Article 58, paragraph 2, letters c) and f), of the Regulation).

Given that the documentation does not provide evidence that the Municipality has taken steps to put an end to and remedy the alleged violations, it is necessary to order the Municipality, pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, letters c) and f), of the Regulation, where it has not already done so, to immediately cease the online dissemination of the data subjects' personal data and to respond to the complainant's request to exercise her rights, if she still has an interest in doing so, within thirty days of notification of this order.

Pursuant to Articles 58, paragraph 1, letter a), of the Regulation and 157 of the Code, the Municipality must inform the Authority, providing adequately documented feedback, within thirty days of notification of this order, of the steps taken to implement the above-mentioned order pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, letters c) and f), of the Regulation.

\[REDACTED\]

Finally, it is noted that the conditions set forth in Article 17 of Regulation No. 1/2019 are met.

NOW CONSIDERING ALL THE ABOVE, THE AUTHORITY

declares, pursuant to Article 57, paragraph 1, letter f), of the Regulation, the unlawfulness of the processing carried out by the Municipality of Agliana due to violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter a), 6, 10, and 12, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Regulation, as well as Articles 2-ter and 2-octies of the Code, in the terms set out in the grounds;

\[REDACTED\]

It shall also provide the Data Protection Authority, within the same deadline, pursuant to Articles 58, paragraph 1, letter a), of the Regulation and 157 of the Code, with adequately documented feedback regarding the initiatives undertaken to implement the order;

ORDERS

Pursuant to Articles 78 of the Regulation, 152 of the Code, and 10 of Legislative Decree No. 150/2011, an appeal against this provision may be lodged before the ordinary judicial authority, under penalty of inadmissibility, within thirty days of the date of notification of the provision itself, or within sixty days if the appellant resides abroad.
