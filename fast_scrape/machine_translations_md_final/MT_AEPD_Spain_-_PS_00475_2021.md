Regarding deficiencies in the information provided to users whose data is

Article 5 of the RGPD regarding the principles that must govern data processing

ne:

        "The personal data will be:

         a) treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party

("Legality, loyalty and transparency") "

Manifestation of the principle of transparency is the obligation incumbent on the

data controllers to inform, in the terms of article 13 of the RGPD, to the
owner of personal data when they are obtained directly from the interested party:

      "one. When personal data relating to him are obtained from an interested party, the

      2. In addition to the information mentioned in section 1, the person responsible for the
treatment will facilitate the interested party, at the moment in which the personal data is obtained

sonal, the following information necessary to guarantee data processing
loyal and transparent:

      a) the period during which the personal data will be kept or, when it is not
possible, the criteria used to determine this deadline;

      b) the existence of the right to request the data controller access to

the personal data relating to the interested party, and its rectification or deletion, or the limitation-
tion of their treatment, or to oppose the treatment, as well as the right to portability

      c) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter a), or the
Article 9, paragraph 2, letter a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent in
at any time, without affecting the legality of the treatment based on the

feeling prior to withdrawal;

      d) the right to file a claim with a supervisory authority;

      e) if the communication of personal data is a legal or contractual requirement, or

a necessary requirement to sign a contract, and if the interested party is obliged to
provide personal data and are informed of the possible consequences of not

      3. When the person responsible for the treatment plans the subsequent treatment of data

personal coughs for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, will provide
to the interested party, prior to said subsequent treatment, information about that other
purpose and any additional relevant information pursuant to section 2.

      4. The provisions of sections 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply when and in the
to the extent that the interested party already has the information. "

In this sense, Recital 60 of the RGPD says that “The principles of treatment
loyal and transparent require that the interested party be informed of the existence of the

The form used violates article 13 of the RGPD conduct that is subsumable
in article 83.5 of the RGPD which provides: “Violations of the provisions
The following will be sanctioned in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines of

EUR 20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, of an equal amount
equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover for the financial year

above, opting for the one with the highest amount:

        (...)

    b) The rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22; "

For the mere purposes of prescription, article 74.1.a) of the LOPDGDD considers
as slight “a) Failure to comply with the principle of transparency of information or the

right to information of the affected person for not providing all the information required by the
Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. ”. The statute of limitations for the
light fractions provided for in Organic Law 3/2018 is one year.

Article 58.2 of the RGPD establishes:

      “Each supervisory authority shall have all the following corrective powers

In the present case, taking into account the special circumstances that concur and conform to

Recital 148 of the RGPD, according to which when there is a minor infringement
instead of the fine, the warning sanction may be imposed, in this
phase of the procedure, and without prejudice to the result of the investigation, it is estimated that

for the infringement of article 13 of the RGPD, it is necessary to impose the sanction of warning
to; taking into account that the privacy policy is very complete, although they have

omitted two pieces of information: the possibility of exercising the right of portability and
treatment, and the right to file a claim with the authority of
control.

Likewise, in the event that the resolution goes in the same direction as this agreement,
It would be appropriate to impose the corrective measure described in article 58.2.d) RGPD and order

tell the respondent to prepare a data collection form that offers to the
affected all the information that is obliged to provide under article 13 of the

GDPR.

The investigated entity legitimizes the processing of your data in the consent of the in-
interested party, in which the treatment is necessary to execute a contract entered into with

the user, and that the treatment is necessary to comply with a legal obligation per-

of “a legal obligation”, and the AEPD's Legal Office indicates that the sentiment
do of the expression "legal obligation" contained in article 6.1.c) of the RGPD is equivalent,

in the Spanish regulation of data protection, to the obligation established in a law
in a formal sense, to a norm with the force of law. The investigated entity can legitimize

mar the treatment of personal data in the first two sections of the article
6.1 of the RGPD.
