                                                   I

     By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each control authority,
and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Agency
Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.

                                                   II

   The content of the fundamental right to data protection consists of a power of disposition

and that also allows the individual to know who owns that personal data and for what, being able

object to that possession or use. These powers of disposal and control over personal data-
which constitute part of the content of the fundamental right to data protection is
legally create the power to consent to the collection, obtaining and access to data
personal data, their subsequent storage and treatment, as well as their use or possible uses, by a
third, be it the State or an individual.

   The purpose for which the City Council has the data of the interested party in the Municipal Register

it is generally the one provided for in the regulations. Additionally, it obtained data that
provided by the police, even if they were the same, they are used to write a letter,
deciding to use the same data for a purpose, the summons of the claimant, which really
it did not exist, in order to facilitate the arrest of the claimant.

   The following articles are mentioned from the RGDP:

   Article 1.2 “This Regulation protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of the
natural persons and, in particular, their right to the protection of personal data. "

   Article 2. Material scope

   "This Regulation applies to fully or partially automated data processing

personal data, as well as the non-automated processing of personal data contained or
intended to be included in a file. "

        article 4. Definitions

For the purposes of these Regulations, the following shall be understood as:

1) "personal data": any information about an identified or identifiable natural person ("the
interested"); an identifiable natural person shall be considered any person whose identity can
be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by an identifier, such as
a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or

various elements of the physical, physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural identity
or social of said person;

2) "treatment": any operation or set of operations carried out on data
personal or personal data sets, whether by automated procedures or not,

7) "controller" or "controller": the natural or legal person, public authority,

   In the present case, the participation by the claimed party in sending the
letter of summons made to the claimant, nor that the possible
detention of the claimant, but if personal data has been used for said summons

   In the first place, according to the version of the claimed, that the data is provided by the
police, the defendant send a letter to the claimant, facilitating the summons of the claimant. For
It uses the same data, apparently they are not those of the Municipal Register, since they are the
same, but in another format, but the address is the same, and for practical purposes, it is intended that
With these data, he decides to send a subpoena letter, exercising his powers.

   This is done without writing that motivates the aforementioned collaboration, then without a legal reason that
support the legality of the collaboration, by way of fact.

     28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/14

   On the other hand, this assertion that the data was given to them by the police is not discredited by the
action by the police, who stated that they had been following the claimant for some time
watching, to no avail. In fact, in the letter of summons, it is not delivered to the address

claimant, but to another person who was there. On the other hand, of the eventual consultations,
use or access to the Municipal Register of inhabitants there are no reviews or indications.

   It would therefore be advisable to delimit where the data for sending comes from, or conclude
rationally where said data does not come or come from.

   It is clearly appreciated in terms of the shipping address associated with the name and surname of the
claimant, that the formats and literals of the Municipal Register and the letter of summons are different
reds. The registry managed by the complained party, the data of the summons letter with an address
(personal data of the claimant, although in format, very different from those that appear in the register).
One refers to a completely uppercase format, in the entire street name, and the data

As a general rule, the data used by the defendant to send letters to
the citizens. In this case, the exact data of the register are not those contained in the chart.

kill given by the police, not the one from the register. Furthermore, the claimant was not aware of another address at
City Hall.

   Without prejudice to the fact that it is indicated that the complainant has collaborated in the agreement to facilitate

To quote the appointment, a matter that is not the competence of this AEPD, the truth is that at the evidentiary level,
burden of proof, which corresponds to the administration that accuses proving the facts, is not confirmed
light because it was undoubtedly not proven that the database of the registry of the
claimed, for the sending of the aforementioned letter. However, if it is proven that other data is used,
same address, different format, which according to the claimed, are used, deciding, to
through the powers conferred by the city council, use these data, to study

a summons, therefore this treatment consisting of sending this letter with these data is the
treatment of the data carried out by the claimed person.

   In this case, the personal data has been processed for a purpose that did not exist.
more legitimation than verbal, without proving the legal motivation that served for the
legitimate treatment of that data and that summons.

   This constitutes an infringement of article 5.1.a) of the RGD.

  1. The personal data will be:

  a) treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness, loyalty and

transparency");

   For the processing of personal data to be legal, you must identify specific reasons
for processing. This is called a "legal basis" for treatment, and there are six options
(Article 6.1) that depend on its purpose and its relationship with the individual. Can't figure out

this case that there was a legal obligation to cooperate when there is no document that motivates
or induce such cooperation. If the exercise of powers were exercised because it is thought
to do or feel pressured, there would be no real reason for the action. The
Disloyalty in the treatment has to be seen as an aspect of the data treatment, in this
case, collaborate on a summons for which there was no ongoing procedure, proving the

exercise in the processing of data for a purpose that is not the one that provides for the treatment of
data in accordance with the powers established for the city council. The previous LOPD is

     28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/14

referred to this type of treatment in its article 4.2 which indicated: "Personal data
object of treatment may not be used for purposes incompatible with those for which
the data would have been collected ”. The RGPD identifies it in its article 5.1.b) “The data

personal will be: collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be processed
subsequently in a manner incompatible with said purposes "

   The purpose of the treatment must be specific, legitimate and express, in this case defined
by law in matters of management of the register, and not stating that there was a procedure to
to be completed by the complainant in said area, it is estimated that the summons with their data

personal data, even if they were provided by the agents, it is a data processing not
lawful in which there is also a lack of loyalty. Loyalty means you only have to handle the
personal data so that people can expect its reasonable use, some
common expectations, and not use them in a deviant or deviant manner, or have adverse effects
unjustified about them. The manager should stop and think not only about how he can use
personal data, but also on whether to do so. It is proven that the aforementioned is violated

article 5.1.a) of the RGPD

   Regarding the manifestations of the eventual transfer of data from the Municipal Register to the police,
that propitiates the detention, such transfer or its need for the detention of the
claimant.

       As for the exercise of powers by the claimed, it is not going to enter the
merits of the allegations regarding collaboration and loyal cooperation with the Security Forces and Bodies

of the State, since they do not fall within the competencies of this AEPD, pointing to what the
Denial refers to the exercise of the same.

       This AEPD cannot enter into assessing the exercise of powers of the claimed in the sense

citation of the municipal agency when it is not proven that there was any matter
related to the Municipal Register by the City Council, indicating that it collaborated
with the police, and that summons could be an instrument or means to achieve an end, although
It is true that there has been no document that motivated such collaboration
between administrations. Thus, you cannot qualify that exercise of competence that is attributed
the claimant, who without any documentation decides to collaborate in the arrest of a person.

Evaluate the regulated elements for the exercise of said power, such as the documented motivation
mental of the requested collaboration, it is a contentious matter that cannot assess this AEPD, if
It may well be that without going into the merits of the matter, consider that it has acted in fact by not
prove that the data processing has the principles of legality and loyalty

       What there is no doubt is that for the exercise of that ordinary management competence of
the issues the law attributes to the complainant the treatment of the complainant's data, provided that
prove that these data have been used for that purpose, logically. If the data were used
pledged in the deployment of a deception to the affected person, they are destined for another purpose, which is not the
data processing, article 5. 1.a) of the RGPD is being violated

    Establishes article 5.1.b) of the RGPD

         "1. The personal data will be:

    28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/14

  b) collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be further processed as
manner incompatible with said purposes; in accordance with article 89 (1), the treatment
further use of personal data for archival purposes in the public interest, research purposes

Scientific and historical or statistical purposes shall not be considered incompatible with the initial purposes
("Purpose limitation");

  The infringement of this article imputed in the initiation agreement decreases, as it is considered more
adjusted the facts to the violation of article 5.1.a) of the RGPD

                                                   III

        Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the violation of “the basic principles for the

treatment, including the conditions for consent pursuant to articles 5, 6, 7 and 9 "is

administrative fines of a maximum of € 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, a
an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover for the financial year
previous financial statement, opting for the highest amount. "

        Article 83.7 of the RGPD indicates:
        “Without prejudice to the corrective powers of the control authorities under article

58 (2), each Member State may lay down rules on whether and to what extent it is possible to
da, impose administrative fines on authorities and public bodies established in said State
all member "

      Article 58.2 of the RGPD indicates: "Each control authority will have all the
following corrective powers listed below:
        b) punish any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with warning when

the processing operations have infringed the provisions of this Regulation;

        d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the treatment operations

comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, of a certain
manner and within a specified period ”.

        The Spanish legal system has chosen not to penalize entities with a fine
public, as indicated in article 77.1. c) and 2. 4. 5. and 6. of the LOPDDGG: “1. The regime
established in this article will apply to the treatments for which they are responsible or

managers:

  c) The General State Administration, the Administrations of the autonomous communities and
the entities that make up the Local Administration.
