A new penalty for breaching GDPR

In August of this year, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator Realmedia Network SA (imobiliare.ro) during which it found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

As such, the company Realmedia Network SA was fined 39,272 lei, the equivalent of 8,000 EURO.

Following some information from the online environment, our institution self-notified about a possible personal data security breach that occurred at Realmedia Network SA.

As part of the investigation, it was found that the breach of data processing security occurred at the level of a service used by the operator to operate the imobiliare.ro platform.

This situation led to the unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access to the following personal data: name, surname, telephone number, e-mail address, postal address, personal numerical code, signature, copies of identity cards, including identification codes , function/quality, bank data, information included in land register extracts/cadastral drafts, property titles, user profile images, which led to the impact of a number of 194,309 targeted individuals.

Thus, the operator Realmedia Network SA was fined for violating the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, as it did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security corresponding to the processing risk.
