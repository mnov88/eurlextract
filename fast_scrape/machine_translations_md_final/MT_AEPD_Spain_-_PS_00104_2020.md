and to resolve this procedure.

Article 5 of the RGPD deals with the principles that should govern the
processing of personal data and mentions among them those of "integrity and

The documentation in the file provides solid evidence that the
processed the complainant's personal data in violation of the principle of
integrity, Article 5(1)(f) in connection with Article 32(1)(b) and (c), both of the GPRS,
when he handled the change of ownership of a mobile line that had been requested by the
claimant, as the new owner, and its hitherto owner, Ms. B.B.B.
Likewise, there is evidence that, as a consequence of such action, the following was violated
the principle of confidentiality (Article 5.1.f, GPRS) as they were disclosed to a
third party, also a customer of the claimant, personal data of the claimant, at least
the mobile phone number subject to the change of ownership that the operator linked to
that person.
It is accredited that on 29/11/2018 the claimant and Mrs. B.B.B. requested
before a YOIGO distributor the change of ownership in favor of the first in line
mobile \*\*\*TELÉFONO.1 that belonged to the latter. Work in the file copy of the
customer copy of the document, with the YOIGO anagram, of change of
ownership in which the personal data of the old and the new owner are recorded.
With respect to the claimant, in addition to NIF, name and two surnames, the postal address and
e-mail and the twenty-digit bank account for the direct debit of the
bill payment.
Furthermore, several points show that, on the occasion of the change of
ownership of the line requested by the claimant, the respondent did not apply the measures

They also show that the defendant had knowledge of the facts, at least,

quickly to the affected person in the availability of their data, in short, to guarantee
the integrity of the personal data processed.
Furthermore, it is proven that the claimant provided the SAC de YOIGO with the
name, surname, ID card and telephone number of the third party - also a customer of
operator - to which he linked the mobile line number that was the subject of the request for change of
ownership. Whether this data is visible to the claimant, as he claims, or not,
it seems clear that the claimant's mobile phone number was disclosed to the third party
that was the subject of a change in ownership. As the claimant has explained the third

"Each supervisory authority shall have all the following corrective powers
indicated below:
(…)
"(i) to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of
each individual case;"
It should be taken into consideration in order to determine the sanction to be imposed, the provision of article 83.3. of the RGPD according to which "If a person responsible or in charge
processing operations intentionally or negligently failed, in respect of the same processing operations or linked operations, to comply with several provisions of this

of the Public Sector indicates that "When the commission of an infraction necessarily results in the commission of another or others, only the sanction corresponding to the most serious infraction committed should be imposed". (The underlining is from the AEPD)

(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
case, such as the financial benefits obtained or the losses avoided, directly
or indirectly, through the infringement."
With regard to article 83.2 (k) of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76, "Sanctions and corrective measures", provides:
 "In accordance with the provisions of Article 83(2)(k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account
