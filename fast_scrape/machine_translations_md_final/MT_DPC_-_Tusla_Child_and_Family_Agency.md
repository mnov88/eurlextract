Data Protection Commission Fine on Tusla Child and Family Agency Confirmed in Court
===================================================================================

04th November 2020 - Press Release

The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) today had the decision to
impose an administrative fine on Tusla Child and Family Agency confirmed
in the Dublin Circuit Court. The application to confirm the decision to
impose an administrative fine of €75,000 was made pursuant to Section 143
of the Data Protection Act 2018. This was the first fine issued under the
GDPR in Ireland following a statutory inquiry and is the first application
under Section 143.

This inquiry was commenced in respect of three personal data breaches
notified by Tusla to the DPC. All three personal data breaches occurred in
circumstances where Tusla failed to redact personal data when providing
documents to third parties. The first personal data breach occurred when
Tusla unintentionally provided the father of two children in care with
their foster carer’s address. The second breach occurred when Tusla
unintentionally provided an individual who was accused of child sexual
abuse with the address of the child who made the complaint and with her
mother’s telephone number. The third breach occurred when Tusla
unintentionally provided the grandmother of a child in care with the
address and contact details of the child’s foster parents and the location
of the child’s school.

  of security appropriate to the risk presented by its processing of
  personal data in respect of its sharing of documents with third parties.

\* The decision also found that Tusla infringed Article 33(1) of the GDPR
  by failing to notify the DPC of the third breach without undue delay.

Corrective Powers
-----------------

\* The DPC imposed an administrative fine of €75,000 on Tusla for its
  infringements of Article 32(1) and Article 33(1).

\* The DPC ordered Tusla to bring its processing operations into compliance
  with Article 32(1) of the GDPR by implementing appropriate organisational
  measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

  Articles 32(1) and 33(1) of the GDPR.
