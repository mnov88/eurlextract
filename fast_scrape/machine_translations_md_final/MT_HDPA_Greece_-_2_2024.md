Summary
As part of a wider initiative of the EDPS, the Authority, like the majority of the members of the EDPS, jointly undertook the examination of the topic "The definition and position of the data protection officer", and sent as part of this review a single questionnaire on with the definition and position of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) in selected public bodies, such as the Ministry of Rural Development and Food.

The Ministry of Rural Development and Food had not appointed a DPO for a certain period of time, nor did it respond to the Authority in a timely manner, and for these reasons administrative sanctions were imposed in accordance with the GDPR and Law 4624/2019.

PENALTY: fine of 25,000 euros
