Procedure
1.
Outline of a case

On June 9, 2021, Personal Protection received a complaint from the law firm Juris, fh \[A\] (hereinafter the complainant), regarding the refusal of BL ehf. on access to the repair and service history of a vehicle owned by the complainant.

The complaint states that the company Autoledger ehf. on 11 February 2021, on behalf of the complainant, requested information from BL ehf. about the repair and service history of a vehicle in his possession. The complaint was accompanied by a power of attorney, signed electronically by the complainant, stating that the complainant authorizes Autoledger to retrieve, store and work with information about the repair and service history of a vehicle owned by the complainant from third parties, including workshops and service providers.

In the response of BL ehf.'s lawyer. to the access request, dated 26. sm, which came with the complaint, says that Autoledger ehf. has requested information about 878 vehicles from the company, but that it believes that it does not need to process historical data for an unspecified number of vehicles from its systems. It is noted that this would entail high costs, and it is unclear whether such processing of personal information is legal. In addition, it says that the service history of most vehicles covers more than one customer and that there are no mandates from previous owners. In addition, warranty repairs and many damage repairs are not paid by the owner but by the manufacturer or insurance company, but this means that the reliability of such an overview is not high.

Personal protection invited BL ehf. to comment on the complaint by letter, dated December 1, 2021, and the company's answers were received on January 6, 2022. The complainant was then given the opportunity to provide comments on BL ehf's answers. by letter, dated 13. sm, and they were received by letter, dated 2 February s.á. By letter, dated On June 13, 2022, Personal Protection requested more information from the complainant. A reply was received by e-mail on 1 July s.á. When resolving the case, all of the above-mentioned documents have been taken into account, although not all of them are separately explained in this ruling.

Complainant's point of view

In the complainant's opinion, he has the right to access his personal information contained in the service and repair history of the vehicle he owns, which is kept by BL ehf. The complainant notes that the access request was sent by Autoledger ehf. on the basis of a power of attorney from him and it is equivalent to the fact that he himself requested the information.

According to the complainant, the refusal of BL ehf. on access to this information constitutes a violation of his rights under the Personal Protection Act.
3.
The point of view of BL ehf.

In the reply letter BL ehf. says that the company only received a request from Autoledger ehf. for information in electronic form about the vehicle's service history, but no formal request directly from the complainant. It is also stated that the company's working method is such that this data is presented if the customer arrives at the location and presents identification and that the data is only delivered on paper and not sent electronically.
II.
Assumptions and conclusion
1.
Limitation of case – Scope – Responsible party

At the beginning of the proceedings, the complainant was informed that Act no. 90/2018 and regulation (EU) 2016/679 gave individuals the right to access their own personal data, but not the right to access personal data about others, such as the personal data of the previous owner that could be contained in the repair and service history of a vehicle. Personal protection would therefore only deal with the complainant's right to access information about the repair and service history of the car while it was in his possession, but not to information about the services the car had received during other owners' time.

It should be noted that points of view may be tested there according to legislation other than the personal protection legislation, such as according to consumer legislation, cf. i.a. section 3.6 in the general comments with the bill that became law no. 27/2021. Then the buyer's right to information about the sale item can be tried, cf. b-point 1. paragraph Article 19 Act no. 50/2000 on the purchase of liquid assets, but it can be assumed that repair history may fall under that. Responsibilities in that regard rest only on the seller of the item, but could be relevant when assessing the authority of others who have information about the item to provide that information.

This case concerns the processing of BL ehf. on a request for access to personal information about the complainant contained in the service and repair history of a vehicle owned by him. It concerns the processing of personal information that falls under the authority of Personal Protection as defined in Act no. 90/2018. BL ehf. is considered to be the party responsible for that processing according to that law, as well as Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
2.
Legal environment

This case examines whether the responsible party has processed the request of Autoledger ehf. on access to personal information about the complainant in accordance with the provisions of Act no. 90/2018 on personal protection and processing of personal data and regulation (EU) 2016/679.

According to paragraph 2 Article 17 Act no. 90/2018 on personal protection and processing of personal information, the registered person has the right to access personal information about himself according to the instructions of Article 15. of regulation (EU) 2016/679. In paragraph 1 Article 15 the regulation stipulates, among other things, that a registered person shall have the right to receive confirmation from the responsible party as to whether personal data concerning him/herself is being processed and, if so, the right to access personal data. In paragraph 3 of the same article states that the responsible party must provide a copy of the personal information that is being processed and that if the data subject submits a request electronically, the information must be provided in an electronic format that is generally used unless he requests otherwise. Then it says in the 2nd paragraph Article 12 of the regulation that the responsible party shall facilitate the registered person to exercise his right according to 15.-22. art.

In paragraph 1 Article 10 Act no. 7/1936 states that if an agent executes a legal deed in the name of the principal and within the limits of his authority, then that legal deed creates an obligation for the principal without the need for a further legal deed, from the agent or the principal.

Conclusion

 

The responsible party has stated that the company only received an access request from Autoledger ehf. about information in electronic form, and that the company has not received any formal request directly from the complainant. The complainant has stated that the company Autoledger ehf. requested the information on the basis of a power of attorney.

It will generally be considered that when a party is given a power of attorney, the agent acts on behalf of the principal without the latter having to take further action. It will therefore be considered that the request of Autoledger ehf. was equivalent to if the complainant himself had requested personal information about himself from the responsible party. In addition, it will be considered that on the basis of paragraph 2 Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the responsible party, if he considered the power of attorney to be insufficient, should have instructed the authorized party on how to meet the formal requirements for submitting an access request, instead of refusing the request.

The responsible party's answer also states that data is delivered to customers on paper, and not electronically, when they show up at the venue and present identification. As stated above, the controller, who receives an electronic request for access to personal information, must process the request electronically in a commonly used format, unless the requester requests otherwise.

In view of the above, it is the conclusion of Personal Protection that the responsible party's handling of the access request by Autoledger ehf., for the complainant, did not comply with Act no. 90/2018, on personal protection and processing of personal information, cf. regulation (EU) 2016/679.

In accordance with this conclusion, and with reference to item 3. Article 42 Act no. 90/2018, cf. c.-item 2. paragraph Article 58 regulation (EU) 2016/679, is hereby submitted to BL ehf. to take the access request of Autoledger ehf., fh the complainant, for substantive processing. Confirmation that these instructions have been complied with must be received by Personal Protection no later than November 28, 2022.
Ú r s k u r ð a r o r ð:

Delivery of BL ehf. on the access request of Autoledger ehf., fh \[A\], did not comply with the provisions of Act no. 90/2018, on personal protection and processing of personal information, cf. regulation (EU) 2016/679.

With reference to item 2. Paragraph 2 Article 42 Act no. 90/2018 and point b of paragraph 2. Article 58 regulation (EU) 2016/679 is BL ehf. given a warning for violating the provisions of Act no. 90/2018 and Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

It is proposed for BL ehf. to take the access request of Autoledger ehf., fh \[A\], for substantive processing. Confirmation that these instructions have been complied with must be received by Personal Protection no later than November 28, 2022.
