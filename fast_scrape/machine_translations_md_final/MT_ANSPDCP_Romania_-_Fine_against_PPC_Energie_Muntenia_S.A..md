As such, the operator was penalized with a fine of 9,947.6 lei (equivalent to 2,000 EURO).

The investigation was started as a result of a complaint through which the petitioner informed us that PPC ENERGIE MUNTENIA S.A. (formerly ENEL ENERGIE MUNTENIA S.A.) did not provide him with an answer to the request through which he exercised his right to delete personal data , regulated by art. 17 of the GDPR.

During the investigation, it was found that the operator did not present evidence regarding the transmission of an answer to the petitioner's request within the term established by art. 12 para. (3) of the RGPD, respectively no more than one month or no more than 3 months from the receipt of the request, the answer being communicated after the expiration of the legal term mentioned above.

The National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data also applied to the operator the corrective measure to comply, in all cases, with the applicable provisions regarding the analysis and resolution without delay of the requests submitted by the data subjects under the RGPD (art. 12-22) and to communicate answers to them within the legal terms, including through periodic testing of dedicated applications.
