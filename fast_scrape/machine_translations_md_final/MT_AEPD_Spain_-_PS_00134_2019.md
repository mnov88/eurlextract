5/84)The defendant has not reported “ the measures implemented so that lists with datapersonnel of job offers or job boards are not visible when it has been fulfilledits purpose, exposure period and data blocking. " that was contained in the proposal.FOUNDATIONS OF LAWIBy virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority ofcontrol, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of theSpanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and resolve thisprocess.IIA first question arises that the BOE list is of 10 people, whichThe object of the complaint appears is 140. The type, purpose and legitimacy have not been given.of the exposure of the 140 members of the list, since it does not appear related to the BOPA.There is no legitimate basis for the aforementioned exposition, for which reason the claim wasinfringement of article 6.1 of the RGPD that states: " Legality of the treatment " "1 . Treatment aloneit will be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met : "listing different ones, notnone of them concurring for the treatment carried out on the page indicated suchas it has been done.Although an infraction of article 6.1 of the RGPD was imputed, in the proposal ofresolution, the classification of the offense is changed, as it is considered more appropriate to classifythe facts that are the object of the complaint as included in article 5.1 a). Thus, the exposure andpublication of the lists with the data: ID, name and surname, and landline telephone numbersand / or mobiles, and results of calls with annotations, in the electronic headquarters of thePrincipality of Asturias with access for anyone, supposes an infringement of the aforementionedarticle, as there is no legitimation for the set of elements that are published,adding that it could be a process already completed since 2015 andremains exposed.Article 5.1.a) of the RGPD indicates: “ The personal data will be:to)treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party("Lawfulness, fairness and transparency");The exposed document could rather be classified as an internal document ofmanagement, by being contained as a block, data that must not be exposed for publicitythat seeks the concurrence of the processes, whether it is job boards or any otherselective process. After the development of the tests it seems that a list is made onwhich annotations are produced, and in no case is there legal authorization to exhibit in aweb, in electronic headquarters said list to the knowledge of third parties. It could be due to an error thatdenotes lack of diligence. Therefore, there is no legitimizing cause that enables the exhibitionof the data in open electronic office as it was given, a kind of management documentof the process that is not related to qualifications or transparency when exceedingsaid elements.C / Jorge Juan, 6www.aepd.es28001 - Madridsedeagpd.gob.es
