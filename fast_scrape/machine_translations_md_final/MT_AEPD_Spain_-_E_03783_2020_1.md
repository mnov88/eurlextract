Law, approved by Royal Decree 1720/2007, of December 21, specifies said
definition indicating that they constitute personal data "Any
numerical, alphabetical, graphic, photographic, acoustic or any other information

       From the actions mentioned in the factual antecedents, it appears
that within the framework of the National Security Strategy and the competencies
attributed by article 11 of the Law of State Security Forces and Bodies,
as well as Royal Decree 463/2002 of March 14, which declares the state
alarm for the management of the health crisis situation caused by COVID-

part of the Coordination Unit that is referred to the Deputy Operational Directorate,
having carried out a total of 53 reports, one daily, between March 20 and
on May 11, 2020.

       The delegate of Data Protection of the Ministry of the Interior, states that

In these activities, a priori, no data processing is carried out
personal, limiting itself to the daily observation of news or information
public social networks, in which the information collected refers to data from
public nature, shared by their authors through social networks and media
communication audiences, consisting mainly of the content of the
communication and the means of dissemination.

       As stated in the on-site inspection carried out, “these reports are

news summary. In each of these sections the publication is included

publication and in others a capture of the publication with the information of the
Identification with which the user is presented on the network. The reports contain

       The AEPD inspectors collected copies of 3 reports dated 19, 20 and

March 28, 2020, in which it is verified that the structure and content are
corresponds to the above, without the documents provided
contain personal data.

       Therefore, the processing of data from

personal character. It must be taken into account that, to Administrative Law
Sanctioner, due to his specialty, are applicable to him, with some qualification but without
exceptions, the inspiring principles of the criminal order, being clear the full
virtuality of the principle of presumption of innocence.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/10

       In this sense, the Constitutional Court, in Sentence 76/1990 considers that
the right to the presumption of innocence implies “that the sanction is based on
acts or means of proof of charge or incriminating the reproached conduct; what

The burden of proof rests with the accuser, without anyone being obliged to prove
his own innocence; and that any shortcomings in the test result
practiced, freely valued by the sanctioning body, should be translated into a
acquittal ”. This principle is expressly stated for
sanctioning administrative procedures in article 53.2.b) of the Law
39/2015, of October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the

Public Administrations, which recognizes the interested party the right “To the presumption of
non-existence of administrative responsibility until proven otherwise "

       In short, the application of the principle of presumption of innocence prevents
impute an administrative infraction when no evidence has been obtained or

evidence from which the existence of an infringement is derived.

       Therefore, in accordance with what was stated, by the director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection,

       HE REMEMBERS:

       FIRST: PROCEED TO THE FILING of these actions.
