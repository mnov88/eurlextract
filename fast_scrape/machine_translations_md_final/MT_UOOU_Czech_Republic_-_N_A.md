Fine imposed on the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic in the amount of 975,000

CZK for the general processing of data on the persons to whom it was due

proven disease of COVID-19 ordered isolation, was the decision of the chairman

Office for the Protection of Personal Data confirmed. According to the Office, the case involved

approximately 2,000,000 people contracted the disease since April 1

2021 to March 8, 2022.

"Organs

public authorities may exercise their power only in the manner established by law. This

it always applies, that is, even under extraordinary circumstances, including a pandemic. Law on

The police of the Czech Republic does not allow the widespread collection of so-called sensitive personal data,

including health information. Their area

processing carried out additionally without adequate information intended for the persons concerned

concerning such data, it can carry with it very serious risks." Jiří stated

Kaucký, Chairman of the Office for Personal Data Protection.

As the Office for Personal Data Protection discovered,

The police collected personal data about the health status of people across the board and preventively

regardless of the specific case being investigated. In doing so, however, she overstepped her authority,

which the law provides for the handling of this type of personal data\[1\].

The Office also draws attention to violations of other obligations which

should the Police of the Czech Republic comply with in connection with the processing of personal data.

In particular, the information obligation was not properly fulfilled in relation to persons whose

the data was related to a proven disease of COVID-19

collected and processed. At the same time, sufficient information is essential

precisely so that the persons in question can oppose unauthorized handling

with their personal data in a timely and adequate manner.

Another misconduct that the Office for Personal Protection

of the data he found consisted in the omission of two steps foreseen by law,

which had the initiation of such an extensive and serious collection of personal data

prevent. The police of the Czech Republic should have first carried out a so-called assessment of the impact on protection

personal data. Intended method of general collection and processing of health data

then she should have discussed the situation with the Office for Personal Data Protection in advance. For these

types of personal data processing are determined by law\[2\]

both of these steps as mandatory, primarily for the prevention of risk in persons whose

personal data to be processed.

The fact that it is not a formality and that the possible effects on

it is really necessary to assess the protection of personal data in advance, according to the chairman of the ÚOOÚ

evident from this particular case. "If the Police of the Czech Republic took these steps

carried out, she would find out in time - either by herself, in assessing her own planned activity,

or later in discussion with our office that such blanket

the collection of personal health information, according to existing laws,

may not perform at all. For the offense for which the fine was imposed, it probably would

it didn't have to happen at all," adds Jiří Kaucký, chairman of the Office.

Information about the health status of persons in the context

with the disease of COVID-19, the police did not start collecting until April 2021, that is

more than a year after the outbreak of the pandemic. "So it cannot be said that it is about execution

preparatory steps, consisting of an assessment of the legal framework and potential risks

the planned collection of this data, there was not enough time," he states

Chairman of the Office for Personal Data Protection.

There was a fine for a breach of privacy in this case

possible to grant to the Ministry of the Interior as a public authority\[3\].

Personal data were processed here for the purpose of preventing, searching and detecting crimes

activities regulated by Title III. of the Personal Data Processing Act.

Such processing of personal data therefore falls under the so-called criminal law regime

Directive\[4\]. And here - unlike

processing of personal data in the GDPR regime - imposing penalties on the public

does not exclude subjects.

For breaching the duties of the governing body

in the Title III regime. of the Personal Data Processing Act is possible

impose a fine of up to CZK 10 million. “Due to the seriousness of what was discovered

misconduct, to the number of persons whose data was processed and to others

the assessed amount of 975,000 crowns is completely reasonable given the circumstances of the case,"

concludes Jiří Kaucký.
