Another fine for GDPR violation

Â 

The National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the company Urban Home Development S.R.L. and found that it violated the provisions of art. 13 para. (1) lit. a) from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (RGPD) and of art. 4 para. (5) lit. a) from Law no. 506/2004 on the processing of personal data and the protection of private life in the electronic communications sector.

The operator was penalized with a fine of 10,000 lei, for violating the provisions of art. 4 para. (5) lit. a) from Law no. 506/2004 and with a warning for violating the provisions of art. 13 para. (1) lit. a) GDPR.

The investigation was carried out as a result of a notification that signaled a possible violation of the legal provisions regarding the processing of personal data, as the operator's website did not display the information regarding the rights of the persons concerned according to the RGPD, nor the information regarding the use of cookies.

During the investigation, the National Supervisory Authority noted that the operator URBAN HOME DEVELOPMENT S.R.L. violated the provisions of art. 13 para. (1) lit. a) from the RGPD as it does not display on its website information regarding the name/identity of the operator responsible for the processing of personal data.

It was also found that by accessing the website managed by URBAN HOME DEVELOPMENT S.R.L., cookie modules were installed on the user's device before the consent was granted and which were not technically necessary for the operation of the website.

Thus, the operator stored cookie module type information in violation of the provisions of art. 4 para. (5) lit. a) from Law no. 506/2004.

At the same time, the following corrective measures were ordered against the operator:

to complete the privacy policy on the website with the necessary information provided by art. 13 para. (1) lit. a) from GDPR; to reconfigure the way of installing cookies modules on the devices of website users.
