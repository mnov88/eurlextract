Summary
The Authority reviewed two related complaints of violation of the right to access recorded conversations against a polling company. This right was exercised by the complainants as participants in a public opinion survey carried out by the aforementioned company. The Authority accepted the complainant's request to withdraw, placing one complaint on file, while for the other, it found that there had been a violation of articles 12 para. 1, 3, 4 and 15 para. 1 of the GDPR, to the extent that the complained company never responded to the right exercised above, if only to inform about the fact that it does not have in its file the element requested by the complainant and imposed a reprimand for the above violations. At the same time, he instructed the complainant to act to formulate, within two months from the receipt of the decision, procedures, in order to adequately satisfy the rights of the data subjects and to inform the Authority accordingly.
