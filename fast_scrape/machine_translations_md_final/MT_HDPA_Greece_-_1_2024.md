As part of a wider initiative of the EDPS, the Authority, like the majority of the members of the EDPS, jointly undertook the examination of the topic "The definition and position of the data protection officer", and sent as part of this review a single questionnaire on with the definition and position of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) in selected public bodies, such as the Municipality of Athens.

The Municipality of Athens did not respond to the Authority in a timely manner and for this reason administrative sanctions were imposed (a fine of 5,000 euros) in accordance with the GDPR and Law 4624/2019.

PENALTIES: a fine of 5,000 euros
