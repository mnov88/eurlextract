REASONING

A. Arguments of the parties and course of proceedings

1. In his complaint dated 1 August 2018 and received by the data protection authority by email on the same day, the complainant stated that he had sent a request for information pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR to the respondent by email on 1 July 2018. In response, however, he only received a message that his account had been deleted because it had become apparent during the processing of his request that he was not yet of legal age. His data had been deleted even though he had only requested information. He had not provided false information about his date of birth. The fact that he had submitted a request for information had been used against him, which was certainly not appropriate. The complainant has requested that a violation of his right to information be established.

2. Since the respondent's full response was not attached to the complaint, the data protection authority issued an order to remedy the deficiency (procedural order of 13 August 2018, GZ: DSB-D123.284/0001-DSB/2018). After this order was not fully complied with, the complaint was initially rejected by decision of 25 October 2018, GZ: DSB-D123.284/0006-DSB/2018, in accordance with Section 13 Paragraph 3 of the General Data Protection Regulations (AVG).

3. This decision was annulled as unlawful by the Federal Administrative Court on May 24, 2022, GZ: W256 2228170-1/5E, because the order to remedy the defect was not served on the complainant's legal representatives (parents) and was therefore ineffective. The order to remedy the defect was therefore repeated - the complainant is now of legal age - (procedural order of June 3, 2022, GZ: 2022-0.407.513). In a letter dated June 9, 2022, the complainant submitted the missing documents.

4. The investigation was then initiated. The respondent, legally represented, submitted the following in its statement of July 4, 2022, following a corresponding request from the data protection authority (procedural order of June 10, 2022, ref. no. 2022-0.422.857): The respondent asked the complainant to provide proof of identity after receiving his request for information. On August 1, 2018, the requested data protection information was then provided in full. When examining the application, however, it was noticed for the first time that the complainant had registered for the customer loyalty program "N\*\*\*Card Program" as a minor (at the age of 14). This was actually not permitted according to the respondent's terms and conditions. As a result, his membership was terminated and he was deregistered from the "N\*\*\*Card Program". The fact that this happened in response to the request for information does not correspond to the facts. Neither the termination of his membership in the "N\*\*\*Card Program" nor the provision of information violated the complainant's right to information under Art. 15 GDPR.

5. The complainant, who was granted the right to be heard as a party to these results of the investigation (procedural order of July 11, 2022, ref. no. 2022-0.485.835), has not made any further statement.

B. Subject matter of the complaint

6. Based on the parties' submissions, it emerges that the subject matter of the proceedings is the question of whether the respondent provided the complainant with lawful information under data protection law in response to his request of July 1, 2018, and whether a possible deletion of his data in connection with this request for information constituted a violation of the right to information.

C. Findings of fact

7.   The complainant was born on March 22, 2003 and therefore turned 15 on March 22, 2018.

8. Assessment of evidence: The complainant's date of birth is officially known and on record at the data protection authority from several complaint procedures initiated by him.

9.   On February 22, 2018, the complainant registered as a member of the respondent's customer loyalty program called the "N\*\*\*Card Program." The respondent began processing the complainant's personal data for this reason and for the purpose of managing his membership.

10.  Evaluation of evidence: These findings are based on the credible (and undisputed) statements of the respondent (statement of July 4, 2022, enclosed as an introductory item in GZ: 2022-0.485.835).

11.  On July 1, 2018, the complainant sent a letter to the respondent by email with the following content:

I am referring to your message of July 2, 2018.

The Austrian Data Protection Act (DSG) as amended by the Data Protection Adaptation Act 2018 and the Data Protection Deregulation Act 2018 sets the age limit for the legality of a child's consent to an offer of information society services at the age of 14.

I am therefore of the opinion that you are permitted to provide me with the information and request that you comply with your obligation to provide information in accordance with Section 44 of the Data Protection Act and Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

\[Editor's note: The comprehensive information letter from the respondent reproduced here as a facsimile (in the form of several PDF files) would have been difficult to pseudonymize. Since the complainant did not object to its content, it was removed.\]

16. Assessment of evidence: These findings are based on the documents submitted by the complainant (annexes to the complaint of August 1, 2018, introductory item in GZ: DSB-D123.284/0001-DSB/2018, and annexes to the supplement to the complaint of June 9, 2022, introductory item in GZ: 2022-0.422.857).

17. After the information was distributed, the complainant's data processed for the purposes of the "N\*\*\*Card Program" customer loyalty program was deleted.

18. Assessment of evidence: as above, para. 10. The fact that deletion took place corresponds to the complaint's allegations (see para. 1 above).

D. From a legal point of view, this leads to:

D.1. Total:

19. The complaint has proven to be unfounded, since neither Art. 15 (right to information) nor Art. 17 (right to erasure) can give rise to a right not to erase data or to store data, and the purpose of the processing has ceased to exist due to the termination of the complainant's membership in the customer loyalty program "N\*\*\*Card Program". The content and scope of the information provided comply with the law and have not been objected to in terms of content. In this respect, the present case differs from that on which the decision of September 30, 2021, GZ: 2021-0.664.183, is based.

D.2. applicable legal provisions - right to information:

20. According to Art. 15 Para. 1 GDPR, the data subject has the right to request confirmation from the controller as to whether personal data concerning him or her are being processed; if this is the case, he or she has the right to access these personal data and to the following information:

a) the purposes of the processing;

b) the categories of personal data being processed;

c) the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations;

d) where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;

e) the existence of a right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data concerning him or her or to restrict processing of such data or to object to such processing;

f) the existence of a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

g) where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, all available information as to their origin;

h) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.

21. The right to information is essentially limited, according to the wording of Article 15(1) (“Information about these” – i.e. the “personal data processed by the controller”), to those data that are actually being processed at the time the request for information is received. No right to the processing of personal data can be derived from Article 15 GDPR or other provisions of the GDPR.

22.  The data protection authority has stated the following about the previous legal situation (Section 26 DSG 2000) (underlining not in the original):

23.  In connection with the right to receive information about one's own data, there is no right to obtain information about or evidence of certain facts through such information or to force a client to admit such facts. The basis for any provision of information under data protection law is the actual state of stored personal data and available information about their use, not a desired state of affairs of any kind. Even if in a hypothetical case data were demonstrably deleted in violation of Section 26 Paragraph 7 DSG 2000, there is still no right to technical reconstruction of this data or to any other taking of evidence to subsequently determine its content in the complaint procedure for violation of the right to information (DSB, decision of December 17, 2015, GZ: DSB-D122.259/0008-DSB/2015, RIS, RS 2).

24. This interpretation can be applied to the current legal situation.

25. Unlike the previous Section 26 Paragraph 7 DSG 2000, the GDPR does not provide for an expressly ordered or even criminally punishable “deletion ban” during an ongoing information procedure. However, deleting data after receipt of a request for information but before the request for information has been answered does not comply with the principle of processing in good faith and therefore constitutes a violation of the data subject’s right to information (Article 15 in conjunction with Article 5 Paragraph 1 Letter a of GDPR) (DSB, decision of June 27, 2019, reference number: DSB-D124.071/0005-DSB/2019, RIS).

D.3. Loss of the legal basis for processing

26.  In the complaint proceedings, it was established that the respondent deleted the complainant's data after providing information - i.e. not in bad faith - because it was of the opinion that the complainant's registration for a customer loyalty program had not been effective due to the complainant's minority, and that the data processing therefore did not serve a legitimate purpose. This view cannot be contradicted in view of Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and the controller's duty to exercise particular caution and restraint when processing the data of minors, as expressed in Recital 38.

27.  If, however, the complainant argues that, pursuant to Article 8(1) GDPR in conjunction with Section 4(4) DSG, he was granted the right to effectively consent to the processing of his data when he turned fourteen, he must be told that this only applies to the legal act of consenting to data processing pursuant to Article 4(11) and Article 7 GDPR, and that this effectiveness is also limited to the use of "information society services". According to Article 1(1)(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535, to which Article 4(25) GDPR refers, this is "any service provided electronically, at a distance, usually for a fee, and at the individual request of a recipient".

28.  Article 8(3) GDPR also makes it clear that the question of the validity of the consent of a minor has no influence on the question of the validity of a contract concluded by the complainant as a minor.

29. The respondent further argued that in its terms and conditions it reserves the legal transaction of joining the customer loyalty program "N\*\*\*Card Program" to adults and that it had therefore terminated the corresponding contractual relationship (see paragraph 15 above). This means that, regardless of whether the customer loyalty program "N\*\*\*Card Program" is an information society service, the basis for data processing in the sense of the legitimate purpose (Article 5(1)(a) and (b) GDPR) no longer applies and the respondent was obliged to delete the complainant's data in accordance with Article 17(1)(a) GDPR even without a corresponding request. A legitimate purpose for the processing must always exist, even if the consent, considered in isolation and detached from its context, is effective.

30.  The examination of the question of whether the respondent was entitled to terminate this contractual relationship (and possibly also to deprive the complainant of associated material benefits such as special customer discounts or collected bonus points) does not fall within the competence of the data protection authority.

D.4. Conclusions:

31.  The respondent legally provided the complainant with information about the data processed concerning him. The information provided at the same time that this data would now be deleted does not constitute a violation of the complainant's right to information under Art. 15 GDPR.

32.  The complaint was therefore to be dismissed as unfounded in accordance with Section 24 Paragraph 5, third sentence, DSG.
