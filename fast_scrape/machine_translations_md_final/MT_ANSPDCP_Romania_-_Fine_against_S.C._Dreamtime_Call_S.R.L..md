The National Supervisory Authority completed in May 2021 an investigation at the operator S.C. Dreamtime Call S.R.L. to whom it applied a fine, as a result of the fact that this controller did not provide the information requested by our institution, thus violating the provisions of art. 83 para. (5) lit. e) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

As such, the controller SC Dreamtime Call S.R.L. was sanctioned with a fine of 9,852.2 lei (equivalent to 2000 EURO).

The investigation was initiated following a complaint alleging that SC Dreamtime Call S.R.L. illegally processed the personal data of a natural person (telephone number), by repeatedly contacting him by telephone, without prior consent.

As the controller did not respond to the requests of our institution, although it confirmed their receipt, it was fined.

Also, the controller was required to transmit to the supervisory authority all the requested information, within 5 working days from the communication of the decision.
