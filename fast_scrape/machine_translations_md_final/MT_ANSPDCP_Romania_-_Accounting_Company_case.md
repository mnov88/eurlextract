Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing, completed, in May 2025, an investigation at Accounting Audit SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 par. (1) letter b) and par. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

As such, Accounting Audit SRL was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 50,553 lei, the equivalent of 10,000 EURO.

The investigation was initiated following the submission by Accounting Audit SRL of a personal data breach notification under the GDPR. Data breach notifications were also submitted by two of Accounting Audit SRL's clients for whom it acted as a processor.

During the investigation, it was found that the data processing security breach occurred as a result of a cyber attack, which led to the unauthorized disclosure of personal data (identification data, payment statements, articles of association, other confidential information received from clients, financial and accounting documents) for a very large number of data subjects, mainly employees of Accounting Audit SRL clients.

As such, in relation to the criteria for individualizing sanctions provided for in art. 83 of the GDPR, a fine was imposed for violating the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) letter b) and para. (2) of the GDPR, since Accounting Audit SRL, as the processor, did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the processing risk, including the ability to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the processing systems and services.
