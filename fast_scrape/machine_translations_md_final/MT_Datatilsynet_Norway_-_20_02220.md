Alerts fee to Odin Flissenter AS

The Norwegian Data Inspectorate has sent Odin Flissenter a notice of order and violation fee of NOK 300,000. The case concerns the credit rating of a single-person enterprise with no basis for treatment.

An individual company was credit rated without having any kind of customer relationship or other affiliation with Odin Flissenter.
Must have a valid treatment basis

Credit information about an individual company is also personal information, since the owner is directly identified with the company and this is directly linked to the owner's personal finances. This means that you have to have a treatment basis in order to credit individual companies.

A credit rating is the result of compiling personal data from many different sources, and shows a number that indicates the probability that a person or individual company will pay a claim. A credit rating will also show details of the company's finances, such as any payment remarks, voluntary mortgages and debt ratio.

- Credit information about individual companies can be used to derive information about the owner's personal finances. Therefore, it is private information that the owner expects that it will not be collected by businesses unless it is objectively justified, says legal counsel Ole Martin Moe.
