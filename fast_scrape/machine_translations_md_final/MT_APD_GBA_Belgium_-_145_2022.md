on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General

Having regard to the internal rules of procedure, as approved by the Chamber of Representatives

Having regard to the documents in the file;

has taken the following decision regarding:

                                                                                                   .
The complainant: Mr X, hereinafter referred to as “the complainant”; .

                                                                                                   .

The controller: Y, hereinafter “the controller” Decision 145/2022 - 2/6

I. Facts procedure

    1. On August 30, 2022, the complainant lodged a complaint with the Data Protection Authority against

        the controller.

    2. The subject of the complaint concerns the privacy statement in which the controller
        requests the complainant's proof of identity if he/she wishes to deregister from the

        receipt of newsletters. The complainant has exercised his right of access to which the

        controller has followed up. Subsequently, the complainant wishes to

        to exercise data erasure, but establishes that in accordance with the privacy statement of the

        the controller must submit his proof of identity to the

        controller.

        In addition, the complainant claims to have never registered to receive

        newsletters from the controller. The complainant has

        therefore requested the controller to provide information on how the

        controller has come into possession of his personal data. The

        controller states that the complainant has given his consent via VIP

        Response B.V. (Netherlands) by participating in a campaign. However, the complainant denies this.

    3. On September 5, 2022, the complaint will be declared admissible by the Frontline Service on the grounds
        of Articles 58 and 60 of the WOG and the complaint on the basis of art. 62, §1 WOG transferred to

        the Disputes Chamber.

II. Justification

    4. The Disputes Chamber determines on the basis of the documents that support the complaint that the privacy policy

        of the controller determines that for the exercise of rights a written

        request and proof of identity via registered letter is required. With regard to the provision of

        identification data, Article 12.2 of the GDPR provides that the controller may not

        refuse to comply with the data subject's request for their rights, including

        to exercise the right of access (Article 15 GDPR) and the right to erasure (Article 17 GDPR),

        unless the controller demonstrates that it is unable to protect the data subject

        identify .However, it does not appear from the factual elements that are the subject of the complaint

        that the controller cannot identify the complainant. After all, the complainant has

        exercised the right of access and the controller has complied with this

1 See in that regard 3.1.3. of the guideline 01/2022 on rights of data subjects – right of access:
https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2022-01/edpb\_guidelines\_012022\_right-of-access\_0.pdf Decision 145/2022 - 3/6

    request without the need to provide any proof of identity beforehand

    was deemed. In practice it has therefore been shown that the complainant can be sufficiently

    identified by the controller to follow up on the request

    of the complainant to provide information about the way in which the

    controller has come into possession of his personal data. From this follows

    ipso facto that the complainant in the present case is also sufficiently identified as soon as he/she
    intends to exercise its right to erasure and

    controller cannot require proof of identity to be provided.

5. By subjecting the exercise of rights in the privacy statement to the preceding

    provision of an identity document, the controller disregards the principle of

    minimum data processing (Article 5.1 c) GDPR). The concrete application of this principle with
    with regard to the processing of identity documents in the context of the exercise of rights

    by the data subject implies that the controller cannot require that a

    proof of identity is provided in cases where the data subject can be identified

    on the basis of the personal data already processed by him in order to be able to follow up

    indicate the exercise of its rights

    to prevent processing more data than is necessary for the purpose of identifying the
    data subject in light of the exercise of rights with regard to direct marketing.

    In concrete terms, this means that if – as in this case – the controller makes use

    of the complainant's e-mail address to send these direct marketing messages, it is sufficient

    that the complainant addresses the controller using the same email address

    to exercise its rights.

6. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that on the basis of the above analysis,

    concluded that a breach of the provisions of the

    GDPR was committed, which justifies the taking of a

    decision on the basis of Article 95, §1, 4° WOG, more specifically to inform the controller

    warn that the condition included in the privacy statement for the provision of a

    proof of identity in the context of exercising rights with regard to direct marketing
    infringes Article 5.1 c) GDPR.

7. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that the controllers should be given the opportunity

    be offered to adjust its course of action as a result of this first complaint, so that in

    similar facts and possibly new complaints about them in the future

    avoided. The Disputes Chamber therefore expects the privacy statement to be specific on this point
    is adapted and brought into line with the principle of minimum

    data processing. Decision 145/2022 - 4/6

     8. The present decision is a prima facie decision made by the Disputes Chamber

         in accordance with article 95 WOG on the basis of the complaint submitted by the complainant, in the context of
                                                                               2
         the ‘procedure prior to the decision on the merits’ and not a decision on the merits of the

         Disputes Chamber within the meaning of Article 100 WOG.

     9. The purpose of this decision is to notify the controller of the

         fact that it may have infringed the provisions of the GDPR and that it is in the

         possibility to still conform to the aforementioned provisions.

     10. However, if the controller does not agree with the content of this

         prima facie decision and considers that it may allow factual and/or legal arguments

         funds that could lead to a different decision, can be sent to the email address

         litigationchamber@apd-gba.be address a request for treatment on the merits of the case to the

         Dispute Chamber and this within the period of 30 days after notification of this decision. The

         enforcement of this decision will, if necessary, be during the aforementioned period

         suspended.

     11. In the event of a continuation of the handling of the case on the merits, the Disputes Chamber will

         the parties on the basis of Articles 98, 2° and 3° in conjunction with Article 99 WOG invite their

         to submit defenses and to attach to the file any documents they deem useful. The

         If necessary, this decision will be definitively suspended.

     12. For the sake of completeness, the Disputes Chamber is informed that a treatment on the merits of the case may be
                                                                                               3
         lead to the imposition of the measures referred to in Article 100 WOG.

     13. Finally, the Disputes Chamber points out the following:
