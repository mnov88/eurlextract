out in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 32(1) of the GDPR.

Below is an examination of the case and a statement of reasons for the Danish Data Protection

Agency’s decision.

2. Summary of facts
Danske Bank notified a personal data breach to the Danish Data Protection Agency on 12 May

2021.

According to the notification, a technical error in sending 132 electronic invoices containing the
name, address and invoice number to Danske Bank’s customers in Finland resulted in the 132

invoices being searchable and visible to 14.511 Finnish business customers in the period be-

tween 5 May 2021 and 10 May 2021.

The breach occurred due to a technical error in which 132 invoices were placed in the 'District
platform' system without the recipients’ account details. The blank receiver field allowed these

invoices to be searched if the user performed a search without entering receiver’s information

(a blank search).

Danske Bank’s investigation of the breach shows that 371 Finnish users accessed the elec-
tronic invoices between 5 May 2021 and 10 May 2021. However, the number of users who

performed a search without entering the receiver’s information (a blank search) would most
likely be lower.

District Platform is an application developed by Danske Bank for the bank’s business custom-
ers to search for invoices, among other things.Danske Bank stated that on 10 May 2021, recipient information was added manually to the              Page 2 of 2

132 electronic invoices. On 20 May 2021, a safety mechanism was verified and released en-
suring the possibility of performing a search for electronic invoices with no receiver information

was disabled.

3. Reasons for the Danish Data Protection Agency’s decision

On the basis of the information provided by Danske Bank, the Danish Data Protection Agency
considers that from 5 May 2021 to 10 May 2021 it has been possible for the bank’s business

customers in Finland to see unrelated invoices.

According to Article 32(1) of the GDPR the controller must take appropriate technical and or-
ganisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks posed by the pro-

cessing of personal data by the controller.

There is thus an obligation on the controller to identify the risks that the controller’s processing
poses to data subjects and to ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place to protect

data subjects from those risks.

The Data Protection Agency is of the opinion that the requirement under Article 32 on adequate
security will normally imply that in systems with a large number of confidential information

about a large number of users, higher requirements must be imposed on the controller’s care-
fulness in ensuring that there is no unauthorised access to personal data, that all likely out-

comes should be tested in the context of the development of software where personal data
are processed and that a relevant security measure in Article 32(1)(d) specifically mentions

that the controller implements a procedure for the regular testing, assessment and evaluation
of the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures to ensure security of pro-

cessing.

In the light of the above, the Danish Data Protection Agency considers that Danske Bank – by

not having continuously tested the Bank’s technical measures – has not taken appropriate
organisational and technical measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks

associated with the processing of personal data by Danske Bank, cf. Article 32(1) of the GDPR.

After examining the case, the Danish Data Protection Agency considers that there are grounds
for issuing a reprimand that Danske Bank’s processing of personal data has not been carried

out in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 32(1) of the GDPR.

As a mitigating fact, the Danish Data Protection Agency has taken into account that the breach
concerned only information on name, address and invoice number.
