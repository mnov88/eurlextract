                                 Response Allegations

Having examined the allegations of the claimed party, these allegations are not accepted,
based on the following arguments:

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/12

The report of the City Council \*\*\*LOCALIDAD.1 that it provides has no validity; only
It is a writing with the letterhead and seal of the City Council, but without any signature.

And in that writing it is stated: “It states that it has to pose perimeter cameras to the
exterior of the seva isolated single-family house. That the street gives the edge of the house,
“It is not a public road, it is part of the urbanization and is privately owned.”

In this sense, Royal Decree 128/2018, of March 16, which regulates the
legal regime of Local Administration officials with authorization of

national character establishes the following:
Article 2. Necessary public functions in all Local Corporations.
1. They are necessary public functions in all Local Corporations, whose
Administrative responsibility is reserved for Local Administration officials

It is also indicated in the aforementioned municipal report: “That the municipal guard,
Agent 01, close this report on July 3, 2023.”

The functions of the guard or municipal agent are those established in the

GENERAL ORDINANCE OF CIRCULACIÓ, of the Alcoletge City Council, which

In cases where it is not available to agents of the Local Police, in other words, it is available to
municipal vigilantes, this will determine the competencies that determine the protection of
l’art.1 and 13 of Llei 16/1991 of July 10, local policies (endavant LPL) and
other concordant provisions.

According to what is foreseen in the art. 13 of the LPL, the vigilants will be able to complete them
following performances:
a) Guard and monitor municipal assets, services, facilities and dependencies. b)

In view of the functions that the municipal guards have according to the Ordinance
cited, among them is not the issue of issuing reports such as the one provided to this
procedure.

Finally, the claimed party alleges that it attaches a procedural expert report, where

It is certified how and what situation the cameras have, as well as whether they are fixed or mobile and

                             The image is personal data

The physical image of a person, in accordance with article 4.1 of the GDPR, is data
personnel and their protection, therefore, is the subject of said Regulation. In article 4.2
The GDPR defines the concept of “processing” of personal data.

Images generated by a camera or video camera system are data from
personal nature, so its treatment is subject to protection regulations
of data.

It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image of the

natural persons) carried out through the reported video surveillance system is
in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD.

                                           IV

                                       Infringement

Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the assumptions that allow the
processing of personal data.

Regarding processing for video surveillance purposes, article 22 of the LOPDGDD
establishes that natural or legal persons, public or private, may carry out
carry out image processing through camera or video camera systems
with the purpose of preserving the safety of people and property, as well as their
facilities.

The processing of personal data is subject to the rest of the principles of the
treatment contained in article 5 of the RGPD. We will highlight the principle of
data minimization contained in article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, which provides that
personal data will be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to

with the purposes for which they are processed.”

This means that in a specific processing only the data can be processed
appropriate personnel, that are relevant and that are strictly necessary
to fulfill the purpose for which they are processed. Treatment must be adjusted and
proportional to the purpose at which it is directed. The relevance in the treatment of

data must occur both at the time of data collection and at the
subsequent treatment carried out on them.

In accordance with the above, the processing of excessive data must be restricted or
proceed to their deletion.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/12

The application of the principle of data minimization in video surveillance
means that images of public roads cannot be captured, since the
processing of images in public places, unless authorization is obtained

governmental, can only be carried out by the Security Forces and Bodies.

On some occasions, for the protection of private spaces, where there have been
installed cameras on facades or inside, it may be necessary to ensure the
security purpose the recording of a portion of the public road.

That is, cameras and video cameras installed for security purposes cannot
obtain images of public roads unless it is essential for this purpose, or
It is impossible to avoid it due to their location. And, in that case

preserve the safety of people and property, as well as its facilities.

In no case will the use of surveillance practices beyond the environment be permitted.

surrounding areas, adjacent buildings and vehicles other than those that access the space
guarded

The installed cameras cannot obtain images of third party private space
and/or public space without duly accredited justified cause, nor can they affect
the privacy of passersby who move freely through the area.

Therefore, the placement of cameras towards the private property of

neighbors with the purpose of intimidating them or affecting their private sphere without cause
justified.

Nor can images be captured or recorded in spaces owned by third parties.

Likewise, it is disproportionate to capture images in private spaces, such as
such as changing rooms, lockers or worker rest areas.

                       Obligations regarding video surveillance

In accordance with the above, the processing of images through a system

video surveillance, to be in compliance with current regulations, must comply with the
following requirements:

1.- Natural or legal persons, public or private, can establish a system
video surveillance with the purpose of preserving the security of people and property,

as well as its facilities.

It must be assessed whether the intended purpose can be achieved in another way less
intrusive to the rights and freedoms of citizens. Personal data only
must be processed if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be achieved by
other means, considering 39 of the RGPD.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/12

2.- The images obtained cannot be used for a further purpose
incompatible with that which motivated the installation of the video surveillance system.

3.- The duty to inform those affected as provided in the articles must be complied with.
12 and 13 of the RGPD, and 22 of the LOPDGDD.

In this sense, article 22 of the LOPDGDD provides in relation to video surveillance
a “layered information” system.

The first layer must refer, at least, to the existence of the treatment
(video surveillance), the identity of the person responsible, the possibility of exercising rights
provided for in articles 15 to 22 of the GDPR and where to obtain more information about the
processing of personal data.

This information will be contained in a device placed in a sufficiently
visible and must be supplied in advance.

The second layer information must be available in one place easily
accessible to the affected person, whether it is an information sheet at a reception, cashier, etc...,

placed in a visible public space or on a web address, and must refer to the
rest of the elements of article 13 of the RGPD.

4.- The processing of images through the installation of camera systems or
video cameras must be lawful and comply with the principle of proportionality and the principle of

data minimization, in the terms already indicated.

5.- Images may be kept for a maximum period of one month, except in
those cases in which they must be kept to prove the commission of acts
that threaten the integrity of people, property or facilities.

In this second case, they must be made available to the authority
competent within a maximum period of 72 hours from becoming aware of the
existence of the recording.

6.- The person responsible must keep a record of treatment activities

carried out under your responsibility that includes the information to which you make
reference article 30.1 of the GDPR.

7.- The person responsible must carry out a risk analysis or, where appropriate, an evaluation
of impact on data protection, to detect those derived from the implementation

of the video surveillance system, evaluate them and, where appropriate, adopt measures to
appropriate security.

8.- When a security breach occurs that affects the processing of
cameras for security purposes, whenever there is a risk to the rights and

freedoms of natural persons, you must notify the AEPD within a maximum period of
72 hours.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/12

A security breach is understood to be the accidental destruction, loss or alteration or
unlawful use of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the
unauthorized communication or access to said data.

9.- When the system is connected to an alarm center, it can only be
installed by a private security company that meets the requirements
contemplated in article 5 of Law 5/2014 on Private Security, of April 4.
