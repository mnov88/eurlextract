The complainant: Mrs. X “the complainant”;

Defendant Y, hereinafter referred to as “the controller”. Decision 130/2021 - 2/5

I. Facts procedure

    1. On 20 September 2021, the complainant lodged a complaint with the Data Protection Authority

        against the controller.

        The subject of the complaint concerns the transfer of personal data in the context of a GAS

        procedure. On 19 August 2021, the complainant reported the illegal dumping to the competent authorities

        municipal services. Based on this report from the complainant, an inspector or agent of

        the competent police zone draws up an official report. This official report, including the non-

        anonymised attachments, including the aforementioned notification, were then transferred to

        the controller with a view to drawing up the GAS fine. Afterwards made

        the controller the GAS fine by letter, also with appendices, including the

        non-anonymized report from the complainant in turn to each of the four suspects.

        The complainant indicates that he was approached by one of the 4 suspects on September 16, 2021

        who confronted her with the report of the illegal dumping. in addition

        does the complainant state that the personal data of the 3 other persons is also included in the GAS fine?

        suspects are displayed.

    2. On 1 October 2021, the complaint will be declared admissible by the Frontline Service on the basis of the

        Articles 58 and 60 WOG and the complaint on the basis of art. 62, §1 WOG transferred to the

        Dispute room.

II. Competence of the Data Protection Authority

    3. The Disputes Chamber states that the complaint relates to the processing of personal data
                                                                                                    1
        of both the complainant and the other data subjects within the meaning of Article 4, 2° of the GDPR to which the

        GDPR applies.

    4. The GAS service of the controller acts in accordance with the Act on
                                                    2
        the municipal administrative sanction as sanctioning GAS official in the present

        matter. As a controller, they draw up GAS sanctions based on the processes

        verbally as drawn up by the inspectors or agents of the competent police zone. In

        within this framework they also send a copy of the official report and all appendices to the

        suspects.

    5. For this aspect, acting as a sanctioning GAS official and all associated

        processing, the Y acts as a controller and not as a processor of the

1Article 4,2)GDPR:““processing”:anoperation or a set of operations relating to personal data or a set of

of personal data, whether or not performed via automated processes, such as collecting, recording, organizing,
to structure, to store, to update or modify, to request, to consult, to use, to provide by transmission, to distribute
or otherwise make available, align or combine, block, erase or destroy data”
2Law of 24 June 2013 on municipal administrative sanctions, Belgian Official Gazette 1 July 2013. Decision 130/2021 - 3/5

        police zone. Therefore, the Data Protection Authority is authorized to take cognizance of the

        complaint.

III. Justification

    6. The problem presented by the complainant concerns the transfer by the

        controller, without having given his consent, of

        personal data relating to her to 4 suspects of the GAS fine regarding

        illegal dumping.

    7. The Disputes Chamber establishes that the controller is responsible for the personal data,

        know has obtained the name and e-mail address of the complainant with a view to a specific

        purpose, namely to take appropriate measures, in this case a GAS fine to

        to solve the illegal dumping problem in the municipality. The controller may

        Do not pass on information obtained from the complainant as provided in her complaint to others

        without the prior consent of the complainant.

    8. However, it is common ground that the controller will process the complainant's personal data

        as provided through her complaint to the 4 defendants. This was

        was in no way consistent with the intended purpose for which the data was

        provided by the complainant, namely taking appropriate measures to act against

        illegal dumping. It is established that the recipients of the GAS fine for illegal dumping of the complainant did not

        belonged to the group of possible recipients in order to achieve this purpose. Thus

        there is a violation of the purpose limitation principle (Article 5.1 b) GDPR).

    9. In addition, this transfer to the recipients of the GAS fine in question took place without

        to have obtained the prior consent of the complainant for this purpose, so that no

        there was a lawful basis for such transfer and therefore Article 6.1 a) GDPR did not

        was respected.

    10. In view of these findings, the Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that the infringement of Article 5.1 b) GDPR

        and Article 6.1 a) GDPR is proven. However, the controller expressly acknowledges a

        serious mistake in which she herself indicates that it is extremely important to

        handle confidential information with care. The controller has

        also timely reported this incident to the Data Protection Authority, whereby

        some concrete measures have already been presented to prevent these incidents in the future

        to avoid. In view of the aforementioned reasons, the Disputes Chamber decides not to proceed with a

        treatment on the merits of this case.

    11. The present decision is a prima facie decision made by the Disputes Chamber

        in accordance with Article 95WOG on the basis of the complaint lodged by the complainant, in the context of Decision 130/2021 - 4/5

         the “procedure prior to the decision on the merits” and not a decision on the merits of the

         Disputes Chamber within the meaning of Article 100 WOG. As a result, the Disputes Chamber will only

         can impose sanctions listed in Article 95 WOG on the controller and not
                                             4
         the sanctions from article 100 WOG, such as an administrative fine.

    12. The purpose of this decision is to inform the controller of the

         fact that it has committed a violation of the provisions of the GDPR and that it is in the possibility

         to still comply with the aforementioned provisions.

    13. However, if the controller does not agree with the content of this

         prima facie decision and considers that it may allow factual and/or legal arguments

         money that could lead to a different decision, can be sent to the email address

         litigationchamber@apd-gba.be submit a request for treatment on the merits of the case to the

         Disputes Chamber and this within the period of 14 days after notification of this decision. The

         enforcement of this decision will, if necessary, be during the aforementioned period

         suspended.

    14. In the event of a continuation of the handling of the case on the merits, the Disputes Chamber will

         the parties on the basis of Articles 98, 2° and 3° in conjunction with Article 99 WOG invite their

         to submit defenses and to attach to the file any documents they deem useful. The

         If necessary, this decision will be definitively suspended.

    15. For the sake of completeness, the Disputes Chamber points out that a hearing on the merits of the case may be

         lead to the imposition of the measures stated in Article 100 WOG.

    16. Finally, the Disputes Chamber points out the following:

         If one of the parties wishes to make use of the possibility to consult and

         copying the file (art. 95, §2, 3° WOG), this should contact the secretariat
