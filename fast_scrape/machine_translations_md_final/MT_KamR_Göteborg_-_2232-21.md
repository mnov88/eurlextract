Google has a routine of informing webmasters when a search result has been removed from the list of search results in accordance with the "right to be forgotten". The Court of Appeal considers that this is not permitted under the Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). & # 13;
                The right to be forgotten means that an individual has the right to have one or more links to web pages with personal data deleted from the list of search results displayed during a search on the person's name.
The Court of Appeal considers that Google's routine of regularly informing webmasters that search results have been deleted constitutes a processing of personal data that is not in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation.
- The Court of Appeal has made the same assessment as the Administrative Court, that Google's routines regarding requests to remove search results are contrary to the Data Protection Ordinance, says the Court of Appeal's lawyer Petter Classon.
However, the Court of Appeal finds that Google has removed individual search results without undue delay. The Court of Appeal therefore reduces the sanction fee by an additional SEK 2 million, in relation to the Administrative Court's ruling, to a total of SEK 50 million. & # 13;
