Fee to Innovation Norway

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has sent a decision on an infringement fee of NOK 1 million to Innovation Norway. The case concerns a credit assessment without a basis for processing.

- Innovation Norway has not been able to refer to a customer relationship, or a connection to the complainant and the company in question, which could justify these credit assessments, says senior adviser Ida Småge Breidablikk.

The amount is unchanged after we first sent notice in the case.
Must have a valid treatment basis

A credit rating is the result of compiling personal information from many different sources, and shows a number that indicates the probability that an individual or sole proprietorship will pay a claim. A credit assessment will also show details about the company's finances, such as any payment remarks, voluntary mortgages and debt ratio.

Credit information about a sole proprietorship is also personal information, as the owner is directly identified with the company and this is directly linked to the owner's personal finances. This means that one must have a treatment basis for credit rating of sole proprietorships.

Experienced offensive

- Credit information about sole proprietorships also says something about the owner's personal finances. It is private information that can not be collected by others unless it is objectively justified, says senior adviser Ida Småge Breidablikk.

- We understand that the complainant reacts when the person in question has been credit-rated several times, and that this is perceived as offensive. We take such cases seriously, and usually react with infringement fines to this type of offense, Breidablikk concludes.

Innovation Norway has a three-week appeal period from the time they receive our decision.
