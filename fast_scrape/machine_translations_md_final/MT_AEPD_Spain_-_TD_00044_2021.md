FIFTH: In the case analyzed here, it is necessary to assess whether the response of the respondent
is sufficient based on your responsibility in handling the data and the
information that is published regarding the claimant.

On the one hand, the respondent points out that they act as the person in charge of the treatment and the
responsible is the administrator and journalist of the site https://extraconfidencial.com/ that
published your personal data and to whom you should contact to exercise your rights.

In accordance with the definition in charge of the treatment contained in article 4.8 of the
RGPD, provides: “in charge of the treatment or in charge: the natural or legal person,
public authority, service or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the

responsible for the treatment. " and in article 28.3 e) it provides: “will assist the person in charge,

appropriate organizational arrangements, whenever possible so that it can comply with
their obligation to respond to requests that have as their object the exercise of the

rights of the interested parties established in chapter III; "

Therefore, in accordance with the regulations set forth, in the case under examination, it has
it has been established that the complaining party requested the deletion of the information
contained in the url, and that, after the period established in accordance with the regulations

above, your request got a response.
The complained party claims to have met the required right by communicating to the client the
right requested, but does not prove it documentary.
However, from this Agency we consider that in the absence of response from the
entity that produced the news object of the claim, “… The claimant states that
after receiving no response from the administrator of extraconfidencial.com, he was forced to

request the deletion of the complained (AWS)… ”, it is not possible that the complained now (AWS),
consider that you have met the criteria established in the transcribed precepts,
either for not giving an answer or for not having transferred the request to the person in charge
of the treatment, affirmation that they make but do not accredit.

The aforementioned rules do not allow the request to be ignored as if it were not
would have raised, leaving it without the answer that must be issued by the
responsible, even in those cases in which it does not meet the requirements
provided, in which case the recipient of this is also obliged to request the
correction of the deficiencies observed.

Therefore, the request that is formulated obliges the person responsible in question to give
express response, in any case, using any means that justifies
receipt of the reply.

Based on the foregoing, considering that the present procedure is intended to

object that the guarantees and rights of those affected are duly
restored, and since the claimed does not provide a response from his client
(responsible for the information), as you are informed of the request of the
claimant, nor has he documented documentary evidence of having done it, it is appropriate to estimate
this claim.

Considering the cited precepts and others of general application,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
