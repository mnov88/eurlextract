Penalty for GDPR violation

The National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data completed, in August 2023, an investigation at the operator ISRA Center Marketing Research SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 14 para. (2) lit. f), art. 17 para. (1) lit. c) and art. 21 para. (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

The operator was fined two fines totaling 9,898 lei, the equivalent of 2,000 EURO.

The investigation was started as a result of a complaint submitted by a natural person who complained that the operator was sending unsolicited messages to his e-mail address.

During the investigation carried out, the National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data found that ISRA Center Marketing Research SRL collected the personal data of the person concerned (for example, name, surname, e-mail address, place of work) in a way indirectly, from public sources, in view of a proposal to participate in a market research.

Thus, during the investigation, it emerged that the operator did not present evidence from which it could be concluded that he provided clear and complete information to the person whose personal data he collected from public sources, omitting to communicate all the information provided by art. 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, such as the data collection source (art. 14 para. (2) letter f)). It was also found that the source of data collection was not clearly presented even in the information available on the operator's website.

At the same time, during the investigation, it turned out that ISRA Center Marketing Research SRL did not take the necessary measures to comply with the request to exercise the right to oppose data processing. Thus, the operator continued to process the petitioner's data by sending a new message, thus violating the provisions of art. 17 para. (1) lit. c) and of art. 21 para. (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

At the same time, in accordance with the provisions of art. 58 para. (2) lit. d) from Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following corrective measures were also applied to the operator:

to ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of personal data processing operations, by ensuring clear and complete information of the data subjects, both on its own website and in other documents communicated directly to the data subjects , by providing all the information provided by art. 13 and 14, as the case may be, and in compliance with the transparency conditions provided by art. 12 of the same Regulation;

to analyze the legality of the processing of personal data previously collected from sources other than directly from the data subjects and to remove from the record system, if applicable, the personal data whose processing was not carried out in compliance with all the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 .

We note that the operator has paid the value of the imposed sanctions.
