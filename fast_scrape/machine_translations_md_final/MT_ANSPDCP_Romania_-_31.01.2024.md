Penalty for GDPR violation

The National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data completed in December 2023 an investigation at the operator Sector 1 of the Municipality of Bucharest and found a violation of the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) lit. a) and e) from Regulation (EU) no. 2016/679 and art. 14 para. (5) lit. e) from Law no. 190/2018.

As such, the operator was penalized with a fine of 10,000 lei.

The investigation was started as a result of notifications that claimed a possible violation of the provisions of Regulation (EU) no. 2016/679.

Thus, the operator of Sector 1 of the Municipality of Bucharest, through the decisions of the Local Council, established the way in which the inhabitants of Sector 1 can submit the necessary documents to benefit from the financial incentives of the program "Local measures aimed at ensuring energy needs and improving the efficiency of energy consumption in households from Sector 1", respectively in physical format or on an e-mail address, established strictly for the purpose of implementing the program. However, Sector 1 of the Municipality of Bucharest made available to the beneficiaries an online platform, https://ticheteanticriza.primarias1.ro, for data collection, purchased before the draft decision was debated and approved by the Local Council.

During the investigation, the operator did not respond to the repeated requests for information sent by the National Authority for the Supervision of Personal Data Processing.

Therefore, as the operator did not provide the information requested by our institution, considering the operator's status as a public institution according to the provisions of Law no. 190/2018, he was sanctioned with a warning. At the same time, it was ordered to apply a remedial measure consisting in the provision/communication of all the requested information.

Since the operator of Sector 1 of the Municipality of Bucharest did not carry out the previously ordered measure through a remedial plan, within the deadline set by the authority, the investigation continued.

Considering that the operator did not prove the fulfillment of the ordered remedial measure, the National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data fined Sector 1 of the Municipality of Bucharest for violating the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) lit. a) and lit. e) from Regulation (EU) no. 2016/679 and art. 14 para. (5) lit. e) from Law no. 190/2018.

At the same time, during the investigation, in accordance with the provisions of art. 58 para. (2) lit. d) from Regulation (EU) no. 2016/679, the National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data applied to the operator the corrective measure to provide/communicate all the requested information, necessary for the resolution of the reported issues.
