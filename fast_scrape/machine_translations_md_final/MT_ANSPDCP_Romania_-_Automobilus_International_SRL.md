Sanction for violation of the GDPR

 

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in February 2025, an investigation at the operator Automobilus International S.R.L. and found a violation of art. 32 para. (1) and para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 24,885 Lei, equivalent to the amount of 5,000 Euros.

The investigation was initiated following the transmission by the operator Automobilus International S.R.L. of a notification of a personal data breach, according to the provisions of art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Thus, the operator reported a security incident, namely that information from its database was illegally accessed by a third party and at the same time the confidentiality of some personal data was lost. It was also notified that access to the information in the records system held was obtained by exploiting a vulnerability in one of the operator's servers. 

During the investigation, it was found that the operator did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the processing risk generated in particular, accidentally or unlawfully, by the destruction, loss, modification, unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access to personal data transmitted, stored and otherwise processed, as it was obliged to do under art. 5 para. (1) letter f) of the GDPR. 

In this context, certain categories of personal data were illegally accessed, such as: name, surname, telephone number, delivery address, belonging to a significant number of the operator's clients. 

Thus, since no appropriate technical and organizational measures were taken to ensure an appropriate level of security, a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) and para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 was found, and the operator was fined.

At the same time, pursuant to art. 58 para. (2) letter d) of the Regulation, the corrective measure of informing the affected data subjects about the security incident, as well as about the technical and organizational measures adopted for the purpose of remediation by displaying a press release on the front page of the company's website, was ordered against the operator.
