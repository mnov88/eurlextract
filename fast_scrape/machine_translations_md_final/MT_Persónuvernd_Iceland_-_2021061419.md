      The Data Protection Authority received a complaint that the Directorate of Labor had provided an e-mail address
complainant to unauthorized persons by mass mail. It was clear that the sharing of the e-mail address involved

were mistakenly placed in a visible copy (cc). The Directorate of Labor has failed
by informing those affected by the security breach and changing procedures
to try to prevent a recurrence of the same security breach.

Outline of the case On 24 June 2021, the Data Protection Authority received a complaint from \[A\] (hereinafter the complainant) about the Directorate of Labour's dissemination of its e-mail address by mass mail. The complaint was accompanied by a copy of the mass e-mail, which was sent on the same day.

The Directorate of Labour's views The Directorate of Labour's reply letter states that on the same day as the mass e - mail was sent, the Directorate of Labour's privacy officer received information that the e - mail address (cc) had been sent to the recipients. Upon closer inspection, it was revealed that by default, standard e-mail had been sent to about 900 e-mail addresses in three separate transmissions and that instead of having recipients in a hidden copy (bcc), they had been placed in a visible copy (cc). The e-mails in question were for the most part the e-mail addresses of companies' contacts. The reply letter states that they were human errors and that they were discovered shortly after the e-mails were sent. The staff of Vinnumálastofnun's IT department had tried to cancel the consignments, which had not yet been received by the recipients, but had not succeeded in all cases.

Paragraph 2 Article 27 Act no. 90/2018 on personal protection and processing of personal information.
