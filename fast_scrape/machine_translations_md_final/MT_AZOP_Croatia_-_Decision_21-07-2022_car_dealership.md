Administrative fine of HRK 30,000 for not marking the facility under video surveillance

The Agency for the Protection of Personal Data ex officio, without prior notice, carried out direct supervision over the processing and implementation of the protection of personal data, the collection and processing of personal data carried out by the video surveillance system, and determined that the processing manager - the car sales and service center based in Zagreb was not indicated that certain rooms in it, as well as the external surfaces of the object in question, are under video surveillance, which is against Article 27, Paragraph 1 of the Law on the Implementation of the General Regulation on Data Protection.

In accordance with Article 51, paragraph 1, subparagraph 1 of the Act on the Implementation of the General Regulation on Data Protection, the Agency imposed an administrative fine in the amount of HRK 30,000 for the aforementioned violation.

Precisely the corrective measure in the form of an administrative fine is effective, proportional and deterrent and fully appropriate to the circumstances for both imposed fines, which are paid to the state budget.
