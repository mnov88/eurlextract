Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter,
LPACAP), for the alleged violation of Article 6.1.f) of the RGPD, typified in the
Article 83.5 of the RGPD.

FOURTH: Once the aforementioned initiation agreement was notified, the defendant submitted a
allegations in which, in summary, it stated that: "the Sanctioning Body itself
makes an assessment in the Start-Up Agreement (early and lacking in motivation
any), of the responsibility of Equifax.

The Initiation Agreement specifies the amount of the reduction that would proceed in the event of
acknowledgment by Equifax of its alleged responsibility and voluntary payment of the
sanction, in the opinion of this party, the rules established in article 85 are not
applicable in the present case.

That Equifax did not include the claimant's data in the ASNEF file

since she is not the entity that manages it, but TESTA as a creditor entity,
therefore non-existent the treatment supposedly carried out by
EQUIFAX and that begins the disciplinary proceedings filed before it.

Indeed EQUIFAX acquired a series of contractual obligations in the

provision of notification delivery services (in this case, of requirements
previous payment) but this, in no case, may mean displacement of the
responsibility in a legally established obligation for the creditor to
data controller for the mere assumption of contractual obligations
by a private agreement between the parties.

Equifax Ibérica S.L. fulfilled the delivery order related to the shipment of
prior payment requirements to the claimant as shown in the
attached documents.

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/13

Asnef-Equifax cautiously canceled the data at the request of the exercise of
cancellation of the affected party in the absence of response from the person in charge to guarantee
the accuracy of the data (TESTA).

That a resolution is issued declaring the nullity of the procedure or,
failing that, the imposition of a warning or warning or a reduction
significant amount of the amount established in the Initiation Agreement, in response to the
numerous concurrent circumstances in the case of fact prosecuted ”.

FIFTH: On December 29, 2020, the instructor of the procedure agreed to the
opening of a period of practical tests, taking as incorporated the
preliminary investigation actions, E / 10196/2019, as well as the documents
provided by the claimed.

the two previous payment requests made by Testa Residencial, S.A. (What
creditor of the debt) to the claimant prior to the inclusion of their data
in the solvency file "Asnef".

Equifax sent the two communications that Testa Residencial Socimi, S.A. I "ll guide you

operation indicated in the Contract for the provision of services in its FIFTH clause
obligations and responsibilities that “At no time will Equifax be responsible
of the content of the letter, this being the full responsibility of the Client "
thus evidencing that Equifax is a mere provider of shipping services but it is the

responsible nor does he have to know the content of the communication
regardless of whether it is a “prior payment requirement”.

Since Equifax is not responsible for the content of the communication, nor the
bound by the principle of information contained in article 20.1.c), it is by

Hence, it is completely impossible to be responsible for whether or not said requirement includes the
obligation to inform the affected party about the possibility of including their data in the
credit information systems ”.
The defendant requests the nullity or, failing that, the file of the procedure or, in its
default, the imposition of a warning or a reduction

 That "The request shipments are not made by TESTA RESIDENCIAL
         SOCIMI, S.A. directly but by a third entity EQUIFAX IBERICA
         S.L. "

In response to the request for the certificate of the third company sending the

                                            I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of
The Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this
process.

                                             II

      Article 58 of the RGPD, "Powers", says:

           “2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers
corrective measures listed below:
(…)
b) punish any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with warning

when the processing operations have infringed the provisions of this
Regulation;
(...)
d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,

in a certain way and within a specified time frame.
(…)
i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or instead of the
measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances of the case
particular
(…) "

                                            III

      The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them that of "legality, loyalty and
transparency". The precept provides:

      "1. The personal data will be:
         a) Treaties in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the
             interested party (<< legality, loyalty and transparency >>); "

        Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

        "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:
      f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests

pursued by the data controller or by a third party, provided that on
said interests do not prevail the interests or the rights and freedoms
fundamental data of the interested party that require the protection of personal data, in
particular when the interested party is a child. The provisions of letter f) of the paragraph
first, it will not apply to the treatment carried out by public authorities in

the exercise of their functions. "

      The infringement for which the claimed entity is responsible is found
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading "General conditions for
the imposition of administrative fines ”, it states:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/13

total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:
      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

       Organic Law 3/2018, on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious ”provides:

      "1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that one and, in
in particular, the following:
        (…)

       b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
           conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
           Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                           IV

      The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 f) of the RGPD, for data processing without
legitimation, obligation established in article 20.1 c) of the LOPDGDD, that is to say
I include the claimant's data in the Asnef file without previously requiring the
payment.

      Article 20.1 c) of the LOPDGDD establishes:

"That the creditor has informed the affected party in the contract or at the time of
require payment about the possibility of inclusion in said systems, with

indication of those in which it participates.
The entity that maintains the credit information system with data related to the
breach of monetary, financial or credit obligations must notify the
affected the inclusion of such data and will inform you about the possibility of exercising the
rights established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 within
of the thirty days following the notification of the debt to the system, remaining

data blocked during that period. "

       Therefore, the data was included in the Asnef file without requiring it
prior to payment in contravention of the requirements set forth in the LOPDGDD.

      EQUIFAX provides a copy of the notification letter to the claimant dated 24
April 2019, requiring the payment of the debt, but without stating the warning that
in case of non-payment, it would be included in the capital solvency file and
of credit.

      Now, in the lease signed on August 3, 2016
with Testa as there is no information either in the contract or in the prior requirement of
payment the elements are not fulfilled so that this treatment can be presumed
protected by the legitimate interest and therefore it has been carried out without a legitimizing basis. Of

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/13

agreement with the contract for the provision of services provided between Testa and Equifax
Ibérica, this last entity will be in charge of making the request
prior payment prior to inclusion in the equity and credit solvency file,

without their sending and receiving by the claimant having been accredited.

      It is clear, and this is the essential, the above makes the data processing
of the claimant is not legitimate, since the established budgets were not given
in article 20.1 c) of the LOPDGDD.
