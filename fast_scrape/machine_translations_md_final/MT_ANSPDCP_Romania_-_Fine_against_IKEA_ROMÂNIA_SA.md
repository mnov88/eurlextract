The participants uploaded in the online platform dedicated to the members their own drawings, together with the participation forms, which contained their personal data but also that of the parents / legal guardians, including their consent. In order to vote for the best drawing, the children's drawings were published on the online platform, by mistake, together with the personal data included in the participation forms. & # 13;
