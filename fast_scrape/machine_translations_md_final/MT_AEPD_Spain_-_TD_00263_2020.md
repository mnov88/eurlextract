in a personnel selection procedure in InfoJobs and requested them, access to the
assessment made to your CV by the company that had offered the job,
since he did not know the entity that convened the position, he also points out that, given the
anonymous nature of the bidding company, you cannot exercise your right of access

mechanism prior to the admission for processing of claims made before
the AEPD, consisting of transferring them to the Data Protection Delegates
designated by those responsible or in charge of the treatment, for the intended purposes

transferred the claim to the claimed entity to proceed with its
analysis and respond to the complaining party and this Agency within a period of
month.

In summary, the defendant made the following allegations, they do not participate in the

selection process or in the evaluation of candidatures and that it does not request that
information in any case.

That the offers published with a "blind profile" of the company, the protection policy of
data explicitly informs the user about this point.

the system itself, so there was no data communication, and there is no possibility
to request any right of access to third parties.

explicit consent (when the job offers so require). Within
this framework of action, client companies that use Infojobs to recruit, only

have temporary access to candidate data, but do not have any rights
to extract that information or process it in other systems, nor of course they can
use the information for purposes other than those related to the
selection process. As the personal data of the affected party is related to said
candidacy solely and exclusively responsibility of Infojobs, so there is no
possibility of requesting the exercise of rights to any other entity, such and how the

candidate requested

That it does not store any information related to the subjective assessment of the
candidate and his selection process by client companies as

but not applicable to your case, the selection process is managed outside the environment of
Infojobs, allowing the client to store the data of the
candidate.

That both types of inscriptions have different characteristics.

That the use of the service that is established in these cases the obligation of the client to
use the data of the candidates who apply for their offers only to
manage that specific selection process and always within the environment of the

use said data for other selection processes or to keep any type of data
of said candidacies. Therefore, and since client companies only
can temporarily view the candidate data, but cannot extract it or
process them in other systems, there should be no candidate data on that

selection process on any other platform or system.

That the claimed is solely responsible for the data and these should not be found
in systems other than the Infojobs platform. Therefore, any right
access to your personal data related to this selection process must

be attended exclusively by the claimed.

candidacy does not exist, nor is it data that the platform processes or stores.

they can advance it in the selection process or discard it, but not enter data
relating to the evaluation of the candidacy. Therefore, it is not possible to satisfy the

User request or provide data that has not been received or stored.
