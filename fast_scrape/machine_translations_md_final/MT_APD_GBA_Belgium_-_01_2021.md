    - the defendant: IAB Europe Interlocutory decision 01/2021 - 3/6

    1. Facts and procedural history

1. Several complaints have been lodged against Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe (IAB hereafter),

    for violation of several provisions of the GDPR (in particular the principle of lawfulness, transparency,

    loyalty, minimization, security, obligation of information ...), for large-scale processing

    of personal data.

2. Nine identical or very similar complaints were filed, including four to the Protection Authority

    Data ("DPA" below) directly, and five to supervisory authorities in other

    countries of the European Union via the IMI system.

3. The four complaints were lodged directly with the APD respectively on May 20, 2019 (DOS-

    2019-02837), June 4, 2019 (DOS-2019-03124), July 2, 2019 (DOS-2019-03668), and 26

    November 2020 (this complaint was directly attached to file DOS-2019-01377).

                                                                  er
4. The five IMI complaints were filed respectively on March 1, 2019 (DOS-2019-01377), on

    July 2019 (DOS-2019-04052), August 08, 2019 (DOS-2019-04210), August 19, 2019 (DOS-2019-

    04269), December 16, 2019 (DOS-2019-02653).

5. The Inspection Service of the APD was also seized on its own initiative in the 2020-

    02653, file which was attached to file DOS-2019-01377.

6. The aforementioned files were all joined in a single case taken up under the DOS-2019- file.

    01377, as long as the complaints are the same or very similar.

7. The complainants gave their consent to this joinder, as well as to the request of the Chamber

    Litigation to unite their conclusions and send common games, for the sake of economy and

    efficiency of the procedure.

8. In this international case, three plaintiffs are domiciled in Belgium, one in Ireland,

    four in different EU states but are represented by the NGO Panoptykon with its headquarters in

    Poland, and one complainant is represented by the NGO Bits of Freedom based in the Netherlands.

    The complainants therefore reside in the various linguistic areas.

9. In view of the international character of this case, the Contentious Chamber is considering the

    present interlocutory decision on the language of the proceedings. Interlocutory decision 01/2021 - 4/6

     2. Motivation

10. As part of the analysis of the language of the proceedings, a distinction should be made

     between the language in which the parties address the ODA of the language in which the ODA

     is for those.

11. With regard to the language in which the parties address the ODA, Article 30 of the
                                                   1
     Constitution guarantees linguistic freedom.

12. With regard to the language of the proceedings before the DPA, that is to say the language in which

     ODA is addressed to the parties, article 57 of the ODA law provides within the framework of the procedure

     litigation in the handling of complaints that "the DPA uses the language in which the procedure

     is conducted according to the specific needs of the case ". Although counsel for six plaintiffs points out that

     Article 57 LCA is contrary to the Constitution, it is not for the Contentious Chamber to

     express itself on this subject, insofar as it is, as an organ of the ODA, linked to the organic law

     who invests his powers in him. It is not within its competence to comment on compliance

     with the Constitution of the organic law.

13. The Contentious Chamber therefore applies article 57 of the organic law. Read in

     in combination with article 60 of this law, proceedings are conducted in one of the languages

     national. There is no other language legislation directly applicable to the procedure

     before the House. The law of June 15, 1935 concerning the use of languages in judicial matters

     does not apply to the Litigation Chamber, as it is not a judicial body.

     The law of July 18, 1966 on the use of languages in administrative matters does not apply either.

     more due to the existence of the specific provision of article 57 of the ODA law and of the principle

     by lex specialis.

14. For the implementation of this provision, the Litigation Chamber applies in principle the rule
                                                                                                      2
     according to which the language of the proceedings is the language of the place of residence of the complainant. As

     stipulated in article 57 of the GBA law, this main rule may be waived according to the needs of

     the case.

15. In the present case, insofar as IAB Europe does not have a command of Dutch and has expressly

     requested the use of French in its exchanges with the Inspection Service, and taking into

     account of the fact that its statutes are drafted in French, the contacts between the Inspection Service

     and IAB Europe were largely conducted in this language. As stated in the note

     on the language policy of the Litigation Chamber, now available on the APD website,

1Article 30 of the Constitution: “The use of languages used in Belgium is optional; it can only be regulated by law,
and only for acts of public authority and for legal matters. "

2 As indicated in a note on the use of languages, available on the APD website:
https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/citoyen/chercher?q=langue&search\_category%5B%5D=taxonomy%3Apublicati
ons Interlocutory decision 01/2021 - 5/6

    the Chamber may derogate from the general rule of use of the language of the place of residence of the

    complainant in the event that the defendant does not speak this language, and asks

    the use of another (national) language.

16. The Contentious Chamber therefore maintains French as the language of the proceedings,

    also takes into account the international character of this case as well as the many parties

    involved and multiple complaints in several EU member states joined together

    folder. The implementation of cooperation between the lead authority (ODA in this case

    case) and the relevant supervisory authorities (art 60 GDPR) is also taken into account. If a

    second language was to be used, English would be appropriate, as long as cooperation

    between supervisory authorities takes place in this language. This is not a national language.

17. Nevertheless, as regards the language in which the parties address the ODA the Chamber

    Litigation decides on the basis of article 57 of the organic law to leave the possibility to the parties

    express themselves in the language of their choice (limited to French, Dutch or English) both in

    their conclusions until the upcoming hearing.

18. No translation will be provided of the written documents (conclusions, documents in the file, etc.), in the

    insofar as, in the present case, the Contentious Chamber considers that the lawyers of the plaintiffs

    and they are fluent in French, Dutch and English. In addition, translations

    systematic would cause months of delay in the procedure. However, the House is of the opinion

    that in this particular case, given the interests represented and the scope of the case,

    a decision as soon as possible is desirable. In the present case, the Chamber considers

    therefore it is in the interest of the smooth running of the procedure to avoid unnecessary translations.

19. The official decision of the DPA will be issued in French, and a translation into Dutch and English

    will be made available to the parties simultaneously with the French version. These translations will be

    also published on the APD website.

20. The APD also accepts the underlying supporting documents in French and Dutch, as well
                   3
    only in English. The fact that certain central reports in this procedure and in complaints

    filed in English was also taken into consideration.

21. In view of the importance of transparency in the decision-making process and

    decisions of the Litigation Chamber, as well as due to the specificity and public interest

    present in this decision, it will be published on the website of the French

    Data protection. In view of the previous publicity on this case, the Chamber

    Litigation has decided not to delete the direct identification data of the parties and

    persons cited, whether natural or legal.

3 See in particular decision 61/2020, point 29 Interlocutory decision 01/2021 - 6/6

FOR THESE REASONS,

THE LITIGATION CHAMBER

Decide, after deliberation:

- conduct the proceedings in French, while allowing the parties to express themselves, both in their

    conclusions only during the hearing, in French, Dutch or English.

- not to provide translations of written documents submitted in one of these three languages

- render the final decision in French, and simultaneously communicate to the parties a

    Dutch and English version, versions which will also be made available on the site

    of ODA

In view of the impact of this case, and to the extent that this question is raised for the first time

times before the Contentious Chamber, following an exchange of contradictory views of the parties

on this specific question, the Litigation Chamber adopted an interlocutory decision instead

a position paper on the procedure.

This interlocutory decision may be appealed against to the Procurement Court within a

30 days from its notification (art. 108 § 1 of the law of 3 December 2017 establishing

of the Data Protection Authority) with the Data Protection Authority as

defendant.
