The professional union DMA France, the CPA union, the Alliance Digitale association and the Le Geste association demonstrate a sufficient interest in the annulment of the contested decision. Consequently, their intervention is admissible. On the dispute:2. Groupe Canal + is requesting the annulment of the decision of 12 October 2023 by which the restricted committee of the French National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties (CNIL) imposed an administrative fine of €600,000 on it for breaches of paragraph 1 of Article 7, Articles 12, 13, 14, 15, 28, 32 and 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (GDPR), and Article L. 34-5 of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code. 3. Firstly, under Article 4(11) of the GDPR, consent of the data subject is defined as "any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her." Under Article 7(1) of the same regulation: "Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has given his or her consent to the processing of personal data relating to him or her." 4. Secondly, Article L. 34-5 of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code, which transposes into national law Article 13 of the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications), provides that: "Direct marketing by means of electronic communications is prohibited." of an automated electronic communications system within the meaning of Article L. 32, 6°, a fax machine or electronic mail using the contact details of a natural person, subscriber or user, who has not previously expressed his consent to receive direct marketing by this means. / For the purposes of this article, consent means any free, specific and informed expression of will by which a person accepts that personal data concerning him may be used for the purpose of direct marketing. "5. Thirdly, under Article 13(1) of the GDPR, the clear and complete information that must be provided to the data subject before obtaining consent, when data is collected from that person, includes: "(a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller's representative / (...) e) The recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any (...). " Under the first two subparagraphs of Article 14(1) of that regulation: "Where the personal data have not been collected from the data subject, the controller shall provide the data subject with all of the following information: / (a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller's representative." 6. It results from the investigation that Groupe Canal + had commercial prospecting operations carried out on its behalf electronically, by contacting prospects whose personal data had been collected by two internet service providers (ISPs) from their subscribers. The persons concerned were invited to check a box in the collection forms indicating their consent to the use of their personal data for prospecting purposes by the ISPs' "partners", without these partners being specifically identified in the collection form, nor in a list accessible by a hyperlink, nor by any other means. Groupe Canal +, which is one of the partners of these ISPs, from which it acquired the list of persons concerned, had commercial prospecting operations carried out with approximately 3.9 million people during the year 2021 without expressly obtaining their consent. The CNIL's restricted committee considered that this company had, in doing so, committed a failure to comply with the obligation to obtain the consent of the persons concerned for the implementation of commercial prospecting by electronic means. 7. It follows from what was said in the previous paragraph that the company Groupe Canal + is responsible for the processing related to the commercial prospecting operations that it has implemented. As such, pursuant to the provisions cited in points 3 to 5, it must be able to demonstrate that the persons concerned have given informed consent to the processing of their personal data for this purpose. 8. In support of its appeal, the applicant company argues that the consent of the persons concerned, obtained according to the procedures set out in point 6 by the ISPs, was sufficiently informed for them to be able to receive commercial prospecting by electronic means on its behalf, insofar as the persons concerned had given their consent to the use of their data by partners of these ISPs. 9. The answer to this argument depends on whether, and if so under what conditions, paragraph 11 of Article 4 of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR and Article 13 of the Directive of 12 July 2002, must be interpreted as meaning that the consent of the data subject, given to a first-time collector, to the use of their data by a category of recipients, such as, in this case, the "partners" of ISPs, may be considered as free, specific, informed and unambiguous consent allowing any person belonging to that category to carry out commercial prospecting operations by electronic means without needing to seek further consent, or whether the combination of these provisions implies, in such a case, that any recipient of the personal data collected, if their identity was not known to the data subject at the time they gave their consent to the first-time collector, must obtain the consent of that person before being able to proceed with the processing of their data. of commercial prospecting as the controller of a new processing operation. 10. In the event that the Court were to hold that the consent given by the data subject, to a first-time collector, to have their data used by a category of recipients to carry out commercial prospecting by electronic means, can be considered as informed consent within the meaning of the aforementioned provisions, the question also arises as to whether the degree of precision of the concept of "category" of recipients is important or whether it can, as in the present case, simply refer to any "partner" of the first-time collector. 11. These questions are decisive for the resolution of the dispute to be decided by the Council of State. They present serious difficulties. It is therefore appropriate to refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union pursuant to Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and until that court has ruled, to stay the proceedings on the application filed by Groupe Canal +. DECIDES:

--------------

Article 1: The intervention of the professional union DMA France, the CPA union, the Alliance Digitale association, and the Le Geste association is hereby granted.

Article 2: The judgment on the application of Groupe Canal + is stayed until the Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled on the following questions:

1) Must Article 4(11) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR and Article 13 of the Directive of 12 July 2002, be interpreted as meaning that the consent of the data subject, given to a first-time collector, to the use of their data by a category of recipients, such as, in this case, the "partners" of ISPs, may be considered to be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent allowing any person belonging to this category to carry out commercial prospecting operations by electronic means without the need to seek further consent, or does the combination of these provisions imply, in such a case, that any recipient of the personal data collected, if their identity was not known to the data subject at the time of the The data subject, at the time they gave their consent to the primary data collector, obtains that person's consent before being able to carry out commercial prospecting with them as the controller of a new processing operation.

2°) In the event that it is appropriate to hold that the consent given by the data subject to a primary data collector to have their data used by a category of recipients to carry out commercial prospecting electronically can be considered informed consent within the meaning of the aforementioned provisions, is the degree of precision of the concept of "category" of recipients important, or can it, as in the present case, simply refer to any "partner" of the primary data collector?

Article 3: This decision will be notified to Groupe Canal +, the French National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties, and the Court of Justice of the European Union.

A copy will be sent to the Prime Minister, the professional union DMA France, the CPA union, the Alliance Digitale association and the Le Geste association.
