 111. THE CONTEXT OF THE CONTESTED DECISION AND THE PROCEDURE BEFORE THE DPA

 5. On December 22, 2020, Mr. X (identified as "X") - who identifies himself as a
 "accidental American", having acquired American nationality by reason of his birth on the soil

American, but without having other ties with this country - and the ASBL Accidental Americans Association of
Belgium (AAAB) lodged a complaint with the APD 1 denouncing the illicit character, according to them, of the
transfer of personal data operated by the FPS Finances to the American tax authorities

in the context of the application of the "FATCA" intergovernmental agreement concluded between the Belgian State
and the United States on April 23, 20142, as well as other GDPR breaches in the same context.

 The Court refers at this stage to the factual elements set out in the Contested Decision, as follows

“5. By virtue of his American nationality, the first parent is considered to be subject to the
control of the American tax authorities with regard to the American tax legal system. This system
is in fact based on the principle of taxation based on nationality and targets the accidental American

like any other taxpayer established on American soil or having activities in re/ation with this
country, the fact that his residence is not established in the United States being irrelevant. alone
certain exceptions apply to non-residents on US soil.

6. In order to facilitate the collection of relevant information by the American IRS (Internal Revenue
Service - ei-àpres IRS) with a view to a possible taxation of Americans residing abroad (in this
including injured Americans such as the first plaintiff), the U.S. government designed

intergovernmental agreements with different states of the world. These agreements provide for the
communication of data relating to these Americans residing abroad by the institutions
national financial authorities (to/the banks) to the national tax administration (to/the defendant),

the latter then being required to transfer this data to the IRS.
7. It is in this context that the "Agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of
Belgium and the Government of the United States of America to improve International tax

compliance and to implement Fatca”, signed by the representatives of the governments of the Kingdom
of Belgium and the United States of America on April 23, 2014. This agreement is commonly and hereinafter

called "the FATCA agreement". It gives effect to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
from which the acronym “FATCA” is derived. A comparable bilateral intergovernmental agreement has
has also been signed with various states of the world, including the member states of the European Union

(ei-after EU).
8. The Belgian Law of 16 December 2015 regulating the communication of information relating to
financial accounts by the Belgian financial institutions and the FPS Finances, within the framework of a

1°
 This complaint (complaint no. 1) will be declared admissible by the APO's front-line service insofar as it is
brought by the first complainant, and °inadmissible because it is brought by the second complainant; this one
will file a second complaint (complaint no. 2) explaining his interaction, which will be declared admissible. By
Subsequently, the two complaints were joined and the APO refers in the Impugned Decision to the two complaints, as
"the complaint", which the court will also do in this judgment.
2 Having been the subject of a law of consent of December 22, 2016.
