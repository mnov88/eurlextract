Reasons for the decision:

The Federal Administrative Court considered:

1. Proceedings and findings:

1.1. On June 15, 2020, the relevant authority received an unencrypted USB stick that had been found in the XXXX area, without any information about the person who sent it. This USB stick contained XXXX's internal documents, such as interrogation protocols including personal data.1.1. On June 15, 2020, the relevant authority received an unencrypted USB stick that had been found in the Roman XXXX area, without any information about the person who sent it. This USB stick contained Roman XXXX's internal documents, such as interrogation protocols including personal data.

1.2. The relevant authority then initiated an ex officio investigation procedure, particularly with regard to the technical and organizational security measures taken.

1.3. In a decision dated November 16, 2021, the authority concerned stated that the ex officio examination procedure was justified and determined that the responsible person, within the scope of her function as head of XXXX, was using a private and unsecured data medium on which she processes official documents have failed to ensure adequate security of data processing.1.3. In a decision dated November 16, 2021, the authority concerned stated that the ex officio examination procedure was justified and determined that the responsible person, within the scope of her function as head of Roman XXXX, had used a private and unsecured data medium on which she had stored official documents processed, failed to ensure adequate security of data processing.

1.4. The present complaint from the BF dated December 6, 2021 is directed against this decision. In it, she alleged, among other things, incorrect findings, the inadequacy of the procedure, lack of reasoning and an incorrect legal assessment. The authority concerned did not adequately take into account the fact that the USB stick had been unlawfully stolen by an employee. The BF could not have expected that one of its employees would steal the USB stick XXXX and restore deleted files from it. The authority concerned had therefore exceeded the standard of care.1.4. The present complaint from the BF dated December 6, 2021 is directed against this decision. In it, she alleged, among other things, incorrect findings, the inadequacy of the procedure, lack of reasoning and an incorrect legal assessment. The authority concerned did not adequately take into account the fact that the USB stick had been unlawfully stolen by an employee. The BF could not have expected that one of its employees would steal the Roman XXXX USB stick and restore deleted files from it. The authority concerned had therefore exceeded the standard of care.

1.5. The authority concerned submitted the complaint following the administrative act in a letter dated December 16, 2021, filed on December 21, 2021, and requested - with reference to the reasons for the contested decision - that the complaint be dismissed.

Evidence was collected by examining the administrative and court files.

2. Assessment of evidence:

The findings result from the harmless administrative act. In particular, the statement on the decision in the contested decision results from the decision also submitted by the authority concerned (OZ 1, p. 240).

3. Legal assessment:

To A)

The admissible complaint is justified.

3.1. Regarding the legal situation:

In its fundamental decision (VwGH December 14, 2021, Ro 2020/04/0032) with regard to ex officio examination procedures by the authority concerned, the VwGH stated that there was no legal basis for an independent decision about the possible authorization to carry out a procedure within the meaning of Article 58 Paragraph 2 of the GDPR or the possible illegality of the processing operation in question. Art 58 GDPR does not contain an express legal basis for an independent determination by the data protection authority of the possible illegality of a processing operation relevant to data protection law in a procedure initiated officially. Section 24 DSG provides for the possibility of detecting a violation of a right protected by data protection law upon request from a data subject. However, this provision regulates the individual complaint of a person whose right to protection of personal data concerning them has been violated and is not directly applicable to the procedure initiated officially by the data protection authority (cf. most recently VwGH September 1, 2022, Ra 2022/04/0066 with further references). In its fundamental decision (VwGH December 14, 2021, Ro 2020/04/0032) with regard to ex officio examination procedures by the authority concerned, the VwGH stated that there was no legal basis for an independent decision about the possible authorization to carry out a procedure within the meaning of Article 58, Paragraph 2, GDPR or the possible illegality of the processing operation in question. Article 58, GDPR does not contain an express legal basis for an independent determination by the data protection authority of the possible illegality of a processing operation relevant to data protection law in a procedure initiated ex officio. Paragraph 24, DSG provides for the possibility of detecting a violation of a right protected by data protection law upon request from a data subject. However, this provision regulates the individual complaint of a person whose right to protection of personal data concerning them has been violated and is not directly applicable to the procedure initiated officially by the data protection authority (see most recently VwGH September 1, 2022, Ra 2022/04/0066 with further references).

3.2. Applied to the facts of the case, this means:

In the ruling in this decision, the authority stated that the ex officio examination procedure was justified and found a violation of the law. There is no legal basis in either the GDPR or the DSG for such a objection by the authority concerned as part of an ex officio investigation. The Austrian legislature did not grant the data protection authority, as a supervisory authority within the meaning of the GDPR, any authority beyond the catalog of Art 58 GDPR (see VwGH September 1, 2022, Ra 2022/04/0066). In the ruling in this decision, the authority stated that the ex officio examination procedure was justified and found a violation of the law. There is no legal basis in either the GDPR or the DSG for such a objection by the authority concerned as part of an ex officio investigation. The Austrian legislature did not grant the data protection authority as a supervisory authority within the meaning of the GDPR any authority beyond the catalog of Article 58, GDPR (see VwGH September 1, 2022, Ra 2022/04/0066).

The contested decision was therefore issued without a legal basis, which is why the complaint had to be followed for this reason and the decision had to be repealed without replacement.

3.3. The decision therefore had to be made in accordance with the verdict.

3.4. Since it was already clear from the file situation that the contested decision should be repealed, the oral hearing - requested - could be dispensed with in accordance with Section 24 Paragraph 2 Z 1 VwGVG.3.4. Since it was already clear from the file situation that the contested decision should be repealed, the oral hearing - requested - could be dispensed with in accordance with paragraph 24, paragraph 2, number one, VwGVG.

Regarding B) Inadmissibility of the appeal:

According to Section 25a Paragraph 1 VwGG, the administrative court must state in its ruling or decision whether the appeal is permissible in accordance with Art 133 Paragraph 4 B-VG. This statement must be briefly justified. According to paragraph 25 a, paragraph one, VwGG, the administrative court must state in its decision or decision whether the appeal is permissible in accordance with Article 133, paragraph 4, B-VG. This statement needs to be briefly justified.

According to Article 133 Paragraph 4 B-VG, the appeal is not permitted because the decision does not depend on the solution of a legal question that is of fundamental importance. The adjudicating court was able to rely on the established case law of the Administrative Court cited in each case. According to Article 133, paragraph 4, B-VG, the appeal is not admissible because the decision does not depend on the solution of a legal question that is of fundamental importance. The adjudicating court was able to rely on the established case law of the Administrative Court cited in each case.
