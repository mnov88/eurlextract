delivers the original hard drive of the running ABS server,
despite the fact that he was not part of the Authority 's interim order, as
confirmed the Authority with its document number C / EX / 452-1 / 29-01-2019. According
with the companies AMPNI and ABS the processing of the backup (back up) that
is located in Manchester, United Kingdom and contains professional e-mails,
is the only way to ensure that key evidence

have not committed any act of unlawful processing of personal data, that no
there was no intention from the beginning to copy the server, nor that they invented as

proportionality (Ait.Sk. 4 GKPD).
3. According to article 3 par. 1 GCP " this Regulation shall apply to
processing of personal data in the context of a
the establishment of a controller or processor in the Union,
regardless of whether the processing takes place within the Union ". In
No. 22 Recital of the GCC is defined for the concept of installation
that it «\[ . . . \] presupposes the substantial and actual exercise of activity through
fixed settings. In this respect, the legal form of these arrangements, either
whether it is a subsidiary or a subsidiary with legal personality, is not decisive
of importance ".
4. According to article 4 par. 1 GCP as " personal data "
is defined as " any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
("Data subject ''); the identifiable natural person is one whose
identity can be verified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an ID
ID, such as name, ID number, location data, online
ID ... ». Similar broad definition for the concept of data
of a personal nature pre-existed in article 2 par. a oflaw 2472/1997, in application
of Directive 95/46 / EC.
In this context, the e-mail address of an individual
is a personal data as it can act as
element of indirect or direct identification of its holder, allowing communication with
13
him. When the email address bears the name or associated
identifier of the natural person - user (e.g. johnsmith@ikea.sk)
then it is a matter of immediate identification and therefore constitutes personal data
in contrast to the address of a legal entity ( e.g. ikeacontact@ikea.com), the
which in principle does not constitute personal data 1
s. According to the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ),
the fact that the processing of information concerns the content of a professional
does not exert influence in that regard and does not invalidate their classification as
personal data 2 , nor does it constitute an exception to the relevant protection 3 ,
even when the controller acts in the context of public policy
tasks 4 , and the ' distinction of the data in question according to whether they fall under
in the private sphere or in the public sphere is clearly a result of confusion between the two
fall into the personal data and those that fall into the private
life » s
According to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights
Human Rights (ECtHR) the protection of "privacy" established in Article 8 thereof
European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which includes the
protection of personal data, does not exclude professional life and
is not limited to life within the place ofresidence (see APDPX 34/2018 and OE29
Working document for the monitoring of electronic communications in the workplace

6. The data subjects, whether they are employees or senior executives
administration or are connected in any way with the controller have a
a reasonable expectation of protection of their privacy in the workplace, which does not
removed from the fact that they use equipment, communication devices or
any other professional hardware or software facilities and infrastructure ( e.g.
electronic communications network, Wi-Fi, corporate email addresses
mail, servers, etc.) owned by the person in charge

7. According to recital 39 of the ICCPR " any data processing
should be lawful and fair. It should be clear about
natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected,
used, taken into account or otherwise processed,
as well as to what extent the data is submitted or will be processed. The beginning
it requires any information and communication regarding the processing of such
personal data to be easily accessible and understandable and to
uses clear and simple language. This principle concerns in particular the updating of
data subjects regarding the identity of the controller and their
processing purposes and further information to ensure fair and
transparent treatment in relation to such natural persons and their right to
receive confirmation and obtain communication of the relevant data
subject to processing. It should be notified to
natural persons the existence of risks, rules, guarantees and rights in relation to
processing of personal data and how to exercise their rights in
in relation to this processing. In particular, the specific purposes of their processing
personal data should be clear, legal and defined
at the time of collection of personal data. Staff data
should be sufficient and relevant and limited to what is necessary for them
purposes of their processing. This requires in particular to ensure that space
storage of personal data should be kept to a minimum. The
Personal data should only be processed if the
purpose of processing can not be achieved by other means. To ensure that the
personal data are not retained longer than necessary, o
the controller should set deadlines for their deletion or for
periodic review. Every reasonable measure should be taken in order to
ensure that inaccurate personal data is corrected or
deleted.

8. According to recital 60 GIPD " The principles of fair and transparent
require the data subject to be informed of its existence
processing act and its purposes. The controller should provide
to the data subject any further information necessary for the
ensuring fair and transparent treatment taking into account specific circumstances and
the context in which staff data is processed
character ".
9. According to the last paragraph ofrecital 39 of the ICCPR " The data
should be processed in such a way as to ensure
the appropriate protection and confidentiality of personal data,
including to prevent any unauthorized access to this data
personal equipment and equipment used for their processing or
use of such personal data and such equipment . 11
10. According to article 4 par. 12 GKP as a violation of personnel data
character means II breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful
destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access to data
personal information transmitted, stored or otherwise submitted
in process 11 •
According to the Guidelines of06-02-2018 of his Working Group
Article 29 of Directive 95/46 / EC (now the European Data Protection Council -
EDPB) for the Notification of personal data breach (" Guidelines on
Personal data breach notification under Regulation 201 6/679 WP 250 rev. 1) one of them
types of personal data breach is one that is categorized based on
principle of security of "confidentiality" when unauthorized access is established
in personal data ("confidentiality breach").
Violation of personal data also takes place with
illegal access to a server, and the taking of technical and organizational measures
server security is initially necessary to prevent it
associated risk due to the large volume of personal data contained in 9

• For more see Detailed Guide of the French Personal Data Protection Authority (CNIL)
"Security of Personal Data" which refers so much to the need for prior security measures for

in accordance with the European Network and Information Security Agency
(ENISA) 10 .
The collection and retention of personal data in the context
operation of a server without prior download of such necessary
technical and organizational security measures constitutes a breach of the principles set out in Article 5
par. 1 ed. a 'and f GKPD.
11. According to article 5 par. 1 in the GCP (" Principles governing processing
personal data ")" personal data shall be submitted to
processing in a way that guarantees the appropriate security of personnel data
including their protection against unauthorized or unlawful use
treatment and accidental loss, destruction or deterioration, using appropriate
technical or organizational measures ("integrity and confidentiality "), while in Article 32
par. 2 GKP is provided in the context of an assessment of an appropriate level of security h
taking into account the risk arising in particular from unauthorized access to data,
where an indicative list of security measures is given 1 1
The GCC requires the submission o f personal data that they have
has already been processed in accordance with the principles of article 5 par. I a 'to e' ' against
way that guarantees the appropriate security "(article 5 par. 1 par. f) so that in case
in which the principles other than that of security are met, to become in
processing is illegal. Respectively, if the intended processing from the beginning
is going to take place in a way that does not guarantee adequate security, it is unnecessary
the examination of the fulfillment of the principles provided by subsections a 'to e' of par. 1
of Article 5 of the ICCPR, as it will be unsafe and therefore illegal
processing.
In addition, the controller's obligation to "guarantee" safety
processing by taking appropriate technical and organizational measures
derives from the GCC-adopted risk-based approach ("risk
based approach ") so that" the degree of risk of each treatment becomes the key

servers in the context of GPA compliance and the risk of unauthorized access to personal
data stored on servers,

criterion for determining the extent of the relevant obligations " 12 (see also APDPH
51/2015 request sk. 4).
The European Court of Human Rights is in the same direction
in case I. v. Finland 13 examining an action on the basis of whether o
processor managed to "guarantee" the security of personnel data
found a violation of Article 8 of the ECHR by non-implementation of measures
security measures that led to unauthorized access to them.
Under the GCC state " integrity and confidentiality " have been reduced to
basic principles and conditions for the processing of personal data
No. 5 par. 1 ed. in GPD 14 so that the mentioned " appropriate technical and organizational
measures ", inter alia, to prevent, if implemented, any unauthorized
access to or use of the data and equipment used for
processing (see Application No. 39 of the GPA and the European Network Security Agency
and Information-ENISA 1s ). Therefore two of the three main goals of security
information systems (ie availability excluded) have been reduced to principles
and conditions for legal processing of personal data. The measures
they need to be more specific (see Article 32 of the GIP) and as required by its principle
and is determined by the provisions of article 24 par. 2 GCP, must
appropriate policies are applied, depending on the processing activities (see
All.MIX 6 7/2018). The existence of appropriate policy documents, approved by
administration of a body (responsible or executing the processing) applicable and
implemented in practice (a contrario APDP 98/2013 par. 5), is a basic criterion
to demonstrate compliance with the principle of integrity and confidentiality
(see APDPX 98/2013 ait. sk. 3. especially for information systems), to the extent that
lack of other evidence such as compliance with an approved code of conduct or
approved certification mechanism.

the freedoms of individuals versus the processing of personnel data
requires appropriate technical and organizational measures to
ensure that the requirements of this Regulation are complied with. In order to be able to
to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller should
establish internal policies and implement measures that respond in particular
principles of data protection already by design and by definition ".
13. According to Recital 82 GKPD " In order to prove
compliance with this Regulation, the controller or the executor
processing should keep records of the processing activities that are under
their responsibility ".
14. According to Recital 83 GKPD " To maintain security and
to avoid processing in breach of this Regulation, the responsible person
The processor or processor should evaluate the risks involved
develop and implement measures to mitigate these risks, such as
example through encryption. These measures should ensure appropriate

17. In order for personal data to be legally processed,
ie processing in accordance with the requirements of the GGP, should be met
cumulatively the conditions of application and observance of the principles of article 5 par. 1 GCP,
as is clear from the recent ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union
(CJEU) of 16-01-2019 in Case C-496/2017 Deutsche Post AG v Hauptzollamt
Cologne 21 . The existence of a legal foundation (art. 6 par. 1 GCC) does not exempt the
controller from the obligation to comply with the principles (art. 5 par. 1 GKP)
with regard to legitimacy, necessity and proportionality, the principle
of minimization 22 . In case of violation of any of
the principles set out in Article 5 ( I ) of the GIP, such processing shall be presented as non -
legal (subject to the provisions of the GCC) and there is no need to consider the conditions
implementation of the legal bases of Article 6 GIP 23 . Thus, the violation of the principles
of Article 5 of the GIPP illegal collection and processing of personnel data
character is not cured by the existence of a lawful purpose and legal basis ( cf.
Alli:iTIX 38/2004).
Moreover, the WEU with its decision of0l -10-2015 in the context of the case
C-201/14 (Smaranda Bara) considered as a condition for the fair and lawful processing of
personal data informing the data subject pre
of their processing 24
21 « 57 . However, any processing of personal data must be consistent with, on the one hand, the
principles to be observed with regard to data quality set out in Article 6 of the Directive

22 On this see L. Mitrou, the general regulation of personal data protection (new law-new
obligations-new rights), published by Sakkoula, 201 7 pp. 58 and 69-70.
23 Cf. !:1:E 5 1 7/201 8 par. 12: «\[ ... \] in order for the personal data to be legal
processing, it is required in each case to meet the cumulative conditions of article 4 par. I of
Law 2472/1997, which, among other things, stipulates that data must be collected and processed
in a lawful and lawful manner, for clear and lawful purposes ... Provided that the conditions of
article 4 par. 1 of law 2472/1997 (legal collection and processing of data for clear and legal
purposes), it is further examined whether the conditions of the provision of article 5 par. 2 of n.
2472/1997 \[legal bases\] ". Also, cf. CoE in Plenary Session 2285/200 1 par. 10: «\[ ... \] Only if
the above basic conditions are met, the provisions of articles 5 and 7 of the Law apply.
2472/1997, which impose as a farther additional, in principle, a condition for legal processing
personal data of a specific person, his consent ".
24 " 3 I. The person in charge of data processing or his representative have an obligation to inform the
content of which is set out in Articles IO and I I of Directive 95/46 and differs accordingly whether the
data are collected by the data subject or not, subject to reservation
of the exceptions provided for in Article 13 of that Directive \[ ... \] 34. Consequently, the requirement of a legitimate
data processing provided for in Article 6 of Directive 95/46 obliges the administrative authority to:
inform the data subjects about the transfer of such data to another
administrative authority for the purpose of processing them by the second as the recipient of such data ".
22
18. Further, the controller, in the context of its compliance
principle of fair or just processing of personal data, owes
inform the data subject that his data is to be processed
in a lawful and transparent manner (see WEU C-496/17 ibid., paragraph 59 and WEU C-201/14
of0l -10-2015 par. 31-35 and especially 34) and to be in a position at any time to
prove its compliance with these principles (accountability principle according to art. 5 par. 2
in combination with articles 24 par. 1 and 32 GCP).
Processing personal data in a transparent manner is recommended
manifestation of the principle of fair treatment and linked to the principle of accountability,
giving subjects the right to exercise control over their data
making those responsible for processing accountable, according to the Working Group
Article 29 2s
Exceptionally and pursuant to article 14 par. 5 ed. 2nd GCP (" Information
provided ifp ersonal data has not been collected by
data subject "), paragraphs 1-4 of the same article do not apply and no
the relevant information is provided by the controller if it is likely to
greatly impair the achievement of the objectives of such processing. Condition
implementation of this provision in accordance with the Working Party of Article 29 26 recommends
the processing (collection) of such personal data has been carried out
legally, ie in accordance with the principles of article 5 par. 1 GKPD.

19. In addition, a new, central compliance model was adopted with the GCC
size of which is the principle of accountability, within which the person in charge
is obliged to plan, implement and generally take the necessary measures
and policies to ensure that data processing complies with the relevant
legislative provisions. In addition, the controller is responsible for further
to prove on its own and at all times its compliance with
principles of article 5 par. l GK.PD. It is no coincidence that the GCC incorporates accountability
(Article 5 (2) GCC) in the regulation of the principles (Article 5 (1) GCC) governing
processing, giving it the function of a mechanism for their observance,
essentially reversing the "burden of proof' as to its legality

201 6/679) of 1 1 -4-201 8 (WP 260 rev. I), pp. 4 and 5.

23
(and in general the observance of the principles of article 5 par. l GCP),
transferring it to the controller, 21 so that it can be reasonably argued that he
bears the burden of invoking and proving the legality of the processing 2s .
Thus, it is the responsibility of the controller on the one hand to receive from
itself the necessary measures in order to comply with its requirements
On the other hand, to prove at all times its above compliance, without
in fact, the Authority should be required, in the context of the exercise of research-auditing
powers, to submit individual - specific questions and requests to
conformity assessment.
It is pointed out that the Authority due to the fact that the first period is elapsed
implementation of the GCP submits questions and requests in the context of the exercise of
its relevant research - control powers, in order to facilitate it on their part
accountants documentation of accountability. The controller must
in the context of the Authority's audits - investigations to present on its own and without
relevant questions and requests of the Authority the measures and policies adopted in
within the internal organization of his compliance, as he is aware of them
after designing and implementing the relevant internal organization.

20. Access by the controller, within an internal company
control, personal data stored on a hardware computer system and
software (server - server) is the processing of personal data,
as in the case of access to and control of a computer that uses
the subject (APDPX 34/2018).
The employer exercising his managerial right, under the self-evident condition
the observance of the principles of article 5 par. 1 GKPD and on the basis provided before
elaboration of specific procedures and guarantees within its organization
internal compliance in accordance with the principle of accountability, is entitled to exercise
control over the electronic media it provides to employees for
their work, provided that the relevant processing, in accordance with the principle of proportionality,
is absolutely necessary for the satisfaction of the legitimate interest it pursues and
provided that this obviously takes precedence over his rights and interests

21. Essential element of the legal operation of information systems and others
infrastructure and communication systems in the processing of personnel data
It is advisable to take appropriate security measures, in particular physical measures and
logical separation of hardware, software and data 29
22. In order to examine the legality of the access of the person in charge
processing no. 5 and 6 par. 1 GKPD in the personal data of
entities maintained in its corporate systems in the context of internal control,
previously examined no. 5 and 6 par. 1 GKP legality of the original
collection, processing and storage of personal data
character in systems. The illegal original collection, processing and preservation of
personal data e.g. on her computer or server
also makes any subsequent or further illegal (with

that is, a different purpose to the original no. 6 par. 4 GK.PD) distinct and independent
processing of the same personal data as in her case
copy them and save them on another digital storage medium ( eg usb stick,
server, pc, etc.), but even further in that of their transmission and use, even
in the event that the conditions for the application of a legal one would be met
based on article 6 par. 1 GK.PD, as e.g. that of subsection f, after non-compliance
of the processing principles of article 5 par. 1 GK.PD is not cured by the existence
legal purpose and legal basis (see recital no. 17 hereof and
cf. AIIMIX 38/2004).
23. Prerequisite for the transfer of personal data outside European
Union, provided that its general principles, procedures, conditions and guarantees are met

personal data of its former and current employees, in addition to
previous legal collection and processing of personal data

there are legal grounds 32 and the conditions of Chapter V are self-evident

24. ABS, a subsidiary of AMPNl (parent company of the AMRNI Group),
notified the Authority of a data breach incident no. 33 fKIL􀍝 which

consisted of unauthorized access and copying from its server
ABS of this full content. As culprits of his illegal copying
server (ABS) company indicated the parent company of the same Group,
AMPNI and the company EY Hellas. In addition, ABS filed a complaint for
violation of personal data legislation to the detriment of companies
AMPNI and EV Hellas, while it requested the issuance of an act of suspension and prohibition
processing the copied content of its server.
The controlled company AMPNI briefly claimed that it legally acquired
access to the ABS server because the latter was a subsidiary
and held 100% of its share capital, that the contents of the e-mails were
corporate and therefore on the one hand belong to its property - property, on the other hand, do not belong
in the protection of personal data legislation, that access has taken place
in the context of internal corporate control and therefore the provision provided by
article 6 par. 1 par. the legal basis of the overriding legal interest given to it
provided the right of access and control as well as that the final copy of the whole
ABS server content became necessary, despite the fact that
The original design of the audit concerned targeted access to small e-mails
" Cf. the position of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) according to which in case
in which the data under cross-border transmission has been collected illegally, it is prohibited to
cross-border their transmission ( see !JnP.s://edp s .europa .eu/data-protection/data-protection/referencelibrfilY.

number of specific employees and executives of the AMPNI Group, because randomly
detected on the day of the audit, the operation of illegal deletion software already
deleted files on the server and thus a complete copy was obtained
security (back up).
The ABS company, before the withdrawal of the complaint against it
AMPNI, briefly argued that from the outset the targeting of the controlled AMPNI was
copy of the entire server (server) that included personal data
employees and executives of third companies as it emerged from relevant letters sent to her
were sent by AMPNI and not the targeted copying of specific e-mails
natural persons, that the audited company AMPNI illegally copied it
total content of the server due to the refusal of. . . ( . . . ) N to

accepts the request for copying because it relied on a relevant legal opinion from
which resulted in the illegality of such processing and that the illegality of the request
Copy of the server (server) results from the by the controlled company
AMPNI sending a letter declaring the exemption in advance
("Amnesty") ofN from any kind ofliability in case oflegal action
proceedings against him due to copying.
25. In the present case, it emerged at the discretion of the Authority that ABS,
subsidiary of the parent company AMR NI of the same Group, was the owner
servers that were installed in the office premises
where the Group's companies were housed on Akti Kondili 10 in Piraeus after
lease from the company "AEGEAN WAREHOUSES SA".
On the above-mentioned servers (servers) owned by the company ABS had
DANAOS software was installed and operated under a contract of use and
on the basis of a license obtained by the company "AEGEAN SHIPPING MANAGEMENT"
("ASM"), which, however, did not belong to the AMPNI Group. It should be noted that on
30-10-2018 and after the control process had already started by the Authority within it
in the present case, ABS entered into separate service contracts and
software maintenance with the company that provided the DANAOS software with respect to
companies of the AMR NI Group.
In the same computer infrastructure (hardware and software) except DANAOS (where
e-mails were saved), including virtual file servers
servers) AMPFSl (where fileshare and usershare files were stored) and AMPFS2 (where
27
attachments of e-mails stored in DANAOS), as shown in
in particular from the statements of12-7-2018 and 17-12-2018 . . . ofEY LLP
from 18-12-2018 statement of. . . of ABS 0, which was presented and invoked by
AMPNI.
The above hardware and software computing infrastructure (DANAOS, AMPFSI and
AMPFS2) was used to make electronic communications
e-mails from both employees and executives in the Group companies
AMPNI, as well as by employees and executives in third companies, outside the AMPNI Group
as in "Aegean Shipping Enterprises", "Aegean Agency" and "Aegean Oil"

(according to the statement of 0, op. cit.), but also in "Aegean Net Fuels Ltd Fze", Aegean
Lubes "and" Aegean Gas " 33
It is important that the ABS company, before its recall
had responded to relevant written questions from the Authority that companies outside
of the AMPNI Group used informally and without any written contract the
infrastructure and servers of the company ABS (prot. no. APDPX G /EIS / 7522 / 20-09-2018),
referring in fact to the letter of 03/7/2018 of the P AMPNI N Group, the
who stated that ABS has not entered into hosting and supply contracts
services with other companies.
It should be noted that N, employee on behalf of the AMPNI Group as . . . ( . . . ),
was hired by the company AEGEAN MANAGEMENT SERVICES"-" AMS", ie
from another company of the AMPNI Group (see Supplementary Memorandum AMPNI-ABS of
19-12-2018 pp. 9 and 10, AIIMIX r /EU: / 10259 / 19-12-2018).
Finally, the memoranda of AMPNI show that both companies are owned
in its Group, as well as third companies, outside the Group, used it
computer infrastructure (hardware and software) for the processing of electronics
correspondence of employees and executives, even accepting that it proceeded to
copying information of 34 third parties related to companies outside
Group and used the same computer infrastructure: " There was never any

" As noted above and will be developed below, AMPNI claims that this is

The reference by AMRNI to personal data in its memoranda is recommended

intends to copy information other than the collection of specific data that
concerned the 18 users and related files related to the internal investigation
described above. Any further copying of information that has taken place

sole purpose of protecting against malicious permanent destruction of critical evidence

pp. 16-17). Similarly, AMPNI stated that "\[ ... \] personal data of physicists
persons not affiliated in any way, now or in the past, with the Group
AMP NI under any relationship of employment, provision of services or otherwise or which is otherwise
pending criminal and I or civil investigations, then AMPNI would be willing to
delete the data concerning such natural persons and provide
evidence of this "(see Supplementary Memorandum AMPNI-ABS of 19-12-
2018 p. 23, Allt.IIX f' / EII: / 10259 / 19-12-2018 as well as Supplementary Memorandum
AMPNI-ABS of05-4-2019 pp. 8 and 12 AIMIIX f' / EII: / 2616 I 05-4-2019).
above copy of the entire contents of the computing infrastructure h
controlled company AMPNI created a new archiving system, a copy of which
which he forwarded to Manchester in the United Kingdom.
Finally, AMRNI stated that in the same common area (" computer room-computer
room ») were installed and more servers were running and
other companies whose offices are housed in the same building and which do not
related to the AMRNI Group (APDPH CI EIS / 7306 / 10-9-2018 p. 2 paragraph 3).
It follows from all of the above that both the parent company AMRNI and
subsidiaries of its Group, as well as third companies, outside the AMRNI Group, made
use and had physical access to the same area where they were located and
operated more servers (servers) of companies of both the AMPNI Group and
and third party companies and other legal entities outside the AMPNI Group but also
physical and logical access to the same computing infrastructure (hardware and software
DANAOS, AMPFS 1, AMPFS2) for the processing of e-mail
employees and their executives by processing the systems
electronic communications archiving. The above accesses and edits
personal data took place without any action being taken
physical and logical separation, and the person appointed as Head . . . ( . . . ) of the AMPNI Group
was hired by a Group company in order to provide services for both

With the
companies of the AMRNI Group, as well as for third companies outside the AMRNI Group, while the
licensing and service agreement with the software company DANAOS
was concluded by a third company outside the AMPNI Group to finally establish that
any kind of processing of personal data took place informally, without

the existence of any agreement between the companies inside and outside the AMRNI Group that
shared the same hardware and software infrastructure, without downloading any essentials
technical or organizational measure of internal compliance with the provisions of the FGM,
without relevant demarcations, resulting, as the documents show, to be set

civil courts to be resolved through the interlocutory proceedings
(AIIMIX I r /E IL / 733 / 30-01-2019).

hearing (see APDPH no. prot. G /EX / 5414-1 / 26-6-2018 and APDPX no. prot.
G I EX I 6211-1 / 14-8-2018), as well as during the hearing requested from the audited company
AMPNI, among other things, to document its compliance as it had

was requested in particular by the Authority among others, both at the hearing and before
of this (see APDPH no. prot. G /EX / 6211-1 / 14-8-2018 p. 2) to clarify " if and with

27. The audited company AMR NI before the hearing and instead ofresponding t o no.
prot. APDPH CI EX I 5414-1 / 26-6-2018 document of the Authority submitted the from 13-8-2018
Application for Treatment for the revocation ofno. 2/2018 of his Interim Order
Chairman of the Authority without finally responding to any of the details
stated requests of the Authority, without substantiating no. 5 par. 2 GKPD the legal
operation of the infrastructure used (hardware and software - servers) that
supports the processing of personal data ( especially e-mails),
without providing any written documentation of internal compliance
to the FSAP, in particular to the requirements of secure data processing
without stating the necessary technical and organizational measures
received and without providing any personnel data management policy
character, no safety policy, no employee regulations and no one
proof of informing the subjects about the processing of their data and
the exercise of their related rights but also for the possibility of doing so
control in their e-mails.
The then complainant ABS, in response to the same document of the Authority
presented with the no. prot. AII􀆳IIX r / EI:E / 5935 / 04-07-2018 memorandum of documents
security policy, but which lacked chronology, signature, approval as well
and proof of their application, in addition they were not said to concern an unclear one
designated legal entity under the name "AEGEAN".
The audited company AMPNI then provided clarifications on the
questions asked by the Authority with no. prot. AIIMIX r /ES / 6211-1 / 14-8-2018
document, but again without documenting no. 5 par. 2 GKPD the legal
operation of the infrastructure used (hardware and software - servers) and
without providing any written documentation of internal compliance
to the GCC.
The then complainant ABS, in response to the same document of the Authority with the
No. prot. AIIAfIX r / EI:E / 7522 / 20-9-2018 document stated that the submitted by

The same Policies are drafted outside the European Union and specifically in the USA
as well as that they are applied by the parent company AMPNI, without presenting
relevant evidence. In addition, she claimed that the person presented in her memorandum
" AEGEAN Rules of Procedure " has been drafted exclusively for the subsidiaries
AMRNI companies and that no reference is made to their control
corporate e-mails of employees or how the company can proceed
above act for which the parent company is solely responsible and not the
same. Finally, in the same memorandum, ABS stated that both AMPNI Group companies and
and third companies outside the AMR NI Group use all informal and without any
written contract the infrastructure and servers of the company ABS.
28. During the meeting of05-12-2019 before the Authority, the company ABS, then
replacement of her legal representative and her attorney,
withdrew its complaint, which has no legal consequences for
continue the examination of the case before the Authority as it is not about one
private civil law dispute the subject matter of which is disposed of in accordance with
will of the parties. In addition, the Authority carries out ex officio audits on the basis of
information received regarding the breach of personal data
of subjects.
The company AMPNI both during the hearing before the Authority against
the meeting of05-12-2019, and later with the no. prot. AilMIX

in compliance not with the provisions of no. 679/2016 of the General Regulation
Data Protection or Directive 95/46 / EC but in compliance with the provisions
32

of the US legislation "Sarbanes Oxley Act 2002" ("SOX") and in particular the section (hereinafter
"Article") 404, as indicated on each page of that policy.
In particular, this US law was passed to address
corporate financial scandals and concerns corporate governance and
disclosure of financial transactions under which the provisions
law companies (whose securities are traded on US stock exchanges)
are obliged to integrate and implement internal control procedures as well
and to prepare annual financial reports to the Commission
US Securities and Exchange Commission ("Security Exchanges Commission -" SEC ") 35 , which include
Internal Controls Report for financial transactions
and the reliability of financial statements ("financial statements"). That said
report shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Article 404 SOX Act. Specifically, with
Article 404 SOX Act 36 introduces the obligation and responsibility of the company management to
set up, install and operate an internal control system
procedures related to the preparation of the company's financial statements
submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and includes a
an internal audit report evaluating the effectiveness and
reliability of the internal control system during the previous annual management
use 37 .
From the above in conjunction with the content of this security policy
information systems under Article 404 SOX Act USA it appears that it does not
take into account the risks involved in data protection
personal data of the subjects through the use of the computer infrastructure
(DANAOS hardware and software, AMPFSl , AMPFS2) but aims to ensure
of the necessary corporate information to achieve the objectives described
above in relation to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Decision 44/2019
From reading the US Article 404 SOX Act policy relied on by
AMPNI, moreover, the absence of any reference to
protection of personal data pursuant to the GIP or the Directive
95/46 I EC as well as any reference and measure of its internal organization
compliance with the principles of Article 5 GIP and the legal bases of Article 6
GPD, indicatively does not lack any provision in relation to: a) their rights
subjects (Articles 12-22 GCC), (b) the application of appropriate techniques; and
organizational measures in order to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the
processing is carried out in accordance with the GCP (article 24 par. 1 in combination with
Articles 25 and 30 of the ICCPR) and ( c) the application of appropriate technical and organizational measures
processing safety measures (Article 32 GIP). In addition, it is absent
any provision regarding the permissibility or not of the use of corporate infrastructure
electronic communication by AMPNI employees and executives in relation to
surveillance, access and control of electronic communications
AMPNI employees and executives and, if so, the terms, procedures and
guarantees to carry out relevant checks and investigations on personal data
their.
Finally, the US Article 404 SOX Act policy that provides and
cites AMPNI does not address the risks arising from
processing of personal data (see application no. 75 GKPD).
Finally, the controlled company AMPNI submitted together with ABS the no. prot.
AIIMIX r /En: / 2616 / 05-4-2019 supplementary memorandum to counter the
memoranda of the complainants and L, former legal representative of ABS, without
but again to document no. 5 par. 2 GKP its legal operation
used infrastructure (hardware and software - servers) and without
provide any written documentation of its internal compliance with
the GCC.
29. Moreover, the controlled company AMPNI, despite its requests and questions
At first, both before the hearing and during the hearing, he did not answer
did not document as it should due no. 5 par. 1 GPD the legality of the processing
personal data in the context of the operation of the used
infrastructure (hardware and software - "original servers").

In particular, it follows from all the above that the controlled company AMPNI
as controller did not take any internal compliance measures no. 5
par. 1 and 6 par. 1 GKPD in relation to the legal operation of the used
infrastructure (hardware and software - "original servers" DANAOS, AMPFSl ,
AMPFS2) which supports the processing of personal data (in particular
e-mails) included in an archiving system, nor provided by anyone
such written documentation of such internal compliance required by the GCC
according to no. 5 par. 2 GKPD, in particular to the requirements of secure data processing
of a personal nature, nor did it take the necessary technical and organizational measures no. 5
par. 1 ed. fin combination with no. 24 par. 1, 2 and 31 par. 1, 2 GKPD to guarantee the
appropriate security of personal data, including
protecting them from unauthorized or illegal processing and accidental loss,
destruction or deterioration (" integrity and confidentiality " ), nor did it appear to have been designed,
prepared and implemented in compliance with the provisions of article 5 par. I GCP the
any accountability measure referred to in recitals no. 11
and 16 hereof, including personnel data management policies
nature and security policies in accordance with the requirements of the GCP, nor received
measures of physical and / or rational segregation, nor produced a staff regulation or
another internal document containing provisions on data protection
nor provided any proof of their information
subjects for the processing of their personal data during
operation of the computer infrastructure used (hardware and software;
"Original servers" (DANAOS, AMPFSl , AMPFS2), the exercise ofrelated
their rights but also for the possibility of checking their e-mails.
On the contrary, the controlled company AMRNI focused its arguments
verbally at later or further stages in the processing of the same data,
that is, at the stage of access to the e-mail control servers (stage 2), in
subsequent copying (stage 3) and transmission to Manchester, United Kingdom (d)
stage) of the contents of the original servers ("copy server" ),
claiming that the conditions of article 6 par. 1 par. in the GCC for
processing of personal data, again without substantiating
No. 5 par. 2 GKPD the no. 5 par. 1 GCP legality of data processing

personal character sufficient for the verbal invocation of article 6 par. 1 ed. f
GPD on overriding legal interest. However, it was also extended to
3 5
Recital no. 17 o f the present, the processing o f personnel data
in violation of the principles of article 5 par. 1 GKPD is not treated by
existence oflegal purpose and legal basis no. 6 par. 1 GKPD.
In this case, the controlled company AMPNI had the obligation,
after proving that he owed no. 5 par. 2 GKP the taking and implementation of measures
compliance with the provisions of Articles 5 (1) and 6 (1) of the GIP
legality of the processing of personal data that took place
in the computer infrastructure used (hardware and software "prototypes
DANAOS, AMPFSl , AMPFS2), to then prove no. 5 par. 2
GKPD, also the legality no. 5 par. 1 and 6 par. 1 GKPD, of the later ones
(for the initial purposes) or further (for different purposes according to no. 6 par. 4
GPD) independent and distinct processing operations, namely: b) access and
checking the e-mails held on the servers, c) creating one
new archiving system after copying the original system
archiving and d) the transmission of the copy archiving system
(server - back up according to AMPNI) in Manchester, United Kingdom (see
with no. prot. All.MIX r /EU: / 7306 / 10-9-2018 O"l::A.. 6 K(ll AIIAfIX r /EI􀃎/ 7434 I 17-9-2018 O"l::A..
6 AMPNI documents).
In view of the above, given that the original collection, preservation and in general
processing of personal data contained in the systems
archiving of computer infrastructure (hardware and software "originals
DANAOS, AMPFS 1, AMPFS2) has already been deemed illegal and infringing
the provisions of article 5 par. 1 GCP and especially those of articles 5 par. 1 ed. a 'and f
and par. 2 in conjunction with articles 24 par. 1 and 2 and 32 par.
that subsequent or further processing of the same personnel data
character and in particular the access and control of e-mails, the copying of their content
"Original servers" and the creation of a new system
archiving, sending the new archiving-copy system to
Manchester United are also illegal and violate the whole
of the principles of article 5 par. 1 and 2 but also article 6 par. 1 GCC, as integral

linked to and originating from the original illegal processing of the data
personal character of the "original server" archiving system.
30. As a result of the above deficiencies, the Authority further notes, in accordance with
facts accepted in no. 25 recital, that the same
36
computer infrastructure (DANAOS server hardware and software, AMPFSI , AMPFS2)
used for the subsequent or further processing of personnel data
character (e-mails) of subjects who worked and were associated with both his companies
AMPNI Group, as well as with third companies, outside the AMPNI Group, without having received the
necessary measures of physical and logical separation resulting in its administrator
system- computer infrastructure to access and process for
AMPNI company account of personal data (e-mails) of subjects
of data not related to the same 38 • Hence the lack of
appropriate technical and organizational measures, in particular those requiring the natural
and logical separation, the threatened risk of confidentiality occurred and
integrity of personal data through access, copying and
their transfer to Manchester, United Kingdom.
It follows from the above that the subsequent or further processing, by
access, copying and transmission to Manchester,
personal data of individuals related to the Group
AMPNI was illegal because it concerned personal data that
from the beginning they had not been legally processed, while in terms of personnel data
nature of natural persons related to third companies outside the AMR NI Group,
in addition to the lack of physical and logical separation measures.
31. In view of the above, the Authority considers that the audited company AMR NI as responsible
processing:
on the one hand, did not apply all the principles of article 5 par. I GCP and 6 par. 1
GGP on the legality of the processing of personal data
(especially e-mails) that took place in the computer infrastructure used (hardware and
(original server software (DANAOS, AMPFSI , AMPFS2)), but also in
any subsequent or further processing of the same personnel data

character, nor proved by no. 5 par. 2 GPD the observance of these.
on the other hand, violated the provisions of articles 5 par. l ed. a 'and f and par. 2 in
in conjunction with Articles 24 (1) and (2) and 32 (1) and (2) of the GIPA on its principle
secure processing (in particular of the "confidentiality") of personnel data
" Cf. the printouts of the e-mails submitted through her memos

37
character that took place in the computing infrastructure used (hardware and
original server software (DANAOS, AMPFS l , AMPFS2) from non-download
appropriate technical and organizational measures, but also in the context of any subsequent
or further processing of the same personal data, as necessary
the examination of the observance of the principles of processing of subsections b ', c', d 'and e' of par. 1 of
article 5 as well as article 6 par. 1 GKPD, according to what was accepted in no.
Recital 11 hereof.
32. The objections and allegations of the audited company AMPNI:
i. As to the objection that the GCC does not apply in accordance with article 3 par. 1
as " \[ ... \] AMRNI is a company based in the Republic of the Marshall Islands
(Marshall Islands), is listed on the NY Stock Exchange and is its head
AMRNI Group. AMRNI does not have an installation in Greece but maintains only one
mailing address in Piraeus. ABS is a 1 00% subsidiary of AMP NL Therefore,
AMP NI does not have the same facility in Greece \[ ... \] the purpose of export I copying
data .... had nothing to do with the activities of the companies of the AMP NI Group
in GREECE. That is, there is no relationship between the purpose for which they were exported
data and the activities of Greek companies .. »( see Supplementary
Memorandum AMRNI and ABS APDPH no. prot. r /EI􀃎/ 10259 / 19-12-2018 p. 5-8).
From article 3 par. 1 GCP, recital 22 GCC and sub
consultation Guidelines 3/2018 of the European Protection Council
Given the territorial scope of the GGP, it follows that the GGP applies
in the processing of personal data in the context of its activities
installation of the controller, which presupposes the substantial and
actual exercise of an activity, which should not be construed narrowly and

typologically as with criterion e.g. the place ofregistration of the company in the relevant registers
registration (see WEU C-210/2016 Facebook (fan page) decision of05-6-2018 Application Sk.
in particular 56 and 53-55, 57, C-230/14 Weltimmo v NAIH decision of0l/10/2015 Ait. Sk. Especially
29 as well as 31).
In this case, the controlled company AMPNI only argues
on the subsequent or further processing of access-control of e-mails and
copying the contents of servers without interfering
claims on the legality of the original collection, preservation and processing of
personal data included in its archiving systems
38
computer infrastructure (DANAOS "original server" hardware and software,
AMPFS I , AMPFS2).
This computing infrastructure (hardware and software "prototypes
DANA OS, AMPFS I , AMPFS2) at the critical time was
established in Greece and specifically in Piraeus on the Kondili Coast no. I 0,
owned by ABS, a subsidiary of AMPNI and according to a statement
of AMPNI itself (see no. prot. APDPH G /EIS / 7306 / 10-9-2018 document ofp.
2): " The Server belongs to the AMPNI Group and in particular, was purchased together with the required
equipment, earlier in 2018, by ABS, member of the AMRNI Group and 1 00% subsidiary
of the Company ".
In addition, it turned out that the use of servers that were installed on
Greece and the processing of personal data through them received
country following decisions by AMPNI, which determined the purpose and manner
processing no. 4 par. 7 GKPD both for itself and for its subsidiaries
companies in the exercise of its activities. Further, according to a statement
of AMPNI itself ( see document no.
2): " The Server belongs to ABS, a member of the AMPNI Group. That is, in terms of ownership,
has been purchased from ABS. ABS, however, does not process personal data for
account of the Company ".
In addition to the above and in the alternative, the claim should be rejected;
AMPNI 's objection that it has no real but postal facility only in
Greece and that it is based in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Marshall Islands) given
that she declares the address of Akti Kondili 10, in Piraeus as the address

installation and actual operation first, before the Authority with the
submitted Application for Treatment (see prot. no. APDPH I GI EIS / 6211 / 13-7-2018 p. 1) and
second, before the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as it turns out
from Annexes A and B attached to the aforementioned Application
Treatment, as well as from the annual report of 16/5/2017 39 which he refers to
C I EIS / 7306 / 10-9-2018 her document to the Authority and from which the statement results
of the following items: AEGEAN MARINE PETROLEUM NETWORK INC., 10, Akti
,. Cf. her to􀃦geanmarine.gcs-web.com/static-files/ebca7627-4368-4e6c-9a75-45862ad60cac
39
Kondili (Address of Principal Executive Office), Piraeus 185 45, Greece (the underlining
and bold from the Annexes),
For these reasons, the Authority rejects its objection - allegation
controlled company AMPNI.
ii. As to the objection according to which the US Bankruptcy Court
of the Southern District of New York issued an order with global force no. 362
(a) The US Bankruptcy Code under the AMPNI Bankruptcy Application, which provides:
according to her allegations, on the one hand, its continuation before the Authority is prohibited
proceedings, on the other hand, the exercise of control over a bankruptcy asset
property, which according to the audited company AMRNI includes' \[ ... \] certain, if
not all, from the data under discussion are assets of the bankruptcy
property »
In this case, by no provision of national or European
legislation, but not by any international or other bilateral - transnational convention
it appears that the cited US Bankruptcy Court order produces
legal results in Greece, nor does the audited company AMPNI claim such
nor does it produce a Greek court decision recognizing
enforceability of such a foreign court order.
In addition, the audited company AMRNI misinterpreted the national and
European legislation on the protection of personal data

as a given in order to submit the relevant objection - claim that the data
personal information processed by the controller recommend
His "property" and therefore part of his "property", as will be demonstrated below.
For these reasons, the Authority rejects its objection - allegation
controlled company AMPNI.
iii. As to the allegation-objection that the complaint against the controlled company
ABS was submitted without right and therefore inadmissible by legal and not natural
person no. 77 par. 1 GKPD, ie the subsidiary ABS resulting in h
issued under no. 2/2018 Temporary Order of the President of the Authority to suffer
invalidity and that ABS withdrew its complaint against the auditee
of AMPNI company, is additionally pointed out under no. 28 recital
of the present that the audit was carried out ex officio according to no. 57 par. 1 ed. a 'and h'
40
GPD based on the information received by the Authority primarily from 18-6-2018
Notification of Data Violation Case submitted by ABS
(AIILllIX / r /EU: / 5432 / 18-6-2018). In any case, even if unacceptable
the complaint was submitted by the company ABS, the Authority is entitled no. 57 par. 1 ed. a'
and the GKPD in combination with no. 19 par. 1 case law 2472/199 7 to carry out
ex officio checks and investigations with only the information received for real
cases of breach of existing data protection legislation
personal. In addition, the Authority is entitled no. 19 par. 1 per. Iy 'v.
2472/199 7, but is not obliged to file requests or complaints that are judged
manifestly, vaguely, unfoundedly or submitted abusively or anonymously. Therefore, from
the above provisions, which apply as they do not conflict with
GPA (see APDP 46/18 and 52/18) it appears that the Authority had the right to
carry out an audit with only the factual information independently
the validity or not of the complaint.
In addition, the President of the Authority despite the submission on behalf of the company ABS
application for a temporary order, issued ex officio the no. 2/2018
Interim Order, taking note of the facts relied on
as it appears from the body of the Provisional Order itself to which it does not refer
that it accepts that request. Therefore the no. 2/2018 Interim Order of

President of the Authority does not suffer invalidity.
Finally, the ABS company withdrew its complaint against it
controlled company ABS, but also the complaint of inadmissible complaint by a lawyer
person do not find support in any provision of law given that it is not about
a private civil law dispute the subject matter of which is disposed of in accordance with
the will of the parties, and in addition, as stated above, the Authority investigates ex officio
any information on breaches of personnel data protection legislation
character (ad hoc AIIt.IIX 136/2015 mt. enc. 6 par. a ').
For these reasons, the Authority rejects its objections - allegations
controlled company AMPNI.
iv. As to the objection-allegation of inadmissibility of the individual complaints
natural persons because they have not previously contacted the controller
in order to exercise their rights under Articles 15-22 GCP, before
It should be noted that, on the one hand, the provisions of Article 77
41
par. 1 GPD it appears that every data subject has the right to submit
direct complaint to the Authority if it considers that the processing of personnel data
violates the GPA. In this case, the natural
persons denounced the violation of the GCP against them and not the non
satisfactory response of the audited company AMPNI in the exercise of
their rights under Articles 15-22 GCP.
In addition, as stated above, the Authority is engaged on its own initiative and investigates
any fact of violation of the current legislation for the protection of
personal data, whether or not the complainants bear the
burden of proving their allegations as well as whether or not they prove their validity
of their allegations.
In this case, the complainants complained about
alleged illegal copying of their personal data
were included in the computer infrastructure archiving systems (hardware and
"original server software" (DANAOS, AMPFSl , AMPFS2). The beginning
in order to verify the legality of such copying, it proceeded ex officio to

investigating the legality of the original collection, preservation and processing of
personal data included in the "original servers".
As already stated, the obligation to prove no. 5 par. 2 GPD of legality
of each treatment no. 5 par. I and 6 par. I GKPD is the responsibility of the person in charge
processing and not the data subject.
For these reasons, the Authority rejects its objection - allegation
controlled company AMPNI.
v. Regarding the objection-claim that the corporate e-mails exchanged by
Corporate e-mail accounts are not data
personal property and that they constitute an "asset" belonging to
"Ownership" of the company, the Authority has already rejected the relevant claim on the basis of
recitals 4, 5 and 6 hereof in order to reach a conclusion
that the audited company processed personal data
were included in a computer infrastructure archiving system (hardware and
"original server software" (DANAOS, AMPFSI , AMPFS2) without complying with
the principles of article 5 par. I and 6 par. I GKPD as well as in violation of its principle
safe processing no. 5 par. I ed. a 'and f GKPD.
42
Moreover, in this case, the fact that the email addresses
(e-mails) had as their first component, identifiers of the usemame, ie
of the form ovoga./i,nmvugo@-mtP-ia.gr is enough for their characterization as data
without the need to check the content of e-mails
in order to determine whether it is professional or private correspondence
or if they come from a corporate or private e-mail account,
in accordance with what has been accepted in recitals 4, 5 and 6 hereof.
Therefore, the claim of the controlled company AMPNI according to which the
Complainants must provide "personal" e-mails that
sent from non-corporate (private) email accounts
and include content copied personal data
by AMPNI in order to prove the validity of their complaint, on the one hand no
based on the above, on the other hand, the Authority considered that
the principles of article 5 par. I GCP and 6 par. 1 GCP regarding its legality

processing of personal data, ie the set of e-mails that
took place in the computer infrastructure used (hardware and software
"Original servers" DANAOS, AMPFSl , AMPFS2), but also any
subsequent or further processing of the same personal data,
so that there is no need to respond to the individual complaints of individuals, as it will
discussed below.
Finally, as already accepted with no. 6 recital of this o
claim of the audited company AMRNI according to which the data
personal belonging to the "property" or "property" of it comes in full
contrary to national and European law and that the controller does not
is the "owner" of the personal data it processes.
If the controller was the "owner" of the personnel data
character to be processed would not be introduced as a rule by article 6 par. 1 GCP h
ban on the processing of personal data so that it is required to
one of the legal bases provided there in order to legalize the
processing, nor would the data subject be granted a set of rights on it
control of personal data (art. 12-22 GKPD), in particular
objection, restriction, deletion or portability rights.
For these reasons, the Authority rejects its objection - allegation
controlled company AMPNI.
43
vi. Regarding the objection - claim of the controlled company AMRNI that any download
taken into account by the Authority new evidence presented by the complainants
after the end of the hearing violates her right to be heard, she must in principle
It should be noted that the audited company, on the one hand, received knowledge and copies of the documents
submitted by the complainants after the hearing as well
deadline of 15 days in order to submit its views on them (APDP no.
prot. G /EX / 2214 / 21-3-2019), on the other hand, she also presented new evidence after
the end of the hearing, but also placed on the allegations and the evidence
material provided by the complainants after the hearing (see Supplementary
Memorandum AMPNI & ABS with no. prot. AIMTIX r /EI􀃎/ 2616 I 05-4-2019).
In addition, it is not provided for in any provision of the CPC or other legislation

Prohibition of presenting new evidence after the end of the hearing
audited or that all the evidence on which the Authority will judge
must have been gathered before the hearing at a hearing given that the
The purpose of the hearing is to provide explanations and information for clarification
issues that may even have first arisen during it
as is the case with other constitutional hearings
established independent administrative authorities such as e.g. its Security Authority
Privacy of Communications (ADAE).
vii. As to the allegation - objection of the audited company about illegal
extension of the granted deadline for submission of a memorandum after the hearing will
It should be noted that the extension was legal since the controlled company AMPNI
together with ABS submitted a request for the exclusion of the rapporteur of the case after
commencement and during the submission deadline resulting in
the deadline for issuing a decision on the request for exemption is automatically suspended
and until a new deadline is provided. In no case could the
initial deadline for submitting a memorandum after the hearing, if not previously
the Department of the Authority decides on the request for exemption. On the contrary, on her part
controlled company AMPNI together with ABS, submission of memorandum by hearing
pending the request for exclusion of the rapporteur which they themselves had submitted and without
await the issuance of the decision on the exemption request comes in full
contrary to the request for exemption itself as on the one hand the companies requested the
44
with the exception of the rapporteur, while on the other hand they submitted a memorandum to the Department of Authority
in which the rapporteur participated.
For these reasons, the Authority rejects its objection - allegation
controlled company AMPNI.
viii. The audited company AMRNI makes the following allegations: that legally
entered the computer infrastructure used (hardware and software "prototypes
DANAOS, AMPFSl , AMPFS2) in order to
e-mail of specific individuals, former and current employees
and AMPNI Group executives, that these inspections were legal, that accidental
software for deleting already deleted files was discovered to make it
it is necessary to copy the entire computing infrastructure used,
including personal data (e-mails) of individuals
related to third party companies outside the AMR NI Groups, that there was no obligation
notification of an incident of personal data breach to the Authority by
detection of "malware" deletion, that as an employer he had under Article 6
par. 1 ed. GPP over legal interest in checking and copying e-mails
in the context of the audit carried out, that he was not obliged to inform the
data subjects, either before copying or after copying e-mails
their.
A prerequisite for answering the above allegations is, as stated above
in accordance with recitals no. 17, 18, 22, 29 and 30 of the present but also
from no. 3/2018 Provisional Order of the President of the Authority, the proof of it
legality of the initial processing (collection and preservation) of the data
of a personal nature taking place in the computing infrastructure used
(hardware and software of"original servers" DANAOS, AMPFSl , AMPFS2).
Given that the Authority considered it illegal and in particular a violation of the principle
of safe processing the original collection, preservation and generally processing of
personal data included in its archiving systems
computer infrastructure (DANAOS "original server" hardware and software,
AMPFSl , AMPFS2), it is provided that subsequent or further processing of the same
personal data, namely the access and control of e-mails, h
copy the contents of the "original servers" to a "server copy"
with which a new archiving system was created (back up according to AMR NI) and
45
the sending of the new archiving-copy system to his Manchester
United Kingdom are also illegal and violate all of its principles
Article 5 par. 1 and 2 but also Article 6 par. 1 GCC, as inextricably linked
and derived from the initial illegal processing of personnel data
the nature of the "original server" archiving system so that it is redundant
the examination of both the complaints of the natural persons and the one to be rebutted
examination of the claims of the controlled company AMPNI that focus
exclusively in the subsequent or further processing of personnel data
character. That is, even if their complaints had not been submitted
natural persons ( concerning subsequent or further processing), would be
copying the "original server" is illegal due to not filling them in from the beginning
conditions for the legal processing of personal data contents.
Thus, the invocation of the legal basis by the controlled company AMPNI
of article 6 par. 1 par. in the GCC for control, access, copying and
sending the content of the "original servers" (servers), but also invoking
of the need to copy due to "malware" detection can not
retroactively legitimize the earlier processing of
personal data in violation of articles 5 par. 1 and 6 par. 1 GCP
in accordance with what was accepted in recitals no. 17 and 22 of this.
For these reasons, the Authority rejects its objection - allegation
controlled company AMPNI.
33. On the contrary, the information in the file and the hearing did not show that
company " ERNST & YANG (BELLAS) CERTIFIED AUDITORS A CCOUNTANTS SA »Participated
or assisted in the breach by the controller
provisions of Articles 5 (1) and 6 (1) of the GIP, in particular at the access stage,
control, copying and transmission in Manchester, United Kingdom
personal data.
34. According to the GKPD (Ait. Sk. 148) in order to strengthen their enforcement
rules of this Regulation, sanctions, including administrative
fines should be imposed for any infringement of this Regulation,
in addition to or instead of the appropriate measures imposed by the supervisory authority
in accordance with this Regulation. In cases of minor breach or if
46
the fine that may be imposed would be a disproportionate charge in kind
person, a reprimand could be imposed instead of a fine.
The Authority after establishing the violation of the provisions of the GCP during
above, taking into account, in addition to the above, in particular the Guidelines
guidelines for the application and setting of administrative fines for its purposes
Regulation 2016/679 issued on 03-10-2017 by the Working Group of the article
29 (WP 253) and having duly taken into account the provisions of Article 83 of the ICCPR in measure
applicable in this case and in particular those provided for
from paragraph 2 of the same article criteria relate to the specific case that
examined by the Authority:
(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, taking into account
the nature, extent or purpose of the treatment concerned, and the number of
subj ects of the data affected by the infringement and the degree of damage suffered
namely:
i. the fact that the company violated the principles from article 5 par. 1 GKPD as well as
the obligation (principle) of accountability no. 5 par. 2 GKPD, ie violated
fundamental principles of the GBER for the protection of personnel data
character.
ii. the fact that the condition of safe processing no. 5 par. 1 ed. f
GPA is now reduced to a basic principle of data processing
personal nature so that, even if the other processing principles are followed
to make the processing totally illegal in the event that o
processor does not guarantee adequate security.
iii. the fact that it also becomes of fundamental importance the principle of accountability
under the new compliance model introduced with the FGM, where
burden of compliance and the relevant responsibility lies with the controller, o
which has been provided by the GCP with the necessary compliance tools.
iv. the fact that according to no. 3/2010 Opinion of its Working Group
Article 29 on the principle of accountability (WP l 73 / 13-7-2010) the establishment
internal accountability measures for compliance with processing principles (par. 39-51
and in particular par. 41 and 44) provides great opportunities for effective implementation
reducing the chances of the controller violating the
legislation and therefore the assessment of sanctions takes into account the
compliance with the principle of accountability (par. 38), while in case
breach of it requires substantial sanctions, such as in
case in which a controller does not comply with the statements made
contained in its binding internal policies, which are taken
in addition to the actual breach of the essential principles
data protection (par. 64).
47
v. the fact that the controller did not take any internal action
compliance with the accountability principle to be applied and
implementation of the principles of personal data processing by
No. 5 par. 1 GKPD, not even the ones provided as "basic" according to the Opinion
3/2010 of OE 29 (par. 44, ibid.)
vi. the fact that the violation of the above principles took place in the context
processing of personal data in a computer infrastructure (hardware
and software) which is used to service a large number
electronic communications of data subjects
vii. the fact that the violation of the above principles took place during the processing
personal data of labor subjects
characterized by a power imbalance between employer and
employees. The importance attached by the GCC to processing
of personal data in employment relationships is demonstrated by
fact that Article 88 thereof gives the national legislature the opportunity
establishing specific rules to ensure their protection
rights and freedoms of workers, including appropriate
and special measures to safeguard human dignity, the law
interests and fundamental rights of the person to whom
the data are reported, with particular emphasis on the transparency of the processing, the
intra-group data transmission and on-site monitoring systems
work. Therefore, the observance of the principles provided by article 5 par. 1
ed. a 'and par. 2 GKPD acquires in this case a special and important importance for
respect for the right to protection of personal data
character of employees.
viii. the fact that the principle of safe processing was substantially violated
personal data no. 5 par. 1 ed. in the GCC through
and ultimately achieve access, copy, transmission and in general
processing of personal data of data subjects
were affiliated with third parties, except the AMRNI Group
ix. the fact that the violation of the above principles is subject to the provisions
of article 83 par. 5 ed. a 'GKPD in cases of administrative enforcement
fines ofup to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of businesses, up to 4% of
total global annual turnover of the previous financial year
year, depending on which is higher, ie in the higher provided
category of the classification system of administrative fines, the imposition of
reserved, in accordance with the principle of proportionality,
in the case of the most serious violations of the GCC. Therefore, already from
the provisions of the GCP show that the violation of the principles provided
from article 5 par. 1 and par. 2 GKPD is treated as of greater importance
in relation to the violations provided by article 83 par. 4 GKPD.
48
x. the fact of causing damage to the right to data protection
personal data of the subjects from the violation of the above
authorities and, in particular , the processing of
personal data, secondly, the continuing in breach of it
GPD processing of personal data in several stages
(initial preservation and processing, access and control, copying, transmission)
and third, the complete deprivation of rights and the exercise of control over them
personal data of the data subjects (cf. Ait.Sk.
75 GKPD and OE 29 on administrative fines, ibid., P. 11 ).
xi. The fact that, from the information presented to the Authority, no evidence emerged against
at this stage the occurrence of material damage to the data subjects, nor
relied on relevant material damage
xii. the fact that the violation of the principles of article 5 par. 1 and par. 2 GKPD no
concerned, on the basis of the information provided to the Authority, data
personal provisions of Articles 9 and 10 of the GIP.
xiii. The fact that the violation of the principles of article 5 par. 1 and par. 2 concerned
any subject whose personal data occurred
processing in the context of its electronic communications service
from computer infrastructure (hardware and software) so that it is not one
individual or occasional infringement but for an infringement that has a systemic
(structural) character.
b) the deceit or negligence which caused the infringement
From the hearing before the Authority and the memoranda of the person in charge
shows that the company was completely unaware of the compliance obligations
in accordance with the requirements of the GCP, and in addition showed no willingness to comply, as
will be demonstrated below. Therefore, the violations found were
resulting from a lack of complete knowledge and application of the provisions of the GCC in
framework of the organization of internal compliance despite the fact that the responsible
could and should, in particular due to accountability, to
comply with the provisions of the GCP, thus violating the duty of care which
required by law.
(c) any action taken by the controller to
mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects,
The controller did not take any action to restore or
mitigation of the damage suffered by the data subjects, nor did it
informing them, even after the illegal processing of the data by him
their personal nature. It should be noted at this point that the person in charge
processing for non-prior updating of data subjects
invoked the exception of article 14 par. 5 ed. b 'GKPD so as not to damage the
achieving the objectives of the processing, namely the internal control relied on.
Regardless of the validity or otherwise of that claim, even after
completion of the alleged internal control, never the controller

informed data subjects of subsequent or further processing,
namely the copying and transmission of their data to Manchester, United Kingdom
Vassilios, especially natural persons affiliated with third parties outside the Group
AMPNI, so that to date they have not been informed about it. It is recalled that according
with what has been accepted hereby, the violation of the principles of article 5 par. 1 GCP
occurred at the expense of any subject whose data were found to be illegal
processing and not only of the complaining natural persons.
( d) the degree of responsibility of the controller, taking into account the techniques; and
organizational measures implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32,
The controller did not take into account technical and organizational measures, nor did he take any action
to the necessary evaluations in order to draw appropriate conclusions (see no. 28
request sk. of the present).
(e) any relevant previous infringements by the controller;
It appears from a relevant audit that no administrative sanction has been imposed to date by
the begining
(t) the extent of cooperation with the Authority to remedy the infringement
and limiting its potential adverse effects,
The Authority recognizes as a mitigating circumstance on the part of the person in charge
processing admission of illegal copying and sending to his Manchester
United Kingdom "\[ . . . \] any e-mails of individuals who have not and I or have not
any employment or service relationship or any other relationship with companies
of the AMRNI group, which AMRNI would be available to separate and provide
evidence of this "(Supplementary Memorandum AMPNI-ABS ofOS-4-2019
pp. 8 and 12 AilMIX r /EI􀃎/ 2616 I 05-4-2019 last page, point 4) as well as the expression
of his intention, according to the above, to proceed with separation or deletion (see
Supplementary Memorandum AMPNI-ABS of 19-12-2018 p. 23), although it did not express
the same intention for the personal data of the other subjects
data.
g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement , namely
Whereas this is not personal data referred to in Articles 9 and 10 of the GIP,
in accordance with the information provided to the Authority.
{h) the manner in which the supervisory authority was informed of the infringement, in particular
if and to what extent the controller or processor notified
the infringement,
In this case, the Authority was informed of the final findings
breaches primarily through the Data Breach Notification submitted by
ABS company as a result of which it carries out an ex-officio inspection. The person in charge
did not inform the Authority, nor did it notify itself of the Infringement
Data
i) any other aggravating or mitigating factor arising out of
circumstances of the particular case, such as the financial benefits that
or damage avoided, directly or indirectly, by the infringement

The Authority, in addition to the above, acknowledges as an additional mitigating factor that from
the data presented to it to date and on the basis of which it found
breach of the GPA, the controller did not reap any financial benefit, either
caused material damage to data subjects.
The Authority recognizes as aggravating the fact that the person in charge
has so far shown no intention of complying with
requirements of the GCP, nor has it informed the Authority of its inclusion in a program
internal compliance in order to make any data processing legal
of personal character no. 5 par. 1 and 6 par. 1 GKPD carried out in
computer infrastructure ("original server" hardware and software).
The person in charge of processing a series of documents to the Authority, especially after
listening, focused all his efforts on highlighting the importance that
had for him the use of the content of the copied servers ("back up"
servers according to him) for the purposes of internal control of the AMPNI Group and
consequently for the submission of relevant data to the Hellenic Capital Market Commission
of the US and the competent US judicial authorities, even asking not to
imposed by the Authority the sanction of the destruction of the content of the copied
at the time the Authority banned processing and
use the content of the copied servers, but not at that time
period of "original servers".
THE BEGINNING
Having taken into account the above
Because he decided the no. 58 par. 2 GKP exercising its corrective powers
in this case by imposing corrective measures
Because pursuant to the provision of article 58 par. 2 ed. d GKPD the Authority decided
to give an order to the company "AEGEAN MARINE PETROLEUM NETWOR K INC
(AMPNI) "as the controller to comply with the provisions of the GCP
the processing of personal data contained in both
in the computer infrastructure used (hardware and software "originals
DANAOS, AMPFS 1, AMPFS2), as well as in the new archiving system
a copy of the original servers sent to his Manchester
United Kingdom.
Because in particular the company should take all necessary internal measures
compliance and accountability to the principles of Article 5 par. 1 and par. 2 in combination
with article 6 par. 1 GKPD.
Because the above order must be executed within three (3) months from
receipt of this, informing the Authority.
Because the above corrective measure alone is not enough to restore it
compliance with the infringed provisions of the GCC in accordance with what has been accepted by

the no. 31 recital herein and in addition, at the time when
in fact the company despite the substantial admission on its part of at least part of it
violation of the GCC showed complete disregard for compliance with its provisions
Articles 5 and 6 par. 1 GCP.
Because the Authority considers that in this case based on the circumstances
should be found pursuant to the provision of article 58 par. 2 ed. 0 TKIL'.l va
in addition, effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative money is imposed
fine no. 83 GPA, both for the restoration of compliance and for
punishment for this illegal behavior 40
Because the Authority found to have infringed the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of the GIP
is subject to the provisions of article 83 par. 5 ed. a 'GPD in the cases
imposition of administrative fines up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of undertakings, up to
4% of the total global annual turnover of the previous financial year
year, depending on which is higher.
Because the Authority took into account, on the one hand, that AMR NI has submitted an application
bankruptcy in the US, on the other hand, that according to the report submitted by the company in the year
2017 to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) its total revenue
("Total revenue") for the year 2016 was 4,076,219,000.00 US dollars. (see p. 157 in
attached no. prot. r / EIE / 7306 / 10-09-2018 document 41 ).
Because with the issuance of this it ceases no. 19 par. 7 a law 24 72/199 7 the validity of
Interim Orders of the President of the Authority No. 2/2018 and 3/2018 and are valid
