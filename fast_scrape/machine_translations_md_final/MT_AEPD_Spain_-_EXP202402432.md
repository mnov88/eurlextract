                          Typification of Article 5 of the GDPR

Article 5 GDPR establishes that personal data will be:

considered incompatible with the initial purposes ("purpose limitation");

c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are processed ("data minimization");

personal details of the complaining party, providing the email address to make the
prior notice the following address: \*\*\*ADDRESS.1, although the postal address

Therefore, such events could involve the commission of an infraction, attributable to
the claimed party, for violation of article 5.1.d) RGPD, which requires that the data

inaccurate email address, as it has not been updated by the claimed party,
which represents a violation of the principle of accuracy regulated in article 5.1 d)
