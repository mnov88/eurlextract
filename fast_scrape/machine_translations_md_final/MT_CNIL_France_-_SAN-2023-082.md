Reference methodology relating to the processing of data from the main database of the National Health Data System implemented for the purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health by organizations acting within the framework of their public interest mission (MR-007)

Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (the GDPR) provides, in particular in Article 5, point 2, that the data controller must be able to demonstrate that the principles of the regulation are respected.

Article 9(4) of the GDPR specifies that Member States may maintain or introduce additional conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data or data concerning health.

Thus, in application of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended (“Informatics and Freedoms” Law), the processing of personal data for the purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health may be implemented provided that the data controller has made a declaration of conformity with a reference methodology. In the absence of compliance with a reference methodology, the processing must be the subject of an authorization request from the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties (the CNIL).

The CNIL may approve and publish reference methodologies, under the standards mentioned in II of Article 66 of the “Informatique et Libertés” law, established in consultation with the Health Data Platform (PDS), as well as with public and private organizations representing the stakeholders concerned.

Given their public interest missions, a large number of organizations carry out research, studies and evaluations in the field of health, which are part of a set of specific purposes corresponding to their missions (for example: evaluation of health pathway or quality of care, medico-economic assessments, responses to requests from public authorities, actions aimed at the general public, advice to members, etc.).

In addition to that relating to data processing requiring access by health establishments and federations to data from the medicalization of information systems program (PMSI), made available on the secure platform of the Technical Agency of the information on hospitalization (ATIH), the Commission adopts a reference methodology relating to certain data processing of the National Health Data System (SNDS) implemented by data controllers acting within the framework of their mission of public interest.

Data controllers who send a declaration of conformity to this reference methodology are authorized to implement their treatments, as long as they meet the conditions provided for by the methodology and have obtained a favorable opinion from the Ethical and Scientific Committee. for research, studies and evaluations in the field of health (CESREES).

Project space

SEC-ESP-1

The data from a study must be handled by authorized users only in a project space specific to this study, sealed with the data from the central SNDS as well as with the project spaces of other studies carried out in the same controlled environment.

SEC-ESP-2

Data sets imported into a project space specific to a study must be minimized and limited to only the data necessary for the study. A unique pseudonym number specific to each project space must be generated under the same pseudonymization conditions as those defined by the security framework applicable to the aforementioned SNDS. For example, this unique pseudonymous number could be generated by a cryptographic hash function resistant to brute force attacks or a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.

Data transmission

SEC-TRA-1

All data transmissions from or to the controlled environment or project spaces must be subject to encryption measures in accordance with appendix B1 of the general security framework (RGS) in order to guarantee confidentiality.

These encryption measures apply to data in transit and to its storage after receipt in the controlled environment or project spaces.

Exporting anonymous data outside of workspaces

SEC-EXP-1

Only anonymous datasets can be exported outside the controlled environment or a project space. The anonymization process must produce a dataset that complies with the three criteria defined by G29 Opinion No. 05/2014 or any subsequent EDPS opinion relating to anonymization. This compliance must be documented. Otherwise, if these three criteria cannot be met, a study of the risks of re-identification must be carried out and documented, prior to each export.

a solution carrying out automatic monitoring with the reporting of alerts processed manually by an authorized operator; orsemi-automatic control via execution of programs allowing selection of abnormal traces, followed by manual rereading by an authorized operator.

SEC-JOU-3

The logging traces defined in the SEC-JOU-1 requirements must be kept for a period of six months to one year from their collection, unless otherwise justified by the importance of the risk for individuals in the event of diversion from the purposes of the processing. and the frequency of occurrence of such practices. In the latter case, the maximum retention period for logging traces can be extended to three years.

Managing security incidents and personal data breaches

SEC-INC-1

The parties to the agreement must provide a procedure for managing and handling security incidents and personal data breaches, specifying the roles and responsibilities and the actions to be taken in the event of such incidents occurring.

the protocol, including the justification of the public interest, as well as a summary, according to the model made available by the PDS. In the event of a favorable opinion with recommendations from CESREES, the protocol and the summary clearly taking into account the recommendations, must be registered; the declaration of interests, in relation to the object of the study, of the data controller and where applicable from the subcontractor.

6.3.4. At the end of the study, the method and the results obtained must be communicated to the PDS for publication.
