Summary
The Authority examined a complaint from a subscriber who, after applying for a new Vodafone connection, received from an advertising company collaborating with Vodafone a parcel with samples of consumer products, despite his opposition to the use of his data for commercial promotion purposes. According to Vodafone, the sending of the parcel was not a promotional action, but an incidental provision of the telecommunications services contract already drawn up between the parties, which is sent to all, without exception, new subscribers who register through the website www.vodafonecu.gr, regardless of the their choices regarding promotional actions, while relevant information is provided via a banner posted on the website in question.

The Authority considered that the transmission to an advertising company and the related processing of the complainant's data was done for the purpose of promotion, in violation of the principle of legality, objectivity and transparency of the processing, because it was not necessary for the purpose of the contract nor was it reasonably expected for the subject, who had expressly objected to the use and transmission of his data for promotional purposes while it was not proven that the complainant had been fully informed in accordance with Article 13 GDPR about the processing in question. Vodafone was fined 10,000 euros and ordered to adapt its practice regarding the additional benefits in question in order to provide the subjects with full information and the possibility to object.
