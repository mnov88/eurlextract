Cyberbook AS receives a fee

The background to the case is a complaint from a former employee of Cyberbook. The person experienced that the company had activated automatic forwarding of their personal e-mail box in the business.
In violation of the rules

The forwarding took place for several months without the former employee receiving information about this.

After investigating the case, the Data Inspectorate has concluded that the forwarding is a violation of the regulations on employers and access to e-mail boxes and other electronic material.
Must establish routines

In addition, our assessment is that the company has violated the Privacy Ordinance's requirement for a legal basis, information to the data subject and the duty to assess protests from the employee, in addition to the rules on deletion of personal data.

On the basis of this, the Data Inspectorate has decided that the company must establish written routines for access to the e-mail boxes of employees and former employees, together with an order to pay NOK 200,000 in fees for the illegal forwarding.

Cyberbook has a three-week appeal period from the company receiving our decision.
