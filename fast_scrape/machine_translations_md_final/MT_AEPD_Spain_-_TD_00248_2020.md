FIFTH: The exercise of the right of access, like the rest of the rights, is

object of treatment, as well as information, in particular, on the purposes of the
treatment, the categories of data, the recipients, the possible assignments, the term

related to their children's school records and a copy of certain

documentation and information related to educational processes and activity

Examining the documentation in the file, it is observed that the claim
of the complaining party is to obtain copies of documents, in this regard we must

point out that, in accordance with data protection regulations, the party
claimant can only request their own personal data, or of those persons
whose representation is, in particular, said documents may contain other
data that do not constitute personal data of the claimant.

are being treated by public administrations or the Body
administrative responsible for the treatment, the data object of the treatment, the
purpose of this, the origin of the data and if they have or will be communicated to third parties.

The right of access is independent of the right of access to public information

that regulates Law 19/2013, of December 9, on transparency, access to
public information and good governance. It is also independent of the right of access
to documentation in an administrative procedure, regulated by Law 39/2015, of
October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the administrations
Public (LPACAP) or access to documents that are part of a file

school, except for those documents that contain health data, which enables the
obtaining them based on data protection regulations in correlation
with the Patient Autonomy Law (LAP)

complaining party, no mention is made or the right of access to data is requested
personal data of your children with the prescriptive requirements in the RGPD, in its article 15

"Right of access of the interested party" regarding the processing of personal data
related to the person in charge, but rather to obtaining the documents of a
school record, which has its own regulations for obtaining said
documentation.

As recognized by the jurisprudence of the CJEU, access to copies of the examinations

if they are part of the content of the right of access to personal data,
However, as has already been said, the request was made by accessing the
educational record and not as one of the rights recognized in the RGPD, for
Therefore, the complaining party may make the request addressed to the Delegate for the Protection of
Data, using the means made available by the person in charge for the exercise

of the rights recognized in the RGPD, and the receipt of
requests through other contact channels other than those expressly
planned.

The rights may be exercised directly or through a legal representative or
voluntary. The supporting documentation must necessarily be provided that the
