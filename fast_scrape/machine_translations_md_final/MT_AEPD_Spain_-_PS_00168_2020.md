established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is
competent to initiate and resolve this process.
II
The defendant is charged with committing an offense for violation of Article 6 of the RGPD, " Legality
of the treatment ”, Which indicates in section 1 the cases in which the processing of third-party data is
considered lawful:
"one. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:
a) the interested party gave their consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more
specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party is a party or
for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures;

The documentation in the file provides evidence that the complained party violated article 6.1 of the
RGPD, since it processed the claimant's personal data without having any legitimacy to do so.
The respondent has recognized this error and has indicated that one of the causes that motivated the
sending of the SMS to the claimant is that said number has been used by both collaborating agents and
Vodafone employees as it is a simple and fast number to remember to write, therefore, a “dummy” number,
how to use it in certain activities and processes.
