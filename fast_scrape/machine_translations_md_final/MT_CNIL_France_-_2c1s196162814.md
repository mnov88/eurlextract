Dear Sir,
I am following up on the exchanges of letters that took place between the CNIL services and the
data protection officer (DPO) of your company, as part of the investigation of several complaints relating
to the processing of debtors’ personal data (amicable collection files).
I. Reminder of claims and facts
With regard to referral No. f
The French complainant requested access to his data and received some responses. He nevertheless
referred the matter to CNIL, feeling that the responses were incomplete, as the identity of the investigative
agency at the origin of the data collection was not communicated to him. Following the intervention of
CNIL services, his request was granted.
With regard to referral No. P|
The data relating to the French complainant were processed by
assignment agreement entered into with ‘he complainant has repeatedly
requested the source of the data concerning him, as well as its retention period and its deletion. Following
discussions with CNIL vices informed the complainant that his address and
telephone number had been obtained from an investigative agency located in Israel. Your DPO has
indicated to CNIL that the use of such an agency occurs only when the data collected from the transferring
institution turns out to be inaccurate.
based on a debt
In addition, the complainant was informed of the “exceptional” closure of his case and that his data
will be deleted after a period of six years from that closure. Your DPO justified this period by the fact that
your company is “legally required to keep this data far anti-money laundering pur poses for a minimum of
five years.“
With regard to referral No. Fs
In this complaint submitted by the Polish Data Protection Authority, pursuant to Article 56.1 of the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the complainant challenged the lawfulness of the processing
of data concerning him b and requested its erasure. He indicated that he was not a
debtor and had never been a client of the ceding company
From the complaint and the exchanges with your company’s DPO, the following details emerge:
- after unsuccessfully attempting to contact the debtor concerned,ME appealed to an
investigative agency, which sent it the contact details of the complainant on 13 July 2018;
- on 23 July 2018, the complainant requested the erasure of the data from \[I after
reccivingEE s letter informing him of the existence of a claim concerning him;
- on 27 July 2018, he contacted I by email DE © obtain
information, as he claims never to have taken out a loan withI
- on17 September 2018, he received another letter asking him to pay his debt;
- on 29 November 2018, during a telephone conversation with the complainant, eS
services noticed that this was a case of mistaken identity (same surname and first name). His
telephone number was then invalidated, but no further action was taken;
- the complainant’s address and telephone number were anonymised following the intervention of
CNIL services on 26 August 2019 (all data relating to the complainant was replaced by crosses,
thus preventing any link between the true debtor’s file and the complainant);
- the complainant was informed that this measure would therefore put an end to all correspondence
with him.
II. Analysis of the facts in question
1. Failure to respond to requests to exercise rights
Pursuant to Article 12.3 GDPR, the Data Controller must respond to requests from individuals
exercising their rights within a maximum period of one month.
In the present case, the Polish complainant attempted to obtain information on the processing of
the data and requested its erasure upon receipt of the letter of assignment of claim.
An initial, insufficient measure was taken only four months after the complainant’s first request. It
is only the intervention of CNIL services - over a year after the complainant’s first request - which led your
services to respond satisfactorily.
I also note that compliance with this obligation and taking into account the complainant’s requests
from the outset could have enabled your company to identify the case of mistaken identity in July 2018
and thus immediately cease the processing of data concerning the complainant.
I find ha i therefore disregarded Article 12.3 GDPR in that it did not respond to
the complainant as soon as possible.
2. Failure to process accurate and up-to-date data
Pursuant to Article 5.1.d GDPR, the personal data processed must be accurate and, if necessary,
kept up to date.
In this case, the case of mistaken identity was identified on 29 November 2018 when the Polish
plaintiff disputed being a customer of the company and requested the deletion of his data. However,
did not take adequate measures to remove any doubt as to this homonymy and
immediately delete the data concerning this non-debtor complainant.
Thus, the data relating to the complainant continued to be processed by I and was
only anonymised after the intervention of CNIL services on 26 August 2019.
I find that Po has therefore disregarded Article 5.1 d) GDPR in that it did not take
the necessary measures to process only accurate and up-to-date data relating to a debtor and that it took the
intervention of CNIL services to stop this breach.
