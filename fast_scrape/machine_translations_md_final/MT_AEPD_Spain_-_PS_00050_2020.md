        The RGPD defines in its article 4:

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/10

   "1. This Regulation applies to the treatment totally or partially

77.1 of this organic law may also process the data mentioned in the two
previous sections when this is derived from a legal obligation or is necessary
for the exercise of its powers. "

       About the claimant's data, which are additionally found in the
invoice, it is not relevant in this case and context, the use of these data as a person
legal, no activity is commented on as a contractor, but as a reference
identifying as a person of the establishment. In addition, its owner is identified not
only with the name, but the NIf and the bank account are added, and they are used to

relate to people belonging to the PP environment in \*\*\* LOCALIDAD.1,
as the claimant means, that is, as a way of identifying the owner
establishment, center where people who feel related to the
popular party attended and held various events. The claimant is a
secondary in the exposition of the facts, insofar as the protagonists are the
group that attended the celebration or meal, on which the opinion is expressed by the

reclaimed. Freedom of expression is manifested in this regard, being able to
add that \*\*\* RESTAURANT.1 or its headline is akin to the party's ideas, but not
violating the right of the owner of the data that by the fact of being the owner of the
establishment, has to sacrifice their personal data, so that the claimed
reveal. One of the limits to the aforementioned right is respect for rights

fundamental, and in this case, the protagonist was not the claimant, being the only
that is fully identified through a data set, when not even
participate in the tweet.

       The tweet is used as a criticism of public spending, being the owner of the
establishment also related to said group, and according to the complainant, it was necessary

know their identity, even if they did not participate in the aforementioned tweet.

       There is no doubt that the reference to public spending by a political group is
of interest, but if fully identifying data is included, not only name and

surnames, but NIF and bank account of someone who does not participate in said event, but
who is responsible for the establishment, no matter how closely related to the political ideas
In other words, the objective of expressing itself conflicts with the ownership of personal data,
those that govern some basic principles. Said data in this case and context is
considered included within the scope of application of the protection regulations of

data.

                                           III

       The document presented by the claimant certifies that the defendant carries out
a data processing by exposing on the social network an invoice with data from the

claimant in which their personal data is contained, listing local, NIF
issuer of the invoice and bank account, in order to state that said meal is
went to the treasury. The origin, title and reason why the
claimed has said document and the competence purpose attributed in the
handling of the same in relation to its private use on your Twitter. The fact of including the

invoice, without realizing it, even if it had been done without bad faith, including
data, reveals a lack of diligence in the elements that are exposed in the social network.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/10

        It does not follow that for the knowledge of third parties through the
social network of the expenses of a group of people related to a match, which was

the literal of the expression expressed in the tweet, the personal data must be given
full details of the issuer of the invoice, and the complete bank account. This does not participate in
food, is not relevant compared to the group, and it does not seem that
even if there is interest in informing that its owner is a sympathizer, it must be identified
with said data, with the own repercussion that the treatment carried out may have

out on social media.

        The claimed, in a private capacity, with his name and surname on Twitter, expresses
their opinions, and identifies the data of the claimant. In the use of the data, you must
concur with any legitimate basis provided for in article 6.1 of the RGPD. The right
fundamental of the claimant, that their data is not used in social networks,

prevails when what it is about is to comment on a meal of a PP group
that goes to the treasury, or that they meet very often in that place, without it being necessary
in addition, express and graphically expose the claimant's data in the photograph,
also, owner of the establishment.

        The aforementioned statement in relation to the intention of the news does not add or is

of interest or relevant for the data to appear in the photograph, not being adequate,
necessary or justified, and if, on the contrary invasive as to are provided in addition,
financial data such as the bank account, the NIF and the name and surname,
with the associated risks that it may entail.

        It is considered that in front of its nominal quote and the object of the comment, it does not add
nothing significant the fact of knowing your identity, the NIF and the bank account that you
make identified or identifiable without problems, since the expression of the expenditure goes
related in their case to the site where they often meet, not to the data of
the person who owns the site where they often meet, who does not appear related
with the comment.

        Under the principles of adequacy, pertinence, congruence, and relevance in the
use of the data, when treating them without the consent of the claimant, you can
serve Twitter to express opinions. However, in this case, the identity of that

person is not relevant to what is meant in the comment, which was that
the food was to be paid for from the public budget.

        The same results would have been obtained by covering the account and the NIF, and
name and surname of the claimant, since the right of its owner has been limited, to

your data is not exposed in a medium in which your data can be multiplied
effects when the message is shared.

        In accordance with the constitutional jurisprudence that defines the profile of the right
of data protection, in this case, the use of the claimant's data on Twitter is
a use that has not been consented to by its owner, and no legitimate basis is credited in the
treatment of said data in relation to the purpose that is to be understood
in the message that the defendant spread.

        The complainant is considered to have violated article 5.1.a) of the RGPD that
indicates: “The personal data will be:
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/10

  a) treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party
("Lawfulness, fairness and transparency"); as the sending of the aforementioned is not considered lawful

data exposed in the photo that associates the expressive literal of your opinion, which uploads it to
the aforementioned network.

        The respondent does not certify that the treatment of the claimant's data
appears embedded in some legitimating scheme of the assumptions that would enable
the treatment, for which the commission of the alleged infringement of the article is estimated

5.1.a of the RGPD.

                                              IV

        Regarding the fact that the data had been obtained from “Public Access Sources
co".

On this point, we limit ourselves to indicating -reiterating what was stated by this Agency-
cia in its Report of 03/10/2019, entry record 045824 / 2019- that “from the
entry into force of the RGPD can not speak of a legal concept of "accessible sources

sible to the public ”such as the one that existed in the previous Organic Law 15/1999 (...)
RGPD only talks about publicly accessible sources when regulating the right to information
if the data has not been collected from the interested party ”.

Therefore, the concept of a source of public access does not exist in the RGPD or in the LO-
PDGDD and, what is more, despite the terms in which article 6.2 of the
repealed LOPD, it was not a valid concept in our legal system during

during the validity of the repealed Organic Law 15/1999 as a result of the STS of 02/08/2012
(Rec. 25/2008). The STS relied on the STJUE of 04/24/2011 which resolved the issue
preliminary ruling from Spain; declared invalid article 6.2 LOPD for being contrary to
Article 7.f) of Directive 95/46 and considered that, given the incorrect transposition of the
Directive 95/46 that the LOPD made at that point, article 7.f) of the Directive was of

direct application. Article 7.f) of Directive 95/46, the text of which was practically identical.
co to the current article 6.1.f) of the RGPD. Also, the bank account number does not appear
in those supposed sources of public access.

        Nor can the allegation that the fact that the data
appear in this type of legitimate sources without further treatment. The GDPR only speaks
sources of public access when regulating the right to information if the data is not

have collected from the interested party.

           Article 14 of the RGPD indicates:

     "1.When the personal data have not been obtained from the interested party, the
     responsible for the treatment will provide you with the following information:

     2.f) the source from which the personal data come and, where appropriate, if they come from
   public access sources; "

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/10

     Neither the publication in official gazettes, in which it will not foreseeably appear
the bank account of the affected party, supposes the existence of a legitimate basis for the
treatment of the claimant's data, especially when the data is exposed as a

ferencia, in a social network open to the general public.
       As for the news of the newspaper "\*\*\* DIARIO.1", the report does not identify

with personal data as does the tweet that is the subject of the claim.

                                              V

       Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the violation of "the basic principles
for the treatment, including the conditions for consent in accordance with the articles
the 5, 6, 7 and 9 ”is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned article 83

of the aforementioned Regulation, with administrative fines of a maximum of € 20,000,000 or,
for a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the volume
total annual global business of the previous financial year, opting for the one with the highest
amount. "

      Article 58.2 of the RGPD indicates: "Each control authority will have all the
following corrective powers listed below:

       b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with warning
When the processing operations have violated the provisions of this Re-
regulation;

       d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment are in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period ”.

       In this case, the defendant is a natural person, who does not carry out on a regular basis
or professional, mainly personal data processing, and does not include
history of previous infringements in the field of data protection, so it is
opted for a warning sanction. It would be advisable, if it has not yet been
made, that the data of the claimant exposed and related to the matter of this

complaint will be removed from the aforementioned tweet, in order not to persist in the behavior that
motivates this procedure.

       Therefore,

       the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE B.B.B., with NIF \*\*\* NIF.1, for a violation of article 5.1.a)
of the RGPD, as indicated in Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, a warning sanction.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to B.B.B ..

THIRD: In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, the
