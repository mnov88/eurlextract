Organic 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of

digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD).

As a result of the investigative actions carried out, it is verified that the

responsible for the treatment is the one claimed.

Likewise, the following points are found:

Transfer the claim to ORANGE, owner of the Jazztel trademark, with
date of October 23, 2019 is received at this Agency, with registration number

050582/2019, brief of allegations sent by this entity stating, between

Information requested from AVILON on the origin of the claimant's telephone number, the object
of this call, legitimacy to receive this type of calls, and the information
provided to the claimant about the origin of their personal data, dated 16 de

July 2020 is received at this Agency, with registration numbers 021697/2020 and
025226/2020, written response stating the following aspects:
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/10

- Regarding the information provided by this entity to the claimant about the origin of
their data, declare that after initiating the agent who called on behalf of Jazztel, the

claimant interrupted him stating that he was registered on the Robinson list and that
would make a claim. He then interrupted the communication, which is why

the agent was unable to provide further information to the claimant.

- AVILON adds that it is registered in ADIGITAL as a provider of
services so you have access to the Robinson list whose data is updated
in their systems monthly. However, on the aforementioned date, it indicates that

produced an error in the software used, momentarily blocking the
table in which all the numbers included in the Robinson File are registered.
This incident was solved in 30 minutes, this call was produced in the

table lock period.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                             I

        In accordance with the provisions of article 84.3) of Law 9/2014, of 9
May, General of Telecommunications (LGT), the competition to resolve the
This Penalty Procedure corresponds to the Director of the Agency

Spanish Data Protection.

                                             II

        In the present case, it has been proven that the claimant is included in the
Robinson List.

In accordance with the evidence available at the present time of
agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction, it is considered that the defendant has contravened article 48.1 b) of the

LGT, in relation to article 21 of the RGPD, and article 23.4 of the LOPDGDD, already
that the claimant received on August 21, 2019 at 7:08 p.m. from

the calling line \*\*\* PHONE. 2. business call on your personal mobile phone
from one of the claimed telesales collaborators, such as

recognizes the claimed in his statements to this Agency on July 16 last, "in
the referred date, indicates that there was an error in the software used, leaving
the table in which all numbers are registered is momentarily locked

included in the Robinson File. This incident was resolved in 30 minutes,
this call taking place in the table lock period ”.

       In the present case, the defendant argues that the call to the
claimant for marketing purposes, when the line was included

previously in Adigital's Robinson Listing, was caused by an error in the
software used when the pre-check was momentarily inoperative
with the Robinson Listing.

       However, this deficiency should have been taken into account in the analysis of
risks prior to any processing of personal data and having incorporated the

controls necessary to avoid that in the event of a system error such as the one now analyzed
calls are prevented while the incident lasts.

       Although strict liability is not applicable to the case, if it is true that
there was a lack of due diligence on the part of the respondent in the organization and
technical means applied to the processing of personal data linked to the

receiving telephone lines that have caused the commission of the offense now
charged when the rights of the affected party were violated, even when he had
previously expressed their right to object by incorporating their line into the

Róbinson advertising exclusion. Consequently, the claimed entity is
responsible for the treatment.

       The facts presented (the violation of the right to object) could
suppose the commission by the claimed party of an infraction of article 48.1.b) of

the LGT Law, contained in its Title III, which states that: “Regarding the protection of
personal data and privacy in relation to subscriber directories, users
end of electronic communications services will have the following

rights: (…) b) To oppose receiving unwanted calls for the purposes of
commercial communication carried out through systems other than those
established in the previous letter and to be informed of this right ”,

       Although the aforementioned article does not configure such a right, so we must go to
the data protection regulations in which the right of opposition is regulated:

                                              III

        In accordance with the indicated precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the sanction to be imposed in

with the following criteria established in article 80.1) and 2) of the LGT:

that the penalty to be imposed should be graduated in the amount of € 20,000 (twenty thousand euros).
