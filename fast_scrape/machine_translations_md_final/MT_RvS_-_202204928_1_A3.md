Considerations

Introduction

1. \[Appellant\] submitted a request to the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) to take enforcement action against GGNet for keeping a record of \[appellant\]'s request to GGNet to delete her medical file.

2. GGNet is an organization that provides specialized care to people with mental health conditions. \[Appellant\] was referred to GGNet by her general practitioner. GGNet therefore held \[appellant\]'s medical file. After an intake interview between \[appellant\] and a psychiatric nurse from GGNet, \[appellant\] requested GGNet to delete her medical file because she did not want treatment. GGNet deleted \[appellant\]'s medical file and informed her of this. GGNet made a record of the deletion request. \[Appellant\] disagrees with this and wants this record deleted from GGNet's system.

3. The only remaining issue on appeal is whether the District Court correctly upheld the Dutch DPA's conclusion that GGNet is permitted to retain the record of \[appellant\]'s deletion request and therefore rightly refrained from enforcement.

Judgment of the District Court

4. In the District Court's opinion, \[appellant\]'s appeal to the right to erasure as referred to in Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter: the GDPR) is unsuccessful. Article 17, paragraph 3, introductory sentence and (c), of the GDPR states that this right does not apply if processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, in accordance with Article 9, paragraph 2, introductory sentence and (h), of the GDPR.

5. The District Court finds no explicit assurances or other statements in the documents referred to by \[appellant\] indicating that the DPA would oblige GGNet to delete the record. The District Court therefore finds that the principle of legitimate expectation is invalid.

Grounds and Assessment of Appeal

6. \[Appellant\] argues that the court failed to recognize that the Dutch Data Protection Authority should have taken enforcement action against GGNet, because GGNet should have deleted the record of the deletion request. According to \[appellant\], the record of the deletion request is not necessary for the management of GGNet's healthcare services. It is unlikely that GGNet will still have to answer to the Health and Youth Care Inspectorate (hereinafter: IGJ) given the considerable time elapsed in these proceedings. The court wrongly upheld the Dutch Data Protection Authority's position that GGNet has a duty to maintain records and retain data. According to \[appellant\], no agreement regarding medical treatment (hereinafter: treatment agreement) has been concluded between \[appellant\] and GGNet.

6.1. Article 9 of the GDPR states:

"1. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.

2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following conditions is met:

(…)

h) processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment, or the management of health or social care systems and services, on the basis of Union or Member State law or in accordance with contract with a health professional, and subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 3;

(…)".

Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 3, introductory sentence and point (c), of the GDPR, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 17 of the GDPR (right to erasure) do not apply for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, as referred to in Article 9, paragraph 2, introductory sentence and point (h), of the GDPR.

6.2. It is undisputed that the record of the erasure request constitutes special personal data within the meaning of Article 9 of the GDPR. This means that GGNet may not, in principle, process the record unless an exception under paragraph 2 applies. The Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) takes the position that the record of the erasure request may be retained because it is necessary for the management of GGNet's healthcare services and pursuant to a contract with a healthcare professional as referred to in Article 9, paragraph 2, introductory sentence and point (h), of the GDPR.

6.3. The court correctly ruled that the Dutch Data Protection Authority was entitled to take the position that recording the record is necessary for the management of GGNet's healthcare services, as referred to in Article 9, paragraph 2, introductory sentence and (h), of the GDPR. GGNet will be required to justify to supervisory authorities, such as the Healthcare Inspectorate (IGJ), health insurers, and the Dutch Data Protection Authority, where appropriate, why it no longer holds certain medical records. The Division therefore disagrees with \[appellant\]'s assertion that no inspections will take place due to the time elapsed in the procedure and the failure to submit claims.

Is the basis for this processing established in Union or Member State law, as referred to in Article 9, paragraph 2, introductory sentence and (h), of the GDPR?

6.4. Article 7:446 of the Dutch Civil Code (hereinafter: BW) states:

1. The agreement concerning medical treatment – hereinafter referred to in this section as the treatment agreement – is the agreement whereby a natural person or legal entity, the healthcare provider, in the exercise of a medical profession or business, undertakes in favor of another person, the client, to perform acts in the field of medicine, directly related to the person of the client or a specific third party. The person to whom the acts directly relate will hereinafter be referred to as the patient.

2. Acts in the field of medicine are defined as:

a. all acts – including examination and advice – directly related to a person and aimed at curing them of an illness, preventing them from developing an illness, assessing their state of health, or providing obstetric assistance;

b. other than those referred to under (a), directly related to a person, which are performed by a physician or dentist in that capacity.

3. The actions referred to in paragraph 1 also include nursing and caring for the patient in that context, and otherwise directly providing the patient with the material conditions under which those actions can be performed.

\[…\]

Article 7:454, paragraph 1, of the Dutch Civil Code states:

"The healthcare provider shall establish a file regarding the patient's treatment. He keeps a record in the file of the information regarding the patient's health and the procedures performed in that regard, and includes other documents containing such information, all to the extent necessary for providing proper care to him.

6.5. The Division accepts \[appellant\]'s argument that the record-keeping obligation under Article 7:454, paragraph 1, of the Dutch Civil Code does not apply because the conversation between her and the GGNet nurse does not fall under a medical act. \[Appellant\] has not further substantiated and therefore not made plausible the assertion that the conversation between \[appellant\] and GGNet was not an intake interview. Moreover, now that \[appellant\]'s medical file has been deleted by GGNet at her request, this assertion can no longer be verified. Pursuant to Article 7:454 of the Dutch Civil Code, healthcare providers are obligated to maintain a medical file regarding the treatment of a patient. This record-keeping obligation exists if there is a treatment agreement as referred to in Article 7:454. Article 7:446 of the Dutch Civil Code (BW) defines medical acts as all activities—including examination and advice—directly related to a person and aimed at assessing their state of health. Such activities may also be performed by a nurse. Given the nature of the intake interview between \[appellant\] and the GGNet social psychiatric nurse, the record-keeping obligation applies in this case. Because GGNet is legally obligated to maintain records and must be accountable to the supervisory authority, GGNet has sufficiently substantiated the need to record the deletion request.

6.6. This establishes that the storage of the data was lawful. Lawful storage of data, in principle, provides a basis for its retention, as long as it is necessary for the purpose for which it is processed. Article 5, paragraph 1, introductory sentence and (c), of the GDPR stipulates that personal data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This principle of data minimization can therefore lead to an initially lawful storage no longer providing a basis for retaining the personal data at some point.

6.7. The Dutch Data Protection Authority was entitled to take the position that retaining the record is not in violation of Article 9, paragraph 2, introductory sentence and (h), of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Article 6, paragraph 1, introductory sentence and (f), of the GDPR. Retention of the data is also necessary for GGnet's record-keeping obligations and for accountability to the supervisory authority. GGNet was therefore not obligated to honor the request to erase the record under Article 17 of the GDPR. The court therefore correctly ruled that GGNet was allowed to continue retaining the record of the deletion request, because there was no unlawful processing.

6.8. The argument is unsuccessful.

7. Finally, \[appellant\] argues that the court failed to recognize that she was entitled to infer from her email exchange with the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) and a telephone conversation with a supervisory officer of the AP that the AP would oblige GGNet to delete the record. According to \[appellant\], the court wrongly rejected her appeal to the principle of legitimate expectation.

7.1. Regardless of whether the AP created trust in \[appellant\] with the emails and the telephone conversation, it is established that enforcement is not possible without a violation. As the Division considered above, the court correctly ruled that GGNet was allowed to retain the record of \[appellant\]'s deletion request. Therefore, there is no violation. The Dutch Data Protection Authority could therefore not take enforcement action. The court rightly dismissed the appeal based on the principle of legitimate expectation.

8. The argument is unfounded.

Conclusion

9. The appeal is unfounded. The Division upholds the court's judgment.

10. The Dutch Data Protection Authority is not required to reimburse legal costs.
