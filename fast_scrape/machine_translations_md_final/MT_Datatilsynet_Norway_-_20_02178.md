The background to the case is a complaint from an employee who experienced that the employer had activated automatic forwarding of the person's e-mail box in the company.

Lacks legal basis

The automatic forwarding was activated in connection with the employee's sick leave, and lasted for more than a month. After investigating the case further, the Data Inspectorate has concluded that the forwarding has taken place in violation of the rules in the regulations on the employer's access to e-mail boxes and other electronic material, as well as the Privacy Ordinance's legal basis, information to the data subject and the duty to assess the employee's protest. .

On the basis of this, the Data Inspectorate has decided that the company must improve the written routines for access to e-mail boxes, as well as an order to pay an infringement fee of NOK 400,000 for the illegal forwarding.

The company's name is exempt from publicity to protect the complainant's identity. The company has appealed the decision.
