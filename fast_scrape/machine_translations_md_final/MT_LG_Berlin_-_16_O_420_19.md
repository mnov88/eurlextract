The social network LinkedIn is no longer allowed to announce on its website that it does not respond to “do-not-track” signals with which users object to the tracking of their surfing behavior via their browser settings. The Berlin Regional Court decided this following a lawsuit from the Federal Association of Consumer Organizations (vzbv). The court also prohibited the company from setting a default that would make the member's profile visible on other websites and applications. Last year, the court banned the sending of unsolicited emails to non-members.

“When consumers activate the ‘Do Not Track’ function of their browser, it sends a clear message: They do not want their surfing behavior to be spied on for advertising and other purposes,” says Rosemarie Rodden, legal officer at vzbv. “Website operators must respect this signal.”

Objection to tracking ignored

Internet surfers can use their browser to set the websites they visit to receive a “Do-Not-Track” (DNT) signal. It conveys your wish that online activities not be tracked and evaluated. LinkedIn announced on its website that it does not respond to such DNT signals. This means that even against the will of the user, personal data such as the IP address and information about the use of the website can be evaluated for analysis and marketing purposes, including by third parties.

The Berlin Regional Court agreed with the vzbv's opinion that the company's communication was misleading. It suggests that the use of the DNT signal is legally irrelevant and that the defendant does not need to observe such a signal. That is not the case. According to the General Data Protection Regulation, the right to object to the processing of personal data can also be exercised using automated procedures. A DNT signal represents an effective contradiction.

The court rejected a further application in this context for procedural reasons.

Profile published without necessary consent

In all other points the vzbv lawsuit was successful without any restrictions. The court prohibited LinkedIn from activating the “profile visibility” function when logging in for the first time. This default setting made the personal LinkedIn profile publicly visible to non-members and outside the network - for example on search engines - without consent. The judges made it clear that a switch activated in advance does not meet the requirements for effective consent to the publication of personal data. “User profiles must not automatically be publicly visible when they are created,” says Rosemarie Rodden.

Unsolicited email sending prohibited

The Berlin Regional Court had already upheld part of the lawsuit last year. LinkedIn is now prohibited from sending email invitations to consumers who are not members of the network and who have not agreed to the use of their email address. In addition, in a further partial acknowledgment judgment, the court prohibited the use of several provisions in the company's terms and conditions, including clauses that only the English version of the contract should be binding and that litigation may only be brought in Dublin, Ireland.
