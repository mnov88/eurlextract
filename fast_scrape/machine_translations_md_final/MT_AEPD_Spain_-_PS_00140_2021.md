                                             I

Article 58 of the RGPD, "Powers", indicates in point 2:

      “2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers
corrective measures listed below:

      (…)

      “I) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition or in
place of the measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances
of each particular case; "

                                               III

      The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data, provision that provides:

      "1. The personal data will be:

      a) treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner with the interested party (<< legality,

         loyalty and transparency

      (…)

      2. The person responsible for the treatment will be responsible for compliance with the

       (The underlining is from the AEPD)

      Article 4 point 2) of the RGPD defines "treatment" as "any
operation or set of operations carried out on personal data or set of
personal data, whether by automated procedures or not, such as collection,
registration, organization, structuring, conservation, adaptation or modification,
extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, diffusion or any

another form of access authorization, (…) "

      Article 6 of the RGPD, “Legality of the treatment”, mentions in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

      "1. The treatment will only be lawful if it complies with at least one of the following

terms:

      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
      personal for one or more specific purposes;
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/12

      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
      pre-contractual;

      (…) "

      At the same time, the LOPDGDD, in its article 20, under the heading of “Systems of
credit information ”provides:

      "1. Unless proven otherwise, the data processing will be presumed lawful
personal information related to the breach of monetary, financial or
credit by common credit information systems when the
following requirements:

      b) That the data refer to certain, overdue and enforceable debts, whose
existence or amount had not been the subject of an administrative or judicial claim for

the debtor or through an alternative dispute resolution procedure
binding between the parties.

      c) That the creditor has informed the affected party in the contract or at the time
to require payment about the possibility of inclusion in said systems, with
indication of those in which it participates.

      The entity that maintains the credit information system with related data
the breach of monetary, financial or credit obligations must notify
to the affected party the inclusion of such data and will inform them about the possibility of exercising
the rights established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
within thirty days of notification of the debt to the system,

the data remaining blocked during that period.

      d) That the data is only kept in the system as long as the
default, with a maximum limit of five years from the expiration date of
the monetary, financial or credit obligation.

      e) That the data referring to a specific debtor can only be
consulted when whoever consults the system maintains a contractual relationship
with the affected party that involves the payment of a pecuniary amount or this would have
requested the conclusion of a contract that involves financing, deferred payment or
periodic billing, as happens, among other cases, in those provided for in the

legislation on consumer credit contracts and real estate credit contracts.

      When the right to the limitation of the
treatment of the data challenging its accuracy in accordance with the provisions of article
18.1.a) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the system will inform those who may
consult it in accordance with the previous paragraph about the mere existence of said

circumstance, without providing the specific data with respect to which

      f) That, in the event that the request for the conclusion of the contract is denied, or

this will not be held, as a result of the consultation made, whoever has
After consulting the system, inform the affected party of the result of said consultation.

      2. The entities that maintain the system and the creditors, with respect to the
treatment of the data referring to its debtors, will have the status of

co-responsible for the processing of the data, being applicable what is established by
Article 26 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

      It will be up to the creditor to ensure that the requirements for
the inclusion in the debt system, responding to its non-existence or inaccuracy.

      3. The presumption referred to in section 1 of this article does not cover the
assumptions in which the credit information was associated by the entity that
keep the system to additional information to those contemplated in said
section, related to the debtor and obtained from other sources, in order to carry out
carry out a profiling of the same, in particular by applying techniques of

credit rating. " (The underlining is from the AEPD)
      The infringement of article 6 of the RGPD, in relation to its article 5.1.a) of which
the claimed person is held responsible, is sanctioned in article 83.5 of the RGPD which states:

      "Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

      It must also be taken into account, for the purposes of prescription of infractions,
that the LOPDGDD classifies as very serious infractions those described in its article 72. 1
which includes “a) The processing of personal data violating the

principles and guarantees established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 "

                                            III

      The documentation in the file shows that the
claimed violated article 6.1 of the RGPD.

      The defendant's conduct contrary to the principle of legality has consisted of

communicate to a credit information system (the ASNEF file) a debt that,
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/12

Regarding the alleged debtor, the claimant, it was not true, expired or enforceable. So
establishes, "a contrary sensu", article 20.1 of the LOPDGDD. The illicit treatment of
the claimant's data, specified in the inclusion in a solvency file without

meet the conditions that are required to be adjusted to law, the
February 24, 2021, date of registration of the debt in the aforementioned file,

        The claimant has provided a document that certifies the admission for processing of his
Request for arbitration before the Consumer Arbitration Board of the Government of the Principality of

Asturias dated December 11, 2020 against MASTER DISTANCIA, S.A., thus
as a report of inclusion in the ASNEF system dated February 24, 2021 in the
that your personal data is registered by the claimed entity.

      As recital 40 of the RGPD clearly states “..For the treatment
is lawful, personal data must be processed with the consent of the
interested party or on any other legitimate basis established in accordance with Law, either
in this Regulation or by virtue of other Union or State law

members referred to in these Regulations, including the need to comply with the
legal obligation applicable to the person responsible for the treatment or the need to execute a
contract to which the interested party is a party or in order to take measures at the request
of the interested party prior to the conclusion of a contract. "
