compliance with the Authority's Decision 16/2022. At the same time, it sent to the Larissa
Regional Police Station the transmittal document (ref. no. G/EXE/2775/15-10-2024) in order

Authority the proof of service of the summons (ref. no. G/EIS/8106/21-10-2024), according

address of the Processing Manager mentioned in the summons.

Manager was summoned for a hearing, no one was present. The Authority set a conference
date of 13-11-2024 to discuss the above matter.
The Authority, after considering all the information on the record and referring to the
deliberations of the meeting of 13-11-2024, having heard the Rapporteur and the
clarifications of the Assistant Rapporteur, and after a thorough discussion,
THOUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW
1. In accordance with Article 4(4). 7 of the General Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the
protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
movement of such data (hereinafter,
4
Regulation), which has been in force since 25 May 2018, a controller is defined as "the
natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly
with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data".
2. The issue of making unsolicited communications by any means of electronic
communication, without human intervention, for the purposes of direct marketing of
products or services and for any kind of advertising purposes is regulated in article 11 of
Law no. 3471/2006 on the protection of personal data in the electronic communications
sector, which transposed Directive 2002/58/EC into national law. According to this
article (paragraph 1), such communication is only allowed if the subscriber has given
his/her explicit prior consent.
According to paragraph 3 of the said article, any electronic mail without the prior
consent of the data subject is allowed only if, among other things, the contact details
have been lawfully obtained in the context of a previous sale of products or services or
other transaction and may be used for the direct promotion of similar products or
services of the supplier or for similar purposes and the data subject was informed at the
time of collection of the data about the use of the data for the purpose of
communication and did not disclose the data to the data subject.
3. Pursuant to Article 31 of the Regulation, the controller and the processor and, where applicable, their representatives shall cooperate, upon request, with the supervisory
authority in the performance of its tasks.
4. As is apparent from the evidence in the files of the complaints under consideration, similarly to what was stated in the Authority's Decision 16/2022, none of the complainants had expressly consented in advance to receive promotional messages from the controller, nor did they have any prior commercial contact or other relationship
with the in order to have their contact details lawfully obtained so as not to require their
prior consent for the sending of those messages, as set out in the Authority's Decision
16/2022. 1 of Law no. 3471/2006.
5
5. Similarly to Decision 16/2022, the controller did not cooperate with the Authority as it
did not reply, on several occasions, to any of the numerous documents clarifications sent
to it e-mail and by post and did not attend the Authority's meeting, where it was invited
to explain itself.
6. The Authority, by Decision 16/2022, has already imposed a sanction on this controller,
namely a fine of fifty-four thousand (54,000) Euros, following the examination of thirty-
six (36) complaints that had been submitted to the Authority previously with the same
subject matter for violation of the above provisions of article 11 of Law no. 3471/2006,
as well as for the lack of cooperation of the Processing Manager. On the basis of the
above, no compliance has been made with the above Decision.
7. In accordance with Article 13 par. 3 of Law 3471/2006, the cases in which an opinion of
the National Telecommunications and Postal Commission (NTC) is foreseen, the latter
gives its opinion upon a subscriber's request or a request of the Personal Data Protection
Authority or ex officio.
On the basis of the above, the Authority unanimously considers that, in accordance
with Article 11 of Law No. 3471/2006 and Article 31 of the GDPR, the conditions for the
imposition of a penalty against the controller are met, on the basis of Article 13 of the Act.
3471/2006, in conjunction with Article 58(58) of Regulation (EC) No 3471/2006. 2(i) of the
GDPR, the administrative sanction referred to in the operative part of this order, which is
proportionate to the gravity of the infringement.
FOR THESE REASONS
Impose on the controller the effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative
fine appropriate to the specific case in accordance with the specific circumstances of the
case, amounting to forty-five thousand Euro (45.000,00 €), for above violations of article 11 of Law No. 3471/2006 and Article 31 of the
GDPR.
It requests the National Telecommunications and Postal Services Commission (EETT)
to examine the accuracy of the data in the registration declaration of the
'www.anoixisdate.gr' Domain Name and to take any appropriate action, such as, for
example, the application of Article 10 of the Regulation on the Management and Assignment
of Domain Names ending in .gr or .ελ. regarding the deletion of the assigned Domain Name.
