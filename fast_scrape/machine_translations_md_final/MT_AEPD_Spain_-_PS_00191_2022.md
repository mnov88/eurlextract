practiced requirements; verifying the deletion of the news.
FOURTH: On April 25, 2022, the Director of the Spanish Agency for

in accordance with the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1,
of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (in
hereafter, LPACAP), for the alleged infringement of article 5.1.c) of the GDPR, classified as
in article 83.5.a).
FIFTH: Notified of the aforementioned start-up agreement in accordance with the rules established in
the LPACAP, the claimed party submitted a brief of allegations on May 10,
2022 in which, in summary, he stated that:
1.- The voice is not considered as a personal data, because not all own attribute and
individual of a person is a personal data, but only those that
identify or allow us to identify the specific person.
For this purpose, it invokes Opinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal data of the Group
of Labor of Article 29, which indicates that a person can be considered "identified"
natural person when, within a group of people, he is "distinguished" from all
other members of the group; the natural person is "identifiable" when, although not
has yet identified it, it is possible to do so. And that the identification is achieved
normally through specific data that we can call "identifiers" and that
They have a privileged and very close relationship with a certain person.
It indicates the claimed party that never identified the victim basically because
He was unaware and still is unaware of that identity. And that the information he gave was
limited to some circumstances of the event, to procedural information, the sex of the
victim and her voice.
It states that in order to consider whether the voice is sufficient to identify the person,
circumstances must be taken into account. And that in the case that
we are concerned with, the voice, as can be verified in the recordings issued in its day,
is the � � � � � �

, a fact that he considers should not be left aside, since
it is about assessing whether the voice alone is capable of individualizing the victim among a
certain group, daring to say that this group is so indeterminate and wide
like that of young women (...) \*\*\*LOCATION.1. Therefore, he denies
categorically that the voice can single out the victim among all the women
young people who were in \*\*\*LOCATION.1 on the day of the events.
For all these reasons, it considers that neither the voice nor the information it disclosed are identifiers
enough to single out the person within the reference group to the point
that it can be identified.
He goes on to indicate that another element that he considers particularly important to ponder
is that of the necessary means for the identification of a person, invoking the
effect recital 26 of the GDPR:
