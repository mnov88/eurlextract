I. FACTS AND PROCEDURE

1. CALOGA (hereinafter the company) is a simplified joint-stock company (société par actions simplifiée) located at 75 rue Guy Moquet in Malakoff (92240). Founded in 2000, CALOGA pursues two activities: it conducts electronic sales prospecting operations on behalf of advertisers using prospects in its databases, compiled from primary collection partners who organize competitions, among other things. It also acts as a data broker, transmitting data collected by first-time data collectors to partners who conduct commercial prospecting for their own advertisers.

2. In 2021, CALOGA had nine employees. For the same year, it generated revenue of \[…\] euros and a net profit of \[…\] euros. The company then gradually ceased operations. In 2022, its revenue amounted to \[…\] euros and a net profit of \[…\] euros. In 2023, its revenue amounted to \[…\] euros and a net loss of \[…\] euros.

3. Pursuant to Decision No. 2022-052C of March 25, 2022, issued by the President of the French National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties (hereinafter the CNIL or the Commission), an inspection was carried out on May 11 and 12, 2022, at the company's premises. The purpose of this inspection was to verify the compliance of the company's processing operations with the provisions of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, relating to information technology, data files, and civil liberties (hereinafter the French Data Protection Act or the Act of January 6, 1978, as amended) and other provisions relating to the protection of personal data provided for by laws and regulations, European Union law, and France's international commitments.

4. Minutes No. 2022-052/1 and No. 2022-052/2 dated May 11 and 12, 2022, were notified to the company following the on-site inspections. Several exchanges between the company and the delegation took place between May 2022 and May 2023.

5. To examine these elements, the Chair of the Commission appointed Ms. Aminata Niakaté as rapporteur on April 22, 2024, on the basis of Article 22 of the amended Law of January 6, 1978.

6. On 21 June 2024, following her investigation, the rapporteur served the company with a report detailing the breaches of Articles 5(1)(e), 6, and 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 (hereinafter the Regulation or the GDPR) and Article L. 34-5 of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (hereinafter CPCE) that she considered to have occurred in this case. This report proposed that the restricted committee impose an administrative fine on the company. It also proposed that this decision be made public, but that it would no longer be possible to identify the company by name after a period of two years from its publication. 7. Several written exchanges subsequently took place between the rapporteur and the company, until the investigation was closed and served on the company on December 3, 2024.

8. Following the written adversarial procedure, the rapporteur and the company presented oral observations at the restricted committee meeting.

II. REASONS FOR THE DECISION

A. Regarding the processing operations in question and the liability of CALOGA

9. Pursuant to Article 4(2) of the GDPR, the processing of personal data means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction. Article 4(7) of the GDPR defines the controller as the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing.

10. The Restricted Committee notes that, in the commercial prospecting ecosystem, the capacity to be conferred on the various actors in the chain in terms of processing responsibility – namely the advertiser on whose behalf the electronic prospecting is sent and the intermediary acting between it and the initial collector, who may in particular be responsible for sending electronic prospecting messages for the advertiser – depends on a certain number of parameters (such as, for example, the ownership of the database, its methods of creation and management, the choices made in terms of segmentation or the degree and precision of the instructions given by the advertiser). These allocations and distributions of responsibilities between the various actors may vary depending on the roles and actions carried out by each, depending on the specific case, and they must therefore be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. The qualification retained by the actors themselves, particularly in their contractual acts, constitutes an important element to take into account, but not decisive if it does not correspond to the reality of the criteria of article 4 of the GDPR. Depending on the circumstances, the advertiser, i.e. the entity wishing to promote its products or services, may be considered data controllers (see CNIL, FR, August 3, 2022, no. SAN-2022-017, published; CNIL, November 24, 2022, no. SAN-2022-021, published; CNIL, FR, October 12, 2023, no. SAN-2023-015, published; CE, March 23, 2015, GROUPE DSE, no. 357556, Rec.) or certain specialized service providers offering advertising services and marketing products (see CE, March 11, 2015, TUTO4PC, no. 368624, T; CNIL, FR, December 7, 2020, SAN-2020-016, published). These service providers include companies that compile contact databases from various third-party sources (known as primary collectors), which they resell to partners or use to offer commercial prospecting services to advertisers. Depending on the configuration, these companies may be subcontractors of the advertiser or data controllers for prospecting operations, without precluding possible joint liability between the advertiser and its service provider. 11. In the area of commercial prospecting, the Restricted Committee, for example, held that an organization whose activity is the creation of a database of contacts intended for commercial prospecting by electronic means and the sending of prospecting emails to advertisers is the data controller, on the basis of the following elements: firstly, with regard to the determination of the purposes, the Restricted Committee notes that \[…\] the company is the owner of the database used in the context of prospecting campaigns, with advertisers and web agencies not providing the personal data of the prospects to be contacted and not having access to the personal data of the prospects. Secondly, the Restricted Committee considers that the company determines the essential means of processing in that it defines the personal data contained in its prospect database, the periods for which this data is kept there and any updates that need to be made. Consequently, and without it being necessary in this case to rule on a possible joint liability of the advertising partners of the company \[…\], the restricted committee holds that the latter has defined the purposes and means of the processing linked to the management and provision of its personal database for the purposes of commercial prospecting by email (CNIL, FR, December 7, 2020, SAN-2020-016, published).12. The rapporteur first considers that CALOGA acts as the data controller for electronic prospecting activities carried out using the data contained in its databases on behalf of its advertising clients. Second, with regard to the transmission of prospect data to its partners so that they can carry out electronic prospecting operations on behalf of advertisers, the rapporteur considers that CALOGA acts as a joint data controller with the partners receiving the data.

13. The company confirms its status as the data controller for database management and electronic prospecting operations carried out on behalf of advertisers. With regard to prospect data transmission operations, the company considers, unlike the rapporteur, that its partners are processors, and that the requirement for valid consent from prospects for the transmission of their data cannot be imposed on it in this context, as the data is transmitted to subcontractors. The legal basis for this processing, according to the company, would be legitimate interest. It states that it has conducted a personal analysis of the status of the various parties involved and cannot be criticized for having reached a different conclusion from that of the CNIL.

14. Regarding the creation of CALOGA's databases, the Restricted Committee notes that CALOGA purchases its data, collected through competitions or product tests, from commercial partners (the "primary collectors") to create its prospect databases, which it owns. As such, it is stipulated, in particular in the contract entered into with the company \[...\], the data provider, that CALOGA itself becomes a data controller when it uses the personal data of Internet users who have agreed to join its database to implement processing operations for which it has defined the purposes and means. The data collected in this context include surname, first name, title, email address, postal code, date of birth, and, occasionally, postal address. It also notes that the company implements this commercial prospecting process by canvassing prospects present in its four databases (CALOGA, ZEPLAN, BASYLO, or VOZEKO) and by choosing the segments to be canvassed itself.

15. It thus appears that the company is responsible for the processing relating to the creation of its four contact databases.

16. With regard to carrying out commercial prospecting operations for the benefit of advertising clients, the Restricted Committee notes that CALOGA offers a service for sending prospecting emails at the request of agencies or affiliate platforms that provide CALOGA with prospecting kits on behalf of end advertisers.

17. It is apparent from the evidence in the case file that, in practice, these electronic sales prospecting operations are carried out using data from one of CALOGA's databases, determined based on the desired volume, which the company itself created from prospect data transmitted by its primary collection partners. In such a situation, CALOGA's customers not only do not provide the data used, but also do not have access to it.

18. It thus appears that, with regard to sales prospecting operations on behalf of advertisers, the company acts at least in part as the data controller when these operations are carried out using its databases. In this regard, it should be noted that the company confirmed its status as the data controller, first during the on-site inspection carried out in May 2022, and then during its observations with the rapporteur. Furthermore, and without it being necessary in this case to rule on the possible joint liability of its clients, the Restricted Committee notes that CALOGA's liability does not exclude that of the advertisers, who act as joint controllers. It is also possible that in certain cases, CALOGA acts as a processor for its clients, but these hypotheses are not at issue in this case.

19. In view of all of the above, the Restricted Committee wishes to clarify that this decision concerns the processing for which CALOGA is, and acknowledges itself to be, the controller, and which involves the conduct of electronic prospecting operations from its databases for the benefit of advertising clients. 20. Regarding the transmission of prospect data for the purposes of commercial prospecting by electronic means, the restricted committee notes that the company regularly transmits (once a month) the data of active prospects present in its databases, which it has created, to partners, mainly the companies \[…\], so that they can in turn carry out commercial prospecting operations by electronic means on behalf of their own advertising clients. This transmission is carried out by delivering to the partner one or more databases of the company CALOGA, the partner having the choice of the database or databases that it wishes to receive. This delivery is carried out by downloading a secure file which cancels and replaces the previous one. The companies to which the data are transmitted, such as \[…\] or \[…\], then carry out new commercial prospecting operations, in particular by electronic means, on behalf of their advertising clients from the databases whose segments they have targeted with their own tools to which they wish to solicit. These operations constitute new processing of personal data, implemented by data controllers other than CALOGA.

21. Under these conditions, the Restricted Committee considers that the company must be considered the data controller, both for the electronic sales prospecting operations carried out for the benefit of its customers using its database—notwithstanding the potential joint liability of said customers and excluding cases where it acts solely as a processor—and for the transmission of prospect data to partners so that they can carry out electronic sales prospecting themselves.

B. On the regularity of the proceedings brought against the company

22. The company asserts that it cannot be criticized for failing to verify the compliance of consent collection based on requirements that did not exist at the time of the inspections. Such a practice would clearly violate the principles of the legality of offenses and penalties and of non-retroactivity.

23. The Restricted Committee wishes to clarify that the applicable legal framework will be examined, within the framework of this deliberation, for each of the breaches identified. It nevertheless reiterates that the decisions referred to by the company as being subsequent to the inspection operations constitute only the application of pre-existing rules and cannot, under these conditions, be subject to the principle of non-retroactivity of repressive rules, which only applies to mandatory rules.

24. It also underlines that, while the CNIL has the power to publish guidelines, recommendations or reference documents intended to facilitate compliance of the processing of personal data with the texts relating to the protection of personal data (pursuant to Article 8, paragraph 2, b) of the Data Protection Act), the legal rules are set by French and European legislators and interpreted by the competent courts, and are directly applicable to the organizations concerned. Therefore, the adoption by the CNIL of reference documents or guidelines is not a prerequisite for the obligation to comply with the rules already laid down and for the application of sanctions provided for by the GDPR or the Data Protection Act in the event of a violation. The Restricted Committee also notes that in this case, the established rules regarding commercial prospecting, informed by CNIL publications such as its framework relating to the processing of personal data implemented for the purpose of managing commercial activities adopted in September 2021 and the pages dedicated to the issue on its website, as well as by Guidelines 5/2020 on consent within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 adopted by the European Data Protection Board (hereinafter, the EDPB), allowed the parties involved to understand, with sufficient precision, the applicable legal framework and the obligations incumbent upon them.

25. Finally, the Restricted Committee wishes to emphasize that it follows from the principle of accountability, as defined by the GDPR, that it is up to the organization carrying out the processing to define and implement the measures enabling compliance with the applicable legal provisions. In this regard, Recital 74 of the GDPR provides that the controller should be held accountable for any processing of personal data that it carries out itself or on its behalf. In particular, it is important that the controller is required to implement appropriate and effective measures and be able to demonstrate compliance of processing activities with this Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. These measures should take into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk that it presents for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. It therefore appears that it is up to the controllers – and not the data protection authorities – to determine the practical arrangements for implementing the processing that they consider most appropriate, provided that these arrangements enable them to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down by national and European texts.

C. On the failure to comply with the obligation to obtain the consent of the data subjects for the implementation of commercial prospecting by electronic means pursuant to Article L. 34-5 of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code

26. As a preliminary point, the Restricted Committee notes that the company conducts commercial prospecting operations by email using prospect data transmitted by its partners. The life cycle of this data can be summarized as follows: the data is collected from the data subjects by companies such as \[…\] and \[…\] (referred to as first-time collectors), contractually responsible for obtaining the consent of the data subjects to be the subject of commercial prospecting by electronic means. The collection of this data and the gathering of consent are carried out through entry forms for online competitions designed by these companies. This data is then transmitted to CALOGA, which integrates it into one or more of its databases and then uses it to carry out commercial prospecting operations by electronic means. To do this, it relies on the consent previously collected by its primary collection partners, on its behalf, using the aforementioned forms.

27. In law, pursuant to Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, direct canvassing by means of an automated electronic communications system \[…\], a fax machine, or emails using the contact details of a natural person, subscriber, or user, who has not previously expressed their consent to receive direct canvassing by this means is prohibited. / For the purposes of this article, consent means any freely given, specific, and informed expression of will by which a person agrees to the use of their personal data for the purpose of direct canvassing. / Direct canvassing constitutes the sending of any message intended to promote, directly or indirectly, goods, services, or the image of a person selling goods or providing services. For the purposes of this article, calls and messages intended to encourage users or subscribers to call a premium-rate number or send a premium-rate text message also fall under direct marketing.

28. Under Article 4(11) of the GDPR, consent of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to them.

29. The rapporteur notes that CALOGA conducts commercial prospecting operations electronically using prospect data collected through competitions, product testing offers, and surveys by companies that collect data first. The data collection forms implemented by the primary data collectors do not allow for the collection of valid consent from the data subjects, and the measures implemented by the company to ensure that the consent collected complies with GDPR requirements are insufficient.

30. In its defense, the company asserts that it could not have foreseen the CNIL's position on the unsatisfactory design of the data collection forms in the absence of a specific recommendation relating to commercial prospecting, as the cookie recommendation does not fall within the same sector of activity. It specifies that the decisions cited by the rapporteur in support of her argument postdate the audit operations.

31. It adds that it has no discretion regarding the publication of the consent collection materials issued by the primary data collectors and that it has implemented measures to verify the compliance of the processing for which it is responsible: contractual frameworks and verifications of the data collected.

1. On the applicable legal framework and the liability of CALOGA

1.1 On the conditions for the validity of consent

32. The company considers that at the time of the audit, in May 2022, the applicable legal framework did not allow it to conclude that the consent collection mechanisms implemented by its partners were invalid. It maintains that it was only through a deliberation of December 29, 2023 (CNIL, FR, December 29, 2023, Sanction, No. 2023-025, published) that the restricted committee ruled on the specific methods of this collection in the context of competitions organized by first-time collectors, and that it was not in a position to anticipate such a decision. It also argues that the recommendations and guidelines relating to cookies, cited in the report, cannot be applied to commercial prospecting. 33. The Restricted Committee recalls that all the rules applicable to electronic prospecting, as well as those relating to consent, have been established for many years and predate not only the publication of the aforementioned decision, but also the inspection operations carried out in May 2022 at CALOGA.

34. The Restricted Committee thus recalls that the specific consent required by the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, combined with those of Article 4 of the GDPR, must be understood as a free, specific, informed, and unequivocal expression of will and can only result from the express consent of the user, given with full knowledge of the facts after adequate information on the use to which their personal data will be put. 35. It notes that the Court of Justice of the European Union clarified, in its 2019 Planet49 GmbH decision, which concerned the validity of consent given in the context of participation in an online competition, that: Article 7(a) of Directive 95 provides that the consent of the data subject may render such processing lawful provided that that consent is unambiguously given by the data subject. However, only active conduct on the part of that person with a view to manifesting consent is capable of satisfying this requirement (CJEU, Grand Chamber, 1 October 2019, Planet49 GmbH, C-673/17, ECLI:EU:C:2019:801, paragraph 54). Therefore, it must be considered that if consent is not unambiguously given, it must be considered as lacking, which renders the processing unlawful for lack of a legal basis. More specifically, regarding the collection procedures, the CJEU states that the expression of will referred to in Article 2(h) of Directive 95/46 must, in particular, be specific, in the sense that it must relate precisely to the data processing in question and cannot be inferred from an expression of will having a distinct purpose. In this case, contrary to Planet49's argument, the fact that a user activates the participation button in the promotional game organized by that company cannot therefore be considered sufficient to consider that the user has validly given their consent to the placement of cookies (Ibid., paragraphs 58-59).

36. Furthermore, the Council of State held that free, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent can only be the user's express consent, given in full knowledge of the facts and after adequate information on the use that will be made of their personal data. (EC, 10th and 9th Chambers Jointly, June 19, 2020, Google LLC, No. 430810, pt. 21).

37. The Restricted Committee also notes, by way of illustration, that as early as 2017, the Article 29 Working Party (now the European Data Protection Board, hereinafter the EDPB) published guidelines on consent aimed at clarifying the new provisions introduced by the GDPR. New Guidelines 5/2020 on consent were adopted on May 4, 2020, and specify that the free nature of consent implies choice and real control for data subjects. As a general rule, the GDPR provides that if the data subject is not genuinely able to exercise a choice, feels coerced into consenting, or will suffer significant negative consequences if they do not consent, consent is not valid. \[…\] In general terms, any inappropriate pressure or influence exerted on the data subject (which may manifest itself in various ways) preventing them from exercising their will will render consent invalid.

38. Finally, the Restricted Committee emphasizes that the work conducted by the Commission on cookie practices in relation to consent collection banners can usefully be used to assess more generally the conditions for obtaining free, unambiguous, specific, and informed consent, and serve as a reference in commercial prospecting when it is based on consent collection. It should be noted that the general rules relating to the conditions for the validity of consent, drawn in particular from Article 4 of the GDPR, are not intended to differ depending on the sector concerned, and that the CNIL is not required to issue sector-specific recommendations. In this regard, Resolution No. 2020-091 of September 17, 2020, adopting guidelines relating to cookies and other trackers, expressly reiterates that the consent required by Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act refers to the definition and conditions set out in Articles 4.11 and 7 of the GDPR (§§ 5 and 6). 39. Thus, by way of illustration and comparison, the restricted committee notes that in its deliberation No. 2020-092 of September 17, 2020 adopting a recommendation proposing practical methods of compliance in the event of the use of cookies and other trackers, the Commission recommends that the organizations concerned ensure that users take full advantage of the options available to them, in particular through the design chosen and the information provided (§ 10) \[…\] In order not to mislead users, the Commission recommends that data controllers ensure that the interfaces for collecting choices do not include potentially misleading design practices that lead users to believe that their consent is mandatory or that visually highlight one choice more than another. It is recommended to use buttons and a font of the same size, offering the same ease of reading, and highlighted in an identical manner (§ 34). It adds that care should be taken to ensure that the information accompanying each actionable element allowing consent or refusal to be expressed is easily understandable and does not require concentration or interpretation efforts on the part of the user. Thus, it is particularly recommended to ensure that it is not written in such a way that a quick or inattentive reading could lead to the belief that the selected option produces the opposite of what users thought they were choosing. (§ 23). Otherwise, the unequivocal nature of the consent would not be established.40. The Restricted Committee also notes that studies conducted on digital interface practices, particularly regarding cookies, highlight the considerable impact of the appearance of consent banners on user choice, potentially encouraging them to make choices that do not reflect their preferences regarding data sharing.

41. Furthermore, contrary to the company's claims, the Restricted Committee notes that the sanction decision of December 29, 2023 (CNIL, FR, December 29, 2023, SAN-2023-025, published) is based on all of the above-mentioned elements, without imposing any new requirements. It merely applies pre-existing rules that the company was perfectly capable of understanding.

42. It is therefore clear from all of these elements that the rules relating to the consent of data subjects predate the inspections carried out against CALOGA and that they appeared sufficiently clear and precise to enable the company to assess the validity of the consent collected by its partners, on which it relies to carry out its prospecting operations.

1.2 On the obligations imposed on CALOGA

43. The company criticizes the rapporteur for seeking to establish a system of joint and several liability, not provided for in the legislation, between it and its primary collection partners. It considers that its liability should not be assessed in light of the legality of the consent collection mechanisms implemented by its partners—the latter having sole control over the collection media they publish—but in light of the obligations incumbent upon it, itself, at the time of the findings.

44. In this regard, it maintains that the legal framework applicable at the time of the audit did not allow digital marketing players to make the obligations imposed on each of them predictable, since the requirement to carry out verifications of the conditions for obtaining consent from data recipients was only imposed, according to the company, in the decisions rendered by the Restricted Committee after the audits.

45. In any event, the company considers that it has implemented the necessary measures to ensure that it has valid consent, in accordance with the rules and recommendations applicable at the time of the audit. In this regard, it emphasizes that it has, on the one hand, regulated its contractual relationships with its primary data collection partners and, on the other hand, carried out verifications on the forms used.

46. The Restricted Committee notes that the data brokerage sector is characterized by the existence of a processing chain involving several parties, starting with the collection of data by the initial data collectors, followed by their transmission to one or more partners to enable the latter to carry out commercial prospecting operations. In this context, each of the organizations involved must, according to its own responsibility, ensure the lawfulness of the operations in which it participates in this processing chain.

47. The Restricted Committee recalls that, pursuant to the combined provisions of Articles L. 34-5 of the CPCE and Article 4 of the GDPR, this lawfulness requires that the data controller who intends to carry out or arrange for commercial prospecting operations to be carried out electronically obtain the unambiguous, specific, freely given, and informed consent of the data subjects. 48. When prospect data has not been collected directly from them by the data controller, this consent may have been obtained at the time of initial data collection by the initial data collector, on behalf of the data controller. Failing this, it is the data controller's responsibility to collect or arrange for the collection of such consent before carrying out any prospecting activities (CNIL, FR, 24 November 2022, Sanction No. SAN-2022-021, published; Deliberation No. 2021-131 of 23 September 2021 adopting a standard for the processing of personal data implemented for the purpose of managing commercial activities). 49. In this regard, the Restricted Committee upheld the liability of an organization, considering that a simple contractual commitment by the organization providing the data to comply with the GDPR and the applicable rules on commercial prospecting did not constitute a sufficient measure (CNIL, FR, November 24, 2022, Sanction No. SAN-2022-021, published; CNIL, FR, January 31, 2024, Sanction No. SAN-2024-003, published; CNIL, FR, April 4, 2024, Sanction No. SAN-2024-004, published).

50. The Restricted Committee emphasizes that, like the rules governing the conditions for the validity of consent, these requirements are not new and that they derive from the texts to which any organization that intends to carry out commercial prospecting operations electronically is subject in its capacity as data controller. 51. In this case, it is indeed CALOGA, as the data controller of the database used for prospecting, and as the data controller downstream of direct electronic prospecting operations, that is subject to the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE (and not the primary collectors, who do not directly prospect data subjects), which has clearly required, since the transposition into French law of the ePrivacy Directive in 2004, to obtain the consent of data subjects. It is therefore its responsibility, in this regard, to guarantee the lawfulness of these operations by ensuring the validity of the consent it intends to rely on or, failing that, by obtaining said consent itself. It should be noted that Article 7 of the GDPR provides in this regard that in cases where processing is based on consent, the data controller is able to demonstrate that the data subject has given their consent to the processing of their personal data. 52. Furthermore, the Restricted Committee recalls that, regardless of the body responsible for collecting the consent of data subjects, the validity of that consent – and therefore the lawfulness of processing based on such consent – can only be assessed at the time it is collected, which, in this case, requires examining the collection forms implemented by the company's partners.

53. Thus, to the extent that CALOGA has chosen not to collect this consent itself and to rely on that collected by its partners, ensuring the validity of said consent necessarily requires reviewing the collection mechanisms implemented by the primary data collectors.

2. On the characterization of the breach

54. The Restricted Committee notes that, to create its VOZEKO, ZEPLAN, BASYLO, and CALOGA databases, the company collects the email addresses of prospects from primary collection partners - the companies \[…\] - who collect them by organizing contests, product testing offers, surveys, etc.

55. It notes that, in the privacy policies accessible via the websites published by CALOGA for each of its databases, it is specified that the prospects' data was transmitted to it following participation in a contest or any other data collection operation on a website published by a third-party company, mentioning the VOZEKO, ZEPLAN, BASYLO, and CALOGA databases in its capacity as partner/sponsor of the operation, the legal basis for processing this data being consent.

56. The Restricted Committee also notes that the investigation established that in 2022, CALOGA prospected 2,315,189 people for the company \[…\] (based on 2,287 forms), 1,970,942 people for the company \[…\] (based on 2,259 forms), and 2,050,706 people for the company \[…\] (based on 2,255 forms). The data on these prospects was collected through forms primarily published by the companies \[…\] and \[…\].

57. Among the 3,653 forms submitted by the company, some of which have identical appearances, the Restricted Committee notes that at least 21 of them offer the user a button validating both their participation in the competition and the use of their data to receive offers from partners of the company organizing the competition.

58. After completing their contact information, the user has the choice between clicking on a button I PARTICIPATE or I VALIDATE (which may also be titled CONTINUE, VALIDATE MY PARTICIPATION), located at the bottom of the form and allowing them to both validate their participation in the competition and consent to their data being transmitted to partners and used by them for commercial prospecting purposes, or clicking on a link allowing them to participate only in the competition, refusing the transmission and use of their data for commercial prospecting purposes (a link which may be contained in the sentence to participate without receiving offers from sponsors, click here, or To participate without receiving offers from sponsors and their partners, click here.

59. The Restricted Committee considers that, as designed, the proposed forms do not allow data subjects to validly express a choice reflecting their preferences regarding the transmission and use of their data for commercial prospecting purposes. Indeed, the overall overview of the interfaces particularly highlights the CONTINUE or VALIDATE buttons, which, by their size—significantly larger than the rest of the information—and their color—which contrasts with the background used—stand out from the other information provided. Similarly, their title suggests more the conclusion of the user journey than the use of data for commercial prospecting purposes, since, in everyday language, one validates the information entered in a form and authorizes, one accepts the use of data. Finally, their placement gives the impression that they must be clicked to complete registration and participate in the competition. Conversely, the hyperlink allowing participation in the competition without accepting the use of its data by partners is presented in the body of the text located above or below the acceptance buttons, in characters of a size significantly smaller than that used for the buttons and without particular emphasis, so that it does not appear intuitive that it is possible to participate without clicking on one of the aforementioned buttons and therefore without transmitting its data to third parties for prospecting purposes. The consent collected is, under these conditions, devoid of unequivocal and free character.60. The Restricted Committee considers that the user is not in a position to give their consent in a fully informed, free, and unequivocal manner, after receiving adequate information about the use of their data. The misleading appearance of the forms encourages them to give their consent to the use of their data for prospecting purposes.

61. Furthermore, the Restricted Committee reiterates that, while the design of these forms is not attributable to it, the company should have, as indicated in points 46 to 50 of this deliberation, ensured the validity of the consent it intends to rely on to carry out its prospecting operations.

62. The Restricted Committee notes that the company implemented verification measures in 2014 and then updated these measures in 2018 with the entry into force of the GDPR. At the date of the inspections, these verification measures related to a contractual commitment from the first-time collectors to require that valid consent be obtained to allow the transmission of data. Before each contract was signed, the company carried out an audit of the first-time collector's practices. During the contract, the company verified the compliance of the collection operations organized by the first-time collectors, i.e., the information notices, the type of data collected, the presence of a link to participate without consenting to the prospecting purposes and the presence of the name of the brand associated with a database in the list of recipients. The company indicated, however, that, as part of the control procedure, for certain first-time collector partners, the checks are carried out at the conclusion of the partnership and that all operations are validated by default, the company not carrying out checks on all forms, which it confirms in its documents. This is particularly the case for the partner \[…\], which transmits the largest amount of prospect data to the company.

63. The Restricted Committee notes in this regard that the company indicated, firstly, that it had stipulated in its contractual relations with its primary data collection partners that the latter undertook to validly collect the consent of the data subjects and, secondly, that it had implemented certain procedures for verifying the collection forms since 2018. Regarding the contractual framework, the Restricted Committee notes that the clauses contained in the contracts entered into with its partners appear very general – the latter undertaking to validly collect the consent of the data subjects, to document said consent, and to transmit a record thereof to CALOGA. The company receiving the data cannot be satisfied with this and must carry out specific verifications of the conditions for collecting the consent on which it intends to rely to carry out its prospecting operations. In this regard, the Restricted Committee notes that the company did indeed regularly review the data collection forms implemented by its partners. However, the findings show that the checks were not carried out with sufficient frequency given the number of data collection forms used and, in any event, that the company did not draw the necessary conclusions regarding the invalidity of the consent obtained and continued to use the data transmitted to carry out its commercial prospecting operations. Indeed, it appears that, based on the documents in the file, the forms analyzed as part of the audit procedure did not allow valid consent to be obtained from the data subjects, even though the checks carried out by the company had begun several months earlier. 64. It follows from the above that, as the company failed to obtain valid consent from the data subjects to create a contact database for commercial prospecting purposes and use it, with regard to the contact details collected by the companies \[…\] and \[…\], CALOGA committed a breach of the provisions of Article L.34-5 of the CPCE.

D. On the failure to respect the right to withdraw consent pursuant to Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE

65. In law, Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, which transposes the ePrivacy Directive, which refers to the concept of consent within the meaning of Article 4 paragraph 11 of the GDPR, provides that direct marketing by means of an automated electronic communications system \[…\], fax, or email using the contact details of a natural person \[…\] who has not previously expressed their consent to receive direct marketing by this means, is prohibited. For the purposes of this article, consent means any freely given, specific, and informed expression of will by which a person agrees to the use of personal data concerning them for the purpose of direct marketing \[…\]. Furthermore, pursuant to paragraph 5 of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, it is prohibited in all cases to send messages for the purpose of direct marketing by means of an automated electronic communications system within the meaning of paragraph 6 of Article L. 32, fax machines, and emails, without providing valid contact information to which the recipient may usefully send a request to cease such communications without incurring any costs other than those associated with the transmission thereof. 66. Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE therefore makes direct marketing operations conditional on the recipient's consent and, correspondingly, provides the data subject with the right to withdraw their consent by submitting a request to cease marketing communications. The data subject may thus reverse their decision to accept the conduct of marketing operations.

67. The withdrawal of consent by prospects for electronic marketing and its procedures are analyzed in light of the provisions of Article 7, paragraph 3, of the GDPR, which applies to the provisions of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE, insofar as the ePrivacy Directive provides in Article 2 (f) that the consent of a user or subscriber corresponds to the consent of the data subject as set out in Directive 95/46/EC, which was replaced by the GDPR. To this end, Guidelines No. 5/2020 on consent under the GDPR, adopted on May 4, 2020 by the EDPB, may provide inspiration.

68. According to Article 7(3) of the GDPR, the data subject has the right to withdraw their consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent given before its withdrawal. The data subject is informed of this before giving their consent. Withdrawing consent is as simple as giving consent.

69. In its Guidelines No. 5/2020 on consent under the GDPR, adopted on May 4, 2020, the EDPB states that: The data subject should also be able to withdraw their consent without prejudice. This means, among other things, that a controller must offer the possibility to withdraw consent free of charge or without resulting in a reduction in the level of service (point 114). This provision should be read in light of recital 42 of this Regulation, which provides that: consent should not be considered freely given if the data subject does not have genuine freedom of choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw their consent without prejudice.

70. The rapporteur notes that prospects can give their consent to receive offers from CALOGA partners, via the collection forms, with a single click. Their data is then stored in CALOGA's various databases. While users can unsubscribe upon receiving an email by clicking on the unsubscribe link, this unsubscription will only apply to the database from which the email was sent or to an end advertiser on whose behalf the email was sent. To unsubscribe from offers sent by CALOGA in full, it is necessary to send an email to CALOGA. The rapporteur considers that withdrawing consent is not as simple as giving it, since it is not possible to withdraw consent to receive offers from all of CALOGA's databases with a single click, whereas prospects give their consent with a single click to receive all partner offers sent by CALOGA.

71. The company states that links inserted in prospecting emails allow unsubscribers to no longer receive advertising content from a specific advertiser or database. It specifies that it is possible to request withdrawal of consent for all databases via the address dpo@caloga.com.

72. Furthermore, the company questions the existence of an absolute right to withdraw consent when consent can be given, with a single click, to a multitude of partners. It therefore questions the obligation imposed on all of these partners to take into account the withdrawal of consent and affirms that it has complied with the CNIL's recommendations published on its website regarding the transmission of data to partners.

73. In this case, the Restricted Committee notes that the company organizes its processing around four databases: CALOGA, ZEPLAN, BASYLO, and VOZEKO, each of which contains more than one million entries, with duplicates. When prospects give their consent with a single click to the collection of their data for prospecting purposes, this data may be sent to one or two of CALOGA's databases. These databases are presented as different partners in the lists of partners on the collection forms implemented by the initial data collectors.74. The Restricted Committee notes that, in prospecting emails sent on behalf of advertisers, two links are inserted. The first link allows the prospect to unsubscribe from receiving advertising content from a specific end advertiser, regardless of the database used. A second link allows the prospect to unsubscribe from receiving advertising content from partners of a CALOGA brand, i.e., from one of its databases. Thus, if the prospect has registered in another of the company's databases, named differently under a different brand, they will continue to receive offers sent from that other database even if they have used the second link to unsubscribe from the offers received. The Restricted Committee also notes that, for a prospect's withdrawal of consent to be taken into account for all databases managed by CALOGA (i.e., for all brands, according to the terminology used by the company), the prospect cannot express this request via a link contained in a single prospecting email, but must send an explicit request to the company's DPO by email or click on several unsubscribe links included in separate emails.

75. A prospect can therefore be registered in one or two databases with a single click. However, when they wish to withdraw their consent to receive offers from advertisers sent by CALOGA and from the two databases to which they are registered, they must make a specific unsubscribe request for all of the company's databases in which they are registered, which requires several steps and clicks on different unsubscribe links contained in separate prospecting emails or sending an email to a dedicated address. 76. The Restricted Committee therefore notes that, in the system implemented by CALOGA, it is not possible for the prospect to unsubscribe with a single click from the CALOGA databases to which they have subscribed. However, it notes that if the prospect is only registered in a single CALOGA database, the prospect will only need a single click to withdraw their consent. The Restricted Committee considers that, when a prospect is registered in two of the company's databases with a single click at the time of collection, they should be able to withdraw their consent for both databases with a single click from a URL link in the prospecting email. Clicking on this link would therefore have the same consequences as sending an email to the company to unsubscribe from the CALOGA databases to which they have subscribed. 77. With regard more specifically to the rules published on the CNIL website in a practical sheet relating to the transmission of data to partners, the restricted committee notes that they do indeed indicate that it is possible for a first-time collector who transmits data to partners to collect the consent of a prospect, at the time of collecting their data, in a single click on behalf of several partners - who will be recipients of the data and responsible for processing their prospecting operations - as long as they are identified. However, contrary to the company's analysis, this publication does not refer to the methods for withdrawing the consent of the interested parties and therefore does not include any information on this point, contrary to the provisions of Article 7 of the GDPR, which provides that it must be as simple to withdraw consent as to give it. On this basis, the Restricted Committee considers that by giving consent with one click to be included in two CALOGA databases, the prospect must therefore be able to withdraw their consent from these two databases with one click, especially since the databases are managed by the same data controller.

78. In addition to this general issue, the Restricted Committee also notes that CALOGA has named one of its four databases (or brands) CALOGA (the names of the other databases/brands being ZEPLAN, BASYLO, and VOZEKO). The Restricted Committee emphasizes that this system implemented by the company is confusing since the prospect may legitimately believe, by clicking on the unsubscribe link titled "no longer receive any offers from CALOGA advertisers," that the action applies to all of the company's databases. Indeed, it is highly misleading, from the prospect's perspective, that CALOGA has given its name to one of the databases. A prospect who, at the time of data collection, checks the list of partners, will see the name Caloga displayed as a trademark and not as a company. They will not notice that CALOGA owns other trademarks, and therefore other databases, which appear under a different name in the list of partners.

79. It is clear from these elements that there is real harm to prospects who believe they have withdrawn their consent. Despite a positive action on their part requesting the withdrawal of their consent, they will continue to receive prospecting emails in a context of intense solicitation linked to the very nature of the electronic prospecting market.

80. In this regard, and in light of all of the above, the Restricted Committee considers that the company cannot rely on its internal organizational choices, by opting to distribute the collected data across different databases corresponding to different brands, to avoid its obligations, as its organizational choices must not prevent the withdrawal of consent under the same conditions as those under which it was obtained.

81. Therefore, by not offering data subjects the option of withdrawing their consent with a single click from the databases to which they have subscribed with a single click, the company has committed a breach of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE (French Data Protection Regulation) as clarified by Article 7, paragraph 3 of the GDPR.

E. On the failure to comply with the obligation to have a legal basis for transmitting prospect data for the purposes of commercial prospecting by electronic means pursuant to Article 6 of the GDPR

82. Article 6(1) of the GDPR provides that processing is lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following conditions is met: a) the data subject has consented to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes; b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; d) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

83. Pursuant to Article 4(11) of the GDPR, consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. 84. Regarding the quality of consent collection, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) clarified in its Planet49 GmbH decision: Article 7(a) of Directive 95 provides that the consent of the data subject may render such processing lawful provided that that consent is unambiguously given by the data subject. However, only active conduct on the part of that person with a view to manifesting consent is capable of satisfying this requirement (CJEU, Grand Chamber, 1 October 2019, Planet49 GmbH, C-673/17, §54).

85. If consent is not unambiguously given, it must be considered lacking, which renders the processing unlawful for lack of a legal basis. 86. Regarding the methods for obtaining consent, the CJEU states that the expression of will referred to in Article 2(h) of Directive 95/46 must, in particular, be specific, in the sense that it must relate precisely to the data processing in question and cannot be inferred from an expression of will having a distinct purpose. In this case, contrary to what Planet49 argued, the fact that a user activates the participation button in the promotional game organized by that company cannot therefore be considered sufficient to consider that the user has validly given their consent to the placement of cookies (ibid., §§ 58-59).

87. Furthermore, regarding the quality of the information provided when obtaining consent, the CJEU stated that clear and complete information must enable the user to easily determine the consequences of the consent they may give and ensure that this consent is given with full knowledge of the facts. It must be clearly understandable and sufficiently detailed to enable the user to understand how the cookies used work (idem, §74).88. The Council of State, for its part, held that free, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent can only be the express consent of the user, given with full knowledge of the facts and after adequate information on the use to which their personal data will be put. \[…\] Finally, regardless of the method by which it is obtained, consent is only valid if it is preceded by a clear and distinct presentation of all the purposes pursued by the processing (EC, 10th and 9th Joint Chambers, June 19, 2020, Google LLC, No. 430810, pt. 21).

89. Finally, in its framework relating to the processing of personal data implemented for the purpose of managing commercial activities, the CNIL considers that if the purpose of the transmission is to enable commercial partners to carry out prospecting requiring the prior consent of the data subjects (electronic prospecting):

o given that commercial prospecting by electronic means presents specific risks (particularly due to the volume of requests likely to be received due to its automation), the organization transmitting the data must inform the data subjects, on the data collection medium (online form or paper form), and obtain their consent to this transmission;

o the organization transmitting the data must, beforehand, have allowed the data subjects to assess the consequences of their choice regarding the transmission by informing them of the scope of the transmission. Informing the data subjects of the number and sector of activity of the partners who would be recipients of the data is an example of a measure that helps to respect the reasonable expectations of the data subjects in this regard;

o Before conducting electronic prospecting, the partners who are recipients of the data must prove that they also have the consent of the individuals who will be contacted. \[…\]

The CNIL has indeed considered that there must be a parallel between the transmission of data to third parties to create databases for electronic marketing purposes and the regime governing this transmission, implying that this transmission is carried out on the basis of consent (opt-in), whereas, when the marketing is based on a legitimate interest regime with opposition (opt-out), the transmission of data to third parties does not require consent (but the individual must be informed, along with the categories of recipients) and be able to object (CNIL, P, December 1, 2021, Formal Notice, Company X, No. MED-2021-131, unpublished). 90. The rapporteur asserts that, contrary to the company's analysis, the partners to whom it transmits prospect data for electronic sales prospecting purposes do not act as subcontractors on behalf of CALOGA and that the company should therefore have obtained the prospects' consent to transmit their data to commercial partners for electronic sales prospecting purposes. However, since the consent obtained at the time the prospect data was collected was not valid, the company could not transmit this data to its partners.

91. The company disputes the status of data controller of its recipient partners and considers them, based on a factual analysis, to be subcontractors. As such, it considers that it is not required to obtain specific consent for the transmission of data. 92. It asserts that, in the absence of recommendations from the CNIL, it cannot be criticized for failing to anticipate the CNIL's requirements regarding the status of the partners receiving the data and therefore the obligation to obtain specific consent for the transmission of prospect data to its partners.

93. The Restricted Committee notes that in this case, as part of its data brokerage activity, the company builds its prospect databases with primary collection partners (the companies \[…\], in particular) and then transmits them to other partners who carry out electronic prospecting activities for the benefit of end advertisers. The main partners to whom this data is transmitted are the companies \[…\] (1.9 million prospect data items transmitted during the last transmission in February 2023) and \[…\] (2.2 million prospect data items transmitted during the last transmission in May 2023).

94. As detailed in its previous arguments (points 17 and 18), the Restricted Committee notes that CALOGA transmits data to its partners so that commercial prospecting operations can be carried out electronically on behalf of their advertising clients using databases from which its partners have targeted, using their own tools, the segments they wish to contact. The administration of these databases and the operations constitute new processing of personal data, implemented by data controllers other than CALOGA. In this context, the Restricted Committee considers that CALOGA must be considered as the controller of the transmission of prospect data to partners so that commercial prospecting operations can be carried out electronically by the latter on behalf of third parties. However, to be lawful, as emphasized in the CNIL's framework for the processing of personal data implemented for the purpose of managing commercial activities, when the purpose of data transmission is to enable business partners to conduct prospecting requiring the prior consent of the data subjects (electronic prospecting), the organization transmitting the data must obtain the consent of the data subjects for this transmission of their data. Indeed, since the data is transmitted solely for operations for which the law, due to its particular intrusiveness, requires consent, the CNIL considers that the legal basis of legitimate interest cannot be upheld. Thus, in the specific ecosystem of data brokers where the transmission of prospect data is intended for electronic prospecting operations, prospecting based on the legal basis of consent, all processing involving the transmission of personal data for this purpose must also be based on the legal basis of consent. 95. However, CALOGA does not have valid consent to transmit prospect data to its partners for electronic sales prospecting purposes on behalf of their advertising clients. The company considers that it is not required to obtain specific consent for this transmission, as it falls within its legitimate interest.

96. By not having the consent of the data subjects for this transmission of their data, and thus a valid legal basis for implementing this processing, the company has committed a breach of Article 6 of the GDPR. F. On the failure to comply with the obligation to retain data for a period not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are processed, pursuant to Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR

97. Pursuant to Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR, personal data must be retained in a form that permits identification of the data subjects for a period not exceeding that necessary for the purposes for which they are processed (…).

98. Pursuant to these provisions, it is the responsibility of the data controller to define a retention period consistent with the purpose of the processing. When this purpose is achieved, the data must be deleted or anonymized, or be subject to interim archiving for a specified period when their retention is necessary, for example, to comply with legal obligations or for pre-litigation or litigation purposes, in particular.

99. In this regard, the restricted committee has repeatedly recalled that the retention period for personal data must be determined according to the purpose of the processing. When they are no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were collected, the data must either be deleted or be subject to intermediate archiving when their retention is necessary, for example to comply with legal obligations or for pre-litigation or litigation purposes. This intermediate archiving first requires sorting the relevant data to be archived, based on the purposes justifying its retention (legal or accounting obligations, litigation purposes, etc.), then separating it from the active database, which may be physical—via a transfer of the data to a dedicated archive database—or logical—via the implementation of technical and organizational measures ensuring that only those individuals with an interest in processing the data due to their duties can access it (CNIL, FR, September 8, 2022, Sanction, No. SAN-2022-018, published; CNIL, FR, December 29, 2023, Sanction, No. SAN-2023-023, published). 100. Regarding the starting point of the period, the restricted committee also considered that a data controller \[could not\], without disregarding the principle of limiting the duration of data retention, consider that the simple opening of a prospecting email by a person allows the starting point of the retention period for prospects’ data to start again and thus retain such data even though the prospects have not demonstrated, by a clear act, an interest in the company’s products or services for several years (CNIL, FR, 28 July 2020, sanction deliberation no. SAN-2020-003; CNIL, FR, deliberation SAN-2020-016 of 7 December 2020). This position reflects the doctrine of the CNIL which, as early as 2016, in Article 5 of Deliberation No. 2016-264 of 21 July 2016 amending a simplified standard concerning the automated processing of personal data relating to the management of customers and prospects (NS-048), specified that personal data relating to a non-customer prospect may be retained for a period of three years from their collection by the data controller or from the last contact from the prospect (for example, a request for documentation or a click on a hyperlink contained in an email; on the other hand, the opening of an email cannot be considered as a contact from the prospect).101. These elements are now reiterated in the framework relating to the processing of personal data implemented for the purpose of managing commercial activities: Personal data relating to a non-customer prospect may be retained for a period of three years from its collection by the data controller or from the last contact from the prospect (for example, a request for documentation or a click on a hyperlink contained in an email referring to the promoted product; however, simply opening an email should not be considered a contact from the prospect). At the end of this three-year period, the data controller may contact the data subject again to determine whether they wish to continue receiving commercial solicitations. In the absence of a positive and explicit response from the individual, the data should be deleted or archived for a period in accordance with the provisions in force (page 11).

102. The rapporteur first considers that by retaining prospect data for a period of four years, without sorting or archiving the data in the interim, even though these prospects are considered inactive by the company after a period of one year without interaction, the company retained the data for an excessive period. She then considers that taking the opening of an email as the starting point for the period does not comply with the requirements of the GDPR, since this interaction, sometimes involuntary, could allow the company to retain prospect data indefinitely in the absence of any voluntary act by the data subjects expressing a wish to do so.

103. The company states that it has compartmentalized its databases in order to pursue three purposes: exploiting the data of active prospects, identifying prospects who have withdrawn their consent, and retaining the data of inactive prospects for evidentiary purposes. It adds that it implements different retention periods depending on the intended purpose: 12 months from the prospect's last action (opening a prospecting email) for commercial prospecting purposes. After 12 months, the prospect is considered inactive. The data of inactive prospects is retained for four years for evidentiary purposes related to consent.

104. Furthermore, it specifies that these retention periods and the starting point of the period are imposed by the operational constraints of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as well as by the statutes of limitations in criminal matters provided for in Article 133-3 of the Criminal Code.

105. The Restricted Committee notes that CALOGA applies a maximum retention period of twelve months from the last action of the active prospect. The company takes into account the later of the date of collection or expression of consent from the data subject, the date the email was opened, or the date a link within an email was clicked. After these twelve months, and without any interaction from the prospect, the latter is considered inactive. An additional retention period of four years from the date the prospect becomes inactive is then applied by the company for evidentiary purposes relating to the prospects' consent. It notes that the company thus retains more than 13.5 million email addresses corresponding to prospects whose data was collected for more than three years or who became inactive for more than three years.

106. First, the Restricted Committee notes that, to determine the active or inactive status of a prospect, the company took into account the date a sales prospecting email was last opened as the date of the last interaction with the prospect, starting the twelve-month period before the prospect was moved to inactive status. Thus, each time the prospect opens an email from the company – even inadvertently – the company will extend the retention of this prospect’s data in its active databases, potentially without limitation. According to a long-established doctrine, the notion of interaction, as understood by the company, is too broad in that the mere opening of an email does not necessarily reflect a desire to stay in contact with the company that is soliciting the person concerned. Indeed, depending on the email service used, clicking once on a new email may be enough to open it, which may result from a simple browsing accident. Opening an email therefore does not result from the same active action on the part of the person concerned as, for example, clicking on a URL link contained in a prospecting email referring to a particular product or service, or even asking the company to obtain documentation on one of its products or services. 107. Secondly, the Restricted Committee notes that the company's prospect data is acquired for a specific purpose, namely commercial prospecting. While, once this purpose has been achieved, the retention of certain data may be justified in light of other purposes, for example, the purposes of preserving evidence related to prospect consent and ensuring the complete cessation of all commercial solicitation of said prospect, as cited by the company, the Restricted Committee considers, however, that the company must, upon transition to inactive status, carry out a sorting process to delete data that is no longer necessary and retain only that which is necessary for these purposes, by archiving it in an interim manner to limit access to only those persons who have a need to know it due to their duties. The Restricted Committee notes that the company confirmed that it does not carry out any intermediate archiving and that it retains all of its prospects' data in an active database for a period of four years from the moment the prospect is considered inactive, thus not implementing any differentiated access based on the purposes pursued and not sorting or deleting the data in question, such as date of birth, postal code, or postal address. Such a practice does not comply with the principle of limitation set out in Article 5, paragraph 1, e) of the GDPR.

108. In any event, the Restricted Committee considers that the operational constraints imposed by economic actors cannot justify disregarding the requirements arising from the GDPR. 109. Regarding the time limits provided for in criminal proceedings, the Restricted Committee considers that the provisions of the Criminal Code invoked by the company, namely the combination of Articles 226-16 and 133-3 of the Criminal Code, do not apply to the prospecting processing carried out by CALOGA. Indeed, Article 226-16 of the Criminal Code covers the act, including negligence, of processing personal data or causing it to be processed without complying with the formalities required by law prior to its implementation. This only concerns processing requiring formalities prior to processing, such as processing in the health sector, which is not the case here. 110. Consequently, the Restricted Committee notes that the fact that the company considers the opening of an email as an interaction by the prospect to define the starting point of the retention period and keeps its prospects' data in an active database, without sorting, for a period of four years from the date the data becomes inactive, constitutes a breach of the provisions of Article 5, paragraph 1, e) of the GDPR. G. On the failure to comply with the obligation to ensure the security of personal data pursuant to Article 32 of the GDPR

111. Article 32(1) of the GDPR provides that, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks, of varying likelihood and severity, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk \[…\], including means to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services, and a procedure for regularly testing, analyzing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of processing.

112. In terms of authentication, it is necessary to ensure that a password used to authenticate on a system cannot be disclosed. Storing passwords securely is a basic precaution in terms of personal data protection. As early as 2013, ANSSI issued warnings and reiterated best practices regarding password storage, stating that they must be stored in a form transformed by a one-way cryptographic function (hash function) that is slow to calculate, such as PBKDF2, and that password transformation must involve a random salt to prevent attacks using precalculated tables.

113. The Commission also specified in its Deliberation No. 2017-012 of January 19, 2017, regarding storage conditions, that passwords must never be stored in plain text. It recommends that it be transformed using a non-reversible and secure cryptographic function (i.e. using a public algorithm known to be strong whose software implementation is free of known vulnerabilities), incorporating the use of a salt or a key. The commission further considers that the salt or key must be generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (i.e. based on a public algorithm known to be strong whose software implementation is free of known vulnerabilities), and not be stored in the same storage space as the password verification element. These requirements were included in deliberation No. 2022-100 of July 21, 2022 adopting a recommendation relating to passwords and other shared secrets, and repealing deliberation No. 2017-012 of January 19, 2017 (see §§ 48 et seq.). Furthermore, the restricted formation has, on several occasions, sanctioned organizations on this point (see in this regard, CNIL, FR, November 24, 2022, n° SAN-2022-021, published and CNIL, FR, October 12, 2023, n° SAN-2023-015).114. The rapporteur considers that the passwords allowing access to the company's back office are stored in a file where they are hashed using the MD5 algorithm, which is considered obsolete. Furthermore, she states that access to the company's databases is via a single user account whose credentials are known to two people.

115. The company considers that there is no evidence to suggest that access to the databases was made possible via the back office. She specifies that the storage of passwords in MD5 applies to individuals with access to the back office. The company considers that, since the back office did not allow access to personal data, Article 32 of the GDPR is not applicable to the present case.

116. Furthermore, it states that the programmatic MySQL account is an account accessible via a username and password, and is intended to be used by all PHP scripts, i.e., lists of commands or instructions using the PHP programming language, requiring access to the database. Access to these usernames is protected, as they are only accessible via a prior login by one of the administrators. It therefore concludes that the measures to ensure traceability of connections to this account are sufficient.

117. First, the Restricted Committee recalls that, with regard to password security, the MD5 hash function has known vulnerabilities that do not guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of passwords in the event of a brute force attack following compromise of the servers hosting them. Given that, generally speaking, a large number of Internet users use the same password to log into their various online accounts, attackers could exploit the compromised data to multiply intrusions into their other accounts, for the purpose of, for example, theft or fraud. The Restricted Committee has already had the opportunity to recall that the company's use of the MD5 hash function has not been considered state-of-the-art since 2004, and its use in cryptography or security is prohibited. Thus, the use of this algorithm would allow a person with knowledge of the hashed password to easily decrypt it in a very short time (for example, using freely accessible websites that allow the value corresponding to the password hash to be retrieved) (Deliberation SAN-2021-008 of June 14, 2021). 118. The Committee considers that the evidence in the case does not establish that the back office allows access to personal data. However, it notes that, assuming that the passwords for accessing the back office and those for accessing the database were stored using the same processes, the MD5 hash algorithm is considered obsolete and would not ensure the security of personal data.

119. Secondly, the Restricted Committee notes that access to the database is via a programmatic account. However, even if the credentials for this account are shared between two individuals, restricting access to the programmatic account to a limited number of IP addresses effectively ensures the traceability of connections.

120. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that the breach of Article 32 of the GDPR has not been established.

III. ON CORRECTIVE MEASURES AND THEIR PUBLICITY

121. Pursuant to Article 20-IV of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, as amended, when the data controller or its processor fails to comply with the obligations arising from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, or from this Law, the President of the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties may \[…\] refer the matter to the Commission's restricted committee with a view to imposing, after an adversarial procedure, one or more of the following measures: \[…\]

7° Except in cases where the processing is carried out by the State, an administrative fine may not exceed €10 million or, in the case of a company, 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover for the previous financial year, whichever is higher. In the cases referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, these ceilings are increased to EUR 20 million and 4% of said turnover, respectively. The Restricted Committee shall take into account, in determining the amount of the fine, the criteria specified in the same Article 83.

122. Article 83 of the GDPR further provides that each supervisory authority shall ensure that administrative fines imposed under this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 are, in each case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, before specifying the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and when deciding the amount of that fine.

123. Finally, Article 22, paragraph 2 of the French Data Protection Act provides that the restricted committee may make public the measures it takes.

124. The rapporteur proposes that the restricted committee impose an administrative fine on the company for its breaches of Articles 5, paragraph 1, e), 6, and 32 of the GDPR and Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE. She proposes that the restricted committee's deliberations be made public.

125. In its defense, the company considers that it has paid particular attention to compliance with the GDPR throughout its operations. It asserts that the breach relating to data security is not a serious one and that, with regard to the other breaches, it cannot be criticized for failing to comply with the new requirements imposed by the CNIL. 126. In the event that the Restricted Committee decides to impose a fine, the company considers that the amount proposed by the rapporteur must be significantly reduced, at a minimum. It specifies that the financial elements to be taken into account when assessing the amount of the fine must be assessed at the time the decision to impose a fine is made and not at the time of the violation. The Restricted Committee must therefore take into account the financial year 2023, given that the turnover for that year amounts to \[…\] euros and a net loss of \[…\] euros. It states that its economic situation forced it to cease trading. For the year 2024, the company achieved a turnover of \[…\] euros and a net loss of \[…\] euros.

127. Finally, the company does not object to the publicity of the penalty.

A. On the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount

128. As a preliminary point, the Restricted Committee recalls that the requirement to provide reasons for an administrative penalty does not require the Restricted Committee to rule on all the criteria provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, nor does it imply that the figures relating to the method of determining the amount of the proposed or imposed penalty must be provided (CE, 10th/9th ch., June 19, 2020, No. 430810; CE, 10th/9th ch., May 14, 2024, No. 472221). Furthermore, while the guidelines adopted by the European Data Protection Board aim to establish harmonized starting amounts and common guidelines on the basis of which administrative fines may be calculated, supervisory authorities are under no obligation to follow all the steps if they are not applicable in a given case, nor to provide reasons for those aspects of the guidelines that are not applicable. However, the reasoning should include, at a minimum, the factors that made it possible to determine the degree of seriousness, the turnover applied, and the aggravating or mitigating factors that were taken into consideration.

129. That being said, the Restricted Committee considers that it is appropriate, in this case, to examine the relevant criteria of Article 83 of the GDPR to decide whether to impose an administrative fine on the company and, if so, to determine its amount. 1) On the imposition of the fine

130. First, the Restricted Committee considers that the criterion provided for in Article 83(2)(a) of the GDPR relating to the nature, gravity, and duration of the breach should be applied, taking into account the nature and scope of the processing, the number of data subjects, and the level of damage they have suffered.

131. The Restricted Committee notes, first of all, that breaches of Articles 5(1)(e) and 6 of the GDPR concern the fundamental principles of data protection and are liable to be punished by the highest fine provided for by the European legislature, namely €20 million or, in the case of a company, up to 4% of its turnover. For clarification, the Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines adopted by the Article 29 Working Party (now the EDPB) on 3 October 2017 emphasize that by setting two different maximum amounts for the administrative fine (€10 million and €20 million), the Regulation already indicates that violations of certain provisions of the Regulation may be more serious than violations of other provisions.

132. The Restricted Committee emphasizes that these breaches concern the basic principles of processing and relate in particular to its lawfulness, as some of the commercial prospecting operations carried out occur without a valid legal basis (the company does not have the consent of the data subjects to solicit them electronically and cannot rely on the legal basis of legitimate interest to transmit prospect data to its partners for electronic prospecting purposes). The Restricted Committee also emphasizes the particularly high number of individuals whose data, more than 2.8 million prospects, the company processes.133. With particular regard to the breach of Article L. 34-5 of the CPCE (French Data Protection Regulation), the Restricted Committee wishes to emphasize its particular seriousness, as it was found that the forms submitted by the company did not allow for the collection of valid consent from the data subjects. These findings demonstrate the systemic and not isolated nature of the breach, noting that the forms examined came from two of the company's three largest data providers. Furthermore, the Restricted Committee wishes to emphasize the number of data subjects affected by the breach, as the company indicated that it sent 6 million marketing messages electronically during 2022.

134. Secondly, the Restricted Committee considers that the criterion set out in Article 83(2)(b) of the GDPR, relating to whether the breach was committed deliberately or negligently, should be taken into account. 135. As already stated, the Restricted Committee emphasizes that the rules relating to commercial prospecting have been defined for many years and that the company was fully aware that in order to carry out its prospecting operations electronically, it required valid consent. The Restricted Committee notes in this regard that the company implemented procedures in 2014 to conduct audits of its suppliers and verify the validity of the consent obtained. Despite these verifications, the company did not take the necessary measures to ensure its compliance. On the contrary, the company continued to use the data transmitted. The Restricted Committee considers that by failing to comply with these rules, the company was, at the very least, grossly negligent.

136. Third, the Restricted Committee intends to take into account certain other circumstances applicable to the facts of this case, pursuant to Article 83(2)(k) of the GDPR. 137. The Restricted Committee considers, in particular, that the company derived a clear financial advantage from the violations committed, insofar as it was paid by its customers for providing the data in question.

138. The Restricted Committee notes, however, that the company has ceased trading.

139. The Restricted Committee considers that all of these elements justify the imposition of an administrative fine.

2) On the amount of the fine

140. The Restricted Committee recalls that the violations identified are subject, pursuant to Article 83 of the GDPR, to an administrative fine of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the company's worldwide annual turnover for the previous financial year, whichever is higher.

141. It considers that the company's business and financial situation must be taken into account in particular. In this regard, it notes that CALOGA's business has ceased. For the year 2023, the company generated a turnover of \[…\] euros and a net loss of \[…\] euros. For the year 2024, the company generated a turnover of \[…\] euros and a net loss of \[…\] euros.

142. In light of the company's liability, its financial capacity, and the relevant criteria of Article 83, paragraph 2 of the GDPR mentioned above, the Restricted Committee considers that a fine of eighty thousand (80,000) euros appears justified.

B. On the publicity of the penalty

143. The Restricted Committee considers that such a measure is justified given the seriousness of the breaches in question, the company's market position, and the number of persons concerned, who must be informed. 144. It also notes that this measure is intended, in particular, to inform the individuals concerned by the processing carried out by the company, as well as partner companies. With regard to prospective customers, this information will enable them, where applicable, to assert their rights.

145. It further considers that this measure appears proportionate since the decision will no longer identify the company by name after a period of two years from its publication.

FOR THESE REASONS

The CNIL's Restricted Committee, after deliberation, decides to:

• impose an administrative fine of eighty thousand (80,000) euros on CALOGA for breaches of Articles 5, paragraph 1, e) and 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 and Article L. 34-5 of the French Post and Electronic Communications Code;

• publish its decision on the CNIL website and the Légifrance website, which will no longer allow the company to be identified by name after a period of two years from its publication.

President

Philippe-Pierre CABOURDIN

This decision may be appealed to the Council of State within two months of its notification.
