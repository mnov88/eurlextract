In accordance with the provisions of article 84.3) of the LGT, the competence to
initiate and resolve this Penalty Procedure corresponds to the Director of
the Spanish Agency for Data Protection.

                                             II
Regarding the allegations presented by the person in charge (VDF) to the initiation agreement,
the following should be noted:

1R) <The claimant's number was not (as of 03/11/2020) included in the

Adigital call exclusion list, having been included from the
claim on the internal exclusion list since 1/04/2020>.

It is proven that the claimant exercised the right of opposition before VDF in
date 05/25/2017, so it should have been attended and, where appropriate, included on that date in

the internal advertising exclusion list.

2R) <The calling numbers referred to the entities Casmar, Solivesa and The Theree
Quarters, the entities themselves are the sole responsibility when using databases
own data>.

It is already proven before this AEPD that the treatment now analyzed by the
The aforementioned entities are carried out in the name and on behalf of VDF, the latter acting in
quality of person in charge when defining the purpose and means. In this regard, the VDF itself
brings up the file PS / 00059/2020 that affects and knows him.

3R) <Only the calling numbers of three entities (Televenta Marktel, Online
Marktel and Unisono) act in the name and on behalf of Vodafone España SAU (in
ahead VDF) (Telesales Marktel: \*\*\* PHONE. 2, Online Marktel: \*\*\* PHONE. 3,
Unisono: \*\*\* PHONE. 4)>

Already answered in the previous one, extensive result to the latter entities.

4R) <VDF adds that in the cases of suppliers that use their own databases
of data as responsible for them, VDF “has given them instructions
clear that they have an obligation to exclude the data of the persons included in
public lists of opposition to the reception of commercial calls ”(sic). Bliss

Exclusion is only the responsibility of those collaborating entities and not VDF. This argument
it is reiterated throughout the statement of allegations.>

From the allegation itself it is inferred that VDF is responsible for the treatments now
analyzed, since VDF confirms that it is the one who provides the instructions for the

Treatment object of order to the entities that use their own databases
on purpose and means.

5R) <Article 23.4 of the LOPDGDD states that it will not be necessary to consult the
referred to in the preceding paragraph when the affected party has provided his

consent to receive commercial communications and, in the present case, has not
It has been proven that the VDF collaborating entities made calls without
the claimant's consent.>

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.agpd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/14

Already answered in the previous ones, since not only did they lack authorization to
perform the treatment now analyzed, but rather that the claimant had exercised
previously the right of opposition before VDF as responsible (echo proven

first) and before the consumer authorities of the Principality of Asturias (Fact
tested seventh) and there is no evidence that he has provided the entities in charge
advertising exclusion records.

6R) <In cases where VDF provides its own databases, these are
provided previously filtered, and the claimant does not record that he has exercised his

exclusion until 04/01/2020, the date on which it is included in the internal list of
VDF exclusions>.

It is evident that VDF did not provide the entities in charge of the treatment with the bases
of filtered data to be treated, since it is established that the claimant previously exercised

the right to object to VDF:

7R) <VDF has an established procedure for the attention of the rights
of those interested in commercial communications, both electronic and by
telephone call, and are attended by a specialized team as indicated in art
21 of the GDPR>

Without prejudice to the veracity of the statement made and not accredited, the truth and
proven is that the alleged procedure for attention to rights has not been
sufficient to avoid the violation of the rights and freedoms of the claimant, therefore
must be corrected.

8R) <Regarding the seriousness of the infractions previously committed by their
collaborators in similar cases, VDF alleges that they act as responsible and
cannot be imputed to VDF, and no penalty may be imposed at this time
procedure based on separate and unrelated files.>

In the present case, VDF is not charged with sanctions for “separate and
unrelated to the present ”, but it is considered aggravating to their conduct according to
establishes article 80 of the LGT.

9R) <The fact of not having attended the right of opposition exercised by the

claimant is due in any case to an unintentional action, devoid of benefit
for VDF>.

In the present case, and with the repetitions of similar behaviors accredited in
this AEPD, it is not plausible that it refers to a punctual conduct, but to a management

deficient of the general procedure established by VDF for the care of
rights of the interested parties.

10R) <Regarding the damage caused and its repair, VDF alleges that it has proceeded to
include the complainant in its internal advertising exclusion list, and is implementing

adequate measures to avoid the repetition of the events. Such measures consist of
provided in procedure PS / 00059/2020 instructed by the AEPD>.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.agpd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/14

It is meant that the damage caused to the claimant has been evident and significant.
having to have filed two claims against VDF in order for the
advertising calls, in defense of your rights.

Consequently, the allegations to the initiation agreement must be rejected.

                                             II
Regarding the allegations presented by the person in charge (VDF) to the Proposal of
Resolution, the following should be noted:

1R) <VDF is not the data controller now analyzed since the
Responsible parties are the collaborating entities that made the call to the
claimant from their own files>.

Regarding the first claim, it has already been answered in section 2R) of the
resolution proposal in the following terms:

“It is already proven before this AEPD that the treatment now analyzed by the
The aforementioned entities are carried out in the name and on behalf of VDF, the latter acting in
quality of person in charge when defining the purpose and means. In this regard, the VDF itself

brings up the file PS / 00059/2020 that affects and knows him ”.

2R) <The claimant was not included in the advertising exclusion list
Robinson of Adigital, so he could not be excluded from the recruitment campaigns of
clients>.

Regarding the second claim, it has already been answered in section 1R) of the
own resolution proposal in the following terms:

“It is proven that the claimant exercised the right of opposition before VDF in

date 05/25/2017, so it should have been attended and, where appropriate, included on that date in
the internal advertising exclusion list ”.

3R) <Regarding the exercise of the right of opposition exercised by letter
certified, VDF does not know>.

In the same sense as in the previous allegation, the exercise of the
right of opposition in the terms set forth from the documentation sent by
the claimant. However, and as VDF now alleges, the lack of organizational means
and technicians implanted in the organization has prevented the right to exercise
worse the claimant, which has caused the infraction to occur now

sanctioned.

4R) <VDF considers that art. 25 of the EC to be punishing a
specific infringement of the same precept for which it has been previously punished in the
framework of commercial campaigns of a certain period of time that has been

object of inspection by the Agency and sanctioned in its maximum amount>.

It should be noted that the previous sanctioning procedures, although they keep
relative to the current one, they are independent of each other with different claimants in

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.agpd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/14

different advertising performances. In the present case, this reiteration of the conduct
offender is considered as aggravating for the imposition of this sanction.

It should be added that the claim that it has already been subject to inspection by
the Agency and sanctioned in its maximum amount does not adjust to reality since,
In the present case, it has not been subject to a prior face-to-face inspection by the
inspection of this AEPD nor the more than fifty previous infractions have been
sanctioned with a maximum amount.

5R) <5.- VDF alleges that the amount of the penalty is disproportionate>.

Regarding the lack of proportionality in the amount of the penalty, it should be noted
which corresponds to 2.5% of the maximum legally foreseen, and the graduation is
has established in accordance with the following criteria indicated in article 80 of the

LGT and that are indicated in the FD V of this resolution.

Consequently, the allegations to the Motion for Resolution must be
dismissed.

                                            III

Article 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, hereinafter
