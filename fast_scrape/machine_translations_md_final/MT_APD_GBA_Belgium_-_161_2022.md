Having regard to the internal rules of procedure, as approved by the Chamber of Representatives

                                                                                                  .

The complainant: Mr X, hereinafter referred to as “the complainant”; .

                                                                                                  .

The Defendant: Y, hereinafter referred to as “the Defendant”. Decision 161/2022 - 2/6

I. Facts procedure

1. On 29 August 2022, the complainant lodged a complaint with the Data Protection Authority against the

    defendant.

    The complaint concerns the unsolicited sending of newsletters by the defendant. The complainant states that

    he received unwanted emails from the defendant on July 19, 2022 and August 29, 2022,

    despite the fact that he never had contact with the defendant. On 20 July 2022, the complainant heeft

    his request for the right to erasure exercised in accordance with Article 17 GDPR at

    regard to the defendant. However, he was not allowed to receive an answer to this within the legal framework
    provided period of 1 month.

2. On October 11, 2022, the complaint will be declared admissible by the Frontline Service on the basis of the

    Articles 58 and 60 of the WOG and the complaint pursuant to Article 62, §1 of the WOG is forwarded to the

    Dispute room.

II. Justification

3. Based on the elements in the file known to the Disputes Chamber and on the basis of the

    powers assigned to it by the legislator on the basis of Article 95, §1 WOG, the

    Disputes room about the further follow-up of the file; in this case, the Disputes Chamber proceeds to:

    the dismissal of the complaint in accordance with Article 95, §1, 3° WOG, based on the following

    motivation.

4. In the event of a dismissal, the Disputes Chamber must gradually investigate and motivate: 1

    - whether there is insufficient prospect of a conviction, after which a technical dismissal follows;

    - whether a successful conviction would be technically feasible but on grounds, in general

        interest, a (further) prosecution is undesirable, followed by a policy dismissal.

    In the event that more than one soil is disposed of, the discarded soils (or technical
                                                                          2
    and policy dismissal) should be treated in order of importance.

5. Based on the information currently available to the Disputes Chamber, it considers it

    impossible to follow up on the complaint for the reasons that will be explained below

    explained. Consequently, it decides to proceed with a technical dismissal.

6. So that the Disputes Chamber - to which the complainant relied on the basis of Article 77 of the GDPR -
    would be competent to handle his complaint, it is in the first place necessary that the GDPR

2Ibid. Decision 161/2022 - 3/6

    applies to the facts at issue or whether other legislation relating to

    data protection that may form the basis of the jurisdiction of the Disputes Chamber, of

    applies.

7. The AVG only applies if the data processing is within the scope of the AVG

    fall.

8. With regard to the territorial scope of the GDPR, Article 3 of the GDPR assumes

    of two different cases. In the first case (Article 3.1 of the GDPR), the

    data processing carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of a

    controller in the territory of the European Economic Area. This first
                                                                    3
    hypothesis therefore presupposes the existence of an establishment on the territory of European
    Economic Area. The complaint in the present case is against a legal person who is

    United States of which there is no establishment in the territory of the European

    Economic Area exists. Article 3.1. of the GDPR therefore does not apply.

9. The second case provided for in article 3.2GDPR specifies that the GDPR applies to the processing

    of personal data that meet the following three cumulative conditions:

      - the processing was carried out by a controller who is not established in the

         European Economic Area;
      - the processing concerns data subjects who are located on the territory of the European

         Economic Area; and

      - these processing activities are related to:

         a) offering goods or services to these data subjects (Article 3.2.a) GDPR) or

         b) monitoring their behavior, insofar as this behavior in the European Economic Area

         takes place (Article 3.2.b) GDPR).

10. On the basis of the documents in the file, the Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that in this case this

    cumulative conditions are met. With regard to the first condition, the Disputes Chamber

    established that the defendant is indeed not established in the European Economic Area. For what

    Concerning the second condition, the Disputes Chamber notes that it is not clear from the complaint whether the
    the complainant was located in the territory of the European Economic Area. Assuming

    that the complainant was indeed located in the territory of the European Economic Area in the

    at the time of the alleged facts - which is therefore not clear from the complaint - has not been fulfilled

    to the third condition. The processing activity in question is not related to "offering

    of goods and services" , nor with "monitoring of data subjects' behaviour".

3The concept of establishment is explained in recital 22: Establishment presupposes the effective and effective exercise of
activities through sustainable relationships. The legal form of such relationships, whether a branch or a
subsidiary with legal personality, is not decisive in this regard. Decision 161/2022 - 4/6

11. The offering of goods and services should be understood as an offer of goods and

    services specifically aimed at data subjects in the European Economic Area

    (for example, on a website located outside the borders of the European Economic Area, which

    offer goods and services in one of the languages of the European Economic Area, with

    possibility to pay in euros, etc.) . These elements must be assessed in concrete terms

    to determine whether goods and services are being offered. 5 The

    Litigation Chamber recalls that Recital 23 confirms that the accessibility of the website

    of the controller, processor or an intermediary in the European Economic Area

    Space, the mention on the website of his e-mail or geographical address, or of his telephone number

    without an international code, does not in itself constitute sufficient evidence that the

    controller or processor intends to offer goods or services

    to a data subject in the European Economic Area. In this regard, the Disputes Chamber refers

    to the Guidelines of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) stating that

    when goods or services are inadvertently or incidentally supplied to a person on the

    territory of the European Economic Area, the related processing of

    personal data does not fall under the territorial scope of the GDPR. 6

12. In this case, the purpose of the controller is to create an (English) platform

    where insights and experiences can be shared about the challenges and triumphs of

    Jewish women. In this context, writing workshops as well as a book with testimonials

    of Jewish women in Israel for sale. The workshops and the book are only available in

    in English and are also only offered for sale against payment in dollars and shekels. The book can

    also only be delivered within the United States of America and Canada on the one hand and Israel

    on the other hand. The Disputes Chamber therefore concludes that there is no question of an offer of

    goodsandservicesspecificallyfocusedonthepersonsintheEuropeanEconomicSpace

    in accordance with Article 3.2.a) GDPR.

13. By "monitoring the behavior of the data subjects", it is understood, the

    trackingactivitiesofthebehaviourontheinternetbutnotjustthat. More generally it's possible

    include activities to monitor the behavior of data subjects, such as behavioral advertising,

    geolocation for direct marketing purposes, the use of cookies or surveillance cameras. There is

    also the condition that this behavior must take place within the European Economic Area. From the

    There is no indication in the complaint that there would be any monitoring of the behavior of the person concerned. The
    The Disputes Chamber therefore concludes that there is no monitoring of the behavior of

    data subjects in accordance with Article 3.2.a) GDPR.

14. In view of the above, the Disputes Chamber decides that the GDPR does not apply to the facts

    presented in the complaint.

15. The Disputes Chamber also notes that with regard to the facts in the present complaint, no

    some other legislation on the protection of personal data applies which means that
    there are no elements giving rise to its competence. In that case, it belongs to the

    competent US authorities to apply the GDPR in this case.

16. Since the GDPR does not apply in this case, nor does any other legislation containing provisions

    contains on the protection of the processing of personal data, which could be the basis

    constitute the competence of the Data Protection Authority, it is not possible that the

    The Disputes Chamber will handle your complaint. Pursuant to art. 95, §1, 3° of the law of 3

    December 2017 establishing the Data Protection Authority, the Disputes Chamber decides
    consequently to dismiss the complaint.

III.Publication of the decision

17. In view of the importance of transparency with regard to the decision-making of the Disputes Chamber,

    this decision will be published on the website of the Data Protection Authority. It is

    however, it is not necessary for the identification of the parties to be directly used for this purpose

    announced.

    FOR THESE REASONS,

    the Disputes Chamber of the Data Protection Authority decides, after deliberation, to:

    - pursuant to art. 95, §1, 3° WOG to dismiss the complaint.
