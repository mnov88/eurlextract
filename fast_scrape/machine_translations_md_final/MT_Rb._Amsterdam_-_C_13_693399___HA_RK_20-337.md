      The parties will hereinafter be referred to as \[applicant\] and Rabobank.
     
    
    
  
  
    
      1 The procedure
    
      1.1.
      
        The course of the procedure is apparent from:
        - the petition of 24 November 2020, with annexes,
        - the order of this court of January 28, 2021, in which an oral procedure is provided,
        - the official report of the oral hearing held on 5 March 2021, together with the documents stated therein.
       
      
    
  
  
    
      2 The facts
    
      2.1.
      
        \[Applicant\] and his then wife took out two mortgage loans with Rabobank to finance a home at \[address 2\] and a home at \[address 1\]. They were jointly and severally liable for the fulfillment of the obligations arising from the loan. During the divorce process, the homes were sold in October 2015 and August 2016 respectively, leaving a residual debt of €119,979.24 in total.
      
    
    
      2.2.
      Since almost immediately after the sale of the first home in 2015, \[applicant\] has voluntarily transferred € 500 per month to Rabobank to repay the residual debt. As of November 2015, \[applicant\] has made seven monthly payments of €500, totaling €3,500.
      
    
    
      2.3.
      In a letter dated 17 February 2017, Rabobank wrote to \[applicant\] the following, insofar as relevant:
      
      
        “On the basis of the information we have received from you, we have calculated that you can repay us € 1,486.11 per month. (…)
        Based on our calculation, you cannot repay the total residual debt within five years. That is why you can choose from one of the following payment schemes, whereby you may not have to repay the entire residual debt.
        (…)
        Do you fully comply with this arrangement and do you still have a residual debt left at the end? Then you will be released from joint and several liability for the unpaid amount. This means that you no longer have to repay the unpaid part of the residual debt to us.
        (…)
        
          Notification Bureau Credit Registration (BKR)
        
        We report the residual debt and agreements according to the guidelines of BKR. For more information, please refer to www.bkr.nl.
        (…)”
       
      
    
    
      2.4.
      Following the letter of 17 February 2017, Rabobank and \[applicant\] corresponded by e-mail. By letter dated 20 March 2017, Rabobank proposed to \[applicant\] a new payment arrangement, in which the amounts already transferred by \[applicant\] on his own initiative to a total of € 3,500 have been deducted. Furthermore, the letter of 20 March 2017 has the same content as the letter of 17 February 2017.
      
    
    
      2.5.
      On September 4, 2017, the parties agreed that \[applicant\] would pay an amount of € 1,388.89 per month, for a period of 36 months, against final discharge. \[Applicant\] transferred amounts to Rabobank over a period from 4 September 2017 to 1 May 2020 and the payment arrangement has been fully complied with.
      
    
    
      2.6.
      Rabobank has paid an amount of € 62,015.83 on the total residual debt.
      
    
    
      2.7.
      In a letter dated 8 May 2020, CoderingVrij lodged an objection with Rabobank on behalf of \[applicant\] against placing special code 3 in the BKR. \[applicant\] has argued that this BKR registration will hinder him in obtaining a mortgage loan for buying a home.
      
    
    
      2.8.
      On 29 May 2020, \[applicant\] was registered with special code 3 with regard to the mortgage debts with Rabobank in the Central Credit Information System (hereinafter: the CKI) of the BKR with the special code 3. This coding means that there has been a write-down of an amount of €250 or more. If debiting takes place against final discharge, the end date of the agreement is stated at the same time as the coding. The credit has been canceled as of May 29, 2020. The code 3 listing in the CKI is therefore visible until May 29, 2025.
      
    
    
      2.9.
      On June 5, 2020, Rabobank responded negatively to the objection made by CoderingVrij. In it, Rabobank indicated that reporting special code 3 is non-negotiable.
      
    
    
      2.10.
      In a letter dated September 4, 2020, CoderingVrij on behalf of \[applicant\] requested Rabobank to remove the BKR registration in the name of \[applicant\]. To that end, \[applicant\] argued that there is a new fact that must be taken into account in the weighing of interests.
      
    
    
      2.11.
      By letter dated 13 October 2020, Rabobank rejected \[applicant\]'s request with reasons. Rabobank has, among other things, written that it had weighed up the interests involved and had to conclude on that basis that the registration of \[applicant\] does not qualify for early removal.
      
    
  
  
    
      3 The request and the defence
    
      3.1.
      
        \[applicant\] requests the court to order, by provisional order, to order Rabobank to remove or have the BKR registration removed from the CKI, on pain of a penalty of € 1,000 for each day from the third day after the decision has been served, up to a maximum of € 30,000 has been reached, with Rabobank being ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings and subsequent costs, plus the statutory interest.
      
    
    
      3.2.
      
        To this end, \[applicant\] states - briefly summarized - that Rabobank wrongly proceeded to the BKR registration. \[applicant\] and Rabobank have agreed a payment arrangement that \[applicant\] has complied with in full. Part of that payment arrangement was that \[applicant\] would then be released from joint and several liability and that he no longer had to pay the unpaid part of the residual debt. Something that does not have to be paid can also not be discharged, so that the special code 3 is illegal. Moreover, \[applicant\] was never informed of the placement of this special code.
      
    
    
      3.3.
      \[Applicant\] further states that Rabobank wrongly refused to remove the BKR registration from the CKI. The residual debt arose due to a one-off and special situation, the need to sell the house due to the divorce. There has never been any question of non-payment and \[applicant\] has very good payment morals. The BKR registration prevents him from obtaining a mortgage loan for a home and from being able to lease a business car, despite the good financial position he is in. The fact that \[applicant\] is now unable to obtain a mortgage loan and a lease car is not proportional to the origin of the codes. His interest in removing the registration outweighs the interests in maintaining it, according to \[applicant\].
      
    
    
      3.4.
      Rabobank defends itself. She argued - briefly stated - that the BKR registration is correct and that it has not become apparent that there are any special circumstances or necessary interests of \[applicant\] on the basis of which it should be removed.
      
    
    
      3.5.
      In so far as relevant, the arguments of the parties are discussed in more detail below.
      
    
  
  
    
      4 The assessment
    receptiveness
    
    
      4.1.
      Rabobank has put forward as the most far-reaching defense that \[applicant\]'s application should be declared inadmissible. To this end, she submits the following. A request for the removal of a BKR registration must be submitted to the competent court within six weeks after Rabobank's rejection, pursuant to Article 35 of the Implementation Act of the General Data Protection Regulation (UAVG). On December 12, 2019, \[applicant\] submitted the first request for non-placement or removal of the coding. Rabobank rejected this request on 13 December 2019. Subsequently, \[applicant\] repeated his requests, most recently on 8 May 2020 and 4 September 2020, Rabobank also rejected these requests on 5 June 2020 and 13 October 2020 respectively. By repeatedly making identical removal requests, \[applicant\] tries to save the statutory deadline. That cannot be the intention of article 35 paragraph 2 UAVG. \[Applicant\]'s request of 4 September 2020 and Rabobank's subsequent rejection of 13 October 2020 should not be taken as the basis for determining the six-week period. This concerns a repeated request in which no new facts and circumstances have been put forward, only a new interest that is otherwise irrelevant. The six-week period to submit a petition started on June 5, 2020. This means that the petition had to be submitted before 17 July 2020, which has not happened. The term has therefore expired, according to Rabobank in each case.
      
    
    
      4.2.
      
        \[applicant\] takes the position that his last request of 4 September 2020 should be used as the starting point and not his previous request of 8 May 2020. The reason \[applicant\] states that the special code 3 was placed in the intervening period and that this is indeed a new fact. Moreover, the interest of \[applicant\] with regard to acquiring a lease car is a new interest that justifies a new assessment. Since Rabobank did not respond to its request of September 4, 2020, i.e. only on October 13, 2020, there is no time limit for submitting the petition. Even if that were the case, this period has still been met because the petition was submitted on November 24, 2020.
      
    
    
      4.3.
      The court states first and foremost that a reasonable interpretation of article 35 paragraph 2 UAVG entails that it is not the intention that by submitting repeated requests it can be achieved (again) that a new term for submitting a petition to the court will start. walk. The legal system also serves to prevent the controller from being summoned roughly or for a long time after he has refused the request. In this regard, however, it should be borne in mind that the request under Article 21 GDPR can be made at any time – and therefore several times. It follows from this that the interested party can also submit an Article 35 UAVG request several times, except for abuse of (procedural) law.
      
    
    
      4.4.
      The court is of the opinion that \[applicant\]'s request is admissible. Unlike Rabobank, the court takes the request for removal of the BKR registration of \[applicant\] dated September 4, 2020 and Rabobank's negative response of October 13, 2020 to answer the question whether his request is admissible. Apart from the difference in the requests of 8 May 2020 (request for non-placement of code 3 in the BKR) and 4 September 2020 (request for removal of BKR registration), Rabobank did not respond to the request in its response of 13 October 2020. position that it concerns a repeated request from \[applicant\] and that for that reason it will no longer process the request. On the contrary, Rabobank reassessed the content of the request and rejected it, taking into account the newly submitted interest of \[applicant\], namely the lease car. \[Applicant\] could therefore rely on the fact that he could submit a petition to the court within six weeks afterwards. Because \[applicant\] is admissible in his request, the content of the request will be assessed.
      
      
        
          BKR registration
        
       
      
    
    
      4.5.
      Under Article 8 of the European Consumer Credit Directive (2008/48/EC), Member States shall ensure that the creditor assesses the consumer's creditworthiness before concluding the credit agreement or increasing the credit limit on the basis of sufficient information which, where appropriate case, has been obtained from the consumer and, where necessary, on the basis of a consultation of the relevant database (credit registration).
      
    
    
      4.6.
      Pursuant to Section 4:32 of the Financial Supervision Act (Wft), credit providers, such as Rabobank, are obliged to participate in a credit registration system. This credit registration is performed by the BKR. The credit providers are also bound by the General Regulations of the CKI (hereinafter: AR). Pursuant to Section 4:34 Wft, before concluding a credit agreement or increasing the credit limit, in the interests of the consumer, the credit provider must obtain information about the consumer's financial position and assess, in order to avoid excessive lending to the consumer, whether of the agreement or the significant increase is justified. If it is irresponsible with a view to over-crediting the consumer, the credit provider may not conclude the agreement or increase the amount.
      
    
    
      4.7.
      According to the legislative history, the purpose of the credit registration is twofold: on the one hand, to protect consumers against excessive lending, and on the other to protect credit providers against borrowers who have shown that they cannot (or cannot) repay their loan. Payment arrears or other irregularities that arise during the term of a credit agreement are stated in the CKI with special codes.
      
    
    
      4.8.
      In the context of participating in that system of credit registration, the credit providers process personal data. The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) applies to this. According to Article 3(4) of the AR, the processing by the BKR – and therefore also by the credit providers – of personal data is lawfully based in Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, because the processing is necessary for the representation of the legitimate interests of the consumer. BKR and its business customers.
    
    
      4.9.
      
        \[Applicant\] can object to the processing of his/her personal data on the basis of Article 21(1)(e) or (f) GDPR on the basis of Article 21(1) of the GDPR. The controller (in this case Rabobank) must honor the objection, unless it demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that outweigh the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject. If the controller does not honor the objection, as here, the data subject can request an effective remedy from the court if necessary (Article 79 GDPR and Article 35 UAVG). The court will assess whether the controller has made it plausible that his compelling legitimate interests (in this case the dual purpose of the credit registration: protecting the consumer against excessive credit and warning other credit institutions) in this specific case outweigh the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject (Recital 69 GDPR).
      
    
    
      4.10.
      This assessment must be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances known at the time of the assessment, so that facts and circumstances that only occurred after registration can be included. Such registration and enforcement must comply with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity. This entails that the infringement of the interests of the data subject (\[applicant\]) may not be disproportionate in relation to the purpose to be served by the processing (principle of proportionality) and that this purpose should not, where reasonable, relate to another, less for the data subject. can be achieved adversely (principle of subsidiarity). For this, reference is made to the judgment of the Supreme Court of 9 September 2011 (ECLI:NL:HR:2011:BQ8097). The applicable GDPR does not intend to change this. Even if the data processing is permitted in principle and the processor has complied with the AR, this does not mean that the weighing of interests can be omitted.
      
    
    
      4.11.
      The controller (Rabobank) will have to demonstrate that in this specific case its interests (as described above under 4.9) are given more weight than the interests of the data subject (\[applicant\]). It is not sufficient to refer in general to the legal obligation to participate in a credit registration system or to the social importance thereof. Nor is it sufficient to invoke the rules of the AR (for example, that a code remains visible for five years); the AR is not a statutory regulation and, in principle, it only applies between the BKR and the affiliated financial institutions. These rules, which have been published, do, however, provide anyone with insight into the way in which the BKR and the affiliated financial institutions wish to carry out the task assigned to them in Section 4:32 Wft. To that extent, they contribute to legal certainty and credit providers can use this as a starting point, but depending on the outcome of the test referred to in 4.9, a credit provider will have to deviate from this if necessary.
      
    
    
      4.12.
      In the context of a request pursuant to Article 21 GDPR, the credit provider must respond to the grounds for objection submitted by the data subject – substantiated to the best of his ability – related to his specific situation. Circumstances that may play a role in the assessment of the objection in the case of a code 3 are, for example: - the amount of the debt that has been forgiven; - whether any payment arrangement has been properly complied with; - the reason for (the origin and continued existence of) the arrears and the degree of culpability in this regard; - the current financial situation of the person concerned (including income) and if this is stable again, how long has it been; - whether the person concerned has other debts; - whether there has been a serious (structural or otherwise) default; - the circumstance that the person concerned cannot wait with the loan (for example for the purchase of a home) until the five-year term has expired (for example due to family and living situation); - the passage of time since the repayment of the debt.
    
    
      4.13.
      Rabobank must assert a compelling interest in maintaining the BKR registration. Rabobank has pointed out the following. \[Applicant\] has not properly fulfilled his payment obligation. For example, he made no payments over the period from 1 November 2017 to 1 February 2018, which has resulted in a arrears. In addition, \[applicant\] informed Rabobank too late and incorrectly about his income situation, which is necessary for Rabobank to redetermine the monthly amount to be paid by \[applicant\] annually. It is also important that a substantial amount has been waived. Moreover, it is not in the interest of \[applicant\] to have the BKR registration removed, according to Rabobank.
      
    
    
      4.14.
      In the opinion of the court, Rabobank has insufficiently demonstrated in this case that the interest in continuing the BKR registration with codes A and 3 carries more weight than the interest of \[applicant\] in its removal. This is due to the following special circumstances.
      
    
    
      4.15.
      It is established that the cause of the residual debt of \[applicant\] that arose in 2015 and 2016 is the direct result of the divorce and the forced sale of the homes as a result. Prior to the sale of the homes, there were no irregularities in the payments of the mortgage loan: \[applicant\] had no arrears or debts with Rabobank up to that point. Almost immediately after the sale of the first home in 2015, \[applicant\] started paying off the residual debt on his own initiative, even before the second home had been sold and the parties had known the total residual debt. Subsequently, the parties agreed on a payment arrangement, which \[applicant\] duly complied with and at the end of which there was no longer any debt to Rabobank. The fact that \[applicant\] may have fully complied with the scheme with minor hiccups in the payment terms, as stated by Rabobank and contradicted by \[applicant\], does not change the foregoing.
      
    
    
      4.16.
      The court is of the opinion that \[applicant\] has sufficiently demonstrated that he is financially stable. He explained that he has been receiving an income from \[applicant's company\] since 2008. In 2018, a net turnover of € 52,296 was obtained. \[applicant\] also has a partner who receives an income from permanent employment. Together they receive an annual income of approximately € 100,000 gross per year. The rent for the private rental home in which they live together is €1,135.29. It has not become apparent that \[applicant\] has (had) other (problematic) debts, apart from a payment arrangement with the tax authorities.
      
    
    
      4.17.
      Furthermore, it is sufficiently plausible that the codes form an obstacle to the purchase of a home or the cheaper renting of a home. After all, Rabobank explained at the hearing that although it is not impossible to obtain a mortgage loan with a code of 3, it is difficult in practice. It also appears from the rejections submitted by \[applicant\] from a number of lenders that they do not wish to provide him with a mortgage. \[Applicant\] has argued that he cannot currently invest in himself by means of an owner-occupied home, nor can he save and build up a pension. After the term of the BKR registration, he is also older, which affects his borrowing capacity. Rabobank has argued that obtaining a mortgage or renting a home more cheaply is not an important interest since \[applicant\] already owns a home and his current income is sufficient to pay the rent. In the opinion of the court, this does not alter the fact that the BKR registration unnecessarily hinders \[applicant\]'s freedom to live how and where he wants to, for which there is no justification from the point of view of the joint lenders.
      
    
    
      4.18.
      It is also plausible that the BKR registration forms a business obstacle for \[applicant\] because it means he can no longer lease a car. \[Applicant\] has explained that his current lease contact will end in March 2021 and that it is not possible to extend the current contract or purchase a new business lease car because of the BKR registration. According to \[applicant\], buying a second-hand car leads to higher costs and is therefore not attractive, while traveling by public transport is not an option because he travels frequently for his work and must be mobile. Rabobank has disputed this and has further argued that leasing a car is not a special circumstance on the basis of which the BKR registration must be removed. In this respect, too, the court is of the opinion that \[applicant\] is unnecessarily restricted in his freedom by the BKR registration, for which there is no justification from the point of view of the joint lenders.
      
    
    
      4.19.
      Under these circumstances, contrary to what Rabobank has argued, there is currently no question of a credit risk against which lenders must be protected, nor does \[applicant\] need to be protected against excessive lending. Contrary to Rabobank's opinion, it cannot be said that the interests of socially responsible services in the financial field prevail over the interests of \[applicant\], despite the fact that only a short period has elapsed since the BKR registration in May 2020.
      
    
    
      4.20.
      This means that the request of \[applicant\] will be granted. In view of this judgment, the position of \[applicant\] that the registration in the BKR was wrongly placed does not require further discussion. This also applies to the question of whether Rabobank wrongly did not include spousal maintenance in the calculation of the payment arrangement, as \[applicant\] argued and denied Rabobank, because this does not lead to a different decision.
      
    
    
      4.21.
      The requested periodic penalty payments can be awarded as determined below under the decision.
      
    
    
      4.22.
      Rabobank will be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings as the unsuccessful party. The costs on the part of \[applicant\] are estimated at:
      - court fee € 304,00
      - lawyer's salary € 1,206.00 (2 points × rate € 563.00)
      Total €1,510.00
      
    
    
      4.23.
      The claimed subsequent costs will be allocated in the manner as stated below under the decision. The statutory interest claimed on the legal costs and subsequent costs can also be awarded, in the manner as stated below under the decision.
      
    
  
  
    
      5 The decision
    The court
    
    
      5.1.
      orders Rabobank to remove the (special) codes A and 3 in the CKI of the BKR in the name of \[applicant\] within 48 hours after notification of this decision, on pain of a penalty of € 1,000 for each day from the third day after the decision has been served, that Rabobank does not comply with this conviction, with a maximum forfeiture of the penalty payments to be made at €30,000.
      
    
    
      5.2.
