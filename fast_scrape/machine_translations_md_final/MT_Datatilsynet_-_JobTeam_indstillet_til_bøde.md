Good data processing

"When a data controller deletes information about the citizen in connection with a non-response request, the data controller unlawfully forecloses the citizen's ability to verify whether he or she has the right to gain access to the information from the Data Inspectorate and the courts. It is a violation of the citizen's fundamental rights and is not an expression of good data processing practices, ‚Äùsays Astrid Mavrogenis, Head of the Data Protection Agency.
Fine setting

The Data Inspectorate has decided to report JobTeam A / S to the police and recommends that the company be fined.

In the opinion of the Data Inspectorate, a violation of the basic principles of the regulation on the security of treatment for a company in a case such as this can basically not be sanctioned by a fine less than DKK 50,000 if the basic requirement of the regulation that fines must be effective and dissuasive. effect, at the same time must be observed. When setting the amount of the fine, the Authority also emphasized that the fine should be proportionate to the infringement.
