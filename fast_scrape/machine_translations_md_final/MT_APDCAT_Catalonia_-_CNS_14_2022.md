stations, trains and facilities to different security companies operating in the market and
that these companies have hired security guards who have theirs
title and qualification to carry out the functions entrusted to them.

to act as a security guard and submit the corresponding claim to the service
customer service of the entity, requesting the identification data of the security guard in
(name, surname, TIP) for the purpose of taking legal action against him.
Based on this background, the DPD requests a ruling on the
following questions
“A) It would be a lawful data processing to provide the identification data of the watchman
security, which provides service in the facilities of (...) and is contracted by a
third company, to the user who has submitted a claim to the service
customer service of (...), without having obtained the prior and express consent of the security guard
security affected?

affected, would be a lawful treatment.
