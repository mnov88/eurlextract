Regarding the "Privacy Policy" of the website, it has been found that it
refers to the repealed Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13, on Protec-
tion of Personal Data (LOPD).

According to article 99 of the RGPD, the entry into force and application of the new RGPD was,
"Twenty days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union (05/25/16)"
and it would be applicable as of May 25, 2018 ”. Therefore, as of 05/25/18,
the LO was repealed. 15/1999, (LOPD), applying compulsorily, from that date
date, the current RGPD and as of 12/07/18 the new LOPDGDD.

The known facts could be constitutive of an infraction, attributable to the
claimed, for violation of article 13 of the RGPD, which establishes the information that
must be provided to the interested party at the time of collection of their data
personal.

For its part, article 72.1.h) of the LOPDGDD, considers very serious, for the purposes of
prescription, “the omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the treatment of
your personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the RGPD "

This offense may be punished with a fine of a maximum of € 20,000,000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
of a higher amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

However, Article 58.2) of the RGPD provides that: “Each control authority

have all of the following corrective powers listed below: b)
sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with warning when
the treatment operations have infringed the provisions of this
Regulation; (…); i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83,
in addition to or instead of the measures mentioned in this section, according to the

circumstances of each particular case ”, therefore, the sanction would be
"Warning."

                                           IV
Regarding the non-consensual treatment of personal data, it has been verified that
there is a publication of a photograph of the interested party and their personal data, according to

claim, without the express consent of the interested party.

The known facts are constitutive of an infraction, attributable to the defendant, for
violation of art. 6.1 of the RGPD, when publishing personal data of the claimant without the
legitimation necessary for it.

For its part, article 72.1.b) of the LOPDGDD, considers very serious, for the purposes of
prescription, "Failure to comply with the requirements of article 6 of the RGPD".

This offense may be punished with a fine of a maximum of € 20,000,000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
of a higher amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

impose in the present case, the sanction to be imposed should be adjusted in accordance with
the following aggravating criteria established in article 83.2 of the RGPD:

    - The intentionality or negligence in the infringement. In the present case we are
        before intentional negligent action, (section b).

    - The way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement. The

        The way in which this AEPD has been made aware has been through the filing of
