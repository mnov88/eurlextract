Fee for automatic forwarding of e-mail

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has decided to impose an infringement fee of NOK 100,000 on a company for breach of the Labor Act's e-mail regulations on access to e-mail boxes and the Privacy Ordinance's requirements for a legal basis and a duty to provide information. The company is also required to improve its own routines.

The name of the company is exempt from publicity to protect the identity of the employees.

The Norwegian Data Protection Authority became involved in the case after receiving both a deviation report from an employer and a complaint from an employee in the company. The background for the case is that the complainant left the employer, and should assist the employer with certain work tasks after the notice period. Due to disagreements, employees' access to e-mail and computer systems was closed. All e-mails sent to the employee's e-mail box were automatically forwarded to an e-mail address managed by the general manager, and the forwarding took place for approximately six weeks.

The purpose of the forwarding was to take care of customer relationships, and during the period the general manager handled both work-related and private e-mails that were sent to the employee's e-mail box.

Several violations

We have concluded that the employer did not have a legal basis for the automatic forwarding under the Privacy Ordinance, and are in conflict with the rules in the regulations on the employer's access to e-mail boxes and other electronic material. The company has also acted in violation of the rules on information to the data subject and the duty to assess the employee's protest, in addition to having inadequate routines for access to e-mail and other electronic material.

On the basis of this, we have decided that the company must improve its written routines for access to e-mail, as well as an order to pay an infringement fee of NOK 100,000 for the illegal forwarding.

The company has a three-week appeal period from the time they receive the decision.
