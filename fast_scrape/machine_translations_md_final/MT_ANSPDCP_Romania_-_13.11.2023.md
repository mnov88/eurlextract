Fine for violation of art. 32 of the GDPR

The National Supervisory Authority completed, in October 2023, an investigation at the operator Rompetrol Downstream SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (4) in conjunction with art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and art. 32 para. (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was penalized with a fine of 546,073.00 lei (the equivalent of 110,000 EURO).

The investigation was started as a result of the transmission by the operator of several notifications of violations of the security of personal data, between 20.07.2021 and 3.02.2022, according to art. 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As part of the investigation, it turned out that the data of some customers from the computer program owned by the company was accessed from the internal level and used in an unauthorized manner, repeatedly, and the personal data of some customers were illegally disclosed for the purpose of obtaining loans from non-banking financial companies on their behalf.

Through the incident, the personal data of some concerned persons, data from the identity card (such as: name, first name, series and number of the identity card, personal numerical code, address, place of birth, photo) and data were disclosed without authorization from the salary certificate (such as: the employee's name and surname, date, signature, earned income, seniority).

The National Supervisory Authority found that Rompetrol Downstream SRL did not take measures to ensure that any natural person who acts under the authority of the operator and has access to personal data does not process them except at his request, nor did he implement technical and organizational measures adequate in order to ensure a level of security corresponding to the processing risk.
