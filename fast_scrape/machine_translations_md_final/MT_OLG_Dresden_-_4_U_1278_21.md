Interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject who
require the protection of personal data prevail. The concept of
legitimate interests is to be understood broadly. It includes both legal and
also economic and non-material interests (cf. Schantz in Simitis/Hornung/

Business enterprise preserved and the debtor subject to reimbursement so
