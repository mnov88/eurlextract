In any case, this is a security incident related to confidentiality
of the Claimant's data caused by a technical error (misconfiguration of the

button in the file of the Claimant client) and it is not about any processing of
data provided in the ID FINANCE Processing Activities Register.

That is, since it is erroneous data processing, there is no legal basis

                                  Previous issues

In the present case, the complaining party denounces the improper inclusion of its data
personal in assets solvency files, since the debt is not yet certain or
enforceable since it is questioned in an ongoing judicial process.

The complaining party affirms that the complained entity includes its personal data in

                                 Article 6.1 of the GDPR

The GDPR in its article 4.11 defines the consent of the interested party as “any
manifestation of free, specific, informed and unequivocal will by which the
interested party accepts, either by a declaration or a clear affirmative action, the
processing of personal data that concerns you.”

In relation to the legality of the processing of personal data, article 6.1
of the GDPR, establishes the following:

"1. Treatment will only be legal if at least one of the following is met
conditions:

is part of or for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures;

d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the interested party or another
Physical person;

e) the processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the controller;

by the person responsible for the treatment or by a third party, provided that regarding said

interests do not prevail over the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party requiring the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child.

The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph will not apply to the treatment
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.”

In relation to credit information systems, we must go to article 20.1
of the LOPDGDD, highlighting its section b), which establishes the following:

"1. Unless proven otherwise, the processing of personal data will be presumed lawful.
relating to the breach of monetary, financial or credit obligations by

common credit information systems when the following are met

rights established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 within
of thirty days following notification of the debt to the system, remaining

data blocked during that period.

the monetary, financial or credit obligation.

e) That the data referring to a specific debtor can only be

requested the execution of a contract that involves financing, deferred payment or
periodic billing, as happens, among other cases, in those provided for in the

legislation on consumer credit contracts and real estate credit contracts.

                                           IV
                 Classification of the violation of article 6.1 of the GDPR

The inclusion of the personal data of the complaining party in solvency files
patrimonial, despite the fact that the debt is not yet certain or enforceable because it is
questioned in an ongoing judicial process, represents a violation of article 6.1 of the
GDPR.

However, the claimed party states that it is not a credit institution so it cannot

claimed party in response to the initial agreement further states that it has already given
drops the claimant which implies that it has the technical and security measures
necessary organizational measures, the events that concern us being the result of a technical error
(the deconfiguration of the button in the file of the Claimant client), and that it is not

This is no improper data processing.

In this sense, it must be indicated first of all that article 76.2 b) LOPDGDD,
considers as an aggravating circumstance the connection of the offender's activity with the carrying out
of personal data processing, which does not bind only credit institutions,
but also to the entities that provide financial services to users since their

activity involves the processing of personal data, which is why said aggravating circumstance
turns out to be applicable.

In relation to the consideration that this is a technical error, it is not a
argument that allows the claimed party to be exonerated from liability, nor

grants legitimacy in the processing of personal data since this has been a
illicit data processing, since the personal data of the complaining party has
been improperly registered in the ASNEF solvency file, despite the fact that the debt
object of registration is not true since it is being appealed judicially.

For all these reasons, the reported facts represent a violation of article 6.1 of the
RGPD, since the inclusion of personal data in solvency files for a
debt pending judicial resolution, involves processing personal data without
that it is established that the claimed party has carried out the necessary consideration that
allows you to determine the prevalence of your legitimate interest over the interests, rights
and freedoms of the complaining party, as this treatment is not covered by the

presumption of legality contemplated in article 20 of the LOPDGDD since the debt
required object of inclusion in the solvency files is not yet true or enforceable to the
find themselves in an ongoing judicial process.

           Proposed sanction for violation of article 6.1 of the GDPR

Article 58.2 of the GDPR provides the following: “Each supervisory authority will have
of all the following corrective powers indicated below:

b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with a warning
when the processing operations have violated the provisions of this
Regulation;

d) order the person responsible or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable,
in a certain way and within a specified period;

i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with Article 83, in addition to or instead of the
measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each case
particular;

Likewise, article 72.1 b) of the LOPDGDD states that “depending on what

established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are considered very serious and
infringements that involve a substantial violation will prescribe after three years
of the articles mentioned in that one and in particular, the following:

b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions of

legality of the treatment in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

This violation may be punished with a fine of a maximum of €20,000,000 or,
In the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
of larger amounts, in accordance with article 83.5 of the RGPD.

Likewise, it is considered that it is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the
following criteria established by article 83.2 of the RGPD:

The following are aggravating factors:

     In the present case we are dealing with negligent action (article 83.2 b) since
    that the personal data of the complaining party is included in files of
    solvency, despite the debt being included in the procedure
    judicial in progress. Furthermore, it must be taken into account that the data was kept

    of the claimant despite having knowledge of the judicial procedure.

     The link with the processing of personal data, by the
    recamada entity, being an entity that provides financial services to its
    users, according to article 76.2 b) of the LOPDGDD.

It is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed on the accused and set it at the amount of €70,000
in accordance with article 58.2 of the GDPR.

                                          VII

                                 Adoption of measures

If the violation is confirmed, it could be agreed to impose on the person responsible the adoption of
appropriate measures to adjust its actions to the regulations mentioned in this
act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the RGPD, according to the

which each control authority may “order the person responsible or in charge of the
treatment that the processing operations comply with the provisions of the
this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain manner and within a
specified period…”
