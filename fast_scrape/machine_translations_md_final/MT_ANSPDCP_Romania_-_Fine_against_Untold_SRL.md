As such, the operator was penalized:

During the investigation, the National Supervisory Authority for the Processing of Personal Data found that the operator did not resolve the request for access to the personal data of the person concerned, even though he communicated his email address, telephone number, full name and surname and postal address. This situation led to the violation of the provisions of art. 15, in conjunction with art. 12 para. (3) and (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

At the same time, it was found that the operator did not resolve the request to delete the petitioner's personal data within the terms provided by Regulation (EU) 2016/679, which constituted a violation of the provisions of art. 17 para. (1) and art. 12 para. (3) and (4) of the same normative act.

At the same time, the following corrective measures were ordered against the operator:

to send a written response to the request of the person concerned in accordance with the provisions of art. 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;

to ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of personal data processing operations, by adopting the necessary technical and organizational measures, including the appropriate training of the personnel designated for this purpose, so that the operator is able to analyze, to resolve correctly and respond to all requests through which the persons concerned exercise their rights, within the terms and according to the conditions provided by art. 12-23 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
