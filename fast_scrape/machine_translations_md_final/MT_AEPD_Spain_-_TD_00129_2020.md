previously transcribed, the voice is considered personal data. Therefore, in principle,
the complaining party would have the right to have those recordings provided, at the
protection of data protection regulations. However, such recordings
may contain, in addition to their data, information related to third parties who
could not be communicated to you, since, otherwise, it could constitute an assignment of

right has not been addressed.
It must be remembered that this Agency only has jurisdiction over data
personal, without being able to assess the information concerning possible contracts
subscribed or incidents on them. This regardless of what other
regulations protect the obtaining of said information, such as, among others, the Real
Legislative Decree 1/2007, which approves the General Law for the Defense of
