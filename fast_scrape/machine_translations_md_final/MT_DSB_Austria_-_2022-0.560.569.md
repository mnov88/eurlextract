SAY

The data protection authority decides on Julius A\*\*\*'s data protection complaint of July 29, 2022 against himself for a violation of the right to secrecy as follows:

- The complaint is rejected.

Legal basis: Art. 51 (1), Art. 57 (1) lit. f and Art. 77 (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter: previous search term GDPR next search term), OJ No. L 119 of 4 May 2016 p. 1; Sections 1, 18 (1) and 24 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Act (DSG), Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended; Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU-GRC), OJ No. C 364 of 18.12.2000 p. 1.

REASON

A. Submissions of the parties and course of the proceedings

In his submission of July 29, 2022 to the data protection authority, the complainant essentially submitted that, in the course of a complaint to the data protection authority on January 22, 2022, he had entered the official e-mail address and the official telephone number of Mag. Ernst N\*\*\* disclosed to the data protection authority. The complaint (“self-disclosure”) is therefore being submitted in order to clarify whether a data protection violation with the form from the data protection authority is possible and whether such a violation exists.

B. Findings of Facts

The data protection authority uses the arguments under point A as a basis for its factual finding.

C. In legal terms it follows that:

The right of a data subject to lodge a complaint is enshrined at national and European level:

Both Art. 77 Para. 1 Previous search term GDPR Next search term and Section 24 Para.

In addition, the European Court of Justice has already stated that Art. 8 para. 1 and para. 3 EU-GRC also grants a data subject the right to submit a request to the national supervisory authorities to protect their fundamental rights (cf. the judgment of ECJ of October 6, 2015, Schrems I, margin no. 58 with further references).

One of the necessary prerequisites for asserting the right to a complaint is therefore that the complainant is himself affected by the processing (cf. Schweiger in Knyrim, DatKomm, Art. 77 Previous search term GDPR Next search term (as of December 1st, 2021, rdb.at) , margin no. 8).

It is therefore a right that a data subject is entitled to, but not, for example, a person responsible or a processor (cf. Schweiger in Knyrim, DatKomm, Art. 77 previous search term GDPR (as of December 1st, 2021, rdb.at), margin no. 19).

Objectively, it follows from the complainant's argument that he is not the person concerned himself, but rather the personal data of Mag. Erwin N\*\*\* - as the person actually affected here - possibly unlawfully disclosed and is now filing a complaint against himself.

Since the complainant is not personally affected, he is therefore not entitled to file the complaint in question and the complainant's request for a complaint is not accessible.

It was therefore to be decided accordingly.

Irrespective of this, the person actually affected is free to have the disclosure made in question reviewed by the data protection authority in the course of a complaints procedure.
