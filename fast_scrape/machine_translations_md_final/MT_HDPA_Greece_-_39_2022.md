Summary
The Authority, following complaints and related notifications, became aware of incidents of unauthorized access by malicious third parties to data of mobile phone subscribers. The access took place following requests to change the SIM card of subscribers and was due to problems with the process of identifying subscribers when such requests were made, either as a result of insufficient security measures or following a faulty implementation of existing measures. The Authority assessed the number of incidents, as well as the actions of the controller in order to deal with them, and imposed a fine of 150,000 euros for the above violations of the provisions of Article 12 of Law 3471/2006.
