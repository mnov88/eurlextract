The complainant's views

The complainant considers that the publication of the opinion of the Parliamentary Ombudsman on the website of the Association of Icelandic Municipalities has not been in accordance with Act no. 90/2018, on personal protection and processing of personal information. The opinion has been on the website for weeks. When he found out, he contacted an employee of the union and the opinion was then taken out of publication. In the complainant's opinion, the case is serious and harmful to his person, as it was a shock for him to discover that confidentiality was not respected.

The views of the responsible party

The respondent's reply states that there had been human error and security breach, as the information had been published unintentionally. The breach of security had not been reported to the Data Protection Authority, as the union had considered it unlikely that it would lead to a risk to the complainant's rights and freedoms. The association therefore considered it sufficient to register the safety defect in the deviation registration.

The reason for this assessment is that information that a party has applied for the job in question and was not received is available on the basis of the Information Act, but in the opinion in question it was stated that the complainant had applied for a specific job, he was not called for an interview. subsequently complained to the Parliamentary Ombudsman about the recruitment process. Information about a party's complaint to the Parliamentary Ombudsman and that he has not been summoned for an interview is not covered by the Information Act, but it must be considered that the information does not create a risk for the complainant. The Association of Icelandic Municipalities considered that the harmful effects of the personal information that was made public were insignificant. As soon as a complaint was received from the complainant that the opinion had been published without his personal information having been erased, the document had been removed from publication and instead referred to the opinion of the Parliamentary Ombudsman in question in a anonymous version on his website. It is also stated that work processes within the union have been reviewed to prevent mistakes of this kind from recurring.
