Sanction for violating the RGPD

The National Supervisory Authority completed in March 2022 an investigation at the operator Condor SA and found the violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1), (2) and (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

As such, the operator was sanctioned with a fine of 9,897.4 lei (equivalent to 2,000 EURO).

The investigation was initiated as a result of a complaint alleging that the operator Condor SA disclosed personal data of a salary nature of the employees or former employees of this operator to unauthorized persons.

In the investigation, it was found that there was unauthorized access to some unspoken documents containing a number of personal data of employees or former employees, such as: place of work, name, surname, position, salary, amount for advance, bank account, personal numeric codes.

Consequently, the National Supervisory Authority found that the operator Condor SA did not present evidence showing that it had adopted sufficient appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the confidentiality of the processed personal data of employees or its former employees. At the same time, it was noted that the operator did not present any evidence showing the training of data controllers under his authority, which led to unauthorized access to documents. Thus, the provisions of art. 32 para. (1), (2), (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

At the same time, during the investigation, two corrective measures were applied to the operator, as follows:

the corrective action to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation of personal data processing operations, by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures, including the training of data controllers under its authority; corrective action to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation of personal data processing operations by contacting the person who had unauthorized access to that personal data, with a view to deleting or destroying it, as appropriate.
