Right to injunctive relief for illegal data processing
Guiding principle
1.
The party affected by an illegal data processing (outside the journalistic/editorial field) can assert claims for data protection by way of injunction
claim. Such claims are not blocked by Art. 79 GDPR.
2.
The lack of congruence between the warning notice and the application in the preliminary injunction proceedings does not lead to the rejection of the application, but only to an obligation on the court to hear the application.
