A new penalty for breaching GDPR

In May of this year, the National Supervisory Authority completed an investigation at the operator Farmacia Ardealul SRL in which it found a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and d) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

As such, the company Farmacia Ardealul SRL was fined 12,424 lei, the equivalent of 2,500 EURO.

The investigation was started as a result of the transmission by the operator of a notification of breach of the security of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation.

During the investigation, it was found that the data processing security breach occurred through the unauthorized installation of a malware program on the operator's website.

This situation led to the violation of the confidentiality of personal data (bank data) of a significant number of customers as a result of the unauthorized installation of a fictitious form for collecting bank data on the operator's website.

Thus, the operator Farmacia Ardealul SRL was fined for violating the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and d) and para. (2) of the General Regulation on Data Protection, as it did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure a level of security corresponding to the risk presented by the processing.

At the same time, the operator was also given the corrective measure to implement a plan that would include a mechanism for testing, scanning, evaluating and periodically assessing the security of all IT systems of the operator, including its website.
