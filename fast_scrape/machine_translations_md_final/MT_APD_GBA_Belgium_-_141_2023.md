15. Pursuant to article 33, §1 of the LCA, the Litigation Chamber is the organ of the
administrative litigation of the APD. It receives complaints that the SPL sends to it in

17. In matters of dismissal, the Litigation Chamber is required to provide reasons for its decision.
step-by-step decision1 and:
- pronounce a classification without technical follow-up if the file does not contain or not
sufficient evidence likely to lead to a sanction or if it includes a
technical obstacle preventing it from rendering a decision;
- or pronounce a classification without further opportunity, if despite the presence

precisely on two reasons why it considers it inappropriate to
continue monitoring the file, and therefore decides not to proceed, among other things, to

Decision 141/2023 - 5/7
20. The Litigation Chamber notes that the complainant denounces the unlawful processing of her
personal data.
21. Firstly, the Litigation Chamber notes that the complaint is not sufficiently
supported by evidence of the existence of a violation of the GDPR or protective laws
personal data (criteria A. 1 of said policy). Consequently, the Chamber
Litigation decides to dismiss the complaint for technical reasons.
22. Despite the allegations that the plaintiff makes against the defendant concerning
the alleged disclosure of his personal data to other party members
political, the Litigation Chamber notes that no evidence to this effect appears in the
case. The complainant, in fact, claims to have received testimonies from people
who may have obtained illicit access to their personal data, but does not provide any
nevertheless no trace.
23. In addition, the complainant relies on the existence of a precedent under which the
communications manager of the defendant was sanctioned by a former
employer. However, this sanction cannot lead the Litigation Chamber to
determination of the existence of a violation of the GDPR or data protection laws
personal for the facts in this case.
24. Furthermore, the complainant states that the president of the Braine-l’Alleud local section of
political party would have confirmed the position of the communications manager of the
defendant, presumed author of the offense, and as such refers us to an exchange
informal non-time-stamped between her and him. However, nothing of the sort appears when reading this
part of the file.
25. Finally, the complainant expresses her dissatisfaction with the answers given by the DPO of the
defendant, however, it turns out that he always responded within the time limit given to him
imposed by Articles 12.3 and 12.4 of the GDPR (see points 5, 8 and 9).
26. Secondly, and without prejudice to the above, the Litigation Chamber proceeds to
classification without further action for reasons of expediency (criteria B. 2 and B. 5 of said policy)4
.
27. On the one hand, the Litigation Chamber notes that the grievance raised by the complainant does not
does not meet the criteria of high general or personal impact, as defined by the ODA
in its note on the no action classification policy of June 18, 2021.
28. On the other hand, if the criteria of high general or personal impact do not apply, the
Litigation Chamber weighs the personal impact of the circumstances of the complaint

violation has occurred, but the resources required to substantiate the complaint are potentially excessive. ; Protection Authority

for the rights and fundamental freedoms of the complainant, and the efficiency of her intervention,
to decide whether it considers it appropriate to deal with the complaint in depth.
In this case, the Litigation Chamber notes that there is a legal proceeding in progress
which includes the grievances made in the complaint filed by the complainant with the police on
October 7, 2022. However, the Litigation Chamber recalls that it assesses the efficiency
of its intervention as well as the means necessary to handle the complaint in a manner
in-depth. In this context, given the absence of substantial evidence (see points
21 to 25) and the significant resources that this would imply, the Litigation Chamber
concludes that it would not be appropriate to launch an investigation through the Inspection Service
to corroborate the complainant's allegations, nor to make decisions parallel to a
ongoing legal proceedings. Consequently, the Litigation Chamber decides not to
carry out an examination of the merits of the case.
29. In conclusion, the Litigation Chamber decides to proceed with the classification without further action.
the complainant's complaint, both for technical reasons and for reasons of expediency.
30. For information purposes, and without this constituting any corrective measure
or sanction within the meaning of article 95, §1 of the LCA, the Litigation Chamber recalls
nevertheless, any data controller must be able to demonstrate the
compliance of its processing with the GDPR, and throughout, by virtue of
Article 5.2 of the GDPR.
III. Publication and communication of the decision
31. Given the importance of transparency regarding the process
decision-making and the decisions of the Litigation Chamber, this decision will be published on the
website of the Data Protection Authority. However, it is not necessary for this
so that the identification data of the parties are directly communicated.
32. In accordance with its policy of dismissal, the Litigation Chamber
will communicate the decision to the defendant(s)
5
. Indeed, the Litigation Chamber decided
to communicate the decisions of dismissal to the defendants by default. There
Chambre Litigation, however, refrains from such communication when the complainant
requested anonymity with regard to the defendant(s) and when the communication of the
decision to the defendant(s), even pseudonymised, nevertheless risks allowing their reidentification6
. This is not the case in the present case.

to be taken into account by the Data Protection Authority in order to set its future priorities
and/or could inspire future initiative investigations by the Inspection Service of the Authority of
Data protection.
