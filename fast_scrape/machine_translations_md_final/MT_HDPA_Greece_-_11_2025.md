Summary
The Authority examined a complaint against a private doctor specializing in gynecology, who was monitoring the pregnancy of the complainant, in which the latter complained about: a) non-full satisfaction of the right of access to her medical file, b) unlawful access to the complainant's personal electronic health file through the website https://ehealth.gov.gr, as well as c) unlawful transmission to third parties of personal health data concerning her.

The Authority found that the accused doctor, as the controller at the time the right of access was exercised, a) did not have at her disposal all the requested personal data of the complainant's medical file, except for the medical documents she handed over to her husband after the relevant request, as well as the data she used to enter the electronic health system (name, surname, social security number, etc.), rejecting the complainant's relevant claim, given that a crucial element for satisfying the right of access is the existence of the personal data at the time of exercising the right, b) the accused proceeded to unlawful processing of the complainant's data (social security number, full name, etc.), which she kept in her file, by registering them in the electronic health system and searching for information on the complainant's health status, thereby obtaining unfair, unethical and illegal access to the complainant's medical information, without the latter's knowledge and without being legitimized for this purpose, in violation of the principles of legality and objectivity of article 5 par. 1 a GDPR, and c) finally, there is no proof of the transfer of the complainant's health data to third parties.
