       against the defendant.

       In the complaint, the complainant states that he receives unsolicited letters on a very regular basis

       of the defendant. On July 27, 2023, the complainant wrote to the chairman

       from the defendant asking him to delete his data in order to make these communications

       defendant on dates of August 11, 2023, September 4, 2023, October 18, 2023, 9

       November 2023, December 4, 2023 and December 12, 2023. The complainant asks the GBA between

       to force the defendant to erase his data.

       on the basis of articles 58 and 60 of the WOG and the complaint is filed on the basis of article 62, § 1

II. Justification

 5. Article 17.1 GDPR provides that the data subject of the controller without

       can obtain the deletion of personal data relating to him without unreasonable delay. The

       controller is obliged to process personal data without unreasonable

       delay to erase when the personal data is no longer necessary for the
       purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.

 6. In accordance with Article 12.3 GDPR, the controller shall provide the

       person concerned without delay and in any case within one month of receipt of the request

       pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 GDPR information about the outcome of the request

1In accordance with Article 61 of the WOG, the Disputes Chamber hereby informs the parties that the complaint is admissible
declared.
2In accordance with Article 95, § 2 of the WOG, the Disputes Chamber hereby informs the parties that the file will be sent to
has been transferred to her as a result of this complaint. Decision 40/2024 — 3/6

        is given. Depending on the complexity of the requests and the number of requests

        that period may be extended by a further two months if necessary. The

        the controller shall inform the data subject within one month of receipt of the

        request of such extension.

 7. The Disputes Chamber determines that the complainant is on the basis of the documents supporting the complaint

        exercised the right to erasure of data on July 27, 2023. The Disputes Chamber can

        However, it cannot be determined on the basis of the complaint that the complainant has received an answer. The inde

        documents attached communication from the defendant on the date of August 11, 2023, 4

        September 2023, October 18, 2023, November 9, 2023, December 4, 2023 and December 12

        2023, however, the Disputes Chamber suspects that there has been an infringement against it

        Articles 12.3 and 12.4 GDPR, as well as Article 17.1 GDPR. 4

        has committed an infringement of the provisions of the GDPR, which justifies this in this case

        a decision will be taken on the basis of Article 95, § 1, 5° of the

        WOG, in particular to order the defendant to comply with the exercise by

        the complainant of his right to erasure (Article 17.1 GDPR) and this in particular in view

        on the documents that the complainant has provided showing that the complainant is the defendant

        has requested that his data be deleted.
