The Danish Data Protection Agency assesses that Danske Bank has not been able to document that they have deleted personal data in accordance with the data protection rules, and the Authority has therefore set the bank a fine of DKK 10 million. kr.

The Danish Data Protection Agency has reported Danske Bank to the police and fined the bank DKK 10 million. This follows on from the fact that in November 2020 the Authority initiated a case of its own motion, after the bank itself had stated that they had identified a problem with the deletion of personal data, which there was not necessarily a commercial justification for continuing to process. .

In connection with the Danish Data Protection Agency's investigation, it has emerged that the bank in more than 400 systems has not been able to document that rules have been laid down for deletion and storage of personal data, or that manual deletion of personal data has been carried out. These systems process personal data of millions of people.

"One of the basic principles of the GDPR is that you can only process information you need - and when you no longer need it, it must be deleted. When it comes to an organization the size of Danske Bank, which has many and complex systems, it is particularly crucial that you can also document that the deletion actually takes place, ‚Äùsays Kenni Elm Olsen, specialist consultant at the Danish Data Protection Agency.

Why police report?

The Danish Data Protection Agency always makes a concrete assessment of the seriousness of the case pursuant to Article 83 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation. 2, in assessing which sanction is, in the opinion of the Authority, the correct one.

In assessing that a fine should be imposed, the Danish Data Protection Agency has emphasized that the breach in question relates to a basic principle for the processing of personal data and affects a very large number of data subjects.

In its recommendation on the size of the fine, the Danish Data Protection Agency has, among other things, emphasized the nature and seriousness of the infringement and the regulation's requirement that a fine in each individual case must be effective, proportionate to the infringement and have a deterrent effect.

Furthermore, it has been concluded that Danske Bank has continuously worked to be able to document that the bank lives up to its obligations, ie. have tried to limit the damage that the data subjects potentially suffer. At the same time, the Danish Data Protection Agency has emphasized Danske Bank's active participation in the information of the case.
