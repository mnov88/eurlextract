The defendant: Y, hereinafter: “the defendant”. . Decision 19/2023 – 2/6

I. Facts and procedure

 1. On November 2, 2022, the complainant filed a complaint with the Data Protection Authority

       data (hereinafter “the DPA”), against the defendant.

 2. On December 5, 2022, the complaint was declared admissible by the Front Line Service on

       the basis of Articles 58 and 60 of the LCA and the complaint is forwarded to the Litigation Chamber

       pursuant to Article 62, § 1 of the LCA.

 3. Pursuant to article 95 § 2, 3° of the LCA as well as article 47 of the rules of order

       inside the DPA, a copy of the file may be requested by the parties. If one of

       parties wishes to make use of the possibility of consulting the file, the latter is required to

       contact the secretariat of the Litigation Chamber, preferably via the address

       litigationchamber@apd-gba.be.

II. Motivation

    4. The complaint concerning the lack of response from the defendant following the request for exercise
        of his right of access and copy by the complainant. This one sent a first email

        requesting the exercise of his right of access and copy (article 15 GDPR) on September 7

        2022. He then sent a reminder on October 10, 2022. He denounces having received no return to

        any of his emails. Following a letter from the APD of January 19, 2023 recommending to the

        complainant to contact the address \[…\] (contact email address listed on the website of the

        respondent) instead of \[…\], the complainant repeated his request for access and copying on the day

        same (to the email addresses \[…\] and \[…\]). On February 26, 2023, more than a month later, the

        complainant indicates that he received no response.

    5. The Litigation Chamber recalls that in its capacity as data controller, the

        defendant is bound by data protection principles and must be

        able to demonstrate that these are respected (principle of responsibility – article

        5.2. GDPR). It must also implement all the measures necessary for this.

        effect (Article 24 GDPR).

    6. Pursuant to Article 15 § 1 of the GDPR, the data subject has the right to obtain

        controller confirmation that personal data the

        concerning are or are not processed. When this is the case, the person concerned has the

        right to obtain access to said personal data as well as a series

        information listed in Article 15 § 1 a) - h) such as the purpose of the processing of its

 Pursuant to article 61 LCA, the Litigation Chamber informs the parties by this decision, of the fact that the complaint has been
declared admissible.
2 Pursuant to Article 95, § 2 LCA, by this decision, the Litigation Division informs the parties of the fact that following
of this complaint, the file was forwarded to him. Decision 19/2023 – 3/6

        data, the possible recipients of his data as well as information relating to

        the existence of his rights, including the right to request the rectification or erasure of his

        data or that of filing a complaint with the protection control authority

        data (APD).

    7. Pursuant to § 3 of Article 15 of the GDPR, the data subject also has the right

        to obtain a copy of the personal data which is the subject of the processing. THE §
        4 of Article 15 of the GDPR provides that this right to copy may not infringe the rights and

        freedoms of others.

    8. Article 12 of the GDPR relating to the procedures for exercising their rights by persons

        concerned provides in particular that the data controller must facilitate

        the exercise of their rights by the data subject (Article 12 § 2 of the GDPR) and provide them with

        information on the measures taken following his request as soon as possible and

        no later than within one month of his request (article 12§3 of the GDPR).
        the data controller does not intend to follow up on the request, he must notify

        its refusal within one month accompanied by the information that an appeal

        against this refusal can be lodged with the data protection supervisory authority.

        data (12 § 4 GDPR).

    9. As indicated above, the complainant sent two emails requesting the exercise of his

        access and copy to the email address \[…\], and repeated his request to the email address \[…\]. He

        explained that he had received no feedback from the defendant.

 10. The Litigation Chamber considers that on the basis of the aforementioned facts, there is reason to

       conclude that the defendant may have violated Articles 15 and 12 of the GDPR,

       which justifies that in this case, a decision is made in accordance with

       Article 95, § 1, 5° of the LCA, more specifically to order compliance with the request

       the complainant to follow up on his request for access and copy on the basis of article 15 GDPR,

       in the terms of article 12 GDPR.

 11. This decision is a prima facie decision taken by the Litigation Chamber

       pursuant to Article 95 of the LCA on the basis of the complaint submitted by the complainant,
                                                                          3
       within the framework of the “procedure prior to the substantive decision” and not a decision on the

       merits of the Litigation Chamber within the meaning of Article 100 of the LCA.

 12. The purpose of this decision is to inform the defendant, allegedly responsible for the

       processing, because it may have violated the provisions of the GDPR,

       in order to enable it to still comply with the aforementioned provisions.

3Section 3, Subsection 2 of the ACL (articles 94 to 97 inclusive). Decision 19/2023 – 4/6

 13. If, however, the defendant does not agree with the content of this decision

        prima facie and believes that it can make factual and/or legal arguments that

        could lead to another decision, it may send the Litigation Chamber a

        request for treatment on the merits of the case via the e-mail address litigationchamber@apd-

        gba.be, within 30 days of notification of this decision. The case

        applicable, the execution of this decision is suspended for the period

        aforementioned.

 14. In the event of further processing of the case on the merits, pursuant to Articles 98, 2° and 3°

        juncto article 99 of the LCA, the Litigation Chamber will invite the parties to introduce their

        conclusions and attach to the file all the documents they deem useful. If applicable, the

        this decision is permanently suspended.

 15. With a view to transparency, the Litigation Division finally emphasizes that a

        dealing with the case on the merits may lead to the imposition of the measures mentioned in

        section 100 of the ACL.

III. Publication of the decision

        Litigation, this decision is published on the website of the Protection Authority

        of the parties are communicated directly.
