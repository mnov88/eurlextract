Summary
The Authority examined a complaint against a company for breaching the confidentiality of the complainant's data, by communicating the complainant's test results to her father by telephone. In particular, the complainant stated that she herself did not give her father's mobile phone number to the complained company. From the examination of the case, the reported violation was not established. Regarding the process of collecting the contact details of the customers of the diagnostic center based on their verbal statement on the day of the visit, the Authority was informed that, in the context of updating the procedures of the complained company, from now on the collection will be done with their signed registration by the data subjects using a tablet. The complaint is therefore dismissed as unfounded.
