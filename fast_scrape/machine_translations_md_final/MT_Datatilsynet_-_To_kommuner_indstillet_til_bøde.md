The Data Inspectorate reports Gladsaxe Municipality and Hørsholm Municipality to the police as the Authority assesses that the municipalities have not complied with the requirements for an appropriate level of security in the Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
Gladsaxe Municipality and Hørsholm Municipality have been fined respectively. DKK 100,000 and DKK 50,000 
The Data Inspectorate became aware of the cases when both municipalities reported breaches of the personal data security in connection with the theft of one of the municipalities' computers, which contained personal data. 
Neither Gladsaxe Municipality nor Hørsholm Municipality's computers were protected by encryption, and the municipalities' loss of personal data therefore posed an unnecessarily high risk to citizens. 
In one of the cases, the inadequate security caused a serious breach of the personal data security when a computer containing personal data on 20,620 citizens, including information of sensitive nature and personal identification numbers, was stolen from Gladsaxe City Hall. 
The second security breach occurred when an employee from Hørsholm Municipality had his worker computer stolen from his car. The computer contained personal information about approximately 1,600 employees at Hørsholm Municipality , including information of a sensitive nature and information about social security numbers. 
The actual breaches of security are some of the possible consequences of the insufficient security. The insufficient security poses a high risk to all the citizens about whom the municipality processes information. 
Municipalities have a great responsibility 
“A municipality processes very large amounts of personal data about the municipality's citizens, including information of a sensitive nature. As a citizen you are not able to opt out of the municipality's processing of information about one, and therefore the municipality has a great responsibility to prevent the information from coming to unknowable persons, "says Frederik Viksøe Siegumfeldt, head of the supervisory unit of the Data Inspectorate, and elaborates: 
"It's easy to access the files stored on your computer when one computer's hard drive is not encrypted, for example by moving the hard drive to another computer. Therefore, when personal data is stored locally on the computer, it is extremely careless that the municipalities had not protected the computers with encryption. " 
Fine setting 
The Data Inspectorate has decided to report Gladsaxe Municipality and Hørsholm Municipality to the police and recommends that the two municipalities be fined respectively. DKK 100,000 and DKK 50,000 
In its fine size recommendation, the Data Inspectorate has emphasized, among other things, the nature of the infringement (lack of security of processing) and that failure to encrypt the municipality's computers is a general measure. In addition, emphasis has been placed on the size of municipalities in terms of population and total operating allowance. 
In most European countries, national data supervision may itself impose administrative fines, but the rules are different in, among other things. Denmark. 
Here it works in such a way that the Data Inspectorate, after elucidating and assessing the case, reports to the police officer the data controller. The police then investigate whether there is a basis for a charge, etc., and finally a possible fine will be decided by a court.
