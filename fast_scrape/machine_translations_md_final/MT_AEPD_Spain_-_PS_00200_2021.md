                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                            I

       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

                                            II

         Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

         "1. The treatment will only be lawful if it complies with at least one of the following
terms:

       a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data

personal for one or more specific purposes;

       b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the

pre-contractual;

(…) "

      The infringement for which the claimed entity is responsible is found
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading "General conditions for
the imposition of administrative fines ”, it states:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

      Organic Law 3/2018, on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of

Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious ”provides:

      "1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that one and, in

in particular, the following:

       (…)
b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                             III

      The documentation in the file provides evidence that the claimed
violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, due to lack of legitimacy in the treatment of the data of the

claimant's phone number, associated with an image of another person and unrelated appointments
consented, without having proven that they have the legal authorization to do so.

        Article 6.1 RGPD says that the treatment will be lawful if “a) the interested party gave
your consent to the processing of your personal data for one or more purposes
specific ”.

        It is clear that the respondent published an announcement on a contact web portal,
sexually, containing the claimant's phone number, associated with an image
and to some non-consensual appointments, treatment of the claimant's data that I carry out without
standing for it.

        Thus, it is estimated that the facts that are submitted to the assessment of this
Agency are constitutive of an infringement of art. 6.1.
