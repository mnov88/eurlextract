Also, the applicant states that the published data are accurate and that the article can be found at the following link:… The request is unfounded. As of 25 May 2018, in all Member States of the European Union, including the Republic of Croatia in the field of personal data protection, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals is directly and bindingly applicable concerning the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data and the repeal of Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation) OJ EU 119.

Following the above, in the specific case for the processing of personal data by the media, the Media Act (Official Gazette 59/04, 84/15, 81/13) is applied as a special law, which, among other things, regulates the preconditions for exercising the principles of freedom of the media, the right of journalists and other participants in public information to freedom of reporting and access to public information, the rights and obligations of publishers, the exercise of the right to correction and response, etc. freedom of expression and

There is no violation of the right to privacy protection if, in terms of information, a justified public interest prevails over the protection of privacy in relation to the activity of journalists or information (Article 8 of the Media Act). Furthermore, Article 16 of the Law on the Right to Access Information (Official Gazette 25/13, 85/15) states that the public authority responsible for handling a request for access to information is obliged to conduct a proportionality test before making a decision. and public interest, while information on the disposal of public funds is available to the public without conducting a test

In this particular case, it is about data related to the spending of public funds, which should be available for the transparent work of public authorities, having in mind the provision of Article 16, paragraph 3 of the Act
on the right of access to information. In this case, it is a question of spending the funds of public authorities, which represents the disposal of public or budgetary funds. For the stated information, the law implies the public interest, ie the right of all natural and
legal entities to know how and for what purpose public funds are used. Following the above, in the entire procedure, it was established that there was a legal basis for the publication of personal data under Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation and that the publication of this range of personal data did not violate the rights of the applicant. Therefore, it was determined that the mentioned processing was not excessive, especially taking into account the scope of the published data and the fact that in this particular case it is also a matter of spending public funds.
