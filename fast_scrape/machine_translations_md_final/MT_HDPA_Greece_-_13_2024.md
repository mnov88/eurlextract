The Authority found deficient cooperation on the part of the Ministry of Immigration and Asylum as the Controller and further considered that the required Data Protection Impact Assessments carried out by the Ministry were materially incomplete and limited in scope, and that serious omissions remain regarding with the Ministry's compliance with specific provisions of the GDPR regarding the implementation of the disputed systems. For these reasons, it imposed an administrative monetary fine on the Ministry of Immigration and Asylum for the violations found in relation to the cooperation with the Authority and the Impact Assessments and at the same time sent the Ministry a compliance order within three months regarding its GDPR obligations.
