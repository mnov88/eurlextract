The complainant's views
The complaint states that information on \[the complainant's health and sick leave\] had been recorded in at least two minutes of the board \[institution X\], but the complainant \[held a confidential position with the institution\]. The minutes have also been distributed to the municipalities that are members of the institution, including \[municipality Y\].

The complainant considers that the board of \[Agency X\] should have recorded health information \[…\] as confidential and that the information should not have been made available to anyone other than the board of the agency and its director.

Perspectives \[Agency X\]
In the aforementioned letter \[from institution X\] to the Data Protection Authority, dated 22 October 2019, states that following the writing of certain minutes of the institution's board, it was sent to member municipalities for information, but it can be deduced from the letter that the minutes contained personal information about the complainant's sick leave.

Now, however, such information is kept in a confidential book, in addition to which further measures have been taken to ensure information security.

Due to a mistake by the board \[agency X\], the complainant's sensitive personal information was recorded in the agency's minutes, but the information was then published on the municipality's website as the employees did not realize that the minutes in question contained sensitive personal information.

The letter also states that \[municipality Y\] first included a letter from the Data Protection Authority, dated 30 September 2019, received information that more minutes with the complainant's sensitive personal information had been published on the municipality's website and that they had already been removed from publication.
