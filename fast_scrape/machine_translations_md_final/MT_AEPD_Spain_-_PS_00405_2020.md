Common Administrative Law of Public Administrations (LPACAP), by not carrying out the
claimed allegations within the indicated period.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                             I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director
of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and to
solve this procedure.

                                             II

Article 6.1 of the RGPD, establishes the assumptions that allow to consider lawful the
processing of personal data, specifically in section 1.a) it is indicated that

the processing of personal data will be considered lawful if he gave his consent.

In this sense, and in application to the present case, which deals with the right to
protection of the image of minors, note that article 8 of the RGPD regulates the
conditions applicable to the consent of the child in relation to the services of the
information society, indicating that:

"1- When article 6, paragraph 1, letter a) is applied in relation to the offer
direct information society services to children, the treatment of
Personal data of a child will be considered lawful when they are at least 16 years old.
If the child is under 16 years of age, such treatment will only be considered lawful if the

consent was given or authorized by the holder of parental authority or guardianship over the child, and
only to the extent that it was given or authorized.

Member States may establish by law a lower age for such purposes,
provided that this is not less than 13 years.

2. The person in charge of the treatment will make reasonable efforts to verify in such
cases where consent was given or authorized by the holder of parental authority or
guardianship of the child, taking into account available technology.

Member States, such as rules regarding the validity, formation or effects of
contracts in relation to a child. "

Therefore, for the processing of the personal data of minors to be lawful
object of this case, the consent of the person with parental authority will be required
or guardianship.
                                            III

In the present case, the claim focuses on the unauthorized use of the image of the
minor child of the claimant, without the legal standing required for this purpose.

Point out that the exceptions of article 2 of the RGPD would not apply, among the
that the domestic use of personal data is contemplated since the image object

of this claim has been sent to more than 400 people, all of them
members of the denounced association.

In accordance with the facts denounced, we are faced with an infraction,
attributable to the complained party, for the processing of personal data, regulated in art. 6.1
a) of the RGPD, in relation to article 8.1 of the RGPD when dealing with the image of a minor,

without the consent of the person who has parental authority.
