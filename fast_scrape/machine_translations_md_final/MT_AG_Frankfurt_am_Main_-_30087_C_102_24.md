Tenor

The action is dismissed.

The plaintiff shall bear the costs of the legal action.

The judgment is provisionally enforceable. The plaintiff may avert enforcement by providing security in the amount of 120 percent of the amount enforceable under the judgment, unless the defendant provides security in the amount of 120 percent of the respective amount to be enforced prior to enforcement.

Facts

The plaintiff holds a degree in computer science and is an external data protection officer and is interested in the accuracy and lawfulness of the processing of his personal data. The plaintiff, who has a press card, works as a freelance journalist and reports on IT security topics in various specialist media, including on his own website.

The plaintiff booked an online ticket for a train journey on the defendant's trains for October 16, 2022, under order number ... on September 21, 2022. During the journey, there were "train disruptions." The plaintiff was routinely checked during the journey. According to an email dated October 19, 2022, the plaintiff requested information from the defendant about all personal data stored concerning him. Reference is made to the email, page 13 of the file. The defendant provided the plaintiff with information in accordance with Exhibit K 4, the email dated October 20, 2022, and the email dated November 29, 2022. Reference is made to the emails, pages 14 to 21 of the file, and pages 24 to 26 of the file.

The defendant generates control data records during ticket inspection on the train when the train attendant scans the ticket. The scanning process results in the ticket data being compared with a server, a so-called "background system" of the defendant. The ticket data, the so-called control data, consists of the order number, time of inspection, train number, and ticket counter number. Using this data, plausibility checks are performed in the background system to detect, for example, multiple use or the use of a ticket canceled before the start of the journey. Corresponding anomaly analyses are run in the background system. The name of the person being checked is not recorded in the control data record. Only the order number is stored there. No anomalies of this kind were found during the plaintiff's ticket checks.

The booking records and the control data records are separated in the defendant's databases for data protection reasons. Only in cases where discrepancies are apparent, such as the use of a previously canceled ticket, is a check performed, during which the affected data record is directly and automatically assigned to a person in the specific case using the order number.

The plaintiff believes that the defendant's information is incomplete, particularly due to the lack of information regarding the validation of his tickets. The plaintiff believes that Sections 259 and 260 of the German Civil Code (BGB) are applicable.

The plaintiff requests that

1. the defendant be ordered to send him a copy of all his personal data, insofar as this data contains information about how, when, and on which trains the plaintiff used his train ticket with order number ..., as well as all other tickets according to Appendix K4, pp. 6 to 8 (please make the appendix the subject of the judgment), according to the defendant's train controls, and whether, when, and how the respective ticket was validated.

2. the defendant be ordered to certify under oath the completeness and accuracy of the data information provided to the plaintiff.

The defendant requests that

the action be dismissed.

The plaintiff has requested a stay of proceedings and a referral to the ECJ regarding the applicability of Sections 259 and 260 of the German Civil Code (BGB).

For further details of the facts and issues in dispute, reference is made to the parties' written submissions and attachments.

Grounds for the Decision

The admissible action is unfounded.

The plaintiff has no claim against the defendant for information pursuant to claim 1, in particular not pursuant to Art. 15 (1) and (2) GDPR, Section 2 of the International Travel Act (IFG), and Art. 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The control data in dispute here are not covered by the right to information pursuant to Art. 15 (1) and (3) GDPR in this specific case.

The control data records only need to be included in the information pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR if, in the individual case, the control data record was compared with the booking data record due to certain anomalies during the ticket inspection. Only in these cases are the data assigned to a specific person. If no anomalies were found, the respective control data record is not assigned to a specific person.

The name of the person checked is not visible in the control data record. The control data consists of the order number, time of the inspection, train number, and ticket counter number. The order number stored in the control data record represents a date that can be used to assign the data to a specific person. However, this assignment is only possible if there is a reference to the booking data records, which also contain the names. In the plaintiff's case, there were no anomalies during the ticket inspection that would trigger this assignment, so the control data records were not assigned to the booking data records.

It can remain open for the resolution of the legal dispute whether the defendant would be able to subsequently combine the control data records and the booking data records without undue difficulty. The right to information under Article 15 of the GDPR does not result in an obligation for the defendant to combine the separately stored control data records with the booking data records and thus expand the plaintiff's right to information. The separate storage of the control and booking data records serves precisely the purpose of data protection.

The plaintiff's claim against the defendant for the requested information does not arise from Section 2 of the International Travel and Tourism Act (IFG), since this provision is not a basis for a claim. Nothing different follows from Article 10 of the ECHR. There is simply no administrative intervention within the meaning of the provision.

Because the plaintiff has no claim against the defendant for the requested information, the plaintiff also has no claim against the defendant to make an affirmation in lieu of an oath in this regard, as claimed in claim 2.

For this reason alone, there was no need to request a preliminary ruling from the ECJ and thus no need to stay the proceedings pursuant to Article 267 TFEU, since the question of the applicability of Sections 259 and 260 of the German Civil Code (BGB) is irrelevant to the resolution of the dispute, as is clear from the above explanations.

The decision on costs is based on Section 91 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO).

The decisions on provisional enforceability and the power to avoid enforcement are based on Sections 708 No. 11 and 711 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO).
