In support of her application, the applicant submitted proof of entry in the "Do not call" register, as well as proof of a call to the telephone number. 
The request is founded. Acting upon the received request, the Agency carried out supervisory actions and it was determined that the phone number in question is not publicly published in the telephone directory. Furthermore, the supervisory activities established that the number… from which the telephone calls were made was owned by the company x and the statement of the company in question on the processing of the applicant's personal data was requested. 
The mentioned company commented on the letter stating that on January 2, 2020, an employee of the company called the telephone number in order to interview the person he called on the number li whether he wants to participate in the survey, after which the respondent said he did not want to participate in the survey and the conversation was not resumed nor was the person called again.

In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC: General Data Protection Regulation personal data must be processed legally, fairly and transparently with regard to the respondent (principle of legality, fairness and transparency); collected for special, explicit and legitimate purposes and may not be further processed in a way that is not in accordance with those purposes (purpose limitation principle); appropriate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed (data reduction principle); accurate and, where appropriate, up-to-date (principle of accuracy); kept in a form that allows the identification of respondents only for as long as necessary for the purposes for which personal data are processed (storage restriction principle); processed in a way that ensures adequate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage through the application of appropriate technical or organizational measures (principle of integrity and confidentiality).
The said General Data Protection Regulation, in Article 4 (1) (1), provides that personal data are all data relating to an identified or identifiable individual, and an identifiable individual is an identifiable person. directly or indirectly, in particular by means of identifiers such as name, identification number, location data, network identifier or by one or more factors specific to that individual's physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.

Article 17 (1) of the General Regulation stipulates that the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller the deletion of personal data relating to him without undue delay and that the controller has the obligation to delete personal data without undue delay if one of the following conditions is met: a) personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; (b) the respondent withdraws the consent on which the processing is based in accordance with Article 6 (1) (a) or Article 9 (2) (a) and if there is no other legal basis for the processing; (c) the respondent objects to the processing in accordance with Article 21 (1) and there are no compelling legitimate reasons for the processing, or the respondent objects to the processing in accordance with Article 21 (2); (d) personal data have been unlawfully processed; (e) personal data must be deleted in order to comply with a legal obligation under Union law or the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject; (f) personal data have been collected in connection with the provision of information society services referred to in Article 8 (1).
Article 14 stipulates that if personal data relating to the data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall provide the data subject with all of the following information at the time of collection: (a) the identity and contact details of the controller and, if applicable, (b) the contact details of the Data Protection Officer, if applicable if applicable, the intention of the controller to transfer personal data to the recipient in a third country or international organization and the existence or non-existence of a Commission decision on adequacy, or in the case of Article 46 transfers; 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49 (1), reference to appropriate or appropriate safeguards and the means of obtaining a copy thereof or the place where they are made available. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time the personal data are collected, provide the respondent with the following additional information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing: (a) the period during which the personal data will be stored; (b) the existence of the right to request the controller to access personal data and to correct or delete personal data or to restrict processing relating to the respondent or the right to object to the processing of such data and the right to data portability; ) if the processing is based on Article 6 (1) (a) or Article 9 (2) (a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time without prejudice to the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before it is withdrawn, (d) the right to object to the supervisory authority, (e) the source of personal data and, where applicable, whether they come from publicly available sources; (f) the existence of automated decision-making, which includes the creation of the profiles referred to in Article 22 (1) and (4) and, at least in these cases, meaningful information on the logic involved and the importance and intended consequences of such processing for the respondent. The controller shall provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the said Act, inter alia, within a reasonable time after receiving personal data, and no later than one month taking into account the special circumstances of personal data processing. the moment personal information is first disclosed. Paragraph 4 of the same article stipulates that if the controller intends to further process personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were obtained, the controller shall provide the respondent with information on that other purpose and all other relevant information referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 14 of the General Regulation.
The respondent has the right, at any time based on his / her special situation, to object to the processing of personal data concerning him / her in accordance with Article 6 (1) (e) or (f), including the creation of a profile based on these provisions. . The controller may no longer process personal data unless the controller demonstrates that there are compelling legitimate reasons for the processing that go beyond the interests, rights and freedoms of the respondent or to set, exercise or defend legal claims. If personal data is processed for the purposes of direct marketing, the respondent has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data relating to him for the purposes of such marketing, which includes creating a profile to the extent associated with such direct marketing. At the latest at the time of the first communication with the respondent, the respondent must be explicitly drawn to the law referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 and this must be done in a clear and separate manner from any other information (Article 21).
Consequently, based on the established facts in this administrative matter, company x as the controller did not have a legal basis for the processing of personal data, specifically the telephone number of the applicant. Namely, the allegation that the legal basis for the processing of the applicant's personal data is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (f). The General Data Protection Regulation does not have its legal basis in this particular case as it has not been established that the applicant is a user / client of the said manager. Also, the processing manager's call for a legitimate interest is not enough, but the processing manager must be able to prove it by conducting a balance test in which he proves that the processing manager's interest prevails over the interest or rights and freedoms of respondents. Also, the decisive fact in this administrative matter was the fact that the applicant's number was entered in the Register "Do not call" before contacting the company so that a legitimate interest can not be a valid legal basis in this case.
The mentioned company also did not prove that the number is in the telephone directory, and the fact that it admitted that calling the number in the Register "Do not call" was due to human error proves that the mentioned company as a processing manager does not take appropriate protection measures to process personal data was lawful and fair, in breach of the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation. 
In addition, it follows from the described procedure that the applicant was not adequately informed about the processing of personal data in the manner required by Article 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
As the company in question processed the applicant's personal data without the legal basis of Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation without taking care that the number is in the Do Not Call Registry, the applicant's personal data was ordered deleted from its databases (storage systems). whereas, in accordance with Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation, there are no stronger legitimate reasons for the further processing of personal data and personal data are also unlawfully processed.
