    Summary
              The Authority (co) examined the appeals of 12 former shareholders of OASTH against the Organization, regarding the publication of their names in a press conference given by the President of OASTH and the publication of a list with specific names for 29 former shareholders. The list was included in a relevant OASTH Press Release published on the same day. First, the Authority considered that the issues related to the operation and the future of OASTH were a matter of public interest and in this context the publication of the names of the former shareholders who raised claims from the value / return of the share (they had also sent a relevant out-of-court settlement to OASTH , which was made public) or was in public controversy with the Agency was justified. However, two names of shareholders were mentioned who were not justified in informing the public, as they were not included in those who raised claims. For this reason, the Authority imposed on OASTH a fine of 3,000 euros for the publication of these two names. Furthermore, with regard to the applicants, who also complain about the dissatisfaction of a right they had exercised with OASTH, based on Law 2472/1997, the Authority imposed on OASTH a fine of 7,000 euros for violation of Articles 12 and 13 of Law 2472 / 1997. The Authority, taking into account articles 4, 5, 12 and 13 of law 2472/1997, imposed on OASTH a fine of a total amount of 10,000 euros for established violations of the same law. Finally, he issued a warning for the compliance of OASTH with the provisions of the GCP, in particular for the exercise of data subject rights and their response in accordance with the law.
