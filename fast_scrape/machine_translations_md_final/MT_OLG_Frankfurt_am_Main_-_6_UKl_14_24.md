– Defendant –

The Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main – 6th Civil
Senate – through the Presiding Judge at the Higher Regional
Court, the Judge at the Higher Regional Court, and the Judge
at the Higher Regional Court, by way of written proceedings
pursuant to § 128(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO),
on the basis of the written submissions received up to 30
May 2025, has ruled as follows:

1. The defendant is ordered, under penalty of a coercive
   fine of up to EUR 250,000 for each case of infringement,
   or alternatively coercive detention, or coercive
   detention of up to six months (to be executed against its
   legal representatives), to refrain from processing or
   having processed, within the context of commercial
   practices directed at consumers, consumers’ e-mail
   addresses and/or mobile phone numbers, unless such
   processing is necessary for the performance of the
   contract, in cases where no distribution channel is
   offered for the sale of “Spar” and “Super Spar” tickets
   that allows purchase of such tickets without the
   provision of an e-mail address and/or mobile phone
   number, while, at the same time, regular tickets can be
   purchased via a distribution channel (vending machine
   sales) without the provision of an e-mail address and/or
   mobile phone number, if this occurs as described in
   section 3.3.1.4 of the Conditions of Carriage (Annex K1).

2. The defendant is ordered to pay the claimant EUR 260.00
   plus interest at a rate of five percentage points above
   the base interest rate from 27 September 2024.

3. The defendant shall bear the costs of the proceedings.

4. The judgment is provisionally enforceable. The defendant
   may avert enforcement by providing security in the amount
   of EUR 15,000, unless the claimant provides security in
   the same amount prior to enforcement.

5. The value in dispute is set at EUR 10,000.

\*\*Statement of Facts\*\* The claimant is the umbrella
organisation of all 16 consumer advice centres. In
accordance with § 2 of its articles of association, the
claimant pursues the objective of representing consumer
interests, promoting consumer protection, strengthening the
position of consumers within the social market economy, and
contributing to the achievement of sustainable development.
The claimant is registered in the list of qualified entities
pursuant to § 4 of the Injunctions Act (UKlaG), maintained
by the Federal Office of Justice in Bonn.

The defendant is a provider of railway transport services.

The defendant offers the sale of train tickets through
various distribution channels. Consumers can purchase
regular tickets online or via the defendant’s app through a
customer account (digital), at staffed counters (in-person
sales), at ticket vending machines, and by telephone via the
travel service.

At issue is the distribution of the defendant’s “Sparpreis”
and “Super Sparpreis” tickets, i.e. discounted or
particularly discounted fare tickets. Unlike other tickets,
the defendant offered these tickets solely via digital means
(digital tickets), meaning that consumers were required to
provide an e-mail address or mobile phone number even when
purchasing at staffed counters. It was not possible to
purchase “Sparpreis” or “Super Sparpreis” tickets at ticket
vending machines.

This is also evident from section 3.3.1.4 of the conditions
of carriage (Annex K1), which have been approved by the
Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs. The provision reads:

> “3.3.1.4 Tickets for Super Sparpreis and Sparpreis as well
> as Super Sparpreis Senior and Sparpreis Senior are issued
> exclusively as digital tickets in the in-person sales
> channel. Upon purchase, the ticket is sent to the e-mail
> address provided by the customer. As an alternative to
> providing an e-mail address, the order number of the
> ticket is sent via SMS when a mobile phone number is
> provided at the travel centre. This order number can be
> used to load the ticket into the DB Navigator app.”

At the time of booking, customers received either the
digital ticket or an order number via electronic channels
(email/SMS). The latter could be used to integrate the
ticket into the DB Navigator or to download it at
bahn.de/auftragssuche. With the order number, customers
could also have the ticket printed at DB travel centres and
DB agencies.

In temporal connection with a supervisory proceeding
conducted by the Hessian Data Protection Commissioner, the
defendant modified its sales process with the timetable
change on 15 December 2024. Since then, customers are no
longer required to provide an e-mail address or mobile
number in order to purchase a discounted fare ticket.
Rather, they may now receive a printed copy of the Sparpreis
ticket at the counter without disclosing such data.

The claimant is of the opinion that the defendant has
violated Article 5(1)(a), (c) and Article 6(1), first
sentence of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
§ 1 of the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG), as well as
§ 4a(1) no. 3 of the Act Against Unfair Competition (UWG).

The claimant bases its action on § 2(1) UKlaG and,
alternatively, on §§ 8(1), 3, and 3a UWG.

The claimant seeks the following relief:

1. The defendant shall be ordered, under penalty of an
   administrative fine of up to EUR 250,000 for each
   individual breach, or alternatively administrative
   detention, or administrative detention of up to six
   months, to be executed against its statutory
   representatives, to refrain from, within the scope of
   commercial practices towards consumers, processing or
   having processed consumers’ e-mail addresses and/or
   mobile phone numbers without such processing being
   necessary for the performance of the contract, by failing
   to offer a distribution channel for the sale of Sparpreis
   and Super Sparpreis tickets to consumers that enables
   purchase of said tickets without the provision of an
   e-mail address and/or mobile phone number, whereas at the
   same time regular tickets can be purchased via a
   distribution channel (vending machine sales) without the
   provision of an e-mail address and/or mobile phone
   number.

2. The defendant shall be ordered to pay to the claimant the
   amount of EUR 260.00 plus interest at five percentage
   points above the base interest rate since the date on
   which proceedings became pending.

The defendant seeks dismissal of the action.

The Hessian Commissioner for Data Protection has submitted a
statement pursuant to § 12a UWG.

\*\*Grounds for the Decision\*\*

1. The Senate has jurisdiction over the action based on § 2
   UKlaG, as the exclusive (initial) jurisdiction of the
   Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt is established
   pursuant to § 6(1) sentence 1 UKlaG in its version
   applicable since 13 October 2023 (Article 10 no. 17
   lit. d sublit. aa of the VRUG).

    a) The Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt has local
    jurisdiction pursuant to § 6(1) sentence 1 UKlaG. The
    defendant has its registered office within the district
    of the court seized.

    b) Furthermore, the Higher Regional Court also has
    subject-matter jurisdiction for claims based on § 2
    UKlaG in conjunction with the GDPR.

        (1) According to the claimant’s submissions in the 
        statement of claim, the asserted claim for
        injunctive relief is based, inter alia, on the 
        allegation that the defendant violated a consumer 
        protection norm within the meaning of § 2 UKlaG. 
        Pursuant to § 2(1) sentence 1 UKlaG, any person who, 
        other than by using or recommending general terms 
        and conditions, infringes provisions serving the 
        protection of consumers (consumer protection laws) 
        may be required to cease and eliminate such conduct 
        in the interest of consumer protection. According to 
        § 2(2) sentence 2 UKlaG, consumer protection laws 
        include, in particular, the provisions listed 
        therein.

        (2) Articles 5(1)(a), (c) and 6(1) sentence 1 GDPR 
        constitute consumer protection laws within the 
        meaning of § 2 UKlaG. Pursuant to § 2(2) no. 13 
        UKlaG, consumer protection laws also include the 
        provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the 
        European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 
        2016 on the protection of natural persons with 
        regard to the processing of personal data, on the 
        free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 
        95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 
        119 of 4.5.2016, p. 1; L 314 of 22.11.2016, p. 72; 
        L 127 of 23.5.2018, p. 2; L 074 of 4.3.2021, p. 35) 
        in its applicable version, insofar as it applies to 
        the processing of consumers’ data by businesses.

        (3) Subject-matter jurisdiction extends not only to 
        the claim for injunctive relief under § 1 UKlaG but 
        also to the additional claim for reimbursement of 
        warning costs. This does not follow from § 35 ZPO 
        or the principle of § 17(2) sentence 1 GVG. The 
        relevant claims concern procedurally distinct causes 
        of action with respect to the injunctive claim (cf. 
        Federal Court of Justice (BGH), judgment of 14 
        December 2017 – I ZR 184/15 – juris para. 19; see 
        also Stein/Roth, Commentary on the Code of Civil 
        rocedure (ZPO), 24th ed. 2024, § 1 para. 10; 
        Heinrich in: Musielak/Voit, ZPO, 21st ed. 2024, § 1 
        para. 14). However, a joinder of claims under § 260 
        ZPO presupposes that the court seized has 
        jurisdiction for all claims (cf. Lückemann in: 
        Zöller, ZPO, 35th ed. 2024, § 17 GVG para. 6).

        Nonetheless, jurisdiction arises from an 
        interpretation of § 6(1) sentence 1 UKlaG that is 
        oriented toward the legislative purpose. Under this 
        interpretation, "actions under this Act" also 
        include ancillary claims accompanying the claim 
        for injunctive relief, at least where they are 
        asserted in the same action. Otherwise, the 
        legislative intent behind the reform of the Act 
        would be undermined. According to the will of the 
        legislature, the Higher Regional Courts are to have 
        exclusive first-instance jurisdiction over such 
        actions in order to accelerate proceedings 
        (Köhler/Alexander in: Köhler/Bornkamm/Feddersen, 
        42nd ed. 2024, UKlaG § 6 para. 2). Proceedings 
        involving claims under the UKlaG primarily concern 
        legal issues, making a single instance of 
        fact-finding sufficient. Since claims for injunctive 
        relief now have a tolling effect (§ 204a(1) no. 2 
        BGB), it is expected that such claims will be 
        brought more frequently in future—particularly ahead 
        of representative actions—in order to clarify 
        certain legal issues in advance before the highest 
        courts and to reduce the cost risk of a 
        representative action (BT-Drs 20/6520, p. 118). 
        Moreover, the aim already pursued under the previous 
        version of § 6(2) UKlaG—to concentrate expertise and 
        practical knowledge—is being maintained. These 
        considerations apply equally to ancillary claims 
        seeking information and corrective measures. The 
        objective of accelerating proceedings would be 
        thwarted if further claims arising from consumer 
        protection law violations pursuant to § 2 UKlaG were 
        to be referred, depending on the amount in dispute, 
        to the first-instance jurisdiction of Local or 
        Regional Courts; there is no longer any 
        concentration at the level of the Regional Courts 
        under the current legal framework (Köhler/Alexander, 
        loc. cit., § 6 UKlaG para. 12). Additionally, 
        the risk of contradictory decisions must be
        addressed. Since, according to the prevailing 
        opinion, jurisdiction is affirmed even in cases 
        where claims are based on contractual penalty 
        undertakings and cease-and-desist declarations (BGH, 
        decision of 19.10.2016 – I ZR 93/15, BeckRS 2016, 
        20396, paras. 22 to 26 regarding § 13 UWG; 
        MüKoZPO/Micklitz/Rott, 6th ed. 2022, § 6 UKlaG, 
        para. 4 with further references), this must apply 
        all the more to ancillary claims. Accordingly, the 
        jurisdictional provision must also be applied 
        mutatis mutandis to disputes concerning the 
        reimbursement of pre-litigation warning costs 
        (Higher Regional Court Koblenz, judgment of 
        5.12.2024 – 2 UKI 1/23, 34027 paras. 12–16).

2. The action is well-founded.

The claimant is entitled to the asserted claim for
injunctive relief under § 2(1), (2) no. 13 UKlaG in
conjunction with Article 5(1)(a) GDPR. The defendant, in the
sale of “Super Sparpreis” and “Sparpreis” online tickets,
made it mandatory for customers to provide an email address
or telephone number and thereby required a data processing
operation that is not lawful.

    a) The authorisation decision of the Federal Ministry for Digital and
    Transport (BMDV) dated 29 August 2023 (Annex B1), by which the general
    conditions of carriage were approved, has no constitutive effect
    (Tatbestandswirkung).

    If a specific market behaviour is authorised by the competent
    administrative or supervisory authority, such conduct cannot, in
    principle, be qualified as unfair as long as the authorisation is
    not null and void or revoked in the appropriate administrative law
    proceedings (BGH GRUR 2005, 778 – Atemtest I; BGH GRUR 2008, 1014 –
    Amlodipin). These principles are also applied when assessing conduct
    permitted by an administrative authority (OLG Hamburg GRUR-RR 2014,
    218; later confirmed by BGH GRUR 2015, 1244 – Äquipotenzangabe in
    Fachinformation; OLG Hamburg Magazindienst 2015, 42), and they also
    apply within the scope of § 2 UKlaG.

    If a commercial practice is assessed by the competent authorities as
    being legally permissible, the advertiser may rely on this
    assessment and is not obliged to seek legal advice based on the
    strictest interpretation of the law or to conduct an individualised
    legal review. As a general rule, it is expected that a trader
    familiarise themselves with the legal provisions relevant to their
    area of activity and, in cases of doubt, seek expert legal advice
    within reasonable bounds. However, this duty finds its limit where
    the conduct in question has been positively classified by the
    authority as lawful—unless the trader knew of the unlawfulness of
    the conduct (or wilfully blinded themselves to it) or unlawfully
    influenced the stance of the administrative authority (BGH GRUR
    2002, 269 – Sportwetten-Genehmigung). Thus, if the competent
    administrative authority has issued a valid administrative act
    expressly permitting the challenged market conduct and this act has
    neither been revoked by the authority nor annulled by an
    administrative court, and cannot be deemed null and void, then the
    permissibility of the challenged conduct—due to the so-called
    constitutive effect (Tatbestandswirkung) of the administrative
    act—is not subject to judicial review by the civil courts, not even
    under the unfairness provision of § 3a UWG (BGH GRUR 2015, 1228 –
    Tagesschau-App).

    The scope of the constitutive effect of an administrative act is
    determined by its regulatory content (tenor) (cf. Stelkens in
    Stelkens/Bonk/Sachs, VwVfG, 8th ed., § 35 para. 142; BeckOK
    VwVfG/Schemmer, status: 1 April 2025, § 43 para. 28; Peuker in
    Knack/Henneke, VwVfG, 10th ed., § 43 para. 22). The regulatory
    content of an administrative act is to be interpreted analogously to
    §§ 133, 157 BGB according to the same principles applicable to the
    interpretation of declarations of intent. Accordingly, the decisive
    factor is the declared intention of the issuing authority as
    understood by the recipient in an objective evaluation (BGH WRP
    2007, 1359; BVerwG NVwZ 2005, 1070; BVerwG NJW 2013, 1832 para. 10).
    In determining this objective meaning, primary reference is to be
    made to the operative part and reasoning of the administrative act;
    in addition, the substantive legal basis on which the act rests must
    be consulted (BGH GRUR 2015, 1228 para. 35; BVerwGE 126, 254
    para. 78; Kopp/Ramsauer, VwVfG, 15th ed., § 43 para. 15).

    The letter of the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport dated
    29 August 2023 contains neither an operative part in the strict
    sense nor any reasoning. Its core statement is limited to the
    notification that tariff application no. 23/2023 dated 10 August
    2023 is approved pursuant to § 12(1) AEG. The operative part does
    not indicate in what respect a legal examination and authorisation
    were carried out; since no reasoning is provided, no conclusions can
    be drawn as to the scope of any binding effect. As the authority has
    discretion under § 12(1) AEG (as regards whether to take up the
    matter and how to decide it), it cannot be assumed that the tariffs
    were comprehensively reviewed in terms of all legal
    issues—particularly not in relation to the GDPR.

    b) The storage of telephone numbers and/or e-mail addresses constitutes 
    unlawful data processing under the GDPR, as no legal basis for such 
    processing is apparent.

        (1) This data processing is not justified by consent under 
        Article 6(1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR.

            aa) The legal ground of the data subject’s consent to
            the processing of their personal data presupposes the
            existence of valid consent within the meaning of
            Article 4 no. 11 GDPR, that is, a “freely given,
            specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the
            data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement
            or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to
            the processing of personal data relating to him or her.”
            Above all, voluntariness is a “defining prerequisite”
            for the validity of consent. A declaration is voluntary
            if the data subject has a genuine or free choice and is
            thus able to refuse or withdraw consent without
            suffering any detriment (Recital 42, sentence 5).

            As follows from Article 7(4) GDPR, consent may not be
            freely given if the performance of a contract—e.g. the
            provision of a service—is made conditional upon consent
            to data processing which is not necessary for the
            performance of the contract. In effect, the provision
            establishes a general prohibition on coupling. Consent
            is not deemed voluntary if the data subject in practice
            has no other choice than to agree to the processing of
            their data in order to benefit from a service or other
            contractual performance (BeckOK DatenschutzR/Stemmer,
            52nd ed. 1.5.2025, GDPR Art. 7 para. 42;
            Paal/Pauly/Ernst, 3rd ed. 2021, GDPR Art. 4
            paras. 73–74).

            Consent is therefore only valid if the controller can
            demonstrate that the data subject had a real choice,
            i.e. that they were not subjected to any disadvantages
            by refusing to provide their data. This requires that an
            equivalent alternative be offered which does not compel
            the data subject to disclose their data. In the absence
            of such an alternative, the digital access barrier
            cannot be based on consent under Article 6(1)
            subparagraph 1 lit. a GDPR.

            In the words of the CJEU: the processing must be
            “objectively indispensable for achieving a purpose that
            is an essential element of the service requested.” The
            controller must therefore be able to demonstrate in what
            way the main purpose of the contract could not be
            fulfilled without the processing in question. The mere
            fact that such processing is mentioned in the contract,
            or that it is merely useful for its performance, is not
            sufficient in itself. The decisive factor for the
            application of the justification under Article 6(1)
            subparagraph 1 lit. b GDPR is that the processing of
            personal data by the controller is essential for the
            proper performance of the contract concluded between the
            controller and the data subject, and that no practicable
            and less intrusive alternatives exist.

            According to the case law of the CJEU, a dominant market
            position of the controller is an indicator of
            potentially absent voluntariness where the consent to
            data processing must be given in order to use a service.
            In such cases, users are not in a position to refuse or
            withdraw their consent without experiencing
            disadvantages. A dominant market position may thus
            result in a clear imbalance of power, which must be
            taken into account in the context of the prohibition on
            coupling. Conversely, however, a dominant market
            position does not in itself exclude the possibility of
            valid consent (CJEU NJW 2023, 2997 paras. 147 et seq. –
            Meta; Paal/Pauly/Ernst, 3rd ed. 2021, GDPR Art. 4
            para. 76).

            bb) In light of the overall circumstances, voluntariness
            of consent cannot be affirmed in this case.

            The defendant made the performance of the contract
            conditional upon consent to data processing that is not
            necessary for the performance of the contract. The
            collection of this data was not strictly necessary in
            factual terms for the provision of the service owed by
            the defendant. The defendant was unable to demonstrate
            how the core subject matter of the contract (the
            provision of the transport service) could not be
            fulfilled without the processing in question. Indeed,
            the defendant did not even claim that it would be unable
            to provide the transport service without the collection
            of such data.

            Insofar as the defendant refers to revenue protection,
            duplication protection, misuse prevention, and
            protection against ticket transfer as justifications for
            the data processing, the protection against duplication
            and transfer may require identification of the person,
            but this necessitates only the collection of the
            customer’s identity data, not the collection of their
            email address or mobile number. Potential misuse can
            also be countered by including, in addition to the
            ticket number, the name of the customer (and, where
            there is a risk of confusion, their address). During
            ticket inspection, it can then be verified by checking
            the ticket number and presenting an ID document whether
            the ticket has been duplicated or transferred to an
            unauthorised person. If a ticket is paid for and printed
            at the counter and the feared misuse is thereby ruled
            out, revenue protection is ensured in this scenario as
            well.

            Not every case of coupling automatically negates
            voluntariness. Rather, the coupling situation must be
            “taken into account to the greatest extent possible.”
            This implies that other factors must also be considered
            in the assessment of whether consent is “freely given.”
            The controller must therefore examine, on a case-by-case
            basis, whether a situation of pressure arises that
            undermines the freedom to make a decision (see the state
            of the debate in Kollmann, ZD 2025, p. 73 \\\[75 et seq.\];
            relative coupling ban: BeckOK DatenschutzR/Stemmer, 52nd
            ed., 1.5.2025, GDPR Art. 7 para. 45; Paal/Pauly/Frenzel
            para. 18; Ehmann/Selmayr/Heckmann/Paschke
            paras. 100, 103; contra: Dammann, ZD 2016, p. 307, 311;
            Golland, MMR 2018, p. 130, 132: absolute coupling ban).
            This enables a nuanced assessment, taking into account
            all circumstances that may impair the data subject’s
            freedom of decision.

            In the present case, however, the Senate considers
            that—at least due to the defendant’s dominant market
            position—a violation of the prohibition on coupling must
            be affirmed.

            According to the case law of the CJEU, a dominant market
            position of the controller is an indication of
            potentially absent voluntariness where the consent to
            data processing is required in order to use a service.
            In such cases, users are not in a position to refuse or
            withdraw consent without suffering disadvantages. A
            dominant market position may therefore result in a clear
            imbalance of power, which must be considered in the
            context of the coupling ban (CJEU NJW 2023, p. 2997,
            paras. 147 et seq. – Meta; see also BGH WRP 2025, p. 72,
            para. 44 – Scraping).

            In this instance, the defendant is, as is well known to
            the court, in a position of overwhelming dominance in
            the long-distance rail transport market. For the
            affected customers, there is no alternative and
            reasonable access to equivalent services on the market.
            This applies, on the one hand, to long-distance services
            offered by other providers, which do not exist to such a
            significant extent as to constitute a viable alternative
            across the board. It also applies, on the other hand, to
            “internal” alternatives referred to by the defendant
            (regular tickets), as these are significantly more
            expensive.

        (2) The data processing is also not justified under Article 6(1)
        sentence 1 lit. b GDPR (processing of contractual data).

        This legal basis—like Article 7(b) of the Data Protection
        Directive (Directive 95/46/EC)—requires that the processing be
        necessary for the performance of a contract with the data
        subject or in order to take steps at the request of the data
        subject prior to entering into a contract. This legal basis
        applies to data processing that is necessary in connection with
        a contract. The concept of “performance” is to be interpreted
        broadly and includes not only the initiation and execution of
        the contractual purpose but also the settlement of the
        contractual relationship (Ehmann/Selmayr/Heberlein, 3rd ed.
        2024, GDPR Article 6 para. 24).

        However, for the performance of a contract, processing is only
        necessary where it is indispensable to achieving the specific
        contractual purposes—not merely useful. This presupposes that
        the agreed contractual purposes between the contracting parties
        cannot be achieved without the relevant processing operations,
        and that these operations are therefore objectively essential
        for fulfilling the contract (Ehmann/Selmayr/Heberlein, 3rd ed.
        2024, GDPR Article 6 para. 25).

        That is not the case here. The defendant enters into a transport
        contract with the customer. Customers wish to travel by train
        from point A to point B on a given day at a favourable price. To
        this end, they pay the defendant the ticket price. However, the
        main subject matter of the contract is not the generation of a
        valid and simultaneously digital “Sparpreis” ticket. The ticket
        merely serves as proof of the conclusion of the transport
        contract and of payment of the fare. The customer does not
        travel from A to B by virtue of the ticket itself—the principal
        performance owed is the transport service.

        According to the defendant’s own submissions, the issuing of a
        digital ticket and the associated processing of personal data
        serve merely to facilitate the execution of the main
        performance, but do not constitute that performance. Even where
        such data processing is mentioned in the contract or is merely
        useful for fulfilling it, this is irrelevant according to the
        CJEU’s “Meta” judgment.

        Accordingly, the processing of the above-mentioned information
        is not necessary for the core contractual performance
        (transportation), but primarily serves internal business
        purposes—such as customer retention, marketing, or monitoring of
        user behaviour.

3. The decision on costs is based on § 91 of the German Code
   of Civil Procedure (ZPO). The decision on provisional
   enforceability is based on §§ 709 no. 11, 711, 713 ZPO.
