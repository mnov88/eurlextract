<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On June 24, 2020, the claimant filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) in which he indicated that Iberdrola Clientes, S.A.U (the defendant) had contacted him through his mobile phone on three occasions despite being included in the 'Robinson list' (a.k.a Do not Call Register).  
</p><p>The first contact was made on 19/06/2020 from telephone number 'T1' to promote an offer on electricity services, the claimant inquired about the call and was informed that his telephone number was included in a database.  The second, on 19/06/2020 (a few minutes later after the first call) from telephone number 'T2', during this call, the caller tried to obtain further personal data about the claimant. The third contact was made on 22/06/2020 again from telephone number 'T2' to offer new electricity discounts. 
</p><p>The claimant submitted along with his complaint a proof of being included in the ‘Robinson list’ since March 2010 as well as proof of ownership of the receiver telephone number. 
</p><p>The AEPD, admitted the complaint of the claimant in accordance with article 65 of the LOPDGDD and proceeded to transfer the claim to the defendant stating that it must respond within a month. 
</p><p>In response to the claim, the defendant stated that  
</p><p>(i) it had no records on the claimant  
</p><p>(ii) it did not own telephone number 'T2' nor it had been used to make marketing calls  
</p><p>(iii) the telephone number 'T1' did belong to one of its processors, however, the call must have been made as a result of a human error since the claimant’s telephone number does not appear on the marketing campaign list. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Were the defendant's actions a violation of Article 21 of the GDPR? Should have the defendant verify the 'Robinson list' before contacting the claimant?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>Based on the facts presented, the AEPD considered that the actions of the defendant infringed the following articles and laws: 
</p>
<ul><li>Article 21 GDPR – Right to Object</li>
<li>Article 48(1)(b) of the Spanish General Law of Telecommunications (LGT) - Right to object to receiving unsolicited communications</li>
<li>Article 23(4) of the Spanish Data Protection and Digital Rights Law (LOPDGDD) - Failure to consult the ‘Robinson list’ prior to contacting the claimant.</li></ul>
<p>The AEPD held that this offense is considered as ‘minor’ in accordance with Article 78 (11) LGT which may be sanctioned with a fine up to €50.000 as per article 79 (b) of the same law.
