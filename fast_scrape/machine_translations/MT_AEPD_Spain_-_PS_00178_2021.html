<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A wife and a husband were both administrators of a company. During a judicial procedure between both of them, the wife sent, as the administrator of the company, a series of emails containing some documents related to the proceedings, revealing details about several alleged crimes, to other companies that had a commercial relationship with the company. The husband (as data subject) filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against the company for sharing the documents containing his personal data without consent.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD established that the facts were a violation of the confidentiality principle, since, even if the company was authorised to process such personal data, being it involved in the judicial proceedings, it should not have shared such personal data without the data subject's consent.
</p><p>Therefore, the AEPD fined the controller €2000 for a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a>. In order to determine the amount of the fine, the DPA took into account, among other factors, the small size of the company and the limited number of data subjects affected (1), as well as the limited impact of the behaviour, since it was only local.

serious for the purposes of prescription in article 72.1.i) of the LOPDGDD.

SEVENTH: The complained entity has not submitted allegations to the Proposal for

Resolution.

In view of all the actions, by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection
In this proceeding, the following are considered proven facts,

                                       FACTS


FIRST: On October 23, 2020, the claimant filed a claim with
the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, stating that his ex-wife,
administrator of the company of which both were partners, sent several emails to
companies with which the entity had a commercial relationship, attaching documentation

that revealed information and personal data of this.

SECOND: On February 10, 2021, the respondent received a response in the
which shows that he sent the emails to companies with which the entity had
commercial relationship, to prevent them from continuing to serve as suppliers, due to the

economic insolvency suffered by society.

                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

FIRST: By virtue of the powers that Article 58.2 Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD) recognizes each

control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the Organic Law
3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Agency
Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.


SECOND: Article 5 of the RGPD, whose heading is entitled “Principles relating to the
treatment ”establishes in letter f) of its section 1 that personal data will be
"Treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate data security
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or illegal processing and against
its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of technical measures
or appropriate organizational ('integrity and confidentiality'). "


In relation to this principle, Recital 39 of the aforementioned RGPD states that:

“[…] Personal data must be treated in a way that guarantees security and
adequate confidentiality of personal data, including to prevent access

or unauthorized use of said data and of the equipment used in the treatment ”.

For its part, the LOPDGDD, in its article 5 provides that:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

 "one. Those responsible and in charge of data processing, as well as all
people who intervene in any phase of this will be subject to the duty of

confidentiality referred to in article 5.1.f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

duties of professional secrecy in accordance with its applicable regulations.

THIRD: The claim is based on the presumed illegality of the
knowledge to third parties, by the claimed party, of the claimant's data, through

emails sent to other companies, revealing information and
documentation related to legal proceedings between claimant and claimed.

The documentation in the file provides clear indications that the claim-
violated article 5 of the RGPD, principles relating to treatment, in relation to
with article 5 of the LOPGDD, duty of confidentiality, revealing information and

personal data to third parties. The dissemination of these data by whoever was a member
and administrator of the company (with respect to whom their legitimacy is not
timation to dispose of them and treat them in the exercise of the rights that may
correspond) to third parties, implies a violation of the principle of confidentiality
ciality established by the RGPD in the processing of personal data, general obligation

General that highlights article 5 of the LOPDGDD, without it being understood to be reduced to
duty of professional secrecy.

This duty of confidentiality must be understood to be intended to prevent
leaks of the data not consented to by the owners of these are made.


Therefore, this duty of confidentiality is an obligation that is incumbent not only on the
responsible and in charge of the treatment, but to everyone who intervenes in
any phase of the treatment and complementary to the duty of professional secrecy.

FOURTH: Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which provides the following:


"Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,

global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for

the highest amount:

    a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
       consent in accordance with articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; […] "


For the purposes of the statute of limitations for infractions, the infraction indicated in the
previous paragraph is considered very serious and prescribes after three years, according to the
Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which establishes that:


C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
