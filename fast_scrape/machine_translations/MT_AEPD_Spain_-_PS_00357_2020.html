<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A public body for the defense of consumers' rights filed a complaint with the AEPD against the defendant for failing to comply with Article 13 GDPR on its website.
</p><p>In its investigation, the AEPD found that the defendant's website had a data collection form, but users did not have all the necessary information on the processing of their data according to Article 13 GDPR. 
</p><p>Subsequently, the AEPD verified that the defendant had updated the information on its website.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>The decision does not establish precisely why the information provided was not in accordance with the GDPR. However, on the basis of the available information it seems that the information appeared under the title "legal notice" instead of "privacy policy". In addition, the text referred to the old Spanish law instead of the current one. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD imposes a warning sanction and explains that imposing a sanction under Article 83(5)(b) of the GDPR against the respondent would be a disproportionate burden on it. In addition, the AEPD takes into account two factors: 1) that the main activity of the respondent is not directly linked to the processing of personal data and 2) that there is no record of previous data protection infringements.

personal information, it is indicated that «the link" Privacy Policy "actually directs the
"Legal Notice" document that, due to its content, as already mentioned, responds
more broadly to the requirements of the data protection regulations than the
"Privacy Policy" document&#160;».


In short, the information provided to users, both in the general content of
the website and the contact form itself, adequately comply
with all the requirements established by law, without observing non-compliance in
none of the points regulated in article 13 of the RGPD.

By virtue of the provisions of article 58.2 of the RGPD, the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, as a control authority, has a set of
corrective powers in the event of an infringement of the precepts of the

GDPR.
Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following:

“2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following corrective powers
listed below:

(…)

b) punish any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with warning
when the treatment operations have infringed the provisions of this
Regulation;"

(...)

“D) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period; "

“I) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or instead of
the measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each
particular case;"

Article 83.5.b) of the RGPD establishes that:

 "Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:


 a) the rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22; "

In turn, article 74.a) of the LOPDGDD, under the heading "Violations considered
mild provides:

 "They are considered minor and will prescribe a year the remaining offenses of character
merely formal of the articles mentioned in sections 4 and 5 of article 83
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, in particular, the following:

a) Failure to comply with the principle of transparency of information or the right
of the data subject for not providing all the information required by the articles

of users who fill in the form included in the website *** URL.1 without
provide them, prior to their collection, all the information regarding
data protection provided for in article 13 of the reviewed RGPD.

Specifically, the content of points 2 to 7 of the Legal Notice, had to be updated
in accordance with the new personal data protection regulations
modifying the reference to Organic Law 15/1999 by Organic Law 3/2018, of
Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights.

It has been verified that the information contained in the
privacy has been modified adapting to data protection regulations
current.

                                           SAW

This being the case, in accordance with the evidence available, the facts
exposed, specifically, that since May 2018 the
information provided to users and clients about the processing of their data,
constitute, on the part of the defendant, an infringement of the provisions of article 13 of the

GDPR.
This infraction will be sanctioned with a warning, in accordance with article 58.2.b)
of the RGPD, when collecting basic data from users and

consider that the administrative fine that may be incurred in accordance with the provisions of
Article 83.5.b) of the GDPR would constitute a disproportionate burden for the
claimed, whose main activity is not directly linked to the treatment of
personal data, since there is no evidence of the commission of any previous infringement in
data protection matters.

Likewise, since the adequacy of the information offered to the
users whose personal data is collected from them to the requirements

contemplated in article 13 of the RGPD, it is not necessary to make a request
any.

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and assessed the criteria of
graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,


the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE A.A.A. with NIF *** NIF.1, for a violation of article 13 of the
RGPD, typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, a warning sanction.


SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to A.A.A. with NIF *** NIF. 1.

In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this
Resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.


Against this resolution, which puts an end to the administrative procedure in accordance with art. 48.6 of the
LOPDGDD, and in accordance with the provisions of article 123 of the LPACAP, the
Interested parties may optionally file an appeal for reconsideration before the
Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection within a month to
counting from the day after the notification of this resolution or directly

National High Court, in accordance with the provisions of article 25 and section 5 of
the fourth additional provision of Law 29/1998, of July 13, regulating
the Contentious-Administrative Jurisdiction, within a period of two months from the
day following notification of this act, as provided in article 46.1 of the
referred Law.


Finally, it is pointed out that in accordance with the provisions of art. 90.3 a) of the LPACAP,
may provisionally suspend the final resolution through administrative channels if the

interested party expresses his intention to file contentious-administrative appeal.
If this is the case, the interested party must formally communicate this fact through
writing addressed to the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, presenting it through

of the Electronic Registry of the Agency [https://sedeagpd.gob.es/sede-electronica-
