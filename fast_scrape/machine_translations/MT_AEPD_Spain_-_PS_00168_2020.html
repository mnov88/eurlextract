<p>AEPD fined VODAFONE ESPAÑA EUR 75,000 for an infringement of article 6(1) GDPR. Advertising SMS were sent to the complainant, despite that his personal data had been erased in 2015. National administrative law attenuating factors were invoked, leading to a reduced fine of EUR 45,000

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The reason for the complaint is that, after the erasure of the claimant's personal data in 2015, he continued to receive advertising SMS messages on his mobile line. Vodafone, in its communication with AEPD,  stated that they carried out the relevant checks and established that the reason why the claimant was able to receive such SMS is that his personal data could have been visible in their customer data management systems.  In the same communication, Vodafone stated that a series of blockages had been made in the system that prevent, for advertising purposes, the further use of the telephone number of the claimant.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Does continuing to send advertising messages after an erasure of personal data constitute a violation of Article 6(1) GDPR?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>AEPD considered that the documentation provided offers evidence that Vodafone violated Article 6(1) of the GDPR, by processing the claimant's personal data without any legitimate reason. The fact that it was a non-intentional negligent action, that basic personal identifiers were affected and the continued nature of the infringement were considered aggravating factors, determining the amount of the fine in EUR 75,000.
However, two attenuating circumstances of the Spanish Law on Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (Article 85) could be applied, which may respectively reduce the fine by 20%. The first mitigating factor is to acknowledge their responsibility within the time allowed for the submission of claims. The second mitigating factor is, at any time prior to the resolution of the proceedings, to make voluntary payment of the proposed fine.
On June 16, 2020, Vodafone proceeded to pay the sanction in the amount of EUR 45,000 applying therefore the two previously mentioned reductions. This implied the recognition of their responsibility and the resignation to any action or appeal in administrative channels against the sanction. After these events, the AEPD decided to terminate the procedure.

continued to receive advertising SMS messages on your mobile line (*** TELEPHONE 1).

what happened, they have proceeded to send a letter to the claimant, informing him of the steps that have
been carried out by Vodafone in response to his claim (attached copy of the letter sent).
They add that the claimant's data is correctly deleted in their computer systems related to the
management of customer data, by virtue of the request to exercise the right to cancel them made by him in

personal data had been visible in their customer data management systems, or there had been some type of
error of the claimed when managing the cancellation of such data.
On the other hand, they point out that the main reason is that this number has been used by both
collaborating agents and Vodafone employees as it is a simple number to remember and quick to write,

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW
I
By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each control authority, and as
established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is
competent to initiate and resolve this process.
II
The defendant is charged with committing an offense for violation of Article 6 of the RGPD, " Legality
of the treatment ”, Which indicates in section 1 the cases in which the processing of third-party data is
considered lawful:
"one. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:
a) the interested party gave their consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more
specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party is a party or
for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures;
(…) "

The offense is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:
"5. Infringements of the following provisions shall be penalized, in accordance with section 2, with
administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, of an amount equivalent
to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
one with the highest amount:
a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for consent in accordance with
articles 5,6,7 and 9. "
The Organic Law 3/2018, of Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights
(LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading “ Violations considered very serious " has:
"one. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infractions that imply
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following will prescribe after
three years:
(…)
a) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the conditions of lawfulness of
the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "
III
The documentation in the file provides evidence that the complained party violated article 6.1 of the
RGPD, since it processed the claimant's personal data without having any legitimacy to do so.
The respondent has recognized this error and has indicated that one of the causes that motivated the
sending of the SMS to the claimant is that said number has been used by both collaborating agents and
Vodafone employees as it is a simple and fast number to remember to write, therefore, a “dummy” number,
how to use it in certain activities and processes.

However, and this is essential, the respondent does not prove the legitimacy for the treatment of the
claimant's data.
IV
The determination of the sanction to be imposed in this case requires observing the provisions of
articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, precepts that, respectively, provide the following:

an additional or substitute for the measures referred to in article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When
deciding to impose an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, the following will be duly
taken into account:

purpose of the processing operation in question as well as the number of interested parties affected
and the level of damages they have suffered;
b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;
c) Any measure taken by the person in charge or in charge of the treatment to alleviate the

28001 - Madrid
www.aepd.es
sedeagpd.gob.es
6/11
h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in particular
whether the controller or processor notified the infringement and, if so, to what extent;
i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been previously ordered against the
person responsible or the person in charge in question in relation to the same matter, compliance
with said measures;
j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved under
Article 42, and
k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the
financial benefits obtained or the losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement. " ( The
underlining is from the AEPD)

article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, it is essential to examine and assess whether the circumstances described in
article 83.2 of the RGPD exist and if they intervene mitigating or aggravating the responsibility of the
responsible entity.
In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the instruction of the
procedure, for the purpose of setting the amount of the fine to be imposed in this case, the claimed party is
considered responsible for an offense typified in Article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, in an initial assessment, the following
factors are considered concurrent.
As aggravating factors the following:
- In the present case we are dealing with an unintentional negligent action, but
identified significant (article 83.2 b).
- Basic personal identifiers (name, an identification number, the line identifier) are affected (article 83.2 g).

- Section k), in relation to article 76.2 of Organic Law 3/2018, in which the continued nature of the offense
attributed to the claimed is framed as an aggravating factor.

of € 75,000 for the violation of article 6 of the RGPD.
