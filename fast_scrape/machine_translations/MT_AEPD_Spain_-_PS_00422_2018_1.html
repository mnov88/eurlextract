<p>The AEPD rejected company's responsibility for depositing on the public highway documents which contain personal data. According to the decision, the fact that a company merely threw or deposited such documents on the highway does not render the company responsible for the documents in terms of security according to the GDPR.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The complaint followed a discovery by Agents of the Local Police of the City Council of Sant Miquel d' Olèrdola of documents containing personal data on the public highway.  
</p><p>The complainant argued that the company SHANA REVOLUTION SHOPS was responsible to maintain security of these documents or otherwise to delete them. They alleged violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a> and asked for a EUR 15,000 fine to be imposed. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD found that it could not be proved which entity collected these documents and which was responsible for deleting the personal data. The AEPD highlighted that a basic principle of the GDPR is that personal data should be processed in a secure manner with technical and organisational means and measures laid down in advance, depending on the data processed and the risks involved. This includes taking measures and protocols to ensure that information in tangible formats, when discarded, is discarded by means that ensure the confidentiality of the data. However, it noted that the fact that an entity throws or deposits documents containing personal data on the public highway does not make it responsible for them in terms of security under the GDPR. Thus, it dismissed the allegations against both defendants since there was no concrete evidence against them.

LAW FUNDAMENTALS I By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the GDPR recognizes to each control authority, and according to what is established in articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.II Article 5.1 f) of the GDPR, establishes "1. Personal data shall be: f) "processed in such a way as to ensure adequate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage, through the application of appropriate technical or organisational measures ('integrity and confidentiality')". In this case, the data are on paper, (not automated) and can in principle be processed manually (recital 15 of the GDPR), considering Article 2 of the GDPR that "This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data, whether totally or partially automated, and to the processing of personal data contained or intended to be included in a file.A basic principle of the GDPR is that personal data should be processed in a secure manner with technical and organisational means and measures laid down in advance, depending on the data to be processed and the risks involved. This includes taking measures and protocols to ensure that information in tangible formats, such as the role of CVs, when discarded, is discarded by means that ensure the confidentiality of the data. Such obligations are attributable to the person responsible for the file or the processing, which usually coincide in the same entity. The GDPR defines in its article 4: 2) "processing": any operation or set of operations performed upon personal data or sets of personal data, whether by automatic or non-automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, dissemination or any other form of enabling access, comparison or interconnection, limitation, erasure or destruction6) "file": any structured set of personal data, accessible according to specific criteria, whether centralized, decentralized or dispersed in a functional or geographical manner the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing. Where Union law or the law of the Member States determines the purposes and means of the processing, the controller or the specific criteria for his nomination may lay them down in Union law or in the law of the Member States any breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or to their unauthorised disclosure or access.   The data controller, however, is the subject to whom decisions on the specific activities of a given data processing, i.e. on a specific application, can be attributed.   This would cover all those cases in which the power of decision must be differentiated from the material performance of the activity that makes up the processing.   The entity responsible for the file or processing must, when a medium is to be discarded, adopt the necessary measures to prevent any subsequent recovery of the stored information. This can be done by the entity itself, or by hiring a third party as the processor, who would be responsible for the task of deleting the documents.   If she uses the latter, she must sign a contract to have the documents processed. The security measures must be implemented effectively, and the correspondence between the documents that are destroyed and the verification that they have been destroyed must be verified. In this case, the person responsible for the offence would be the entity that collected the CV data, or it could, alternatively, if it is not the same entity, be the one that kept them and decided the purpose and th application of the same.   Usually it can be the same entity that collects the data and uses it for a purpose. However, in addition to this responsibility, it could fall to a processing manager, if it is decided to entrust this function to a third party. In this case, the practical implementation of the deletion of data is the responsibility of the said entity, in accordance with the provisions of a contract concluded for that purpose. In the present case, two entities have been charged with the same infringement at the beginning of the procedure. The charge of an infringement must be supported by evidence incriminating the action of its author.The statement in the police document "According to the opinion of a store called "SHANA REVOLUTIONS SHOPS" lacks evidential support, as there is no evidence in this sense.   It has not been proven that those that appeared in the boxes together with the containers had been deposited there by said entity, nor in its case the legal title in which it participated if that were the case. It should be borne in mind that although it was accredited that the said entity deposited the boxes with the CVs, it is not responsible for this for the purposes of data protection regulations, since in the first place it would be necessary to consider why the entity has the legal title to these documents, if there is some type of contract, and furthermore it would be necessary to find out who originally collected the CVs (the person responsible for the file-treatment). The fact that an entity throws or deposits documents containing personal data on the public highway does not make it responsible for them in terms of security. Therefore, in accordance with the legislation, the Director of the Spanish Agency of Protection of Data RESOLVES:FIRST: TO DECLARE the FILING of the infraction of the article 5.1.f) of the GDPR against PROJECT, DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE CLUSTER SL, considering that her responsibility for the infraction has not been accredited, in accordance with article 90.1 of Law 39/2015, of 1/10, of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (LPACAP).SECOND: DECLARE the ARCHIVE of the infringement of Article 5.1 (f) of the GDPR against SHANA RETAIL S.L.,  considering that its responsibility for the infringement has not been accredited, in accordance with article 90.1 of the LPACAP.THIRD: TO NOTIFY the present resolution to PROYECTO, DISEÑO Y FABRICACIONCLUSTER SL and to FOREST PARTNERS, ESTRADA Y ASOCIADOS, S.L.P. representing SHANA RETAIL S.L.FOURTH: In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this Resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.6 of the LOPDGDD, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 123 of the LPACAP, the interested parties may lodge, optionally, an appeal for reversal with the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency within a period of one month from the day following notification of this decision or directly an administrative appeal before the Administrative Chamber of the National Court, in accordance with the provisions of Article 25 and paragraph 5 of the fourth additional provision of Law 29/1998 of 13 July 1998, regulating the Contentious-Administrative Jurisdiction, within a period of two months from the day following notification of this act, as provided for in Article 46.Finally, in accordance with the provisions of article 90.3 a) of the LPACAP, the final resolution may be suspended as a precautionary measure through administrative channels if the interested party expresses its intention to file a contentious-administrative appeal.   If this is not the case, the interested party must formally communicate this fact by writing to the Spanish Data Protection Agency, submitting it through the Agency's Electronic Register [https://sedeagpd.gob.es/sede-electronica-web/], or through any of the other registers provided for in art. 16.4 of the aforementioned Law 39/2015, of October 1. He must also send to the Agency the documentation that accredits the effective filing of the contentious-administrative appeal. If the Agency were to become aware of the lodging of the contentious-administrative appeal within two months from the day following the notification of the present resolution, it would terminate the precautionary suspension.
