SANCTIONING PROCEDURE RESOLUTION

From the procedure initiated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: On April 12, 2024, a complaint was filed with the Spanish Data Protection Agency for a possible violation attributable to COMUNIDAD

DE PROPIETARIOS A.A.A. (hereinafter, THE COMMUNITY) with NIF: ***NIF.1.

The facts brought to the attention of this authority are:

That the minutes of the ordinary general meeting, held on August 3, 2023, were still posted as of April 2, 2024, in a locked display case located in the entrance hall of the building, visible to anyone entering the building. Said minutes contain
the last name and initial of the first name, associated with a debt owed by the claimant, who provides a copy of the minutes and photos of the display case, its contents, and location.

Along with the written document, the following are provided:

- Minutes of the ordinary meeting of 3/08/2023.
- 8 photographs showing: the sign for the surveillance camera installed at the entrance, the location of the display case, and its contents (minutes).

SECOND: In accordance with Article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), this complaint was forwarded to THE COMMUNITY for analysis and to inform this Agency within one month of the actions taken to comply with the requirements set forth in the data protection regulations.

The electronic notification of the transfer of the claim, which was made in accordance with the rules established in Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), was not received by the respondent, resulting in the expiration of June 9, 2024. The notification was repeated by certified mail on June 25, 2024, and was again returned due to "incorrect address."

No response has been received to this notification.

THIRD: On July 12, 2024, in accordance with Article 65 of the LOPDGDD (General Law on Public Administrations), the claim was admitted for processing.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/9

FOURTH: On November 28, 2024, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against the respondent, in accordance with Articles 63 and 64 of the LPACAP (Spanish Data Protection Act), for the alleged

violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, classified in Article 83.5.a) of GDPR Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR).

FIFTH: The initiation agreement, sent by registered mail, was not collected by the respondent. The file records the two attempted deliveries dated

11/12/2024 and 12/12/2024, resulting in a no-show at the address. A notice was left in the mailbox for collection at the post office. This notice was not collected by THE COMMUNITY, and therefore, it was published in the BOE (Official State Gazette) on
27/12/2024.

After notification of the aforementioned initiation agreement, in accordance with the rules established in the LPACAP (Statutory Law on Public Administrations), and after the deadline for submitting objections, it has been confirmed that no objections to the initiation of the case have been received by this Agency.

Article 64.2.f) of the LPACAP—a provision of which the respondent was informed

in the agreement opening the procedure—establishes that if no allegations are made within the established period regarding the content of the initiation agreement, when
it contains a precise statement regarding the imputed liability,
it may be considered a proposed resolution. In the present case, the agreement initiating the sanctioning procedure determined the facts that specified the

infraction attributed to the respondent and the sanction that could be imposed. Therefore, taking into consideration
that the respondent has not submitted allegations to the agreement initiating the procedure and in accordance with the provisions of Article 64.2.f) of the LPACAP,
the aforementioned initiation agreement is considered in the present case a proposed resolution.

In light of all the actions taken by the Spanish Data Protection Agency in this proceeding, the following facts are considered proven:

PROVEN FACTS

SOLE: The minutes of the ordinary general meeting, held on August 3, 2023, were posted in a locked display case located in the entrance hall of the building, visible to anyone entering the building, and were still posted as of April 2, 2024. The minutes displayed the claimant's surname and first initial, associated with a debt owed by the claimant.

The claimant provided a copy of the minutes of the ordinary meeting of August 3, 2023, and eight photographs showing the sign for the surveillance camera installed at the entrance, the location of the display case, and the contents of the display case (minutes).

LEGAL FUNDAMENTALS

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/9

I
Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of the GDPR and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on Data Protection), the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

Furthermore, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II
Procedure

Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "Procedures processed by the

Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

The procedure shall have a maximum duration of twelve months from the date
of the initiation agreement. After this period, the procedure shall expire and, consequently, the proceedings shall be archived, in accordance with the provisions of
Article 64 of the LOPDGDD.

III
Preliminary Questions

In this case, in accordance with Articles 4.1 and 4.2 of the GDPR, personal data processing is established, since THE COMMUNITY carries out, among other processing activities, the collection and storage of personal data of natural persons, such as the name, surname, postal address, and debts of residents.

THE COMMUNITY carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller, since it determines the purposes and means of such activity pursuant to Article 4.7 of the GDPR.

IV
Breached obligation. Duty of confidentiality.

Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, in relation to the principle of integrity and confidentiality in data processing, establishes that:

“1. Personal data shall be:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/9

f) processed in such a way as to ensure adequate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, through the application of appropriate technical or organizational measures (integrity and confidentiality).”

The aforementioned confidentiality principle therefore requires the protection of personal data against unauthorized access, use, and disclosure, as Recital 39 of the aforementioned GDPR states:

“[…]Personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures adequate security and confidentiality of personal data, including to prevent unauthorized access to or use of such data and of the equipment used in the processing.”

Law 49/1960, of July 21, on horizontal property, establishes in its Article 19:

- Art. 19.1: “The resolutions of the Board of Owners shall be recorded in a minute book
kept by the Property Registrar in the manner provided by regulations.”

- Art. 19.3: “The minutes of the meetings shall be sent to the owners in accordance

with the procedure established in Article 9.”

Regarding the procedure for sending the minutes to the owners, Article 9.h) second paragraph of the aforementioned Law establishes:

“If, upon attempted summons or notification to the owner, it is impossible to serve it in the place provided in the preceding paragraph, it shall be deemed to have been served by posting

the corresponding notice on the community's notice board, or in a visible place of general use designated for this purpose, with a note stating the date and reasons for this form of notification, signed by the person exercising the functions of community secretary, with the approval of the president. Notification served in this manner shall produce full legal effects within three calendar days.”

In the present case, the residents' names, surnames, postal addresses, and debts have been exposed to third parties, and the file does not contain any information stating the reason for posting the minutes of the Ordinary General Meeting held on August 3, 2023, in the portal's window. Furthermore, the 3-calendar-day deadline for notification of the minutes to be effective has been exceeded, as they were posted from the date of the Ordinary General Meeting (August 3, 2023) to April 2, 2024, as stated by the claimant.

Based on the evidence currently available, the decision to initiate the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, is considered that the disclosure of names, surnames, postal addresses, and debts owed to the community constitutes an alleged violation of the confidentiality principle established in Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR.

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/9

V
Classification of the violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR and classification for the purposes of the statute of limitations

If the aforementioned violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR is confirmed, it could lead to the commission of the violation classified in Article 83.5. a) of the GDPR, which provides:

“Violations of the following provisions shall be punishable, in accordance with paragraph 2, by administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, by an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

a) “The basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9.”

In this regard, Article 71 of the LOPDGDD establishes:

“The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute infringements.”

For the purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 72 of the LOPDGDD “Infringements considered very serious” provides:

“1. Pursuant to Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, violations that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:

a) "The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees established in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)"

VI

Proposed sanction.

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:

“1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for the infringements of this Regulation indicated in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures provided for in

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/9

Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due consideration shall be given to the account:

a) the nature, gravity, and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them;

b) the intentionality or negligence of the breach;

c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects;

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;

e) any previous breaches committed by the controller or processor;

f) the extent of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

h) how the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the (i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have been previously ordered against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with those measures;

(j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42;

(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.

In the present case, taking into consideration the content of the minutes regarding the number of debtors (approximately 12), the information outlined in the president's report on the 2022-2023 financial year accounts, the interventions of other residents, as well as the lack of justification for the public display of said minutes in the portal's display case, and in accordance with the provisions transcribed, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation of the procedure, the initial assessment that reaches the amount of the fine is €1,000, for violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR.

VII

Corrective Measures
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/9

If the violation is confirmed, the resolution issued may establish the corrective measures that the offending entity must adopt to end the breach of personal data protection legislation, in this case Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 58.2.d) of the GDPR, according to which each supervisory authority may "order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period..."

Thus, the responsible entity may be required to bring its actions into compliance with personal data protection regulations, within the scope expressed in the previous Legal Basis.

This document establishes the alleged violation committed and the facts that could lead to this potential violation of data protection regulations. From this, it is clear what measures to be adopted, without prejudice to the specific procedures, mechanisms, or instruments to implement them being the responsibility of the sanctioned party, as the data controller is fully familiar with their organization and must decide, based on proactive responsibility and a risk-based approach, how to comply with the GDPR and the LOPDGDD. However, in this case, regardless of the foregoing, in accordance with the evidence currently available regarding the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, the resolution adopted may require THE COMMUNITY to adopt the following measures within one month from the date of enforcement of the resolution finalizing this procedure:

- Prove that the necessary measures have been adopted to ensure compliance with the provisions of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR and, more specifically, to ensure that the Minutes of the Owners' Meeting are not displayed in view of owners and third parties who access the homes, except in the cases specified in the Horizontal Property Law. If the minutes that gave rise to this procedure are still on display, they must be removed from the display case within one month.

The imposition of this measure is compatible with the sanction consisting of an administrative fine, as provided in Article 5.1.f). 83.2 of the GDPR.

Please note that failure to comply with the possible order to adopt measures imposed by this body in the resolution of this sanctioning procedure may be considered an administrative violation pursuant to the provisions of the GDPR, classified as a violation in Articles 83.5 and 83.6. Such conduct may lead to the opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.

Therefore, in accordance with applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for graduating sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/9

FIRST: TO IMPOSE on the COMMUNITY OF OWNERS A.A.A., with NIF

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to the A.A.A. OWNERS' COMMUNITY.

THIRD: Order the A.A.A. OWNERS' COMMUNITY, with NIF ***NIF.1,
