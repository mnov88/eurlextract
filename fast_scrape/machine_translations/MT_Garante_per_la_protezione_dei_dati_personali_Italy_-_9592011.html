<p>The Italian DPA ordered Associazione Rousseau, the owner of a digital platform for participatory democracy, to give “Movimento 5 Stelle,” a populist political group, access to the personal data of all its members.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) is a populist political group. Because it is not recognized as a political party under Italian law, it organized its almost 200,000 certified members on the M5S digital platform. The digital platform, owned by Associazione Rousseau, is designed to enable participatory democracy. M5S members used the site to vote on budgetary and leadership decisions, for example.  
</p><p>After a political fallout between the leaders of Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) and the Associazione Rousseau, M5S decided to stop using the Rousseau platform. Thereafter, two members of M5S asked Associazione Rousseau to delete their data, but Associazione Rousseau refused to do so. M5S objected and submitted a complaint to the Italian DPA. 
</p><p>M5S claimed that it is the data controller of the M5S digital platform, and that Associazione Rousseau, as the data processor, must comply with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR" title="Article 28 GDPR">Article 28 GDPR</a> by returning all personal data to the data controller. MS5 requested that Associazione Rousseau comply by making the domains of the 'movimento5stelle.it' and 'tirendiconto.it' websites available to M5S and by refraining from any form of processing that is not necessary for the fulfilment of their legal obligations. 
</p><p>M5S further demanded that that Associazione Rousseau return the personal data of all M5S members, explain the methods and security requirements it had for collecting and storing data on M5S members, and explain the precise technical procedures it will use for transferring the data in question.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA ascertained, based on the documentation provided by M5S, that the Associazione Rousseau does indeed fulfil the role of data processor - even if in certain situations it is an autonomous data processor - and that M5S is the data controller for all purposes. 
</p><p>Pursuant to Article <a href="/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR" title="Article 58 GDPR">58(2)(d)</a> of the GDPR, the DPA ordered Associazione Rousseau to comply with the provisions of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR" title="Article 28 GDPR">Article 28(3)(g)</a> of the GDPR by ensuring that all the personal data of the M5S members are given to Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S). The DPA, moreover, granted a maximum period of five days to comply with the injunction.

1) as to the alleged violation of the provisions of art. 28, par. 3, lett. g) of the Regulations, the Rousseau Association "has not refused to adhere to the owner's requests, rather setting the theme (...) of wanting to receive and adhere to instructions given by a person who actually has the ability to express the will of the owner Association some data"; furthermore, "art. 28, par. 3 indeed cited provides that "[the treatments by a manager are governed by a contract or other legal act pursuant to the law of the Union or of the Member States that binds the data controller to the data controller and stipulates the matter governed and the duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and the categories of data subjects, the obligations and rights of the data controller] "and that said contract (which the Associazione Movimento 5 Stelle has not product) may provide, inter alia, as provided therein sub lett. g); consequently, art. 28, par. 3, lett. g) does not establish a principle directly applicable if not transfused into a contract or other legal act under the law of the Union or of the Member States ";

CONSIDERING that, at the state of the documentation, also acquired by the Authority during a previous investigation involving the same subjects, the Movimento 5 Stelle and the Rousseau Association are respectively the owner and manager of the processing of personal data of the members of the Movement (as per the designation deed by Giuseppe Grillo on 25.4.2016);

NOTING that on the occasion of the access request made by Mr. Vito Crimi pursuant to law no. 241/1990 to the documentation relating to the file concerning the violation of the information systems of the so-called Rousseau platform, the Authority deemed it necessary to allow the same access instantly, even as a senior member of the Guarantee Committee pursuant to art. 7, lett. d) of the Statute of the 5 Star Movement Association;

NOTING that according to art. 28, par. 3, lett. g) of the Regulations, the data controller, "at the choice of the data controller", is required to cancel or return all personal data "after the provision of the services relating to the treatment has been completed" and to provide for the cancellation of existing copies " unless the law of the Union or of the Member States provides for the retention of data "; considering that the aforementioned provision must be applied even where the regulatory act of the owner / manager relationship does not expressly provide for it or, as in the case in question, is previous on the date of entry into force of the Regulations (as per the deed of designation of the Rousseau Association as data controller of 25 April 2016); this in order to protect - when a conflictual relationship between the parties arises - the interests of the owner of the treatment and, in particular, of the interested parties who over the years have given their data to the Movimento 5 Stell and on the basis of the information provided by the same;

CONSIDERING that, since it is an undisputed circumstance that the Movement is the data controller, it is therefore undisputed that, in this capacity, it has the right to dispose of the personal data of the members to use them, limited to the pursuit of its purposes. Such data, therefore, can be used for the pursuit of the only institutional purposes of the Movement for which such data have been conferred to it;

CONSIDERING therefore that, with reference to the request for the delivery of personal data of members of the Movement, the conditions are met for a corrective action by the Authority pursuant to art. 58. par. 2, lett. d) of the Regulations; therefore deemed it necessary to order the Rousseau Association to provide, as data processor, to implement the provisions of art. 28, par. 3, lett. g) by delivery to the 5 Star Movement, in the forms and in the manner indicated by the owner himself, of all personal data of the members of the Movement, for which the Association is responsible, within 5 (five) days of receipt of this provision; this without prejudice to the further processing of personal data of those members with respect to whom the Rousseau Association is at the same time independent data controller. Pending delivery to the Movement of the data in question, Associazione Rousseau must refrain from any further processing of the data, except for explicit, specific requests of the Movement;
