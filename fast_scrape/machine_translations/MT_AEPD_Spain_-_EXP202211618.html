<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject was a 4 year old minor, who attended a birthday party at one of the establishments of the controller, Nandivale. The controller posted images showing the faces of children present at the party in the stories of its Instagram profile. 
</p><p>After seeing the stories, the mother of the data sent an Instagram message to the controller, asking it to delete the image. However, the controller did not comply with the request and she filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA, claiming that she never gave her consent for the publication of her child's image. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA stressed that the physical image of a person must be considered as personal data under Article 4(1) GDPR, and thus, it requires a legal ground to be processed. The DPA also emphasized that, in addition to consent, there are other possible bases that legitimize the processing of data without the need for the authorization of the data subject. For instance, when it is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by a third party.  
</p><p>In the present case, the DPA noted that the controller did not inform data subjects about the processing of personal data that it carried out, neither before nor after it took place. In other words, there was no information about the recording of images in parties organized at the controller's venur and their publication on its social media profile. The controller also did not inform if it relied on consent of the parents, in the case of minors under 14 years of age, or the consent of minors, over 14 years of age, differentiating this circumstance. Therefore,the DPA concluded that there was no accredited basis for the processing of minors' personal data and issued a fine of €10,000 for the violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)</a> GDPR.

                                           II
       Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of

                                           II
       The denounced facts materialize in the taking of images of the event in the
containing minors and their publication on the Instagram profile ***PERFIL.1

as a "story", without the consent of their parents being accredited.

       Article 58 of the GDPR, Powers, states:

       "2. Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers
corrections listed below:


       (…)
       i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or in
       instead of the measures mentioned in this paragraph, according to the
       circumstances of each particular case;

       (…)”

       It should be noted that the physical image of a person, according to article 4.1
of the GDPR, it is personal data and its protection, therefore, is the subject of said
Regulation. Article 4.2 of the GDPR defines the concept of "processing" of
personal information.


       It is therefore necessary to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image
of natural persons) carried out through recording and broadcasting, in which
minors appear, in social networks is in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.


       Article 6, Legality of the treatment, of the GDPR in its section 1, establishes
that:

       "1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following is fulfilled
conditions:


       a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his data
       personal for one or more specific purposes;
       b) the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
       interested party or for the application at the request of this of measures
       pre-contractual;

       c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation
       applicable to the data controller;
       d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or
       of another physical person;
       e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in

       public interest or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the person responsible
       of the treatment;
       f) the processing is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests
       pursued by the data controller or by a third party, provided that
       such interests are not overridden by the interests or the rights and freedoms

       of the interested party that require the protection of personal data,
       in particular when the interested party is a child.



C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/11








       The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the
treatment carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions”.


       And article 4 of the GDPR, Definitions, in its sections 1, 2 and 11, states that:

       “1) “personal data” means any information about an identified natural person
or identifiable ("the data subject"); Any identifiable natural person shall be considered
person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular
by means of an identifier, such as a name, an identification number,

location data, an online identifier or one or more elements of the
physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity of said
person;

       "2) "processing": any operation or set of operations carried out

on personal data or sets of personal data, either by procedures
automated or not, such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring,
conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use,
communication by transmission, diffusion or any other form of authorization of
access, collation or interconnection, limitation, deletion or destruction;


       "11) "consent of the interested party": any manifestation of free will,
specific, informed and unequivocal for which the interested party accepts, either through
a statement or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that
concern him."


       On the other hand, article 92 of the LOPDGDD, Data Protection of
minors on the Internet, points out that:

       "Educational centers and any physical or legal persons who
develop activities in which minors participate will guarantee the

protection of the best interests of the minor and their fundamental rights,
especially the right to the protection of personal data, in the publication or
dissemination of your personal data through services of the society of the
information.

       When said publication or diffusion were to take place through services of

social networks or equivalent services must have the consent of the
minor or their legal representatives, in accordance with the provisions of article 7 of this
organic Law".

                                           IV.

       It should be noted that data processing requires the existence of a database
law that legitimizes it.

       In accordance with article 6.1 of the GDPR, in addition to consent,
There are other possible bases that legitimize the processing of data without the need for

have the authorization of its owner, in particular, when necessary for the
execution of a contract in which the affected party is a party or for the application, upon request
of this, of pre-contractual measures, or when necessary for the satisfaction of
legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/11








provided that such interests do not prevail over the interests or rights and
fundamental freedoms of the data subject that require the protection of such data. He
treatment is also considered lawful when necessary for the fulfillment of

a legal obligation applicable to the data controller, to protect interests
of the data subject or of another natural person or for the fulfillment of a mission
carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of public powers vested in the
responsible for the treatment.

       In the present case, the defendant in relation to the processing of personal data

personal character, neither before nor after the infringement, nor in
its Privacy Policy or in the Risk Analysis provides for the treatment carried out
cabo: disseminate or publish images of the celebrations on social networks.

       On the other hand, regarding the publication of images, it is not specified

where it is provided (web page of the defendant, social networks, etc.) and as soon as
to the consent that they transfer in their response, nothing indicates about this treatment
specifically, if you collect parental consent in the case of children under 14
years or the consent to minors, over 14 years of age, differentiating this
circumstance of age (Neither does it appear in the case of adults if it is collected
their consent for the publication of their images, etc.).


       Therefore, in the case examined, there is no accredited basis of legitimacy
any for the treatment of data of minors.

                                           V

       The infringement attributed to the defendant is typified in the
Article 83.5 a) of the GDPR, which considers that the infringement of "the basic principles
for processing, including the conditions for consent under the terms of the
Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9" is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned
Article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, "with administrative fines of €20,000,000 as

maximum or, in the case of a company, of an amount equivalent to 4% as
maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the previous financial year,
opting for the one with the highest amount”.

       The LOPDGDD in its article 71, Violations, states that: "They constitute
offenses the acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the

Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to the
present organic law”.

       And in its article 72, it considers for the purposes of prescription, which are: "Infractions
considered very serious:


       1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
particular, the following:

       conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
       Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

       (…)”

       damages they have suffered;
       b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

       c) any measure taken by the controller or processor
       to alleviate the damages and losses suffered by the interested parties;
       d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or the person in charge of the
       processing, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have
       applied under articles 25 and 32;

       e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or in charge of the
       treatment;
       f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put
       remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach;
       g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
       h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in

       particularly if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such a case,

       In relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the GDPR, the LOPDGDD, in its
Article 76, "Sanctions and corrective measures", establishes that:

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/11








       "2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of the Regulation (EU)

aggravated by the category of data processed, since the image that is disseminated is of
minors (article 83.2.g) of the GDPR).

        The intentionality or negligence in the infraction. Connected this circumstance

with the degree of diligence that the data controller is obliged to
deploy in compliance with the obligations imposed by the regulations of
Data Protection; the SAN of 10/17/2007 can be cited, which although it was issued before
