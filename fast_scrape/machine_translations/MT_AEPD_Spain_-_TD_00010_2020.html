<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The complainant terminated his contractual relationship with Vodafone España in 2017, but continued to receive emails from the latter stating that invoices had been issued in his name. The complainant then filed a complaint with the AEPD in 2019 on the basis that he had been unable to exercise his right to oppose the processing of his personal data, as protected under Article 21 GDPR. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Did Vodafone España violate the complainant's rights under Article 21 by continuing to issue the invoices?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD held that complaint was valid, as the complainant's right to object had not been met. The AEPD ordered Vodafone España to comply with Article 21 and stop the processing within ten working days following notification of this decision. If Vodafone España decided not to comply, they would have to give reasons for continuing to process the complainant's personal data. The AEPD concluded that failure to do one of these actions would result in further sanctioning of Vodafone España by the AEPD pursuant to Article 72(1)(m).
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>The AEPD does not specify the provision of Article 21 on which it bases its decision. Article 21 GDPR states that the data subject either has the right to object if the processing uses the legal bases of public or legitimate interest (Article 21(1)), or if the personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes (Article 21(2)). 
</p><p>However the question of whether either of these provisions apply in this case, which would confirm whether Article 21 definitively applies at all, is never examined by the AEPD.

SECOND: Article 64.1 of the LOPDGDD, provides the following: "1. When the procedure refers exclusively to the lack of attention to a request to exercise the rights established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, it will be initiated by an agreement of admission to procedure, which will be adopted in accordance with the provisions of the following article.   Once this period has elapsed, the interested party may consider his claim to have been accepted".

THIRD: Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, General Data Protection (GDPR), provides that: 
"1. The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide interested parties with any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and any communication pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to the processing in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using plain and simple language, in particular any information specifically addressed to a child. At the request of the data subject, the information may be provided orally provided that the identity of the data subject is established by other means.2. In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), the controller shall not refuse to act at the request of the data subject for the purpose of exercising his rights under Articles 15 to 22, unless he can prove that he is not able to identify the data subject.3. The controller shall provide the data subject with information concerning his or her actions on the basis of a request pursuant to Articles 15 to 22, and in any case within one month of receipt of the request.   That period may be extended by a further two months if necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The person responsible shall inform the applicant of any such extension within one month of receipt of the application, stating the reasons for the delay. Where the applicant submits the application by electronic means, the information shall be provided by electronic means where possible, unless the applicant requests otherwise.4 If the data controller does not comply with the request of the data subject, he shall inform the data subject without delay, and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request, of the reasons for his failure to act and of the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and of taking legal action.5   The information provided under Articles 13 and 14 as well as any communication and any action taken under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 shall be free of charge.

The information to be provided to data subjects under Articles 13 and 14 may be transmitted in combination with standardised icons which provide an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible overview of the intended processing. Icons presented in electronic form shall be mechanically legible.8 The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 92 to specify the information to be displayed by means of icons and the procedures for providing standardised icons.”

FOURTH: Article 12 of the LOPDGDD determines the following:
1.	The rights recognised in Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU)2016/679, may be exercised directly or through a legal or voluntary representative.2 The data controller shall be obliged to inform the data subject of the means available to him/her to exercise the rights to which he/she is entitled. The means must be easily accessible to the data subject.   The exercise of the right may not be denied on the sole ground that the data subject has opted for otromedio.3. The person in charge may process, on behalf of the person responsible, the requests for the exercise of his rights made by the affected parties if this is established in the contract or legal act that binds them.4.   When the laws applicable to certain processing operations establish a special regime affecting the exercise of the rights provided for in Chapter III of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the provisions of those laws shall apply.6.   In any case, the holders of parental authority may exercise the rights of access, rectification, cancellation, opposition or any other rights that may correspond to them in the context of this organic law in the name and on behalf of minors under fourteen years of age.
FIFTH: Article 18 of the GDPR, which refers to the right to limit processing, provides that: 
"1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the limitation of the processing of the data where one of the following conditions is met: (a) the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the data; (b) the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the limitation of their use; (c) the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but the data subject needs them for the formulation, exercise or defence of complaints 2. Where the processing of personal data has been restricted by virtue of paragraph 1, such data may be processed, with the exception of their retention, only with the consent of the data subject or for the purpose of lodging, exercising or defending complaints or for the protection of the rights of any other natural or legal person or for reasons of substantial public interest of the Union or of a Member State. 3   Any data subject who has obtained a restriction to processing pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be informed by the controller before the restriction is lifted.”

SIXTH: Article 21 of the GDPR, which refers to the right of objection, provides that: 
'1. The data subject shall have the right to object at any time on grounds relating to his particular situation to the processing of personal data relating to him which is based on Article 6(1)(e) or (f), including profiling on the basis of those provisions. The controller shall cease to process personal data unless he establishes compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the lodging, pursuit or defence of complaints. Where the processing of personal data has as its purpose direct marketing, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data relating to him/her, including profiling insofar as it relates to such marketing. Where the data subject objects to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes. No later than the time of the first communication with the data subject, the right referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be explicitly mentioned to the data subject and shall be clearly presented in addition to any other information. In the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding the provisions of Directive 2002/58/EC, the data subject may exercise his right to object by automated means applying technical specifications. 6. Where personal data are processed for the purposes of scientific or historical research or statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1), the data subject shall have the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to the processing of personal data concerning him or her, except where such processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.”
SEVENTH: In the case analyzed here, the complainant requests the right to oppose the processing of his personal data.             The claimant proves that he has requested the right and provides a document dated June 24, 2019, in which the stamp of receipt of the claimant appears.             Also from this Agency the claim was transferred having the certification of the Folder or DEH as a proof of the reception by the claimant, in spite of which and only after the admission to procedure, the claimant replies to say that he has not received the claim.

Therefore, the claim should be upheld as the right has not been met. 
In view of the above and other generally applicable provisions, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency hereby RESOLVES:

The actions carried out as a result of this Resolution must be communicated to this Agency within the same period of time.   Failure to comply with this resolution could lead to the commission of the infringement considered in article 72.1.m) of the LOPDGDD, which will be sanctioned, in accordance with article 58.2 of the RGPD.SECOND: NOTICE this resolution to Mr. A.A.A. and VODAFONE ESPAÑA,S.A.U.
