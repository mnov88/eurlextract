<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The claimant filed a complaint against The Washpoint SL on the basis that the company's website did not have a Privacy Notice nor a Cookie Notice.
</p><p>The Spanish DPA (AEPD) when to verify the claims and highlighted that it was proven that, with regards to the Privacy Policy, there was no link to any document or page outlining this. There is therefore no information provided on processing of the users' personal data.
</p><p>With regards to the Cookie Policy, the Spanish DPA also confirmed that there was no mechanism to reject cookies in the second layer of the Cookie Policy. There was only information available on how the user can configure browser settings in their terminal equipment.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Does the lack of a Privacy Policy lead to a violation of Article 13 GDPR?
</p><p>Does the absence of a reject button in the second layer of the cookie policy lead to a violation of Article 22(2) LSSI?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>In relation to the Privacy Policy, the Spanish DPA (AEPD) held that there was a possibility for The Washpoint SL to collect information concerning the users' personal data. However, due to the lack of a link to any Privacy Policy or information on the processing of the users' personal data, the DPA held that there was a violation of Article 13 GDPR. 
</p><p>In relation to the missing reject button from the second layer of the Cookie Policy, the Spanish DPA held that this constituted a violation of Article 22(2) of the Spanish Law on services of the information society and electronic commerce (LSSI). 
</p><p>The DPA considered that the lack of a information or a privacy policy in breach of Article 13 GDPR should be sanctioned with a fine of €1000. Additionally, the DPA held that the violation of Article 22(2) LSSI due to the lack of a reject button in the cookie banner should be sanctioned with a fine of €1000 as well. Therefore, the overall fine imposed on The Washpoint SL amounted to €2000.
