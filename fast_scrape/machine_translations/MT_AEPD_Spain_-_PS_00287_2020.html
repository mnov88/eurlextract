       First of all, article 5 of the RGPD establishes the principles that must be
govern the processing of personal data and mention among them that of "integrity and

       The aforementioned article points out that:

       "1. The personal data will be:

       (…)

       f) treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate security of the
       personal data, including protection against unauthorized processing or

of the duties of professional secrecy in accordance with its applicable regulations.

       3. The obligations established in the previous sections will be maintained
even when the relationship of the obligated party with the person in charge or manager has ended

                                               IV
       The documentation in the file shows that the defendant,
violated article 5 of the RGPD, principles relating to treatment, in relation to the
Article 5 of the LOPGDD, duty of confidentiality, by allowing access to the
claimant to the personal data of a third person when accessing their account

user in perfumespremium.es where the personal data of another client appear.

       This duty of confidentiality, previously the duty of secrecy, must

any phase of the treatment and complementary to the duty of professional secrecy.


                                               V
       Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of "the principles

mentioned article 83 of the aforementioned RGPD, “with administrative fines of € 20,000,000
at most or, in the case of a company, of an amount equivalent to 4% as
maximum total annual global business volume of the previous financial year,

opting for the highest amount ”.

       On the other hand, the LOPDGDD, for prescription purposes, in its article 72 indicates:
"Violations considered very serious:

       1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)

2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
in particular, the following:

       a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees

established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
       (…) "

                                                SAW
       Second, it should be noted that the security of personal data
It is regulated in articles 32, 33 and 34 of the RGPD.


          Article 32 of the RGPD "Security of treatment", establishes that:

        "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of

variable probability and severity for people's rights and freedoms
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical measures and
appropriate organizational arrangements to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,
that in your case include, among others:


       a) pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;
       b) the ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability and
       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
       c) the ability to restore availability and access to data
       personnel quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
       d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness

       of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the safety of the
       treatment.

       2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particularly the
take into account the risks presented by the data processing, in particular as

consequence of accidental or illegal destruction, loss or alteration of data
personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to such data.

       3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved in accordance with article 40 or to a

certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the
this article.

       4. The controller and the data controller will take measures to
ensure that any person acting under the authority of the controller or the
manager and have access to personal data can only process said data

following instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the
Law of the Union or of the Member States ”.

       The violation of article 32 of the RGPD is typified in article
83.4.a) of the aforementioned RGPD in the following terms:


       "4. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 10 000 000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:


       a) the obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to articles 8,
       11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43.
       (…) "



       For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 71, Infractions, states that:
“The acts and conducts referred to in sections 4, constitute offenses.
5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those resulting
contrary to the present organic law ”.


       And in its article 73, for the purposes of prescription, it qualifies as "Infractions
considered serious ”:

       "Based on the provisions of article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
are considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a

substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

       (…)
       g) The breach, as a consequence of the lack of due diligence,
       of the technical and organizational measures that have been implemented in accordance with

       as required by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ”.
       (…) "

       The facts revealed in this claim materialize
in the access to the personal data of a third person user client of the

claimed when accessing your account in perfumespremium.es violating the measures
technical and organizational.

                                           VII
       The GDPR defines personal data security breaches as

“All those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or
accidental or illegal alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or processed
otherwise, or unauthorized communication or access to said data ”.


C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/11








       From the documentation in the file, it is proven that the claimed person has
Article 32 of the RGPD has been violated, when a security incident occurs in your
system allowing access to personal data of third parties, when accessing your account
the claimant in perfumespremium.es, where the data of another
customer with breach of security measures.


       It should be noted that the RGPD in the aforementioned precept does not establish a list of
the security measures that are applicable according to the data that are
object of treatment, but establishes that the person in charge and the person in charge of the
treatment will apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk
involved in the treatment, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of

application, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, the risks of
probability and seriousness for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.

       Likewise, security measures must be adequate and
proportionate to the risk detected, noting that the determination of the measures

technical and organizational must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymisation and
encryption, the ability to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, and
resilience, the ability to restore availability and access to data after a
incident, verification process (not audit), evaluation and assessment of the
effectiveness of the measures.


       In any case, when evaluating the adequacy of the security level, the
particularly take into account the risks presented by data processing, such as
consequence of accidental or illegal destruction, loss or alteration of data
personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data and that could cause damages
physical, material or immaterial.


       In this same sense, recital 83 of the RGPD states that:

       “(83) In order to maintain security and prevent the treatment from infringing the
provided in this Regulation, the person in charge or the person in charge must evaluate
the risks inherent to the treatment and apply measures to mitigate them, such as the

encryption. These measures must guarantee an adequate level of security, including the
confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of its application
with respect to the risks and the nature of the personal data that must
protect yourself. When assessing risk in relation to data security, you should
take into account the risks arising from the processing of personal data,
such as accidental or illegal destruction, loss or alteration of personal data

transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or communication or access does not
authorized to said data, susceptible in particular to cause damages
physical, material or immaterial ”.

       In the present case, as stated in the facts and in the framework of the

investigation file E / 03847/2020, the AEPD transferred to the defendant the
06/04/2020, the claim submitted for analysis requesting the contribution of
information related to the incident claimed, without it having been received in this
body any response.


C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/11








       The responsibility of the claimed person is determined by the incidence of
security demonstrated by the claimant, since he is responsible for taking
decisions aimed at effectively implementing technical measures and

appropriate organizational arrangements to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk
to ensure the confidentiality of the data, restoring its availability and preventing
access to them in the event of a physical or technical incident. However, from the
documentation provided it is clear that the entity has not only breached this
obligation, but also the adoption of measures in this regard is unknown, despite
of having given him transfer of the claim presented.


       In accordance with the foregoing, it is estimated that the claimed would be
also allegedly responsible for the violation of the RGPD: the violation of the
article 32, offense typified in article 83.4.a).


                                           VIII

       b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

        or indirectly, through the infringement.

"Sanctions and corrective measures", establishes that:


        "two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU)
2016/679 may also be taken into account:

        of personal data.
        c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the offense.

        cases in which there are controversies between those and any
        interested."

        In accordance with the transcribed precepts, in order to set the amount of the
sanction to be imposed in the present case for the offense typified in article 83.5.a)

of the RGPD for which the claimed person is responsible, the
following factors:

        The scope in a local environment of the treatment carried out by the entity
