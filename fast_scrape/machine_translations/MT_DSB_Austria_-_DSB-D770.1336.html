<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A data subject received a letter from the umbrella association of Austrian social insurance institutions - the controller - suggesting him to show up for an appointment for a vaccine against covid-19. The data subject believed that the letter had been sent to him on the basis of unlawful processing of his personal data by the controller. He thus filed a complaint with the Austrian DPA (<i>Datenschutzbehörde, DSB</i>) on 23 December 2021, asking the DSB to prohibit such processing and impose a fine on the controller. 
</p><p>Given the high number of similar complaints, the DSB took for granted that the umbrella association was the controller and asked it to provide its submission on the matter. 
</p><p>On 14 January 2022, the controller submitted as sole controller it sent letters about the possibility of getting a covid-19 vaccine to those people who had not been vaccinated before a certain date. In the controller’s view, this was legitimate as it occurred on the basis of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=10008147">§ 750(1a) and (2) of the Austrian General Law on Social Insurance (ASVG)</a>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>First of all, the DSB considered that the controller in this case is an entity under public law. The controller checked the central vaccination register whether the data subject had been vaccinated against covid-19 before 22 November 2021, and, as he had not, the controller retrieved the address of the data subject from the central patient register and sent him the letter. 
</p><p>The DSB also found that the sending of the letter with information about the risk of covid-19 and a suggestion of an appointment for a free vaccine were not unlawfully transmitted to third parties, in this case, a printing service provider. As a matter of fact, the latter, as a processor, later confirmed deletion of the data. 
</p><p>Further, the DSB concluded that, since the controller is a public entity acting in accordance with <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=10008147">§ 750(1a) and (2) ASVG</a>, this justified a restriction of the right to data protection under <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1999_1_165/ERV_1999_1_165.pdf">§1(2) DSG</a>, in compliance with <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf">Article 8(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (CFREU)</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1e" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(e) GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>The DSB thus rejected the whole complaint as unfounded, since no rasons for ordering to cease processing nor to impose a fine on the controller were given.

2. the authorization to access ELGA must be entered separately.

(9) Ten years after knowing the date of death of an ELGA participant, the umbrella organization must automatically delete the data of the deceased stored in the patient index.

In the matter:

The fundamental right to data protection enshrined in § 1 DSG, according to the first paragraph of which everyone has a right to confidentiality of personal data concerning them, in particular with regard to respect for their private and family life, insofar as there is a legitimate interest in doing so, includes the protection of the Those affected before their data is determined and the data determined about them is passed on. The fundamental right to data protection enshrined in paragraph one of the DSG, according to the first paragraph of which everyone, especially with regard to respect for their private and family life, has a right to confidentiality the personal data concerned, insofar as there is an interest worthy of protection, includes the protection of the data subject from the determination of his or her data and the disclosure of the data determined about him or her.

However, the fundamental right to data protection is not absolute, but may be limited by certain, permissible interventions. According to Section 1 Para. 2 DSG, restrictions on the right to secrecy are only permissible to protect the overriding legitimate interests of another, provided that the use of personal data is not in the vital interest of the person concerned or with his or her consent, whereby the fundamental right to data protection applies in the event of interference However, this is not absolute, but may be limited by certain, permissible interventions. According to paragraph one, paragraph 2, DSG, restrictions on the right to secrecy are only permissible to protect the overriding legitimate interests of another, insofar as the use of personal data is not in the vital interest of the person concerned or with his or her consent, whereby in the event of intervention by a state authority may only be carried out on the basis of laws which are necessary for the reasons stated in Article 8 Paragraph 2 ECHR. which are necessary for the reasons stated in Article 8 Paragraph 2 ECHR.

As established, the respondent, who is a corporation under public law, processed the processing as an authority within the meaning of Section 1 Para The processing in question is to be qualified as an authority within the meaning of paragraph one, paragraph 2, DSG, see Pollirer/Weiss/Knyrim, Data Protection Act2 § 1 Note 13), for the purpose of sending an information letter regarding the risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 and the possibility of receiving a free vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, the complainant's data from the central vaccination register and their own data, specifically from the central patient index. Paragraph one, note 13), for the purpose of sending an information letter regarding the risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 and the possibility of receiving free vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, the complainant's data from the central vaccination register and his or her own data , specifically from the central patient index.

Since the respondent was able to rely in this context on Section 750 Paragraph 1a and Paragraph 2 ASVG and thus on a fundamental encroachment in accordance with Section 1 Paragraph 2 DSG, the complaint turned out to be unfounded, which is why it was filed in accordance with Section 24 Paragraph. 5 DSG Since the respondent was able to rely in this context on paragraph 750, paragraph one a and paragraph 2, ASVG and thus on a fundamental encroachment in accordance with paragraph one, paragraph 2, DSG, the complaint has proven to be unfounded, which is why it is filed in accordance with Paragraph 24, paragraph 5, DSG had to be rejected.

D2. On the request for a ban on data processing

Insofar as the complainant requested that the data protection authority prohibit the respondent from processing his data in accordance with Section 22 Paragraph 4 of the Data Protection Act, it should first be noted that the prerequisite for such a prohibition is the existence of a significant Paragraph 4, DSG prohibits the respondent from processing his data, it should first be pointed out that the prerequisite for such a prohibition is the existence of a significant immediate danger, i.e. “imminent danger”. However, since the processing in question had already been completed at the time the complaint was lodged, for this reason alone it can no longer be assumed that there is any significant immediate danger or that there is “imminent danger”, which is why the prerequisites for a prohibition in accordance with Section 22 Paragraph 4 of the Data Protection Act also include danger or . “Imminent danger” can no longer be assumed, which is why the requirements for a prohibition in accordance with paragraph 22, paragraph 4, DSG were not met.

The application in this regard was therefore rejected.

D3. On the application for the imposition of a fine

To the extent that the complainant requested that the data protection authority impose a fine on the respondent, it should be noted that no fine can be imposed on a person responsible as part of an administrative procedure. While no subjective right to initiate criminal proceedings against a certain person responsible can be derived from Art. 77 Para. 1 GDPR or Section 24 Para. Fister in To the extent that the complainant requested that the data protection authority impose a fine on the respondent, it should be noted that no fine can be imposed on a controller in the context of an administrative procedure. While from Article 77, paragraph one, GDPR or paragraph 24, paragraph one, and 5 DSG no subjective right to initiate criminal proceedings against a certain person responsible can be derived; in this regard, according to paragraph 25, paragraph one, VStG, the principle of official authority applies, see Fister in Lewisch/Fister/Weilguni (eds), VStG Commentary 2 [2017 ] § 25 Rz 1), it should also be noted that, according to § 30 Para. 5 DSG, no fines can be imposed on corporations under public law. [2017] Paragraph 25, paragraph 1), it should also be noted that, according to paragraph 30, paragraph 5, DSG, no fines can be imposed on public corporations.

The application in this regard was therefore rejected.

It had to be decided according to the saying.
