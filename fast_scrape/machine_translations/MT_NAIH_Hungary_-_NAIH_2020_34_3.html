<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The complainant was employed as a civil servant, but his employment was terminated in February 2019. The complainant knew of his termination four months in advance (October 2018), and so filed an employment law action in early November 2018. 
</p><p>In the course of the employment law proceedings, the complainant sought access to the entire 2018 archive of his email account on a CD, which included partly private letters, correspondence concerning with publishers from certain publications regarding to the complainant's research and letters regarding other applications and the complainants' doctoral training. 
</p><p>The respondents rejected the complainant's reasons for the requests, stating that no interest would justify the complainant's access to the mail account again as a former civil servant. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Did the complainant have a right of access under Article 15 GDPR? 
By denying the complainant access, did the respondent infringe Articles 12(1) or 12(2) GDPR?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The NAIH that the complainant's right of access could only be partly upheld.
</p><p>In particular, given the volume of emails requested and the complainant's failure to specify which emails they required, the NAIH held that pursuant to Recital 63 GDPR, the complainant should have specified to which emails the request related and that the respondent could legitimately refuse the complainant access to the entire archive of emails from 2018.
</p><p>However, the NAIH also held that the application of Recital 63 did not deny the complainant access to all of his letters and correspondence. The NAIH noted that the respondents could have asked the complainant to clarify which emails he specifically required, or they could have sorted the letters into private and business categories. On this basis, the NAIH decided that the respondents had failed to provide the complainant with adequate and transparent information on accessing his private letters pursuant to Article 12(1). Subsequently, the NAIH held that the respondents had infringed Article 12(2) as they failed to facilitate the exercise of the complainant's data rights under Article 15.

REASONS. 

Procedure and clarification of the facts

I. 1. By letter received on 7 November 2019, the Applicant applied to the Authority, in vain to request the Applicant, on 6 February 2019, to access his work e-mail account after the termination of his employment as a civil servant [...] 2018 . The Applicant requested the Authority to initiate a data protection authority procedure for the issuance of the Applicant's e-mails, including his official and semi-official archives with the management.

I. 2. In its order to initiate the data protection authority procedure, the Authority notified the Applicant and, in order to clarify the facts, called for a statement and disclosure of information. The termination date was 9 February 2019. Following the termination, the Applicant filed an employment lawsuit against the Applicant on 9 November 2018 for the legal consequences of the unlawful termination of the employment relationship, in which the appellant brought action.

During the labor lawsuit, on February 6, 2019, the Applicant submitted a request in which he wanted to receive the 2018 letters from the Applicant on a CD in order to obtain his e-mails about scientific publications and announcements related to research related to his employment. According to the Applicant's letter to the Applicant, he would have needed partly private letters containing the IDs, passwords, passwords to the journals, submission time, name of the journal and persons and information related to the application of university teaching aids in various companies. According to his statement to the Authority, he specifically wanted to receive letters concerning communications and scientific publications, scientific activity and contracts, as well as correspondence with publishers which the Applicant stated he had received at his Representation. According to the Applicant's statement, he also wanted to have access to the letters he received regarding the applications he received and the doctoral training. you should also arrange for it to be delivered to colleagues.

According to the Applicant's statement dated 29 November 2019, the archive of the e-mail account, although it has deleted most of them, may contain a small number of private letters. The Authority's request was addressed mainly to its internal correspondence, official and semi-official letters to management. However, the Authority notes that the The applicant would not accept the reasons given by the Applicant for his access to his e-mails, as he considered that the Applicant, as a university, should who takes over the duties of his former civil servant and in what way, so there is no interest on the Applicant's page that would justify the Applicant's access to the mail account again as a former civil servant. Given that the Applicant's employment as a civil servant has been terminated, the Applicant's Declaration does not allow him to indicate the Applicant in his scientific publications, so there is no interest on the Applicant's side referred to by the However, in view of the fact that an employment lawsuit was pending and that the Applicant could not identify the personal data, such as scientific publications, which the Applicant had requested to be disclosed, the Data Controller could not comply with his request.



According to the Applicant's Declaration, the use of the electronic mail system for private purposes was not regulated in any way at the time of the Applicant's civil service relationship, therefore the Applicant could use or use it for private purposes in accordance with its declaration. Thus, in the absence of appropriate internal regulations, the Applicant did not receive any specific information, however, in accordance with Article II of the [...] Organizational and Operational Regulations. Pursuant to the last sentence of Section 36 (2) of the Employment Requirements System, the Applicant should have cease.

The Applicant also requested that if it is established in the data protection authority proceedings that the Applicant has committed an infringement and the Authority considers that a fine is justified, the Authority should note that the Applicant has committed an infringement for the first time since the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation. Your application has not yet been convicted of a breach of the General Data Protection Regulation. The Applicant regulated the issues examined in the data protection authority procedure in full, in detail, informed its employees about the established norm, the adopted data management and data protection regulations, and also informed the public employees about the data management in the use of their e-mail account. The Application was the subject of an employment lawsuit between the Applicant, due to which the Applicant's interest justified that the Applicant, as a former civil servant, should not have access to his correspondence, as this would have provided an opportunity to even remove evidence that could be used in the lawsuit. Irrespective of the lawsuit, the protection of the data controller's financial and economic interests and business secrets justified the non-disclosure of any data due to the termination of the Applicant's civil servant status.

According to the Applicant's statement, the Applicant justified the reopening of his / her e-mail account in his / her application to the Applicant on the grounds that there was a university interest in publishing the publications (scientific publications) he / she wanted to obtain. However, in view of the fact that the legal relationship of the Applicant as a civil servant has been terminated, he / she may not indicate the Applicant in his / her future publications and scientific publications, so the Applicant's interest referred to by the Applicant does not exist. In addition, in the Applicant's view, the Applicant could reasonably be expected to have its communications available on other media. The other reason cited by him, according to which various software related to his legal relationship and job is sent to this e-mail address, is not an appropriate reason, as they are the property of the Applicant, to which the Applicant as a former civil servant has no connection. The Applicant could get acquainted with the letters received at this e-mail address, related to the legal relationship of the Applicant as a former civil servant, and took care of the related work.

The Applicant also requested the Authority to take into account that no pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage had occurred on the Applicant's side and that the Applicant's employment relationship had been terminated with an exemption which he became aware of four months before the actual termination, thus: you had the option to redirect, save, delete, or perform any other operation on your private mail. According to the Applicant's Declaration, he is also fully open to the transmission of the Applicant's private letters, provided that he indicates the e-mails from which he has requested and to which he is sent, indicating that he is requesting access to or publication of correspondence for the entire term or for a specified period. , and indicating the medium on which you request the data to be sent and whether the data is to be transmitted to yourself or another data controller.

However, the Applicant stated all this to the Authority, in an e-mail sent to the Applicant on 25 February 2019, denying the Applicant access to his archived e-mails in 2018 only on the grounds that, unless his / her data protection officer was interest does not justify it, we cannot allow it. He is no longer entitled to act or work on behalf of [...], so his correspondence in the course of his university work belongs to [...]. Such an edition could not work independently of the GDPR, and it has been less so since then. ”

III. Decision

III. 1. General remarks
According to the definitions of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data content of the workplace e-mail account provided to the employee is considered personal data, and any operations performed on the personal data are considered data processing. A separate issue is that personal data and data processing are related only to the work, its purposes, or for private purposes, which may be relevant in assessing the identity of the data controller or the lawfulness of the data processing.

In the present case, based on the statements and the attached documents, it can be stated that the use of the electronic mail system by the Applicant was not regulated, so the so-called “corporate e-mail account” used by the Applicant In the event that the employee uses the e-mail account, regardless of whether the employer otherwise prohibits or authorizes private use, he / she also performs data management activities with regard to the personal data stored in it.

If the data processing is related to the performance of work, it is done for that purpose, the employee essentially acts on behalf of the employer as a data controller, and this activity as a data processing activity can also be attributed to the employer. The fact that this data management a
in the case of persons other than the employee, an independent issue and liability for possible illegality depends on the in the case of third parties, the employer is primarily responsible under the relevant civil law rules.

With regard to the employee's own personal data, as long as the data processing takes place in connection with the performance of the work, the legal basis for the data processing in the case of an employment relationship is first and foremost the employment contract, and the data processing must be assessed accordingly. However, as in the present case, where the body performing a public interest task is a data controller, the legal basis for the processing is the legal basis under Article 6 (1) (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation, according to which the processing of personal data is lawful. if the data processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of a public authority conferred on the data controller.

However, if handles its own personal data and, in most cases, other third parties, the situation is no longer so clear. In this case, the purpose of the data processing is not determined by the employer, but by the employee, who thus becomes the data controller himself with regard to the personal data of third parties in relation to data processing in no way related to his work. He decides on the transfer of personal data to the e-mail account, and as long as he has the account in his possession, he can decide on its deletion and other use. However, with regard to this personal data, the operation of the system remains the task and competence of the employer, and the employer does not lose the right to dispose of the e-mail account containing personal data, who therefore remains the data controller for private data.


The employer's quality as a data controller cannot be questioned in this case either, because private use is not prohibited and, as a result, personal data in connection with other data processing for employee purposes may be added to the e-mail account used by the employer for data processing purposes. , which, on the one hand, are actually obtained through persons acting in relation to their own data processing. On the other hand, due to the circumstances of the data management, it is actually possible to process personal data in the e-mail account that does not actually show any connection with the data management for the purpose it controls - which can almost never be ruled out in a workplace e-mail account or mobile phone. and, in the case of other computer equipment provided as a work tool, although in most cases it may be expected to be expected by the employer, all data management activities carried out in the context of fulfilling its own data management requirements necessarily cover (primarily store) these data, and have access to such personal data in the performance of its tasks necessary to ensure the lawfulness of its own data processing.

It should also be noted that, as far as the employee is concerned, the processing of such data stored in the e-mail account solely for his or her private interest, ie for private purposes, as well as for personal or domestic purposes, falls outside the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation. this may not be the case for the employer. In such cases, therefore, a very specific joint data management situation arises, in which case the employer is in any case considered a data controller and the employee is not, in the legal sense at least, necessarily.

In addition to the above, it is also important that, due to the legal relationship between the employer and the employee, the employer has the primary responsibility for the lawfulness of the data processing, as the
the means (internal regulatory and technical operational measures) to ensure legality are available in the first instance. Thus, it is his responsibility to recognize this situation and to deal with it with appropriate employer measures, such as agreeing on the details of data processing in the case of joint data processing, and regulating the responsibilities related to data processing (essentially in accordance with Article 26 of the General Data Protection Regulation).

In the light of the above, the processing of the personal data of an employee who, in addition to using the e-mail account for work purposes, uses the e-mail account provided by his employer for private purposes should also be assessed. compliance with data protection requirements in this respect should be assessed in accordance with the above.

III. 2. The applicant's right of access 

Under the right of access under Article 15 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data subject has the right to receive feedback from the controller as to whether the processing of his or her personal data is in progress and, if such processing is in progress, to gain access to your personal data and data management information. The obligations of the data controller regarding the way in which the data management information is provided are detailed in Article 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation. On this basis, information on personal data should be provided in a concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible form, in a clear and comprehensible manner. The information must be provided in writing or otherwise. Pursuant to Article 12 (3) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the controller must provide information on the action taken on the request for access to personal data without undue delay and in any case within one month of receipt of the request. If necessary, this period may be extended by a further two months, which shall inform the controller of the fact of the extension and the reasons for the delay within one month of receipt of the request.


Pursuant to Article 12 (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation, if the controller does not act on the request, he must inform the data subject without delay, but no later than one month after receipt of the request, of the reasons for the failure to act. Pursuant to Article 12 (5) of the General Data Protection Regulation, requests relating to the rights of data subjects, such as the action taken on a request for access to personal data and information thereon, must in principle be provided free of charge. to assure. If the data subject's request is manifestly unfounded or, due to its particularly repetitive nature, excessive, the controller may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on the request, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the requested information or action or taking the requested action. However, the burden of proving that the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive is on the controller.

It should be emphasized that the data subject can only access his or her personal data in the context of his or her right of access. The Authority shall act in accordance with Annex III to this Decision. Stated in paragraph 1 that the data content of the work e-mail account provided to the employee, although classified as personal data, is a separate issue, whether the personal data or data processing is related only to work, its purposes or for private purposes, as related letters, such as letters containing business secrets, are protected and therefore, in the event of termination of the employment relationship of the data subject, his / her full e-mail cannot be disclosed.

It follows from recital 63 of the GSP This right shall not prejudice the rights and freedoms of others, including trade secrets or intellectual property, and in particular copyright, which protects software. If the controller handles a large amount of information about the data subject, he or she may ask the data subject to specify, before disclosing the information, which information or data processing activities his or her request relates to.

In the present case, the Applicant wished to have access to his personal data, to the entire 2018 archive of his e-mail account via a CD, when his legal relationship with the Applicant had already ceased. From this archive he wished to access his work-related letters, according to his declarations. Within this, he would have needed letters, partly private, containing the IDs, passwords, passwords for journals, time of submission, name of the journal, and persons and information related to the application of university teaching aids at various companies. In addition, he specifically requested to receive letters concerning certain publications and scientific publications, scientific activity and contracts, as well as correspondence with publishers which he had received at the Applicant's Office, as well as letters concerning his applications and doctoral training. However, it did not specify exactly which of its e-mails it needed. In the Authority's view, in this case the Applicant could legitimately refuse the Applicant access to the entire archive of e-mails in 2018, since, subject to recital (63) of the General Data Protection Regulation, Following the termination of the applicant's legal relationship, no legitimate aim or interest can be identified on the basis of which it would allow access to work-related data, information and, where appropriate, the employer's business secrets. In the Authority's view, this includes publications and scientific publications requested by the Applicant. activity and contracts related to work. Such correspondence is also correspondence with publishers, which, according to the Applicant's statement, he received at the Applicant's Representation.

However, this does not mean that the Applicant could not have had access to his private letters. The fact that he wanted access to his entire 2018 letters also includes access to his private letters. However, the Applicant did not take any measures to give the Applicant access to these letters. It can be stated from the correspondence between the Applicant that in its e-mail sent on 25 February 2019, the Applicant denied the Applicant access to its archived e-mails in 2018, stating that “unless justified by a special university interest, we cannot allow such . He is no longer entitled to act or work on behalf of [...], so his correspondence in the course of his university work belongs to [...]. Such a release could not work independently of the GDPR, and it has been so much ever since.”

As stated in recital (63) of the General Data Protection Regulation, a work e-mail account contains such a large number of incoming and outgoing mail that the controller, in this case the Applicant, could not be expected to sort and send it to him. As explained above, the Applicant will not have access to the complete archive in view of the termination of his legal relationship. However, it was in those circumstances that the Applicant should have However, given that the Debtor did not allow the Applicant to access his private e-mails in 2018, the Authority finds that the Applicant has breached Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation.


III. 3. Measures and transparency requirements related to the right of access of the Applicant. 

The Authority is no longer entitled to act or perform work on behalf of [...] after the termination of its legal relationship, so its correspondence in the course of university work belongs to [...]. In paragraph 2, it found that the Applicant had unlawfully failed to comply with the Applicant's right of access on the grounds, in breach of Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation. However, the Authority considered that this information provided at the Applicant's request did not meet my transparency requirements. In the Authority's view, the transparency requirements and the Latvian measure would have been complied with if it had informed the Applicant of the Applicant Mindar, which it also stated to the Authority during the clarification of the facts. That is, in view of the fact that the Applicant's employment as a civil servant has been terminated, he may not designate the Applicant in his future publications and scientific publications, so there is no interest of the Applicant to issue - even in copy - the Applicant's email fiókja2018. However, it shall be fully open to the transmission of the Applicant's private letters, provided that it indicates the specific e-mails it requires and the medium on which it requests the data to be sent.


This can be done either by the Applicant proposing to select which e-mails he needs on the basis of a table of contents or, for example, as explained by the Authority in several decisions: by jointly sorting the Applicant's and the Applicant's private and business letters. This could make it possible for the Applicant to really only access his / her private letters that do not harm his / her interests.

Therefore, in view of the fact that the Applicant did not provide adequate and transparent information on how to access the Applicant's private letters, where applicable, pursuant to Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, and why he refused on 6 February 2019. the Authority finds that the Applicant has infringed the
