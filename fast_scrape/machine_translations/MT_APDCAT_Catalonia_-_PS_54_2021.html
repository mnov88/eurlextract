<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A citizen filed a complaint with the Catalan DPA (APDCAT) reporting that the Catalan Department of Health's website for citizens to set up COVID19 vaccination appointments, had some security vulnerabilities. The website allowed unauthorised third parties to get access to data subject's personal data just by entering their personal ID number, and neither authentication nor verification processes were requested. The personal data included name and surname, health card number, phone number, email, and vaccine type, as well as the vaccination appointment's place, date and time.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The APDCAT held that the Department of Health is responsible of an infringement of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>, since no appropriate technical and organisational measures were in place to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk in the processing. Moreover, the APDCAT pointed out that the Department of Health did not carry out the corresponding Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) prior to the processing in order to assess the impact of the envisaged processing operations.
</p><p>Therefore, the APDCAT requested the Department of Health to carry out a risk analysis based on <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a> within one month, in order to determine which technical and organisational measures are appropriate to ensure the security of the vaccination data on their website.

Resolution of the sanctioning procedure no. PS 54/2021, referring to the Department of Health of

the Generalitat de Catalunya.


Background


1. On 30/06/2021, a letter was sent to the Catalan Data Protection Authority
of a person who filed a complaint against the Department of Health on the occasion of a
alleged breach of personal data protection regulations.


Specifically, the complainant stated that he had detected certain vulnerabilities in
security on the website that the Department of Health has made available to the public for

request a vaccination appointment (https://vacunacovid.catsalut.gencat.cat), as it allows access to
very easily by unauthorized third parties to vaccination data, health card, mobile,
mail, full name, appointment for vaccination, etc. All you have to do is have the number
DNI (or health card) of the victim. No extra steps are required to verify authenticity, either

receive no verification SMS (other than the initial one) ”.

The complainant detailed in his writing how information could be accessed
of third parties, and literally indicated the following steps:


“1. (...)
2. (...)
3. (...)

4. (...).
5. (...)
6. (...)

7. (...)

In short, the complainant stated that once the user was validated on the website
https://vacunacovid.catsalut.gencat.cat, making certain calls to the API (application

programming interface) of the web through the browser console, could be accessed
data from third parties.

Along with his writing, the complainant provided screenshots in which

documented each of the steps it had taken in order to access information from
third parties. The documentation provided was anonymized
third parties.


This complaint was assigned the number IP 264/2021.

data security, reference should be made to Article 32 of the RGPD, which provides that:


        “1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of application, and the

2.1.- In relation to the proven fact 1st:


In accordance with the provisions of the first additional provision of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 of
December, on the protection of personal data and the guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter
LOPDGDD), it is necessary to mention the provisions of Royal Decree 3/2010, of 8 January, which
regulates the National Security Scheme (ENS) in the field of e-government, and

specifically its section 4.2.2 “Access requirements” of Annex II (Measures of
Security ”):

        “The access requirements will be met as follows:

        a) The resources of the system will be protected by some mechanism that prevents their
        use, except for entities that enjoy access rights
        enough. ”


2.2.- In relation to the 2nd proven fact:

At this point it is necessary to make express reference to the provisions of section 2 of Article 32 of

the RGPD already transcribed, which obliges the data controller to carry out a risk analysis
of those treatments that you plan to do, in order to determine the security measures that
must be implemented.


In accordance with the above, the facts set out in points 1 and 2 of the facts section
proved to be the infringement provided for in Article 83.4.a) of the RGPD, which classifies as such the
violation of “the obligations of the manager and the manager in accordance with Articles 8, 11,
25 to 39, 42 and 43 ”, including the one provided for in Article 32.


These conducts have been listed as a serious infraction in article 73.f) of the LOPDGDD, in the
as follows:


        “F) Failure to adopt any technical and organizational measures
        appropriate to ensure a level of safety appropriate to the risk of treatment, in
        the terms required by Article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "


3. Article 77.2 LOPDGDD provides that in the case of offenses committed by those responsible or
in charge listed in art. 77.1 LOPDGDD, the competent data protection authority:


        "(...) he must issue a resolution sanctioning them with a reprimand. The
        resolution shall also set out the measures to be taken to end it
        conduct or correct the effects of the offense that has been committed.
        The decision must be notified to the controller or controller, a

        the body on which it depends hierarchically, where applicable, and those affected who have the
        interested party, if any. "






                                                                                       Page 6 of 8, PS 54/2021
Carrer Rosselló, 214, esc. A, 1st 1st
08008 Barcelona





In terms similar to the LOPDGDD, article 21.2 of Law 32/2010, determines the following:


        “2. In the case of infringements committed in relation to publicly owned files, the
        director of the Catalan Data Protection Authority must issue
        a resolution declaring the infringement and setting out the measures to be taken for
        correct its effects (...) ”.
