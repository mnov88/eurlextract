<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts_and_questions_arising">Facts and questions arising</span></h3>
<p>In 2019, Mr D, a customer of Iberia Airlines, requested the company to delete all his personal data, including those concerning an ongoing Loyalty Program. Although the controller confirmed the deletion, Mr D continued to receive unsolicited marketing emails from the company. These facts led to a first complaint which ended in the sanctioning procedure PS/00370/2018. Notwithstanding the first formal notice, the sending of promotional did not stop. Therefore, Mr D lodged a second complaint alleging the ongoing violation of Article 6 GDPR.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD finds the violation of Article 6 quite apparent and focuses on the criteria to assess the amount of the fine under Article 83 GDPR. In particular, the Agency finds a certain "recidivism" due to the commission of infringements of the same nature, already sanctioned in the context of a previous procedure.
</p><p>This integrate the aggravating criteria under Art. 83(2)(b) (intentional or negligent character of the infringement) and (e) (previous infringements) of the GDPR. For these reasons, the controller was given a penalty of 20.000 euros.

<pre>Procedure No.: PS/00402/2019



DECISION ON DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS

From the procedure instructed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following

BACKGROUND


FIRST: D. A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claimant) on 14 June 2019 filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The claim is directed against IBERIA LÍNEAS AÉREAS DE ESPAÑA, S.A. OPERADORA UNIPERSONAL with NIF A85850394 (hereinafter the claimed party). The reasons on which the complaint is based are that having been a customer with an Iberia loyalty card (Iberia Plus), you applied for cancellation of the loyalty programme and of your personal data with that company.

Subsequently, you received written confirmation of the cancellation and deletion of your data. However, he continued to receive emails. In view of these facts, he filed a complaint with this Agency in August 2018, from which the sanctioning procedure PS/00370/2018 was derived.

This being the case, he has again received emails from the requested party at the same email address in which it is clear that this company has not cancelled its data and is still listed as being linked to the Iberia Plus loyalty programme.

The following documentation, among others, is provided

-	Copy of the e-mail received in your mailbox. It informs you that you can authenticate in your personal Iberia Plus space not only with your Iberia Plus number, but also with your email and password.

SECOND: In view of the facts set forth in the complaint and the documents provided by the complainant, the Subdirectorate General for Data Inspection proceeded to carry out actions for its clarification, under the investigative powers granted to the supervisory authorities in Article 57.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD).

As a result of the investigative actions carried out, it has been established that the person responsible for the processing is the one who has been requested.

The following points are also noted:


As a result of the consultation made to the application of the AEPD that manages previous sanctions and warnings on data protection, that IBERIA LÍNEAS AÉREAS DE ESPAÑA, S.A.

LEGAL FOUNDATIONS

I

By virtue of the powers that Article 58.2 of the RGPD grants to each supervisory authority, and as established in Articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.
II

In the present case, from the complaint and documentation presented, it is noted that, the claimant has continued to receive e-mails from the complained party. As the latter acknowledges, in its reply to the transfer of the claim.

Consequently, given that in the case in question there is recidivism due to the commission of infringements of the same nature, given that the complainant continued to receive emails from the requested party, even after the resolution of the PS/00370/2018 sanctioning procedure was issued.

Therefore, the known facts constitute an infringement, attributable to the defendant, for violation of Article 6.1, of the RGPD, which states that: "in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.11 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, consent of the affected party is understood as any free, specific, informed and unequivocal expression of will by which the affected party accepts, either by statement or clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data concerning you".

Article 72.1(b) of the LOPDGDD defines "very serious" as "the processing of personal data without meeting any of the conditions for the lawfulness of processing set out in Article 6 of the RGPD".

III

As aggravating criteria:

-	Intentionality or negligence in the infringement (paragraph b).

-	For other previous infringements committed by the controller or processor (section e).

The balance of the circumstances referred to in Article 83.2 of the RGPD, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of Article 6 thereof, allows for a penalty of 20,000 euros (twenty thousand euros), classified as "very serious", for the purposes of prescription, in Article 72.1.b) of the LOPDGDD.

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: TO IMPOSE on IBERIA LÍNEAS AÉREAS DE ESPAÑA, S.A. OPERADORA UNIPERSONAL, with NIF A85850394, for an infringement of Article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, a fine of
