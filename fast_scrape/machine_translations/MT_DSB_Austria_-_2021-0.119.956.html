She further asked for a finding that it was reasonable for the respondent to obtain further additional registration information from MA 62. alleges that the respondent's right to information was violated by not fully complying with its request for information dated November 14, 2019. The respondent's information dated December 12, 2019 did not include all documents relating to the complainant's treatment in Hospital N*** in 2019. According to Article 15, Paragraph 3, GDPR, you have the right to receive a copy of the stored data. Exp.Gr. 63 explicitly included health-related data (patient files, diagnoses, examination results, etc.). In addition, the complainant asked for a declaration that the respondent's request to provide a copy of his ID, even though a qualified electronic signature had already been submitted, was not legal. She further asked for a finding that it was reasonable for the respondent to obtain further additional registration information from MA 62.

2. In its submission dated March 27, 2020, the respondent commented on the complaint and stated that the personal data contained in the information dated December 12, 2019 was both information about the processed personal data relating to the complainant (Article 15 paragraph 1 GDPR), as well as a copy of the personal data that is the subject of processing, within the meaning of Art. 15 Para. 3 GDPR. The right to information pursuant to Article 15 Para. 3 GDPR only includes the right to receive a copy of the personal data stored about the person concerned, i.e. a list of them, but this is not a right to receive entire files or copies of files. Accordingly, under the GDPR, the complainant has no right to receive “all patient files […] in full as a copy”. Statement and stated in relation to the complaint that the personal data contained in the information dated December 12, 2019 was both information about the personal data processed concerning the complainant (Article 15, paragraph one, GDPR), and a copy of the personal data that The subject of the processing is within the meaning of Article 15, Paragraph 3, GDPR. The right to information pursuant to Article 15, Paragraph 3, GDPR only includes the right to receive a copy of the personal data stored about the person concerned, i.e. a list of them, but this is not a right to receive entire files or copies of files. Accordingly, under the GDPR, the complainant has no right to receive “all patient files […] in full as a copy”.

In addition, in the case of the patient file, there is the possibility of inspecting the medical history or making a copy of the medical history against reimbursement of costs in accordance with Section 17a Paragraph 2 Letter g Wr. CAG. The right to information according to Art. 15 GDPR is also based on the principle In the case of the patient file, there is the possibility of inspecting the medical history or making a copy of the medical history against reimbursement of costs in accordance with paragraph 17 a, paragraph 2, litera g, Wr. CAG. The right to information according to Article 15, GDPR is also based on the principle lex specialis derogat legi generali of more specific rights in the area of the right to information and also the right of inspection of the Wr. KAG repressed.

The area of hospital law at issue here, namely the exercise of patients' rights, has a European law foundation in Directive 2011/24/EU (see also Füszl in Aigner/Kletečka/Kletečka-Pulker/Memmer, Handbook of Medical Law (2019) Chapter IV. 1.10), which is why there was another legal act at the same level in addition to the GDPR. The only special feature was that the directive was not generally directly applicable, but had to be implemented through domestic law. However, this did not change the equality of the EU regulation and the EU directive (or the national provisions implementing the EU directive)., Handbook of Medical Law (2019) Chapter. Roman IV.1.10), which is why there was another legal act at the same level in addition to the GDPR. The only special feature was that the directive was not generally directly applicable, but had to be implemented through domestic law. However, this did not change the equality of the EU regulation and the EU directive (or the national provisions implementing the EU directive).

Insofar as the complaint (implicitly) referred to patient files in an analogue form, it should be noted that manual files do not qualify as a file system within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 6 GDPR, which is why the GDPR (and consequently also your right to information) is not applicable in this regard. Insofar as the complaint (implicitly) referred to patient files in an analogue form, it should be noted that manual files do not qualify as a file system within the meaning of Article 4, Paragraph 6, GDPR, which is why the GDPR (and consequently also your right to information) is not applicable in this regard .

Regarding the requested determination as to whether the request for a copy of the ID was lawful, the respondent stated that since the complainant had been given information in accordance with the GDPR, only this could be the subject of the complaint and not the modalities.

3. In a submission dated June 30, 2020, the complainant requested that the proceedings be continued and stated in summary that she was of the opinion that the provisions of the GDPR, as secondary Union law, were of a higher rank in the hierarchy of norms than the Wr. CAG. In addition, she assumes that all resulting files, unless they are already recorded electronically, must be structured and sorted due to legal obligations, which means that the GDPR continues to apply to these documents.

4. In a submission dated February 2021, the respondent stated that the information contained in the files had been digitally archived. Accordingly, the GDPR is directly applicable as (partially) automated data processing.

5. In her submission dated February 16, 2021, the complainant essentially repeated her previous statements.

B. Subject of the complaint

The subject of the complaint is the question of whether the respondent violated the complainant's right to information by not providing the complainant with complete information about her health-related data.

Furthermore, the applications submitted by the complainant with regard to the exercise of the right to information must be discussed.

6. In the ongoing proceedings before the data protection authority, the respondent submitted the following information on February 3, 2021 (formatting not reproduced 1:1):

Regarding the information in question, it is stated that the following existing documents were not cited by mistake:

-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inpatient letter 0*.**.2019

-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; *** Outpatient questionnaire 2*.**.2019

Assessment of evidence: Evidence on the facts that were not in dispute were included through the parties' submissions, which are available in the file.

D. From a legal point of view it follows:

At the outset the following should be noted:

Although the complaint is directed against the “City of Vienna, Department D***”, it obviously means the Vienna Health Association as the operator of the N*** Hospital of the City of Vienna. The Vienna Health Association is a dependent company of the City of Vienna. The magistrate (Department D***) represents the City of Vienna in data protection matters, in particular before the data protection authority.

It follows that the respondent is the “City of Vienna, represented by the Magistrate of the City of Vienna”. However, the vagueness of the name of the original respondent cannot be blamed on the complainant (cf. also the decision of the Federal Administrative Court of May 27, 2020, GZ W214 2228346-1 regarding “Wiener Wohnen”). It follows from this that the The respondent is the “City of Vienna, represented by the Magistrate of the City of Vienna”. However, the vagueness of the name of the original respondent cannot be blamed on the complainant (see also the decision of the Federal Administrative Court of May 27, 2020, GZ W214 2228346-1 regarding “Wiener Wohnen”).

It should also be noted at the outset that the data processed in relation to the complainant is health data in accordance with Art also the decision of November 19, 2020, GZ: 2020-0.743.659). It should also be noted at the outset that the data processed in relation to the complainant is health data in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 15, in conjunction with Article 9, paragraph one, GDPR, because these data are processed (exclusively) in the context of the complainant's medical history (see also the decision dated November 19, 2020, GZ: 2020-0.743.659).

1. 2. On the question of Directive 2011/24/EU as a lex specialis

As data protection information, the complainant demands the (free) provision of information that the respondent has, specifically the content of the medical history.

The respondent argued that the right to information pursuant to Article 15 of the GDPR was based on the principle of lex specialis derogat legi generali Wr. KAG, which stipulates an obligation to pay for patient files, has been displaced. The present area of hospital law, namely the exercise of patients' rights, has a European law foundation in Directive 2011/24/EU.

This objection is not valid because, according to Article 2 lit. c of this directive, Directive 95/46/EC remains unaffected. According to Art. 94 Para. 2 GDPR, references to Directive 95/46/EC are considered references to the GDPR. This objection is unfounded because, according to Article 2, Litera c, of this Directive, Directive 95/46/EC remains unaffected. According to Article 94, paragraph 2, GDPR, references to Directive 95/46/EC are considered references to the GDPR.

For this reason alone, it cannot be said that Directive 2011/24/EU supersedes the GDPR according to the principle lex specialis derogat legi generali.

Apart from that, Art f, Directive 2011/24/EU provides that the Member State of treatment shall guarantee the right of treated patients to have a written or electronic medical record relating to the treatment and - in accordance with and subject to national measures implementing Union rules on the protection of personal data, in particular Directives 95 /46/EC and 2002/58/EC — access to at least one copy of this file.

Even under this provision - which expressly regulates access to patient files - the requirements of the GDPR are considerable.

Directive 2011/24/EU was adopted by LGBl. No. 33/2014, among other things, in Section 17a Paragraph 2 Letter g Wr. KAG implemented. Directive 2011/24/EU was implemented by State Law Gazette No. 33 from 2014, including in paragraph 17 a, paragraph 2, litera g, Wr. KAG implemented.

Art. 15 GDPR does not contain any regulation similar to Section 26 Para. 6 DSG 2000, according to which the request for information under data protection law can only be exercised as a subsidiary to other rights of inspection. Rather, there is a fundamental right to information pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR, provided there is no permissible restriction pursuant to Art. 23 GDPR. If, on the other hand, a more specific substantive regulation applies under Union law, this is based on the principle of Article 15; the GDPR does not contain any regulation equivalent to Section 26, Paragraph 6, DSG 2000, according to which the request for information under data protection law can only be exercised as a subsidiary to other rights of inspection. Rather, there is a fundamental right to information in accordance with Article 15, GDPR, unless there is a permissible restriction under Article 23, GDPR. However, if a more specific substantive regulation applies under Union law, this applies according to the principle lex specialis derogat legis generalis. The GDPR cannot be interpreted as if it conclusively regulates the rights of those affected. Rather, the GDPR, in accordance with its scope of application, regulates the rights of those affected in a general manner, although it cannot be ruled out that other legal acts of the Union provide for more specific regulations on the rights of those affected (cf. the decision of June 21, 2018, GZ: DSB- D122.844/0006-DSB/2018). before. The GDPR cannot be interpreted as if it conclusively regulates the rights of those affected. Rather, the GDPR, in accordance with its scope, regulates the rights of those affected in a general manner, although it cannot be ruled out that other legal acts of the Union provide for more specific regulations on the rights of those affected; see the decision of June 21, 2018, GZ: DSB-D122. 844/0006-DSB/2018).

Since in the present case § 17a paragraph 2 lit. g Wr. KAG (which was issued in implementation of Directive 2011/24/EU) Since in the present case paragraph 17 a, paragraph 2, litera g, Wr. KAG (which was issued in implementation of Directive 2011/24/EU) does not standardize a special right to information (in relation to the GDPR) without reimbursement of costs, and therefore cannot be limited to the right to general data protection information about one's own data. On the contrary, the aforementioned directive refers – as explained – to Directive 95/46/EC (now GDPR), which is relevant for the processing of personal data.

From all of this it follows that Section 17a Paragraph 2 Letter g Wr. KAG does not derogate from Art. 15 GDPR. It follows from all of this that paragraph 17 a, paragraph 2, letter g, Wr. KAG does not derogate from Article 15, GDPR.

2. Regarding points 1 and 2

a) Basic information about Article 15 GDPRa) Basic information about Article 15 GDPR

Pursuant to Article 15 Para. 1 GDPR, the data subject has the right to request confirmation from the person responsible as to whether personal data concerning him or her is being processed and, if this is the case, to receive information about this personal data and to be entitled to the information in accordance with lit. a to h leg. cit. According to Art. 15 Para. 3 GDPR, the controller must provide the data subject with a copy of the personal data that is the subject of processing. If the data subject submits the request electronically, the information must be provided in a common electronic format unless the data subject states otherwise. According to Article 15, paragraph one, GDPR, the data subject has the right to request confirmation of this from the controller , whether personal data concerning you is being processed and, if this is the case, to receive information about this personal data and the right to the information in accordance with Litera a, up to h leg. cit. According to Article 15, paragraph 3, GDPR, the controller must provide the data subject with a copy of the personal data that is the subject of processing. If the data subject submits the application electronically, the information must be provided in a common electronic format unless the data subject states otherwise.

In principle, the respondent must provide the complainant with information about the personal data it processes, unless there is another exception to the right to information.

b.) On the right to a copy (Article 15, Paragraph 3, GDPR)b.) On the right to a copy (Article 15, Paragraph 3, GDPR)

The right to a copy of data in accordance with Art. 15 Para. 3 GDPR exists independently of the right to information about the content of the processed data in accordance with Para. 1 Leg. Cit. (cf. The right to a copy of data according to Article 15, paragraph 3, GDPR exists independently of the right to information about the content of the processed data according to paragraph one, leg. cit. cf. Franck in Gola [ed.], General Data Protection Regulation2 Art. 15 para 27). Article 15, paragraph 27).

In summary, the complainant believes that she can obtain information about the contents of the patient files, or information about diagnoses, examination results, findings of the treating doctors and information about treatments or procedures, essentially a copy of the medical history, by asserting the right to information.

The data protection authority has, with reference to the Recommendation Act. 63 as well as the judgment of the ECJ of July 17, 2014, YS et al., C-141/12 and C-372/12, have already stated that from Art. 15 Para. 3 GDPR the data protection authority, with reference to the recital. 63 as well as the judgment of the ECJ of July 17, 2014, YS et al., C-141/12 and C-372/12, have already stated that Article 15, paragraph 3, GDPR does not give rise to a right to the release of a copy of documents that contain personal data of a person requesting information. With reference to Art. 15 Para. 3 GDPR, it is therefore not possible to demand the release of entire documents, even if the personal data of a person providing information appears in them (cf. in this sense also the ruling of the BG für Handelssachen Vienna of October 7, 2019 , GZ 18 C 263/19m regarding the delivery of an insurance policy). Art. 15 Para. 3 GDPR simply norms the right to receive a “copy of the personal data that is the subject of processing” (see also the decision of August 10, 2020, GZ: 2020-0.204.456 mwN). contain personal data of a person requesting information. With reference to Article 15, Paragraph 3, GDPR, it is therefore not possible to demand the release of entire documents, even if the personal data of a person providing information appears in them. In this sense, also compare the judgment of the BG für Handelssachen Vienna of October 7, 2019, GZ 18 C 263/19m regarding delivery of an insurance policy). Article 15, paragraph 3, GDPR only norms the right to receive a “copy of the personal data that is the subject of processing” (see also the decision of August 10, 2020, GZ: 2020-0.204.456 mwN).

Contrary to the complainant's opinion, it can also be seen from recital. 63 cannot be deduced that there is a right to the (free) release of entire documents: it speaks of “data in your patient files that contain information such as diagnoses, examination results, findings of the treating doctors and information on treatments or procedures” and not of “ Data from patient records”.

From all of this it can be deduced that there is no right to copies of the entire patient files according to the GDPR, but the information from the ErwGr can still be obtained by means of a request for information. 63 2nd sentence of the GDPR can be requested in the patient files.

In all of the respondent's information, apart from the names of the files/findings and therapies with dates, there was no complete information about the complainant's health-related data in the patient files, such as diagnoses, examination results, and findings from the treating doctors.

Taking the above into account, it is therefore not important to reproduce entire documents and make them available free of charge; However, Art. 15 GDPR still guarantees that you will receive information about this data, be it in the form of a print (facsimile) or in the form of a description of the content or context in which personal data is processed. Taking the above statements into account Therefore, it is not intended to reproduce entire documents and make them available free of charge; However, Article 15, GDPR still guarantees that you will receive information about this data, be it in the form of a print (facsimile) or in the form of a description of the content or context in which personal data is processed.

In any case, the information must be provided precisely in such a way that the data subject can assert their rights to deletion, rectification and, if necessary, objection on the basis of this information (cf. the ECJ judgment of May 7, 2009 on Directive 95/46/EC , C-553/07, Rz 49 and 51).In any case, the information must be provided precisely in such a way that the data subject can, on the basis of this information, assert their rights to deletion, rectification and, if necessary, objection (see Directive 95/46). /EC the judgment of the ECJ of May 7, 2009, C-553/07, paragraphs 49 and 51).

As a result, the respondent responded inadequately to the request for information and was required to provide the complainant with complete information in accordance with Article 15 of the GDPR and to provide the health-related data in the patient files in accordance with Art. Exp.Gr. 63 2nd sentence of the GDPR to provide the complainant with information. As a result, the respondent responded inadequately to the request for information and was ordered to provide the complainant with complete information in accordance with Article 15 of the GDPR and to include the health-related data in the Patient files in the sense of Exp.Gr. 63 2nd sentence of the GDPR to inform the complainant.

Point 2 is based on Article 58 Paragraph 2 Letter c GDPR. The restriction in accordance with Section 24 Paragraph 5 of the GDPR must be disregarded because this is not covered by Article 58 of the GDPR (cf. BVwG of May 28, 2020, GZ W211 221 6385-1). Point 2 is based on Article 58, paragraph 2, letter c, GDPR. The restriction according to paragraph 24, paragraph 5, DSG must be ignored because it is not covered by Article 58, DSGVO (see BVwG of May 28, 2020, GZ W211 221 6385-1).

Therefore, the decision had to be made according to the verdict.

Regarding points 3 and 4:

The complainant lodged a complaint because of inadequate information and not because the information was not provided.

The aim of the complaint procedure based on Article 15 GDPR is to obtain information about the processing of personal data by the respondent. The aim of the complaint procedure based on Article 15 GDPR is to obtain information about the processing of personal data by the respondent.

With regard to the complainant's application for a declaration that the copy of the ID card requested by the respondent was not legal, even though a qualified electronic signature had already been submitted, and that it was reasonable for the respondent to obtain further additional registration information from MA 62 , it should be noted that only the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority can be derived from Art. 77 GDPR (in conjunction with Section 24 DSG) and thereby enable the enforcement of subjective rights - if necessary by means of an official service mandate. A right to establish that the respondent had allegedly unlawfully requested a copy of her ID in the past or that it was reasonable for her to obtain registration information herself cannot be derived from the right to information pursuant to Article 15 GDPR. With regard to the complainant's application for a declaration that the copy of the ID card requested by the respondent was not legal, even though a qualified electronic signature had already been submitted, and that it was reasonable for the respondent to obtain further additional registration information from MA 62 , it should be noted that only the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority can be derived from Article 77, GDPR in conjunction with Paragraph 24, GDPR, thereby enabling the enforcement of subjective rights - if necessary by means of an official service mandate. A right to establish that the respondent had allegedly unlawfully requested a copy of her ID in the past or that it was reasonable for her to obtain registration information herself cannot be derived from the right to information pursuant to Article 15, GDPR.

Regardless of this, the respondent cannot be accused of having obtained more detailed information because the request for information - and thus also the digitally signed documents - did not come from the complainant herself, but from the person entitled to custody. The proof of identity thus provided relates exclusively to him, but not to the complainant and person providing information.

Therefore, the decision had to be made according to the verdict.
