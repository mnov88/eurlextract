<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>Vodafone transferred the claimant’s telephone number to another customer, despite the claimant not making a request for Vodafone to do this. In examining the contract for the transfer, the AEPD discovered that the claimant’s signature was missing from the section “signature of old owner”.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Did Vodafone’s failure to get the claimant’s signature constitute a breach under the GDPR?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD held that Vodafone violated Article 6(1) GDPR, as they had processed the claimant’s data without a lawful basis. 
</p><p>When setting the amount of the fine, the AEPD considered the negligent nature of the infringement - Article 83(2)(b) - and the fact that the infringement involved the “basic identifiers” of the claimant - Article 83(2)(g) - to be aggravating factors. The fine was reduced to €42000 by Vodafone’s early voluntary payment of the fine, and their waiver of any right to appeal the fine.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW




I



        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each

control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate

and to solve this procedure.



II




      Article 58 of the RGPD, "Powers", says:



           “2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers
corrective measures listed below:

(…)

b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with warning

when the treatment operations have infringed the provisions of this
Regulation;

(...)

d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment are in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified time frame.


(…)

i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or instead of the
measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances of the case
particular

(…) "



III




      The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them that of "legality, loyalty and
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/18








transparency". The precept provides:



      "1. The personal data will be:


         a) Treaties in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the
             interested (&lt;&lt; legality, loyalty and transparency &gt;&gt;); "



        Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:




        "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
      personal for one or more specific purposes;

      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures

      pre-contractual;

      (…) "



      The infringement for which the claimed entity is responsible is found
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading "General conditions for

the imposition of administrative fines ”, it states:



      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for

the highest amount:



      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "



       Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of

Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious ”provides:



C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/18








      "1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that

suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
in particular, the following:




        (…)

       b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
       conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
       Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "






IV




      The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it processed the
personal data of the claimant without having any legitimacy to do so.



      The operator Vodafone has carried out the portability of the line of the

claimant, without standing for it.



      The owner of the line, the claimant, warned Vodafone that it was a
made fraudulent, since she had not made the request for portability, but rather
someone had usurped his data to process said portability.




      Despite warning that it was a fraudulent act on several occasions, the
portability was carried out on April 4, 2019.



      Well, in the contract provided by Vodafone, it was found in the
“Change of Holder” section: Name, surname and NIF of the claimant (old

headline). However, and this is essential, there is no signature in the box entitled
"Old owner signature." That is, it is not duly signed and therefore the
claimant has not given consent.



       Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, it remains in

the diligence employed by the claimed party questioned.
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/18










      Respect for the principle of legality that is in the essence of fundamental right

protection of personal data requires that it be proven that the
responsible for the treatment displayed the essential diligence to prove that
extreme. If this Agency does not act in this way - and if this Agency does not demand it, it is incumbent upon
for compliance with the regulations governing the data protection right of
personal character - the result would be to empty the content of the principle of legality.




V



        In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, precepts that indicate:

        e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
        treatment;

         f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/18








        h) the way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement,
        in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infraction and, in such
        case, to what extent;

        i) when the measures indicated in Article 58 (2) have been
