<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>Following the decision of the Italian DPA to impose a temporary limitation on the processing activities of OpenAI L.L.C. (the controller) regarding ChatGPT, the controller contacted the DPA to express its willingness to cooperate and requested it to lift the temporary limitation.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Italian DPA argued that it would re-assess its decision on condition that the controller put in place concrete measures to protect the rights and freedoms of those whose data was used to train ChatGPT’s algorithms and those who are users of the service. These measures include: 
</p><p>1) Preparing and publishing an information notice on the controller's website which explains that the data collected from the data subjects (users and non-users of the service) is used to train ChatGPT’s algorithms, and also includes information on how the processing is carried out, the logic behind the processing as necessary for the operation of the service, data subjects' rights and any other information required by the GDPR. 
</p><p>2) Putting in place a tool, which could be accessible on the controller’s website, by which data subjects who log in from Italy can exercise their right to object to the processing of their personal data obtained from third parties, when the processing is carried out for purposes of algorithm training and provision of the service.  
</p><p>3) Making available on the controller's website a tool by which data subjects can request and obtain the correction of their data which was inaccurately processed in the generation of contents or, where this is not possible according to the state-of-the-art technology, erasure of such personal data.  
</p><p>4) Including a link to the privacy policy which shall be displayed before proceeding to registration. This link shall also appear prior to the reactivation of the service. 
</p><p>5) Modifying the legal basis for processing personal data for purposes of algorithm training. In particular, the controller shall not invoke the performance of a contract as an appropriate legal basis but shall instead base its processing on consent or legitimate interest.  
</p><p>6) Implementing, on the controller's website, a tool that allows data subjects to object to the processing of their personal data collected during their use of Chat GPT, when data are processed to train the algorithms on the basis of a legitimate interest of the controller. This tool shall be easily accessible.  
</p><p>7) Putting in place an age gate system to filter out minors on the basis of the age declared by the data subject. 
</p><p>8) Submitting a plan to the Italian DPA by 31 May 2023 for the implementation of age verification tools which would prevent data subjects aged under 13 from using ChatGPT alongside with data subjects aged under 18 in the absence of a clear affirmative act of consent by the person holding parental responsibility over the latter. 
</p><p>9) Launching an information campaign, without promoting its services, on the main Italian mass communication channels to inform data subjects that there is a high probability that their personal data was collected for the purposes of algorithm training and the controller published an information notice and provided a tool by which data subjects can request and obtain the erasure of their personal data. 
</p><p>Moreover, pursuant to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#1" title="Article 58 GDPR">Article 58(1) GDPR</a>, the Italian DPA asked the controller to communicate by 30 April 2023 the initiatives it took to put in place the measures 1 to 7. It also asked the controller to indicate the steps it took to implement the measures 8 and 9.

GUARANTOR FOR THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA

At today's meeting, with the participation of Pasquale Stanzione, President, Ginevra Cerrina Feroni, Vice-President, Agostino Ghiglia and Guido Scorza, members, and Fabio Mattei, Secretary-General;

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016, on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95 /46/EC, 'General Data Protection Regulation' (hereinafter 'the Regulation');

Having regard to Legislative Decree No 196 of 30 June 2003 laying down provisions for the adaptation of national law to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016, on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter 'the Code');

Having regard to Decision No 112 of 30 March 2023 on the temporary limitation referred to in Article 58(2)(f) of the Regulation, as adopted in respect of OpenAI LLC (hereinafter also 'the Company') by the President as a matter of urgency pursuant to Article 5 (8) of Regulation 1/2000 on the organization and functioning of the Guarantor's Office, which was ratified at the meeting of 8 April 2023;

Having regard to the e-mail of 3 April 2023 in which the Company expressed its willingness to meet the Guarantor;

Taking note of the outcome of the meeting held by videoconference between the Guarantor's Panel of Commissioners and the Company's top managers on 5 April 2023;

Having regard to the information gathered from OpenAI, which stated, inter alia, its willingness to cooperate with the Guarantor in its letters of 6 and 7 April 2023, and also requested the lifting of the temporary limitation decision;

Finding that it is possible to proceed with re-assessing the circumstances underpinning the temporary limitation decision by making the corresponding determinations, in the light of the information obtained and the willingness expressed by the Company to put in place concrete measures to protect the rights and freedoms both of the data subjects whose data have been processed to train the algorithms used to provide the ChatGPT service and of the users of that service, without prejudice to the continuation of the fact-finding activities initiated by the Garante, on condition that OpenAI factually implements the measures specified below which the Company is ordered to take pursuant to Article 58(2)(d) of the Regulation:

1. drafting and publishing, on the Company’s website, an information notice which provides&#160; data subjects whose data have been collected and processed for the purpose of training algorithms – whether or not they are also users of the ChatGPT service -&#160; with information on how the processing is carried out, the logic underlying the processing that is necessary for the operation of the service, the rights to which they are entitled as data subjects, and any other element provided for in the Regulation within the terms and in accordance with the arrangements laid down in Article 12 of the latter;

2. making available, on the Company’s website, at least to data subjects who are connected from Italy, whether or not they are also users of the service, a tool by which they can exercise their right to object to the Company’s processing of their personal data for the purpose of training algorithms and providing the service insofar as such data have been obtained from third parties;

3. making available, on the Company’s website, at least to data subjects who are connected from Italy, whether or not they are also users of the service, a tool by which to request and obtain rectification of any personal data relating to them which have been processed incorrectly in the generation of contents or, where this is not possible according to state-of-the-art technology, the erasure of their personal data;

4. including a link to the user information notice in the registration flow at such a location as can allow it to be read before continuing with the registration and in such a way as to enable all users connecting from Italy, including registered users, to view that information notice immediately they access the service following the possible reactivation of such service;

5. changing the legal basis of the processing of users’ personal data for the purpose of algorithmic training, by removing any reference to contract and relying on consent or legitimate interest as legal bases by having regard to the assessment the Company is required to make from an accountability perspective;

6. making available, on the Company’s website, at least to users who are connected from Italy, an easily accessible tool by which to exercise their right to object to the processing of their own data as acquired when using the service for the purpose of training algorithms, where the legal basis chosen under point 5 above is the Company’s legitimate interest;

7. including a request to all users connecting from Italy, whether already registered or not, to go through an age gate upon their initial access following the possible reactivation of the service for Italy so as to filter out underage users on the basis of the inputted age;

8. submitting a plan for the deployment of age verification tools to the Garante by 31 May 2023, whereby users aged under 13 should be prevented from accessing the service along with users aged under 18 in the absence of an express indication of consent by the person exercising parental authority over the latter; implementation of this plan shall start at the latest on 30 September 2023;

9. promoting a non-marketing oriented information campaign by 15 May 2023, on all the main Italian mass media (including radio, television, newspapers and the Internet), the content of which shall be agreed upon with the Garante, in order to inform individuals that their personal data are likely to have been collected for the purpose of training algorithms, that an ad-hoc detailed information notice has been published on the Company’s website, and that a tool has been made available, still on the Company’s website, by means of which all data subjects can request and obtain the erasure of their personal data;

Finding that the measures set out in points 1 to 7 above shall be complied with in full by 30 April 2023 at the latest;

Finding, if the foregoing conditions are fulfilled, that enforcement of its temporary limitation decision may be suspended as from compliance with the measures set out in points 1 to 7 above, whereby this shall be without prejudice to such further action, even of an urgent and temporary nature, as may be taken&#160; in the event of inadequate or insufficient implementation of the above measures;

Whereas the current decisions shall be without prejudice to any further measures as may prove necessary following the conclusion of the fact-finding activities under way;

Having regard to the records on file;

Acting on the report submitted by Prof. Pasquale Stanzione;

BASED ON THE FOREGOING PREMISES, THE GARANTE

2. to make available, on the Company’s website, at least to data subjects who are connected from Italy, whether or not they are also users of the service, a tool by which they can exercise their right to object to the Company’s processing of their personal data for the purpose of training algorithms and providing the service insofar as such data have been obtained from third parties;

7. to include a request to all users connecting from Italy, whether already registered or not, to go through an age gate upon their initial access following the possible reactivation of the service for Italy so as to filter out underage users on the basis of the inputted age;

8. to submit a plan for the deployment of age verification tools to the Garante by 31 May 2023, whereby users aged under 13 should be prevented from accessing the service along with users aged under 18 in the absence of an express indication of consent by the person exercising parental authority over the latter; implementation of this plan shall start at the latest on 30 September 2023; and

9. to promote a non-marketing oriented information campaign by 15 May 2023, on all the main Italian mass media (including radio, television, newspapers and the Internet), the content of which shall be agreed upon with the Garante, in order to inform individuals that their personal data are likely to have been collected for the purpose of training algorithms, that an ad-hoc detailed information notice has been published on the Company’s website, and that a tool has been made available, still on the Company’s website, by means of which all data subjects can request and obtain the erasure of their personal data,

within the time limits set out in the premises hereof;

b)&#160; suspends enforcement of the temporary limitation decision that was adopted by way of an urgent determination of the President (No 112 of 30 March 2023) and ratified by the Garante’s Panel of Commissioners at its meeting of 8 April 2023 as from compliance with the measures set out in points 1 to 7 above.

The foregoing decisions are made without prejudice to such activities as may be carried out to establish any infringements of the legislation in force by the controller and to such further or different measures as may prove necessary upon completion of the fact-finding activities under way.

Pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Regulation and Section 157 of the Code, the Garante hereby requests the controller addressed by this decision to communicate the following:

-&#160; what steps have been taken to implement the measures set out in points 8 to 9, by the dates referred to therein respectively.
