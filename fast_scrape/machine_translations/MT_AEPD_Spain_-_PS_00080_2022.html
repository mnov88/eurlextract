<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A woman, acting as a third party, received documentation about authorisations for medical clinic tests by an insurance company. Those tests belonged to other data subjects that the woman did not know and to whom she had no link. It occurred on numerous occasions, and it was sent via email. The woman reported the situation to the insurance company every time she received such an email but they answered by redirecting her complaints to other offices within the company. Hence, the issue was not resolved, and the woman kept receiving more emails. The documents included the authorisation number, the data of the insured (name, surname, number of insurance policy) and the type of medical tests.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA first held that not ensuring the appropriate security of the personal data of the data subject by sending their medical information to third parties violated the principle of integrity and confidentiality under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>Furthermore, the controller was responsible for implementing appropriate security measures according to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32(1)(b) GDPR</a>, for guaranteeing no alteration of the personal data and evaluating the possible risks related to the processing. The DPA remarked that the type of data that was exposed fell within <a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR" title="Article 9 GDPR">Article 9(1) GDPR</a>. With this in mind, the Spanish DPA found a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a> since the lack of security measures adopted represented a structural problem of the controller. 
</p><p>Lastly, the DPA found a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR" title="Article 33 GDPR">Article 33 GDPR</a> when the controller did not notify the personal data breach, which entailed a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, to the competent authority no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it. 
</p><p>The DPA also considered aggravating circumstances in relation to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Articles 32</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR" title="Article 33 GDPR">33 GDPR</a>.

FIFTH: In view of the reported facts and in accordance with the evidence

available at this time, the Data Inspection of this Spanish Agency
of Data Protection considers that the processing of personal data carried out by
claimed party would not meet the conditions imposed by current regulations in
matter of data protection, so it is appropriate to open this procedure
sanctioning lie.



                          FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

FIRST: In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of the Regulation (EU)

2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants
each control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1
of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency

of data.
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 5/17









Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: “The procedures
processed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions

in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations issued in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

SECOND: Article 5.1.f) of the RGPD establishes the following:

“Article 5 Principles relating to processing:


1. The personal data will be:

(…)

f) processed in such a way as to ensure adequate security of the data

including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against
its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of technical measures
or appropriate organizational structures (“integrity and confidentiality”).”

In relation to this principle, Recital 39 of the aforementioned GDPR states that:


“[…]Personal data must be processed in a way that guarantees security and
appropriate confidentiality of personal data, including to prevent access
or unauthorized use of said data and of the equipment used in the treatment”.


The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the
claimed violated article 5.1 f) of the RGPD, principles related to treatment.

In the specific case under examination, it is clear that the respondent party sent, from the
April 16, 2020 to March 9, 2021, to third person, 51 emails
They weren't addressed to her.

Indeed, as evidenced in the file, it is clear that the claimant received (...).

On the other hand, the respondent party acknowledged the facts, stating to this Agency

than the incident (...), also concluding (...).

THIRD: Article 4.12 of the RGPD establishes that it is considered "violation of the
security of personal data: any breach of security that causes the
accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of transmitted personal data,
stored or otherwise processed, or unauthorized communication or access to
said data.”


Article 32 of the RGPD, security of treatment, establishes the following:

         1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical measures and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,

which in your case includes, among others:
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 6/17









         a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;


          b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;

          c) the ability to restore availability and access to data
quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;


         d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and evaluation of the effectiveness
of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the treatment.

         2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration shall be given to
taking into account the risks presented by the processing of data, in particular as

consequence of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of data
data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data (The underlining is from the AEPD).

Recital 75 of the RGPD lists a series of factors or assumptions associated with
risks for the guarantees of the rights and freedoms of the interested parties:


“The risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, serious and
variable probability, may be due to the processing of data that could cause
physical, material or non-material damages, particularly in cases where
that the treatment may give rise to problems of discrimination, usurpation of

identity or fraud, financial loss, reputational damage, loss of
confidentiality of data subject to professional secrecy, unauthorized reversal of the
pseudonymization or any other significant economic or social damage; in the
cases in which the interested parties are deprived of their rights and freedoms or are
prevent exercising control over your personal data; In cases where the data

treated personalities reveal ethnic or racial origin, political opinions, religion
or philosophical beliefs, militancy in trade unions and the processing of genetic data,
data relating to health or data on sex life, or convictions and offenses
criminal or related security measures; In cases where they are evaluated
personal aspects, in particular the analysis or prediction of aspects related to the
performance at work, economic situation, health, preferences or interests

personal, reliability or behavior, situation or movements, in order to create or
use personal profiles; in the cases in which personal data of
vulnerable people, in particular children; or in cases where the treatment
involves a large amount of personal data and affects a large number of
interested.”


From the actions carried out, there is evidence of the existence of reasonable indications and
enough that the security measures, both of a technical nature and
organizations, with which the claimed party had in relation to the data of
health subject to treatment, were not adequate at the time of occurrence

improper access.

The consequence of this implementation of deficient security measures was the
Exposure to a third party of personal data relating to the health of

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 7/17








other customers, that is, those affected have been deprived of control over their
personal information.


It should be added that, in relation to the category of data to which the third person
outside has had access, they are in the category of special according to what
provided in art. 9 of the RGPD, a circumstance that supposes an added risk that
must assess in the risk management study and that increases the degree requirement

of protection in relation to the security and safeguarding of the integrity and
confidentiality of these data.

This risk must be taken into account by the data controller, who must
establish the necessary technical and organizational measures to prevent the loss of

control of the data by the data controller and, therefore, by the data controllers.
holders of the data that provided them.


The fact that workers of two different managers have committed the same
error shows that it is not a specific human error, but a faulty
CRM configuration, which shows that these errors are just the
sample of the lack of security measures adopted by the person in charge.


FOURTH: Article 33 of the RGPD, Notification of a violation of the security of
personal data to the control authority, establishes that: “1. In case of violation

of the security of the personal data, the person in charge of the treatment will notify it to
the competent supervisory authority in accordance with article 55 without delay
wrongful and, if possible, no later than 72 hours after you had
record of it, unless it is unlikely that the security breach
constitutes a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. If the

notification to the control authority does not take place within 72 hours, it must go
accompanied by an indication of the reasons for the delay.

























C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 8/17









       2. The person in charge of the treatment will notify the person in charge without undue delay
of the treatment the violations of the security of the personal data of which

be aware.

       3. The notification referred to in section 1 must, at a minimum:

       a) describe the nature of the data security breach
including, where possible, the categories and approximate number of

affected stakeholders, and the categories and approximate number of data records
affected personnel;
       b) communicate the name and contact details of the data protection delegate
data or another point of contact where further information can be obtained;
       c) describe the possible consequences of the breach of the security of the

personal information;
       d) describe the measures adopted or proposed by the person responsible for the
treatment to remedy the violation of the security of personal data,
including, if applicable, the measures adopted to mitigate the possible effects
negatives.


       4. If it is not possible to provide the information simultaneously, and to the extent
where it is not, the information will be provided gradually without undue delay.

       5. The data controller will document any violation of the
security of personal data, including the facts related to it, its

effects and corrective measures taken. Such documentation will allow the
control authority verify compliance with the provisions of this article.

Although it is true that the entity claimed was aware of the incident, it adopted measures
tending to remedy the same, article 33 of the RGPD establishes

explicit that security breaches, provided that in a breach they are affected
personal data and implies a risk for the rights and freedoms of the
natural persons, must be notified by the data controller within the period of
72 hours after you have received proof of it to the Control Authority
(AEPD), a circumstance that would be fulfilled in the present case, since, in addition, the
Affected data belongs to the category of data regulated in article 9.1 of the

cited RGPD (Treatment of special categories of personal data).

In the present case, it is known that the respondent has suffered a security breach of
personal data having proof of it since July 13, 2020 and not
has notified this Agency. A rape can have a number of adverse effects

considerable in people, likely to cause damage and physical harm,
material or immaterial. The GDPR explains that these effects may include the
loss of control over your personal data, the restriction of your rights, the
discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss,
unauthorized reversal of pseudonymization, reputational damage and loss

confidentiality of personal data subject to professional secrecy. also can
include any other significant economic or social harm to those persons.



C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 9/17








Lastly, the controller himself states that (...) has caused
that the facts claimed to this Agency occurred, but the truth is that the
complainant brought the incident to the attention of the entity complained against, and the latter did

ignore the notice.

In accordance with the foregoing, it is estimated that the entity's actions could
suppose the violation of article 33 of the RGPD, an infraction typified in its article

83.4.a) of the same legal text.


FIFTH: In accordance with the evidence available in this
moment of agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what
result of the instruction, it is considered that the claimed party would fail to comply with the provisions
in article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, which could lead to the commission of an infringement
typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD.


The lack of implementation of technical and organizational measures necessary to
guarantee an adequate level of security in the processing of personal data
could constitute, on the part of the claimed entity, an infringement of the provisions of the
article 32 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.4.a) of the RGPD.


Likewise, failure to comply with the duty to notify the data protection authority
data a violation of personal data security, could constitute an infringement of
the provisions of article 33 of the Regulation, typified in article 83.4.a) of the same
legal text.


SIXTH: Article 83.5 of the RGPD provides the following:

"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for

the largest amount:

        consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;”

For its part, article 71 of the LOPDGDD, under the heading "Infringements" determines what

following:

          a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 10/17








The violation of articles 32 and 33 RGPD is typified in the article
83.4.a) of the aforementioned RGPD in the following terms:

 "4. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10,000,000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

        a) the obligations of the person in charge and the person in charge pursuant to articles 8,
            11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43.”

             (…)

For the purposes of the limitation period for infractions, article 73 of the LOPDGDD,
under the heading "Infringements considered serious", it establishes the following:

 “Based on the provisions of article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:


 (…)

 f) The lack of adoption of those technical and organizational measures that result
appropriate to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk of the treatment,
in the terms required by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

r) Failure to comply with the duty to notify the data protection authority of
a breach of security of personal data in accordance with the provisions of

Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

fine is €100,000 for infringement of article 5.1 f) of the RGPD, regarding the
violation of the principle of confidentiality and €60,000 for each of the
violations of articles 32 and 33 of the aforementioned RGPD, regarding the security of the

Lack of diligence in implementing appropriate security measures

element of guilt.


NINTH: If the infraction is confirmed, it could be agreed to impose the
adoption of appropriate measures to adjust its actions to the aforementioned regulations
in this act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the RGPD,
according to which each control authority may "order the person in charge or in charge
of the treatment that the treatment operations comply with the provisions of the

this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain way and within a
specified period…”. The imposition of this measure is compatible with the sanction
consisting of an administrative fine, as provided in art. 83.2 of the GDPR.

It is warned that not meeting the requirements of this organization may be
considered as an administrative offense in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD,
typified as an infraction in its article 83.5 and 83.6, being able to motivate such conduct the

opening of a subsequent sanctioning administrative proceeding.
