<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The worker of a company filed a complaint against their employer company (a constructor) before the Spanish DPA (AEPD). The data subject claimed that the company had shared with a public housing business entity data referring to their medical leaves and their content, including covid-19 data, and their email address.
</p><p>The controller alleged that it had shared such personal data in the course of an administrative procedure against the company.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA first noted that health data fall under the category of special categories of personal data from <a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR" title="Article 9 GDPR">Article 9 GDPR</a>. According to the AEPD, even if the controller may had relied on the exemption on <a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2f" title="Article 9 GDPR">Article 9 GDPR(2)(f)</a>, since the data were shared in the course of an administrative procedure against the company, the general data protection principles from <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5 GDPR</a> still need to be complied with.
</p><p>According to the DPA, the controller did not take into account the minimization principle, since the company did not need to share all the data subject's personal data it shared during the proceedings, specially taking into consideration the nature of health data. Even if the controller was entitled to process such data internally, they should not have shared it away without express consent of the data subject.
</p><p>Additionally, the DPA remarked that the company should not have shared the worker's email either, since the email was collected with the sole purpose of communicating with the worker, and therefore sharing it with third parties infringed the purpose limitation principle.
</p><p>Therefore, the DPA determined that the controller had infringed <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(c) GDPR</a> and fined the controller €50,000.

                             FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                              I


By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director
of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and to
solve this procedure.


                                             II

The RGPD in its article 5, "Principles relating to treatment" says that "The data
personal will be:


a) treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness,
loyalty and transparency ”);

b) collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be processed
subsequently in a manner incompatible with said purposes; in accordance with article 89,
section 1, the further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in

public interest, scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes are not
deemed incompatible with the original purposes ("purpose limitation");

c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that they are processed ("data minimization");


d) accurate and, if necessary, up-to-date; all measures will be taken
reasonable so that the personal data that
are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are processed ("accuracy");


e) maintained in a way that allows the identification of the interested parties during not
longer than necessary for the purposes of processing personal data; the
Personal data may be kept for longer periods provided that it is
treat exclusively for archival purposes in the public interest, research purposes
scientific or historical or statistical purposes, in accordance with article 89, paragraph 1,
without prejudice to the application of the appropriate technical and organizational measures that

imposes these Regulations in order to protect the rights and freedoms of the
data subject ("limitation of the conservation period");

f) treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate data security
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or illegal processing and against

its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of technical measures
or appropriate organizational ("integrity and confidentiality").

2. The person responsible for the treatment will be responsible for compliance with the provisions
in section 1 and able to demonstrate it ('proactive responsibility'). "


The offense for which the claimed person is held liable is provided for in article 83.5.
of the RGPD that establishes:


C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/10








"Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or, in the case of
of a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the volume of

total annual global business of the previous financial year, opting for the one with the highest
amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "



In turn, the LOPDGDD in its article 72.1.a) qualifies as a very serious infringement, to
prescription effects, "a) The processing of personal data violating the
principles and guarantees established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "


                                            III

In the present case, the claimant's personal data has been disclosed, such as the
personal email address and health data to the Public Entity
Housing Business-Donostiako Etxegintza, without the consent of the

claimant.

Although the claimed party is recognized legitimacy to send the data
necessary to defend against a sanctioning procedure or penalties
that could be imposed derived from the breach of a contract

administrative, it should not be forgotten that the RGPD includes health as a category of
specially protected personal data, in accordance with article 9.1 of the
RGPD, where the following is indicated:

“The processing of personal data that reveals the ethnic origin or
racial, political opinions, religious or philosophical convictions, or affiliation

union, and the treatment of genetic data, biometric data aimed at identifying
unequivocally to a natural person, data related to health or data related to
the sexual life or sexual orientation of a natural person ”.

In this sense, the claimed entity presents a written statement of allegations to the proposal

resolution indicating that in accordance with article 9.2 f) of the RGPD the data
Claimant's personal data were released for his defense against a claim.

It should be noted that the literal tenor of said precept is as follows:


"Section 1 will not apply when one of the circumstances occurs
following:

f) the treatment is necessary for the formulation, exercise or defense of
claims or when the courts act in the exercise of their judicial function; "


In this sense, it should be pointed out that although recital 52 of the
RGPD in fine establishes with respect to this exception that “it must also be authorized to
exceptional title the processing of said personal data when necessary
for the formulation, exercise or defense of claims, either by a

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/10








judicial procedure or an administrative or extrajudicial procedure ”; but nevertheless,
It must be taken into account that the use of health data, even when this
exception, it is not covered if it violates article 5.1.c) of the RGPD and the data

transferred are excessive in relation to the purpose, since the
need to specify all vacations, permits and, especially since they are data
health, casualties with their causes to seek their defense.

On the other hand, the claimed entity also alleges in its brief of allegations to the
motion for a resolution that evidence has been rejected by this body.


In this sense, it should be noted that this Agency has not rejected any evidence
presented by the claimed party, it has only been considered that with the
evidence in this procedure, it is not necessary to request the City Council of
Donostia / San Sebastián the recording of the session incorporated into the diary of sessions of

the Territory Planning and Development Commission dated December 9,
2020.

This is so because it has been proven that they have been transferred by the entity
claimed, health data of the claimant, specifically dates of medical leave,
reasons for the same and permissions, and therefore, the claimed entity has been

exceeding the processing of the personal data of the claimed party, even if it has
legitimacy for its internal use in its relations with the worker or claimant, but
you have no legitimacy to use them beyond your employment relationship with the claimant,
without your express consent.


In another vein, it has also been found that in response to the
requirement of the Public Housing Business Entity-Donostiako Etxegintza,
as a result of the complaints filed by the claimant on July 14 and July 9
September 2020 due to lack of assignment of human and material resources, the
claimed entity provided the claimant's email without having their

consent.

In this sense, the claimed entity claims to know the email of the
complainant, because it was the form of company-worker communication, so at the
facilitate the personal email of the claimant, to a third entity, has
exceeded the purpose for which said personal data was provided, thereby violating the

principle of purpose limitation, regulated in article 5.1 b) of the RGPD,
indicated in the foundation of law II.

Therefore, when the claimant's health data is transferred, (dates of medical leave,
reasons for the same and permits with their respective causes, including COVID) and the

personal email of the claimant, this Agency considers, on the one hand, that
are treating specially protected data, in accordance with article 9 of the
RGPD (health data), and on the other that personal data is being processed
(personal email) for a purpose other than mere communication between
the worker and the company, in accordance with article 5.1 b) of the RGPD.


All this results in an excessive use of personal data by the
claimed entity, since despite the fact that data protection regulations require that
the processing of personal data is adequate, pertinent and limited to what

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/10








strictly necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed, such as
consequence of the complaint filed by the claimant against the entity
claimed before the Public Housing Business Entity-Donostiako Etxegintza by

lack of assignment of human and material resources, the claimed entity has
violated the principle of data minimization, by providing said public entity
business for your defense, health data and personal email of the
claimant, which makes us face an alleged violation of the
article 5.1 c) of the RGPD, indicated in the basis of law II.


Therefore, it is considered convenient to reiterate that it is not considered necessary to require the
Donostia / San Sebastián City Council the contribution of the recording of the session
incorporated into the journal of sessions of the Development and Planning Commission of the
Territory dated December 9, 2020, as suggested by the claimed entity,
since with the documentation in this file, the

denounced events, which are ultimately an excess of personal data provided
by the claimed entity to justify its action, to the detriment of the
claimant, when processing especially sensitive data, and therefore especially
protected, such as health data, in accordance with the provisions of the
Article 9 of the RGPD.


                                           IV

Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following: “Each supervisory authority will have
of all of the following corrective powers listed below:


b) direct a warning to any person in charge or in charge of the treatment when the
treatment operations have infringed the provisions of this Regulation;

d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,

Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76, “Sanctions and
corrective measures ”, provides:

"two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 also
may be taken into account:
