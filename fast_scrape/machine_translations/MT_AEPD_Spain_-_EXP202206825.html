<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The landlord, with the consent of a tenant, installed a camera the façade of a shared villa which captured both a shared swimming pool and terrace. However, the other tenants in the same villa were not notified nor asked to consent to the installation of the cameras. One of them complained to the Spanish DPA.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA initially found a breach under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(b)</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#c" title="Article 5 GDPR">(c)</a> GDPR and fined the landlord €300. They also ordered the removal of the camera. The landlord ignored this request. On a second review of the case, the Spanish DPA raised the fine to €1,500 and changed the infringement to the lack of a legal basis under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a>. The camera was ordered to be removed within 10 working days.

Spanish Data Protection.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures

processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

                                   Previous issues

Article 4 “Definitions” of the GDPR defines the following terms for the purposes of
Regulation:


"1) 'personal data': any information about an identified natural person or
identifiable ("the interested party"); Any person will be considered an identifiable natural person
whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by
an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, data
location, an online identifier or one or more elements of identity
physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social of said person;”


“2) “treatment”: any operation or set of operations performed on
personal data or sets of personal data, whether by procedures
automated or not, such as the collection, registration, organization, structuring,
conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use,

communication by transmission, broadcast or any other form of enabling
access, collation or interconnection, limitation, deletion or destruction;”

In the present case, in accordance with article 4.1 of the GDPR, the physical image of a
person is personal data. In this way, the images generated by a system

of cameras or video cameras are personal data, so their processing
is subject to data protection regulations.

                                            III
                     Legality of the processing of personal data


Article 18 section 4 EC provides: “The law will limit the use of information technology to
guarantee the honor and personal and family privacy of citizens and the full
exercise of their rights.”

Recital 40 of the GDPR states that “For the processing to be lawful, the

Personal data must be processed with the consent of the interested party or on
any other legitimate basis established in accordance with Law, whether in the present
Regulation or under other law of the Union or of the Member States to which
referred to in this Regulation, including the need to comply with the legal obligation
applicable to the person responsible for the treatment or to the need to execute a contract with

to which the interested party is a party or in order to take measures at the request of the
interested prior to the conclusion of a contract.”



C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/11








For its part, the principles that must govern the treatment are listed
in article 5 of the GDPR. In this sense, section 1 letter a), states that: “The
personal data will be:


    a) Treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party
        (legality, loyalty and transparency);

        (…)”


The principle of legality is fundamentally regulated in article 6 of the GDPR. The
assumptions that allow the processing of personal data to be considered lawful
listed in article 6.1 of the GDPR:

1. Treatment will only be legal if at least one of the following conditions is met.

nes:

    a) the interested party gave his/her consent to the processing of his/her personal data.
        them for one or more specific purposes;

    b) the processing is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party

        sado is a party or for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures.
        them;

    c) the treatment is necessary for compliance with an applicable legal obligation.
        ble to the person responsible for the treatment;


    d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the interested party or of
        another natural person;

    e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in

        public interest or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the person responsible
        of the treatment;

    f) the processing is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests
        guided by the person responsible for the treatment or by a third party, provided that
        said interests do not prevail over the interests or functional rights and freedoms

        data of the interested party that require the protection of personal data, in
        particularly when the interested party is a child.

        The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph will not apply to the treatment.
        “action carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.”


Therefore, the “data processing” carried out with the object video surveillance camera
claim must be able to be justified on the so-called legitimizing bases, this
is, that the legality of the treatment can be proven in the list of situations or suppositions.
specific positions in which it is possible to process personal data.


In the present case, a video surveillance camera has been installed at the top of the
facade of the chalet owned by the claimed party, the claimant having rented it

part of the property (the contract has not been provided in the claim), with the right to use
of common areas (terrace and pool) and towards which the device is oriented.


As proof of these statements, the complaining party provided a report
photograph in which the presence of a white video surveillance camera is observed
in the upper part of the façade of the property mentioned, which, due to its height and position, is
focusing towards the areas mentioned above. Thus, the presence of the camera
in question involves the impact on spaces that are no longer “private” to the owner,
to be enjoyed by a third party whose rights must be respected, both

the right to privacy as the right to “protection of personal data”.

Therefore, the “personal and domestic” scope in capturing images of the areas
common (article 22.5 LOPDGDD) disappears when the temporary use and enjoyment of
private housing to a third party, becoming an area reserved for their

strictest personal and family privacy and also protected by the regulations of
data protection, which does not generally allow the collection and processing of
the same.

The right to privacy, remember, consists of guaranteeing the free development of the
individual private life of each one, without “there being interference from third parties”, the pre-

The presence of cameras focusing on shared use areas not only represents a con-
excessive control of the entrances/exits of the resident and/or companions, but
a “data processing” that is not justified in this file.

cal and by the appellant in amparo, and it has been recalled later in STC 22/2003, of

In the agreement to initiate this sanctioning procedure, the party was charged with

claimed a violation of article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5.a)
of the GDPR; considering that capturing images of shared areas
(terrace and pool) gave rise to excessive and disproportionate treatment. Thus
set as an initial assessment an administrative fine of €300 (three hundred euros) and,
as a possible measure, the removal of the device from the current location or regularization of

compliance with current regulations.

However, taking into account the above and as a consequence of the
instruction, it was considered that the legal classification of the known facts should be
different. The lack of legal basis that legitimizes the processing of personal data of the

complaining party (image) violates the provisions of article 6.1 of the RGPD.

article 83 of the RGPD -article 58.2 i)-, or the power to order the person responsible or
