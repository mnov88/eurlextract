<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>Holaluz is an electric power and gas commercialization company. It has three three channels for contracting: internet, telephone and commercial networks (with collaboration contracts).
</p><p>On July 28, 2021 four energy supply contracts were signed up through the collaborator BLANER ENERGY, S.L. for supply points associated with the data subject. 
</p><p>On December 11, 2021 the data subject contacted Holaluz communicating the identity fraud suffered in order to contract with Holaluz, stating that it was not her who signed and subscribed to the agreement.
</p><p>On May 4, 2022, the data subject initiated a procedure at AEPD against Holaluz for unlawful data processing without her consent, based on the identity theft to contract with Holaluz for electricity contracts. 
</p><p>Allegedly, based on the fraudulent contract between the data subject and Holaluz, the company proceeded with the cancellation of the energy contract the data subject had previously with another energy commercial company, Energía XXI, using her personal data without her consent. 
</p><p>As a result, there was a discharge of electric energy supplies from one of her four properties subscribed to Energía XXI. In addition, the email address given in the contract did not actually belong to the data subject.
</p><p>Holaluz alleged that was unable to detect that the contracting had been signed without the consent of the data subject, considering that the collaborator appeared to be truthful in the contracting. Holaluz affirmed that it randomly performs a subsequent review of the contract made by new employees and that Blaner carries out its activities for them both directly or through “sub-agents”.
</p><p>They also confirmed the deletion of the data subject’s personal data from its database.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>AEPD concluded that Holaluz has registered the electric energy supplies of four properties from the data subject, using her personal data, without her consent and, based on that, the processing was unlawful. 
</p><p>AEPD considered the fact that the data subject had previously subscribed to energy supplier service with Energía XXI and that the contract informed a different email address than the one the data subject has.
</p><p>In addition, although Holaluz has a system for validating the contracts made by its employees and commercial partners, AEPD considered that there is no evidence that the validation was carried out correctly in this case, since they send the contracts unsigned as well as the e-mail sent for such validation for an email that did not belong to the data subject. 
</p><p>The AEPD pointed out a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a> by processing data without an adequate basis of legitimacy, since the data subject had not given her consent to carry out such contracts. It was determined that personal data were incorporated into the company's information system without accrediting a legitimate contract, and therefore the processing was unlawful, leading to a fine of €70,000.

principle of legality, although it is true that HOLALUZ-CLIDOM, S.A, hereinafter
(CLIDOM) responds and identifies with the definitions referring to the person responsible for
treatment in articles 4 and 24.1 of the GDPR, it is before the contractual relationship that
exists with Blaner Energy 2 S.L. (hereinafter, "Blaner") for the purposes of the contract of
signed with it on March 30, 2017 and updated on December 1, 2017.

December 2021 for the performance of contract promotion services
supply of electricity and acquisition of potential customers, which is attached
for the record for the appropriate purposes as Document number 1 and 2
respectively.

For the fulfillment of the contract, the processing of personal data is required

physical, since Blaner must capture potential clients so that they register with
CLIDOM's energy supply services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
It is important to emphasize that, in the contract signed between the two parties, CLIDOM, as
responsible for the treatment, included, as a contractual obligation, Blaner, as
of treatment manager, the proactive responsibility of collecting the
consent of the interested parties in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR.

***ENCODING.4, respectively. which, as can be verified
The commercial then validated both contracts with his own email
(***USUARIO.1@gmail.com), thus perpetuating recruitment fraud:

That the person in charge Blaner, acted against the instructions of CLIDOM as soon as

Likewise, a reminder of the contractually established obligations was made
that concern the Collaborator.

                                     Competence

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the

Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures

processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."


                                           II
                           Arguments to the initiation agreement

As stated by the claimant in its statement of claim dated March 2
of 2022, that Holaluz has registered the electrical energy supplies of four
properties that the claimant had subscribed with the marketer Energía XXI

using your personal data without your consent

Definitely. The claimant denounces identity theft to contract with
Holaluz four contracts of light. The defendant alleges that the hiring was done by his
in charge of the treatment fraudulently by stating an address of
email different from the one the claimant has.


Well then, the defendant has planned a contract validation system that
carried out by those in charge, and although it indicates that in the present case the
validation correctly, there is no evidence in this regard, since it sends the contracts
without signing as well as sending the email for such validation, but there is no
evidence that such validation has been performed by someone.


It is proven that the defendant processed the personal data of the claimant without
legitimacy for it. It is clear that Holaluz (incoming marketer) had to
manage the withdrawal of the claimant's contracts with the outgoing marketer
(Energía XXI), which is done through the number of CUPS that is associated with the
households.


Law 24/2013, of December 26, of the electricity sector (hereinafter, "Law of the
Electric"), establishes the consumer's right to change company
marketer in accordance with the provisions of the European directives of the market
electricity inside.

For this, the regulations establish the general process that must be carried out between the
new marketer or incoming marketer, the distributor and the

existing marketer or outgoing marketer. Said change implies the registration of
a new energy supply contract with the incoming retailer and the deregistration
of the existing contract with the outgoing marketer, through an agent who
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/17








execute the change that is the distributor.

Likewise, article 46 of the Electricity Sector Law establishes among the obligations
of the marketers, in its section 1 letter g) that of "Formalize the contracts of
supply with consumers in accordance with the regulations that result

of application". The mention by the Law of the obligation to formalize the contract between
the obligations of the marketers shows that it is the
marketer the holder of the supply contract with the consumer. Therefore,
corresponds to the retailer and, in the event of a change of retailer, to the
incoming marketer, verify the identity and the voluntary, correct and informed

provision of consent by the consumer, who is his counterpart in the
supply contract.

In this sense, the new marketer (the defendant) will have to manage the cancellation
of the claimant's contract with its outgoing retailer (Energía XXI), which is

treats your personal data.


Thus, having been accredited that the defendant processed the personal data
of the claimant, who denies her consent to the treatment, and while the first
has not provided any evidence to disprove such evidence, it is estimated that the
facts that are submitted to the evaluation of this Agency could constitute
an infringement of article 6.1 of the GDPR, infringement typified in article 83.5 of the
aforementioned Regulation 2016/679.

                                            II


                                  breached obligation

Article 6.1 of the GDPR establishes the assumptions that allow the use of
processing of personal data.



"1. Processing will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following
conditions:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data

for one or more specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;


c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;

d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or of another

Physical person.

e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller;


C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/17








f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said

interests do not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child.


The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the treatment
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.”
On this question of the legality of the treatment, Recital 40 also affects
of the aforementioned GDPR, when it provides that "For the treatment to be lawful, the
Personal data must be processed with the consent of the interested party or on

some other legitimate basis established in accordance with Law, either in the present
Regulation or by virtue of another Law of the Union or of the Member States to which
referred to in this Regulation, including the need to comply with the legal obligation
applicable to the data controller or the need to perform a contract with
to which the interested party is a party or in order to take measures at the request of the

concerned prior to the conclusion of a contract."

In relation to the above, it is considered that there is evidence that the treatment
data of the claimant object of this claim has been made without csa
legitimizing the data collected in article 6 of the GDPR.


The GDPR applies to personal data, which is defined as "personal data":
any information about an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject");
An identifiable natural person shall be considered any person whose identity can be
be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as
for example a name, an identification number, location data, a

online identifier or one or more elements of physical identity,
physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social of said person.

The documentation in the file shows that the defendant violated the
Article 6.1 of the GDPR, since it processed the personal data of

the claimant without having any standing to do so. The personal data of
the claimant were incorporated into the company's information systems, without
that he has proven that he had contracted legitimately, disposed of his
consent to the collection and further processing of your personal data, or
there was some other cause that would make the treatment carried out lawful.

The personal data of the claimant were registered in the files of the

claimed and were processed for the issuance of invoices for services associated with the
claimant. Consequently, it has processed personal data without
that has accredited that it has the legal authorization to do so.

Article 6.1 of the GDPR states that processing "will be lawful if it is necessary for the
performance of a contract to which the interested party is a party.

It was therefore essential that the defendant prove to this Agency that the

claimant had contracted with it for the supply of electricity; that at the time
of the recruitment had deployed (through its treatment manager) the
diligence that the circumstances of the case required to ensure that the person

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/17








who canceled the service with the marketer "Energía XXI", registering with
Holaluz was indeed its headline.

It should be noted that the defendant in his response to the request for information
of this Agency dated April 28, 2022 and in its allegations to the Agreement of
Start dated May 16, 2023 acknowledges that the email address

consigned in the contract did not actually belong to the owner, but was
“knowingly facilitated by the Collaborator to perpetuate his fraud, something that, in
principle, it was impossible to detect on this part, despite the control mechanisms
established”.

Email dated January 17, 2022 addressed from

gestiones@holaluz.es to ***USUARIO.2@blanerenergy.es in which the
claim received in relation to the contracted CUPS. In it it is stated that
“the contracts were validated from an email that is not yours
***USUARIO.1@gmail.com" and information is requested in this regard.

Email dated January 24, 2022 addressed from

gestiones@holaluz.es to ***USUARIO.2@blanerenergy.es in which it communicates
that has to deal with the claim since it does not have the "sales call" and
expresses that "the channel will have to take charge of the invoices until the date of
low".

Well then, Holaluz has planned a contract validation system that

carried out by those in charge, and although it indicates that in the present case the
validation correctly, there is no evidence in this regard, since it sends the contracts
without signing as well as sending the email for such validation, but there is no
certainty that such validation has been performed.


Hence, the defendant does not accredit a basis of legitimacy for the treatment of the
data of the complaining party.

In this sense, Recital 40 of the GDPR states:

 "(40) For processing to be lawful, personal data must be processed with
the consent of the interested party or on some other established legitimate basis
in accordance with Law, either in this Regulation or under another Law

of the Union or of the Member States referred to in this Regulation,
including the need to comply with the legal obligation applicable to the data controller
treatment or the need to execute a contract in which the interested party is a party or
in order to take measures at the request of the interested party prior to the
conclusion of a contract."

                                         IV.

                       Classification and classification of the offense

In accordance with the evidence available at the present time of
agreement to start the disciplinary procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction, it is considered that the facts exposed fail to comply with the provisions of the
article 6.1 of the GDPR, so it could mean the commission of an infringement

typified in article 83.5 of the GDPR, which provides the following:
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/17









 Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5, 6, 7 and 9.”


The LOPDGD, for the purposes of the prescription of infringements, qualifies in its article
72.1 of very serious infractions, being in this case the limitation period of three
years, "b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation

(EU) 2016/679”.

                                           V
                                 Sanction proposal

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the

provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR, precepts that state:

"Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of administrative fines
under this Article for infringements of this Regulation
indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are effective in each individual case,
proportionate and dissuasive.”

"Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each

individual case, in addition to or in lieu of the measures contemplated in
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case shall be duly taken into account:

a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question

such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that
have suffered;

b) intentionality or negligence in the infraction;

c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to
alleviate the damages and losses suffered by the interested parties;

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor,
taking into account the technical or organizational measures that they have applied under

of articles 25 and 32;

e) any previous infringement committed by the controller or processor;

 f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the
infringement and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the infringement;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/17








h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in
particular whether the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, if so, in what
extent;

i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been ordered

previously against the person in charge or the person in charge in relation to the
same matter, compliance with said measures;

j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or to mechanisms of
certification approved in accordance with article 42, and

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,
such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, through the infringement.”

Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the GDPR, the LOPDGDD, article 76,
"Sanctions and corrective measures", provides:

"2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

may also be taken into account:

a) The continuing nature of the offence.

b) The link between the activity of the offender and the performance of data processing.

personal information.

c) The benefits obtained as a consequence of the commission of the infraction.

d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have led to the commission

of the offence.

e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the
violation, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.


f) The affectation of the rights of minors.

g) Have, when it is not mandatory, a data protection delegate.

h) Submission by the person responsible or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to

alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which
there are controversies between those and any interested party.”


In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the fine to
impose on the defendant, as responsible for an infraction typified in article

83.5.a) of the GDPR, in an initial assessment, the following are considered concurrent
