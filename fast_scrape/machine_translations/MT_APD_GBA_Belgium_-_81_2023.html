<p>The Belgian DPA confirmed that CCTV images made to protect against littering and illegal dumping can be used to fine a data subject doing the littering, based on public interest under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1e" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(e) GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>The DPA also noted that person combining the roles of DPO and safety consultant could pose a breach of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_38_GDPR#6" title="Article 38 GDPR">Article 38(6) GDPR</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>An area was plagued by illegal dumping. To combat this, a CCTV camera was placed. A data subject received a letter stating that he could receive a fine for leaving bottles next to the designated deposit area.
</p><p>The data subject asked the DPA whether the CCTV images could be used to impose a fine.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA started by clarifying that there are two parties involved in the CCTV data processing. The controller of the images itself (a municipality), and a processor who used these images to impose fines. 
</p><p>The DPA held that the controller can rely on public interest under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1e" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(e) GDPR</a> to prevent illegal dumping, littering, and protecting public cleanliness. On top of that, the controller followed all the requirements as set out by article 5 Camerawet and articles 1 and 4 of KB 10 februari 2008. 
</p><p>The DPA did find several shortcomings in the Record of Processing Activities of the processor: incomplete contact details of the processor and the controller, incomplete &amp; unclear categories of data subjects. As such, the DPA concluded a breach of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_30_GDPR#2a" title="Article 30 GDPR">article 30(2)(a) GDPR</a>. The DPA noted that the DPO of the processor is also a safety consultant. This could result in a breach of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_38_GDPR#6" title="Article 38 GDPR">Article 38(6) GDPR</a> when the DPO has tasks that enable him to decide the purpose and means of processing. 
</p><p>The DPA reprimanded the processor for not having a complete Record of Processing Activities. The DPA dismissed all other grievances.

II. Motivation


    II.1. Identification of the controller and processor


 10. The Disputes Chamber finds that both the complaint and the complainant's answer to the

       questions from the Inspectorate clearly stipulate that the complaint is directed against the second

       defendant. In his complaint, the complainant asks whether the security camera
       collected footage of him that was used for the imposition of a GAS

       fine was validly imposed. However, investigations by the Inspectorate show that the

       first defendant is the data controller for the surveillance camera

       described in the complaint and that the second defendant acts as a processor in this context

       the framework of the writing of the GAS fine based on the camera images. The parties

       do not dispute this finding. The first defendant must therefore be qualified
       as controller and the second defendant as processor as regards

       the processing at issue.


    II.2. Article 5, paragraph 1, a) (lawfulness) in conjunction with Article 6, paragraph 1 GDPR and Article 5, paragraph 2 in conjunction with Article 24,
         paragraph 1 GDPR


 11. The contested processing in the present case concerns the making of visual material by one
       or multiple cameras at the bottle bank where this footage was used afterwards in Decision on the substance 81/2023 – 4/11


     in the context of imposing a GAS fine. The question arises whether the processing of

     personal data by these surveillance cameras is done lawfully and or in this

     framework, appropriate technical and organizational measures have been taken to ensure the
     to ensure compliance with the GDPR.


12. The Litigation Chamber recalls that pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) GDPR personal data

     must be lawfully processed. This means that the processing must be done on

     on the basis of the processing grounds as set out in Article 6(1) GDPR.

13. Based on its investigation, the Inspectorate determines that the processing is necessary

     for the performance of a task of general interest or of a task within the framework of the

     exercise of public authority vested in the controller
     assigned (Article 6(1)(e) GDPR). The public interest task in question is it

     preventing and combating illegal dumping, litter and protecting the public

     cleanliness and health. The inspection report also refers to Article 9.3 of this

     the general police regulation Y1, which stipulates that, when a violation of a

     determination is committed with a motor vehicle, in the absence of the driver, the
     administrative fine is imposed on the holder of the registration plate of

     the vehicle. The holder of the registration plate may prove by any means who is on the

     was driving the vehicle at the time of the facts. If the license plate holder has the

     does not rebut or deny the infringement, the administrative fine will be charged to him. In

     in its privacy statement, the first defendant also informs the data subjects that

     personal data can be processed in the context of the public interest. Having
     based on the above, the Inspectorate comes to the conclusion that the processing of the

     personal data of the complainant takes place in the context of the public interest and that

     this processing is necessary for the performance of that task of public interest,

     as a result of which no infringement of Article 5 (1) a) and Article 6 (1) GDPR is established.

14. Article 24(1) of the GDPR obliges the controller to, account

     taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, as well as the

     risks of varying likelihood and severity to the rights and freedoms of

     natural persons, take appropriate technical and organizational measures to
     to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing is in accordance with GDPR

     is carried out. These measures should also be evaluated and if necessary

     updated. This article reflects the principle laid down in Article 5(2) of the GDPR

     of "accountability", according to which "the controller

     responsible for compliance with paragraph 1 and must be able to demonstrate this". Article 24(2).
     of the GDPR stipulates that, when proportionate to the processing activities,

     the measures referred to in Article 24(1) of the GDPR, an appropriate

     include data protection policies to be adopted by the controller Substantive decision 81/2023 – 5/11


     executed. Since no infringement of Article 5 (1) (a) and Article 6 (1) GDPR was made

     established, the Inspectorate concludes that there is no infringement of

     Article 5 (2) and Article 24 (1) GDPR.

15. Based on the inspection report and considering that the complainant has no arguments

     arguments to the contrary, the Disputes Chamber sees no reason to do so

     to take a different position in this regard. Consequently, the

     Litigation Chamber that there is no violation of Article 5(1)(a) and (2),

     Article 6(1) and Article 24(1) of the GDPR in respect of the first defendant.

   II.3. Article 5 Camera Act and Articles 1 and 4 Royal Decree of 10 February 2008


16. Based on article 5 of the Camera, articles 1 and 4 of the KB of 10 February 2008.

     it is necessary for the controller to comply with certain rules if he wants to

     proceed to the installation and use of one or more permanent surveillance cameras
     an unenclosed place. The obligations from the aforementioned articles, the compliance of which

     is examined in the context of the inspection investigation can be summarized as

     follows:

          a. the decision to place is made by a public authority that

              is the controller;


          b. even before the placement, the controller must receive a positive advice

              from the relevant municipal council, which consults the chief of police for this purpose;

          c. access to the data is not decided by the controller

              place an icon indicating that camera surveillance is taking place.

              That pictogram must be in accordance with Articles 1 and 4 of the Royal Decree of

              February 10, 2008 are applied to an aluminum plate of at least 1.5 mm
              thickness with dimensions of 0.60 x 0.40 m and determined in a visible and legible manner

              contain entries.


   17. During the inspection investigation, the first defendant alleges the following:

      “


          a. This concerns a temporary fixed surveillance camera in a non-enclosed place,

              throughout the territory of the municipality. The municipality uses permanent

              temporary surveillance cameras. That is why there are on all approach roads of the municipality
              icons applied. You can find photos and examples of these icons

              can be found in appendix 2, as well as the work order to place the pictograms

              (attachment 3). The pictograms are drawn up in accordance with the Royal Decree of

              February 10, 2008 about reporting camera surveillance. An example of one

              inscription under the pictogram can be found in appendix 4. Decision on the substance 81/2023 – 6/11


          b. The camera is said to have been in use since March 2019 to the present as the municipality

              regarded this location as a fly-tipping sensitive location and still do

              case would be.

          c. An advice was obtained from the chief constable for the placement of this camera

              and you can find this advice in appendix 5, in particular in point 2.1 on portable ones

              (temporarily fixed) cameras.

          d. The chief of police was consulted before the camera was placed as well as the

              social security service, environment service, community guards

              and other members of the local police force.

          e. A decision was taken by the Y1 City Council in this regard. It

              an extract can be found in appendix 6.”


18. After examining these answers and the appendices, the Inspectorate concludes that

     article 5 of the Camera Act and articles 1 and 4 of the Royal Decree of 10 February 2008 were
     complied.


19. In view of the inspection report and the fact that the complainant does not put forward any counterarguments, sees

     the Disputes Chamber has no reason to take a different position in this regard.

     The Disputes Chamber therefore concludes that there is no question of a violation of
     Article 5 of the Camera Know Articles 1 and 4 of the Royal Decree of 10 February 2008

     of the first defendant.


   II.4. Article 30, paragraph 1, paragraph 2 and paragraph 3 GDPR

20. Based on the register of processing activities, the Inspectorate determines that the

     second defendant carries out processing of personal data, both as processor and

     in the capacity of controller. The Inspectorate will therefore also check the

     assess compliance of the second defendant with the requirements regarding this register in the

     light of the applicable capacity and respective obligations.

21. Pursuant to Article 30(1) GDPR, each controller must maintain a register

     keep track of the processing activities that come under its responsibility

     executed. Article 30(1)(a) to (g) GDPR stipulates that, with regard to the

     processing operations carried out in the capacity of controller, the following

     information must be available:

     a) the name and contact details of the controller and any

         joint controllers and, where applicable, of the

         representative of the controller and of the officer for

         data protection;

     b) the processing purposes; Decision on the substance 81/2023 – 7/11


     c) a description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of

         personal data;

     d) the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be

         provided, including recipients in third countries or international organisations;

     e) where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or a

         international organisation, including the reference to that third country or countries

         international organization and, in the case of the organizations referred to in Article 49(1) second subparagraph GDPR,

         such transfers, the documents concerning the appropriate safeguards;

     f) if possible, the envisaged time limits within which the different categories of

         data must be erased;


     g) if possible, a general description of the technical and organizational
         security measures as referred to in Article 32 (1) GDPR.


22. Pursuant to Article 30(2) GDPR, the processor shall keep a record of all

     categories of processing activities they perform for a
     controller have done. This register contains the following information:


     a) the name and contact details of the processors and of each

         controller on behalf of which the processor is acting, and, in
         where applicable, of the representative of the controller or

         the processor and of the data protection officer;


     b) the categories of processing operations carried out on behalf of each
         controller have been carried out;


     c) where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or a

         international organisation, specifying that third country or international organisation

         organization and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the
         documents on the appropriate safeguards;


     d) if possible, a general description of the technical and organizational

         security measures as referred to in Article 32(1).

23. The Inspection Service deals with the register of processing activities of the second

     the following findings, as summarized below.

24. The record of the processing activities of the second defendant that was provided

     to the Inspection Service does not meet the aforementioned minimum requirements. Specifically, the

     Inspectorate established the following infringements in that regard: Decision on the substance 81/2023 – 8/11


     a) the contact details of the second defendant are not complete (cf. Article 30(1)(a))

         and paragraph 2, a) of the GDPR) since the e-mail addresses […] and […] from the website and the

         privacy statement of the second defendant (documents 13 and 14) are not mentioned;

     b) the description of the categories of data subjects is incomplete (cf. Article 30(1)(c))

         of the GDPR) since in the columns “Category data subject” the words are used several times

         become “employees”, “politicians” and “contact persons of affiliated partners”.

         mentionwhile it is not clear through a description what those words concretely mean

     c) the description of the categories of personal data is incomplete (cf. Article 30,

         paragraph 1, c) of the GDPR) since in the columns “Category of personal data”

         repeatedly the words “personal identification data”, “criminal

         data”, “medical data”, and “financial data” are mentioned while not

         it is clear through a description what those words mean concretely;

     d) the name and contact details of each controller responsible for processing

         of which the second defendant acts as a processor are not listed (cf. Article 30,

         paragraph 2, a) AVG) and are therefore missing in the tabs "Administrative enforcement" and, among other things
         “Neighborhood works”.


25. The Litigation Chamber points out that in order to effectively fulfill the obligations contained in the GDPR

     can apply, it is essential that the controller and the

     processors have an overview of the processing of personal data they carry out
     to carry out. This register is therefore primarily an instrument for

     assist controller or processor in GDPR compliance for the

     various data processing operations that it performs because the registry is the most important

     reveal its features. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that this

     processing register is an essential tool in the context of the already mentioned

     accountability (article 5, paragraph 2, and article 24 GDPR) and that this register is the basis
     to all obligations that the GDPR imposes on the controller and processor

     imposes. It is therefore important that it is complete and correct.


26. On December 7, 2022, the Disputes Chamber has an amended register of

     processing activities from the second defendant. The Disputes Chamber states
     established that this register of processing activities meets various requirements

     findings of the Inspectorate.


27. With regard to the last determination of the Inspectorate, namely the statement of
     the name and contact details of each data controller

     of which the second defendant is acting, the Disputes Chamber notes that this is not yet the case

     was met. The Disputes Chamber finds that the second defendant for

     various processing operations as a processor, without clarifying for which Decision on the substance 81/2023 – 9/11


       controller it acts. Thus, the Disputes Chamber rules that there is

       is an infringement of Art. 30(2)(a) GDPR.


 28. For the sake of completeness, the Disputes Chamber points out that from the register of
       processing activities shows that the functions of data protection officer

       and the safety consultant are carried out by the same person. In this regard, the

       Litigation Chamber notes that the Court of Justice has recently ruled that there may be

       of a conflict of interest within the meaning of Article 38(6) GDPR when to an officer

       for data protection other tasks or duties are entrusted to him

       would convey the purposes of and means of the processing

       establish personal data with the controller or its processor.
       This has to be done on a case by case basis based on an assessment of all

       relevant circumstances, in particular the organizational structure of the

       controller or its processor, and in the light of the applicable regulation

       in its entirety, including any policy of the
                                                      3
       controller or its processor.

 29. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that the second defendant, the processing register, she

       it incomplete, has it transferred in electronic form by mail at the first request&#160;?

       of the Inspectorate. Consequently, the Litigation Chamber rules that there is no infringement of

       Article 30 (3) GDPR.

III. Sanctions


 30. On the basis of the documents in the file, the Disputes Chamber establishes that there is

       a violation of Article 30 paragraph 2, a) GDPR.

    III.1. Infringement of Article 30 (2) (a) GDPR


 32. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that a reprimand based on Article 100, §1, 5 WOG in

       this case is designated for the infringement of Article 30(2)(a) GDPR. The Dispute Room

       ruled that the register of processing activities provided by the

       second defendant is incomplete, as established in the inspection report. In this context

       the Litigation Chamber notes that, although the second defendant is admittedly currently

       steps to rectify these breaches, too little effort has been made

       are to finalize the register of processing activities as provided for in Article 30

       AVG.Again in this regard, the Litigation Chamber once again points out that the AVG is already almost

       applicable for five years and entered into force seven years ago.

    III.2. Other grievances


 33. The Litigation Chamber proceeds to a deposit of the other grievances and findings of the

       Inspectorate because, based on the facts and the documents in the file, they do not belong to the

       conclude that there has been a breach of the GDPR. These grievances and

       findings of the Inspectorate are therefore regarded as manifestly unfounded

       within the meaning of Art. 57(4) GDPR.


IV. Publication of the decision


 34. Given the importance of transparency with regard to decision-making by the

       Litigation Chamber, this decision will be published on the website of the

       Data Protection Authority. However, it is not necessary for the
