<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On the 14 October 2022, the data subject alleged a violation of his right to access under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15 GDPR</a> by the controller. The Austrian DPA (<i><a href="/index.php?title=DSB_(Austria)" title="DSB (Austria)">Datenschutzbehörde – DSB</a></i>) however rejected the complaint on the 18 October 2022. 
</p><p>The DSB detailed that the data subject had lodged his first complaint on the 3 September 2018 and since then he had followed it with 73 other complaints. The DSB held that although <a href="/index.php?title=Article_57_GDPR#4" title="Article 57 GDPR">Article 57(4) GDPR</a> does not specify the meaning of “excessive”, it certainly indicates that a high number of complaints can be considered excessive. The DSB went on to say that the initiated proceedings were legally complex and the statements made by the data subject were very detailed which meant that a lot of resources would be necessary for the assessment of the case. As <a href="/index.php?title=Article_57_GDPR#4" title="Article 57 GDPR">Article 57(4) GDPR</a> enables the supervisory authority to choose between implementing a fee or refusing to process the complaint, the DSB found itself validated in its decision to reject the complaint. 
</p><p>The data subject appealed the decision of the DSB to the Austrian Federal Administrative Court (<i><a href="/index.php?title=Category:BVwG_(Austria)" title="Category:BVwG (Austria)">Bundesverwaltungsgericht - BVwG</a></i>). The data subject posed that the DSB had given no legal justification for the rejection of the complaint proceedings. The BVwG paused its assessment of the matter until the conclusion of the CJEU case <a href="/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C-416/23_%C3%96sterreichische_Datenschutzbeh%C3%B6rde" class="mw-redirect" title="CJEU - C-416/23 Österreichische Datenschutzbehörde">C-416/23</a> which had been referred to the CJEU by the Supreme Administrative Court of Austria (<i><a href="/index.php?title=Category:VwGH_(Austria)" title="Category:VwGH (Austria)">Verwaltungsgerichtshof – VwGH</a></i>). The CJEU in <a href="/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C-416/23_%C3%96sterreichische_Datenschutzbeh%C3%B6rde" class="mw-redirect" title="CJEU - C-416/23 Österreichische Datenschutzbehörde">C-416/23</a> held that placing a numerical threshold on complaints would undermine the data subject's rights. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The BVwG held that the DSB had failed to carry out an investigation into whether the data subject had abusive intensions. The BVwG found that there were no indications on an abusive intension of the data subject. Therefore, the BVwG concluded that the rejection of the complaint had been unlawful. 
</p><p>The BVwG reverted the case back to the DSB for an adequate assessment of the claims.

DECISION
The Federal Administrative Court, through Judge Mag. Mathias VEIGL as chairman and
the expert lay judge Mag. Gerda Ferch-Fischer and the expert lay judge
Dr. Wolfgang Goricnik as assessor on the complaint of XXXX, represented by Thurnher

Wittwer Pfefferkorn &amp; Partner Rechtsanwälte GmbH, against the decision of the

data protection authority of XXXX regarding the refusal to deal with a

data protection complaint pursuant to Art. 57 Para. 4 GDPR, decided:

A)

I: The suspension decision W298 2263726-1/5Z of August 23, 2023 is remedied ex officio as a result of the

announcement of the judgment of the ECJ-416/23 of January 9, 2025 in accordance with Section 68 Para. 1 and 2 AVG in conjunction with

Section 11 VwGVG.

II: The contested decision is remedied in accordance with Section 28 Para. 3 second sentence VwGVG and the

matter is referred back to the data protection authority for the issuance of a new decision.

B)

The appeal is not admissible according to Art. 133 para. 4 B-VG. - 2 -

Reasoning:

I. Procedure:

1. In his complaint dated October 14, 2022 addressed to the data protection authority (DSB, authority concerned before the

Federal Administrative Court), the

complainant alleged a violation of his right to information pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR by

XXXX (respondent before the authority concerned, co-involved party before the

Federal Administrative Court) and, in summary, argued that he had received

insufficient information and that the co-involved party had recently stopped responding to

his inquiry. The complaint was accompanied by a request for information from the

complainant to the co-involved party, various emails and the co-involved party's data protection declaration.

2. With the now contested decision of October 18, 2022, the complaint was rejected. The authority concerned stated that the complainant had submitted his first complaint to the data protection authority on September 3, 2018. Since then, the complainant has filed 73 further proceedings, which are specified in more detail in the decision. Legally, the authority concerned concluded from this that a data subject is in principle free to assert his rights as a data subject without further justification by filing a complaint. According to Art. 57 para. 4 GDPR, this does not apply to manifestly unfounded or - especially in the case of frequent repetition - excessive requests. Even if the regulatory authority generally leaves it open in which cases one can speak of an "excessive" complaint, the wording of Art. 57 para. 4 GDPR, that this is to be assumed in particular in the case of a significantly

increased number of applications and procedures.

The authority concerned is of the opinion that the now more than 70 complaints of the

complainant are to be qualified as "frequent repetition" within the meaning of Art. 57 para. 4 GDPR. The degree of complexity of the procedures initiated by the complainant at the

authority concerned is high and, also due to the consistently very - 3 -

comprehensive statements of the complainant, an above-average

number of resources of the authority concerned are tied up on them.

In the case of excessive requests, the supervisory authority can demand a reasonable fee

or refuse to act on the request.

The word "or" in Art. 57 para. 4 GDPR indicates that it is at the discretion of a supervisory authority whether it imposes costs or refuses to act.

Article 57(4) GDPR does not contain an obligation to impose costs first and only to refuse to process the data if this step is ineffective. Moreover, this provision corresponds in content to the "abuse clause" in Article 12(5) leg.cit and therefore reference can also be made to the literature available on this subject. In this regard, it is argued that the controller has a right of choice.

Against this background, the authority concerned came to the conclusion that the processing of the complaint had to be refused due to the excessive nature of the complainant's requests.

3. The complainant lodged an appeal against this decision with the Federal Administrative Court within the deadline and argued in summary that the authority concerned had made incorrect and incomplete findings of fact and had unlawfully refused to deal with the complaint. The contested decision neither made sufficient findings of excessiveness, nor did it contain a comprehensible assessment of the evidence or a legal justification as to why the rejection of the complaint in question was arbitrary.

4. In a letter dated November 30, 2022, the authority concerned submitted the complaint and the associated administrative act to the Federal Administrative Court for a decision. A statement was made to the effect that the complaint was disputed in its entirety and reference was made to the contested decision.

5. The case in question was taken away from the originally responsible judicial division based on the order of the

Business Allocation Committee dated May 31, 2023 and reassigned to judicial division W298 on June 12, 2023. - 4 -

6. By decision of June 27, 2023, the Administrative Court referred the following questions to the ECJ for a binding interpretation of Union law:

"The following questions are referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling pursuant to Article 267 TFEU:

1. Is the term "requests" or "request" in Article 57(4) of Regulation (EU)

2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR) to be interpreted as also including "complaints" pursuant to Article 77(1) GDPR?

If question 1 is answered in the affirmative:

2. Is Article 57 (4) GDPR to be interpreted in such a way that it is sufficient for the existence of "excessive requests" that a data subject has merely addressed a certain number of requests (complaints under Article 77 (1) GDPR) to a supervisory authority within a certain period of time, regardless of whether they concern different facts and/or the requests (complaints) concern different controllers, or does it require an intention of abuse on the part of the data subject in addition to the frequent repetition of requests (complaints)?

3. Is Article 57 (4) GDPR to be interpreted in such a way that the supervisory authority, in the event of a "manifestly unfounded" or "excessive" request (complaint), can freely choose whether to charge a reasonable fee based on the administrative costs for processing it or to refuse to process it from the outset;

If the answer is negative, what circumstances and criteria must the supervisory authority take into account, in particular whether the supervisory authority is obliged to charge an appropriate fee as a

less invasive measure, and only if it is

hopeless to collect a fee to prevent manifestly

unfounded or excessive requests (complaints) is it entitled to refuse to process them?"

7. By decision W298 2263736-1/5Z of August 23, 2023, the

Federal Administrative Court suspended the proceedings pursuant to Section 38 (1) AVG in conjunction with Section 17 VwGVG until the relevant preliminary ruling of the ECJ in case C-416/23.

8. On January 9, 2025, the judgment of the ECJ C-416/23 was announced.

II. The Federal Administrative Court considered: - 5 -

1. Findings:

1.1. The procedure listed under point I is the basis for the findings.

1.2. In its judgment of January 9, 2025, the ECJ stated the following on the questions referred as far as relevant:

“For these reasons, the Court (First Chamber) has ruled:

1. Article 57(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council

of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) is to be interpreted as meaning that the term “request” contained therein

includes complaints under Article 57(1)(f) and Article 77(1) of Regulation 2016/679. 2. Article 57(4) of Regulation 2016/679 must be interpreted as meaning that requests cannot be classified as ‘excessive’ within the meaning of that provision solely on the basis of their number during a given period, since the exercise of the power provided for in that provision requires the supervisory authority to demonstrate the existence of an abusive intention on the part of the person making the request.

3. Article 57(4) of Regulation 2016/679 is to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of excessive requests, a supervisory authority may choose, by reasoned decision, whether to charge a reasonable fee based on the administrative costs or to refuse to act on the request, taking into account all relevant circumstances and ensuring that the option chosen is appropriate, necessary and proportionate."

1.3. The authority concerned did not conduct any investigation into an intention to abuse the complainant or the alleged violation of the right to information pursuant to Article 15 GDPR by XXXX and found that the complainant had submitted 73 complaints since

September 3, 2018. There was no further (identifiable) investigation or findings at all.

2. Assessment of evidence: - 6 -

The above findings are based on the harmless contents of the files. The

request for a preliminary ruling is under Austrian Administrative Court - GDPR:

Are complaints pursuant to Art. 77 Para. 1 GDPR "requests" within the meaning of Art.

57 Para. 4 GDPR, and if so, under what conditions can the data protection authority

describe the processing of complaints as "excessive requests" within the meaning of Art. (vwgh.gv.at)?

The ECJ's ruling is available in its German version under CURIA - Documents.

The findings under 1.3. arise from the harmless contents of the files.

3. Legal assessment:

3.1. According to Section 6 of the Federal Administrative Court Act (BVwGG), the

Federal Administrative Court decides by single judges, unless federal or state laws

provide for a decision by senates.

The contested decision is based on a decision by the authority concerned in accordance with Article 57

Paragraph 4 GDPR or Section 24 DSG. This matter is covered by

Senate decisions in accordance with Section 27 DSG.

The procedure of the administrative courts with the exception of the Federal Finance Court is regulated by

the VwGVG, BGBl. I 2013/33 as amended by BGBl. I 2013/122 (Section 1 leg.cit.). According to Section 58 Para. 2

VwGVG, conflicting provisions that were already published at the time this federal law came into force remain in force.

According to Section 17 VwGVG, unless otherwise provided in this federal law, the provisions of the AVG with the exception of Sections 1 to 5 and Part IV, the provisions of the Federal Fiscal Code - BAO, Federal Law Gazette No. 194/1961, the Agricultural Procedure Act - AgrVG, Federal Law Gazette No. 173/1950, and the Civil Service Procedure Act 1984 - DVG, Federal Law Gazette No. 29/1984, and, in addition, those procedural provisions in federal or state laws that the authority applied or should have applied in the procedure preceding the procedure before the administrative court, are to be applied mutatis mutandis to the procedure on complaints pursuant to Article 130 Paragraph 1 B-VG.

Re A)

3.2. Art. 12 Para. 5 GDPR states: - 7 -

"Information pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 and all notifications and measures

pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 shall be provided free of charge. In the case of

manifestly unfounded or - in particular if repetitive -

excessive requests from a data subject, the controller may either

a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information

or notification or implementing the requested measure,

or

b) refuse to act on the request."

Art. 57 Para. 4 GDPR states:

In the case of manifestly unfounded or - in particular if repetitive -

excessive requests, the supervisory authority may charge a reasonable fee based on the administrative costs or refuse to act on the request.

In this case, the supervisory authority bears the burden of proof of the manifestly unfounded or excessive nature of the request.

3.3. On A)

Ad I)

According to Section 68 AVG, which is also to be applied mutatis mutandis in administrative court proceedings according to Section 17 VwGVG, an authority or a court can, of its own motion, revoke or amend decisions, or in the case of administrative courts, decisions from which no right has accrued to anyone, from the authority (or court) that issued the decision (decision).

In the present case, the court had to answer a main question in the sense of a relevant question referred for a preliminary ruling pending before the ECJ and suspended the proceedings until this question had been answered.

After the suspension effects cease to apply - in this specific case after the ECJ's ruling has been announced - and the resulting revival of the obligation to decide, the procedure must be continued by the authority (the administrative court) ex officio (VwGH March 9, 2020, Ra 2019/12/0057) (cf. Hengstschläger/Leeb, General Administrative Procedure Act 1991 to Section 38, marginal no. 48). - 8 - The suspension decision therefore had to be remedied ex officio. Ad II) Remediation and lack of investigations: As can be seen from the findings and the course of the proceedings, the authority concerned assumed that the complainant had acted excessively in accordance with Article 57, paragraph 4 of the GDPR and did not deal with the substance of the complaint, but refused to deal with the complaint. The answer to the question submitted shows that excessiveness in accordance with Article 57(4) GDPR only exists if the authority concerned can prove an intention to abuse. However, no investigations or findings can be identified in this regard. The decision of the court hearing the case also does not indicate how the complainant's intention to abuse could be identified. Investigations into the alleged violation of law were also not carried out. This means that the rejection of the complaint was not lawful. According to the case law of the Administrative Court, the matter can be referred back to the administrative authority to carry out the necessary investigations in accordance with Section 28(4) GDPR. 3 second sentence VwGVG particularly applies if the administrative authority has failed to carry out any necessary investigative activity, if it has only taken completely unsuitable investigative steps to determine the relevant facts or has only carried out preliminary investigations. The same applies if there are concrete indications that the administrative authority failed to carry out (e.g. difficult) investigations so that these could then be carried out by the administrative court (cf. VwGH 25.01.2017, Zl. Ra 2016/12/0109, Rz

18ff.; VwGH 26.06.2014, Zl. Ro 2014/04/0063).

According to the established case law of the VwGH, the VwG must provide comprehensible reasons if it (exceptionally) assumes that a meritorious decision-making authority does not exist. It must therefore explain that and for what reasons the requirements for a substantive decision pursuant to Section 28 (2) VwGVG 2014 are not met, in particular in what way the facts relevant to the decision are not established and to what extent any necessary additions would not have to be made by the VwG itself (see, for example, VwGH of December 20, 2021, Ra 2021/22/0201 and of May 26, 2021, Ra 2018/22/0132). - 9 - The present facts were only determined by the authority concerned with regard to the fact that the number of complaints made to the authority concerned was determined. However, an official investigation of the facts based on the complainant's application was completely omitted. The authority concerned would then have had to examine whether the parties involved had violated the complainant's right to information or what constituted an intention to abuse the information in accordance with Article 57 (4) GDPR. The authority concerned will therefore have to take the missed investigative steps in the continued proceedings and collect comprehensible evidence. The conditions for the exceptional annulment of the contested decision and the referral of the matter back to the authority concerned are therefore met, especially since it cannot be seen that the Federal Administrative Court would be able to establish the relevant facts more quickly or more cost-effectively than the authority concerned entrusted with the matter, particularly because of its jurisdiction as a senate. The Federal Administrative Court also has no doubts that the authority concerned will seek a quick decision in the continued proceedings. B) Inadmissibility of the appeal:

According to Section 25a Paragraph 1 VwGG, the administrative court must state in its ruling or

decision whether the appeal is admissible according to Article 133 Paragraph 4 B-VG. The

ruling must be briefly justified.

The appeal is not admissible according to Article 133 Paragraph 4 B-VG because the decision does not depend on the

solution of a legal question that is of fundamental importance. With regard to the application of Section 38 AVG, the court hearing the case was able to rely on a well-established case law of the Administrative Court, which was cited in each case. An assessment of a legal question pending before a court other than the one in question, made within the framework of these principles established by the Administrative Court, is not subject to revision (cf. VwGH 13.9.2017, Ra 2017/12/0068).
