<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 28 April 2021, a data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against the bank Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. (BBVA). According to the complainant, the BBVA had called and sent him several messages about non-payments and appointments. The complainant had asked the bank to delete his data, but the bank replied that it could not do so because there was no customer on their records with the phone number listed in the complaint.
</p><p>The AEPD requested information from BBVA about what had happened and the bank replied that the communications had been an internal error. BBVA alleged that it was testing the operation of a tool designed to send notifications to its customers, and that the messages received by the complainant were fictitious test notifications that BBVA believed it had sent to an idle phone number. In addition, the entity said it had taken appropriate security measures to correct the situation.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD considers that BBVA's actions breached the principle of lawfulness in <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a> because it had no legal basis for processing the complainant's data. The initial sanction the AEPD envisaged was €100,000 but BBVA was able to terminate the sanctioning procedure by paying €60,000 and acknowledging its responsibility, as provided for in Spanish administrative law.

your database, with the mobile number you mentioned in your request.




SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, of Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
hereinafter LOPDGDD), on June 10, 2021, said claim was transferred to the

claimed party, to proceed with its analysis and inform this Agency in the
period of one month, of the actions carried out to adapt to the requirements

provided for in the data protection regulations.



On August 2, 2021, this Agency received a written response

indicating that the sending of said text messages has been the product of an error
by the team that is responsible for carrying out performance tests of
the tool designed to send notifications from the Bank to its customers.




The messages the claimant has received are fictitious notifications of
calls or meetings in the offices of the claimed entity that my client

sent to the phone number ***PHONE.1 mistakenly believing that
said number did not exist nor was it operational and therefore no one was going to receive said
fictitious ads.




We must clarify that these are not advertising messages but placements

fictitious to carry out procedures in the offices of the claimed entity and that were sent
by mistake in the test environment of the tool.




Checked the error and the existence that said mobile phone number belongs
to a natural person, the respondent entity has taken the necessary measures to

that these events do not happen again and has apologized, in writing, to the
claimant.




THIRD: On August 17, 2021, the Director of the Spanish Agency for

Data Protection agreed to admit for processing the claim presented by the party
claimant.


                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW



                                             I




By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director

of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate and to
resolve this procedure.




                                             II



The defendant is accused of committing an infraction for violation of Article 6
of the RGPD, “Legality of the treatment”, which indicates in its section 1 the assumptions in which
that the processing of third party data is considered lawful:




"one. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:


a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their personal data
for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party

is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;
(…)”


 The infringement is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:




"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/11








global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:




a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5,6,7 and 9.”



The Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of the
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements
considered very serious” provides:



"one. Based on the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in it and, in particular, the
following:



(…)




a) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the conditions
of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”



                                             III



The documentation in the file offers evidence that the claimed,

violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it processed the data
of the claimant without having any legitimacy to do so.



The respondent has acknowledged said error and has indicated that it has analyzed the record of
the calls provided by the claimant in this file, and observes that,

after confirming the reception of these, it has been detected that by mistake the
claimant and its numbering in a campaign organized by the claimed object

to verify the existence of technical breakdowns that customers may suffer.



Likewise, it states that, after receiving the last claim from the client, it has strengthened

the operation at the time of establishing and preparing the communication campaigns to
clients, inhibiting this number automatically so that it cannot be included

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/11








as a recipient in any case in those communications; and that they will carry out controls
periodically in order to check that its agents comply with all the measures

established by the company.




Now, despite stating the claim in previous claims to have
implemented new security measures so that it does not happen again. It's clear,
that the 1002 and 1004 calls continue to occur. Therefore, it is

producing the treatment of the personal data of the claimant without
legitimizing.




                                            IV



The determination of the sanction to be imposed in this case requires

observe the provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, precepts that,
respectively, provide the following:




“Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of administrative fines
under this Article for infringements of this Regulation

indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case effective,
proportionate and dissuasive.”




“Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each
individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine

administration and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:

a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question as well
such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages that

have suffered;

b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to
alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties;

d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge or of the person in charge of the treatment,
taking into account the technical or organizational measures that they have applied under

of articles 25 and 32;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/11








e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the treatment;

 f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the
infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the infringement;


g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in
particular whether the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, if so, in what
measure;

i) when the measures indicated in article 58, section 2, have been ordered

previously against the person in charge or the person in charge in question in relation to the
same matter, compliance with said measures;

j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or mechanisms of
certification approved in accordance with article 42, and

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,
such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or

indirectly, through the infringement.” (The underlining is from the AEPD)



In order to specify the amount of the penalty to be imposed on the person claimed for violation
of article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, it is essential to examine and assess whether the

circumstances described in article 83.2 of the RGPD and if they intervene by mitigating or
aggravating the responsibility of the responsible entity.





In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the sanction of fine to
impose in the present case, the claimed party is considered responsible for
an infringement typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, in an initial assessment,
The following factors are considered concurrent.


As aggravating the following:

- In the present case we are facing a negligent action on significant data
that allow the identification of a person (article 83.2 b).


- Basic personal identifiers are affected (name, a number
identification, the line identifier) (article 83.2 g).
- Section k), in relation to article 76.2 of Organic Law 3/2018, in which

frames as an aggravating circumstance the continuous nature of the infraction attributed to the
claimed.





C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/11








- The evident link between the business activity of the defendant and the
processing of personal data of customers or third parties (article 83.2 K, of the RGPD

in relation to article 76.2 b, of the LOPDGDD).


This is why it is considered appropriate to adjust the sanction to be imposed on the person claimed and
set it at the amount of €100,000 for the infringement of article 6 of the RGPD.

Therefore, based on the foregoing,



By the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
