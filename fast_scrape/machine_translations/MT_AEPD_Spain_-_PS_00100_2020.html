<p>AEPD decided to fine the company ARANOW PACKAGING MACHINERY, S.L in the amount of EUR 3000   for violating the rights of recipients of services, in particular for "using data storage and retrieval devices (cookies) without providing the necessary information prohibited by article 22.2 of the LSSI" (Spanish Law on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce, which transposes into Spanish law the Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 03/10/19 AEPD received a complaint stating, inter alia, the following: 
</p><p>"The web page ***URL.1 does not comply with the current legislation on Data Protection as it does not have a Privacy Policy, nor a contact page, nor, even less, a Cookie Policy that complies with the aforementioned current legislation".
</p><p>In view of the facts set out in the complaint and the documents provided by the complainant, AEPD proceeded to carry out actions for its clarification, specifically, to examine both the Privacy policy and the Cookie policy of the aforementioned web page.
</p><p>Regarding the privacy policy, AEPD confirmed that the information found there was in line with the provisions of Article 13 GDPR, which governs the information that must be provided when personal data is collected directly from the data subject.
Regarding the Cookie Policy, AEPD firstly checked the information contained therein (What are cookies - What do they use cookies for? - What data is obtained?- What are the cookies that are used?). It was also checked if there was any mechanism to reject all cookies, but none was found.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Were ARANOW PACKAGING MACHINERY's  Privacy and Cookie policies aligned with European and national regulations&#160;? (Art 13 GDPR and art 22.2 LSSI)
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>With respect to the Privacy policy, AEPD considered that the Privacy Policy of the challenged website was not in contradiction with what is stipulated in article 13 of the GDPR.
With regards to the Cookie policy, AEPD considered differently.  The fact that there was no link to the different browsers to deactivate or delete cookies and the fact that there was no mechanism to reject all cookies was considered to be contrary to the legal provisions established in article 22.2 LSSI. 
</p><p>This Infraction is classified as "minor" in Article 38.4 g) of the aforementioned Law, and may be sanctioned with a fine of up to EUR 30,000 , in accordance with Article 39 of the LSSI. Two criteria (established in Article 40 of the LSSI) were applied to graduate the sanction: the existence of intentionality and the period of time during which the infraction was committed. Taking these criteria into account, the amount of the fine was calculated at EUR 3,000.  However, two attenuating circumstances of the Spanish Law on Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (Article 85) could be applied, which may respectively reduce the fine by 20%. The first mitigating factor is to acknowledge their responsibility within the time allowed for the submission of claims. The second mitigating factor is, at any time prior to the resolution of the proceedings, to make voluntary payment of the proposed penalty.
</p><p>On June 22, 2020,  ARANOW PACKAGING MACHINERY, S.L proceeded to pay the sanction in the amount of EUR 1800, applying therefore the two previously mentioned reductions. This implied the recognition of their responsibility and the resignation to any action or appeal in administrative channels against the sanction. After these events, the AEPD decided to terminate the procedure.

<p>Despite the fact that the Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce has been introduced into the legal systems of the Member States in a harmonized manner, each Member State has its own administrative sanctioning procedures. This underlines the importance of knowing the administrative sanctioning procedures of each Member State, where small particularities can mean big differences from one State to another.

II
A) - The following can be seen from the actions carried out in relation to the Privacy Policy of the website in question: In this case, it has been verified that the ***URL.1 website has a specific "privacy" section: ***URL.2 in which, mentioning compliance with current legislation on data protection, information is provided on: the person responsible for processing, the collection, purpose, legitimacy and conservation time of personal data; commercial information on customer service; on quality surveys; information on the legal basis applied; data conservation periods; user rights; on automated individual decisions; on the right to file a complaint with the AEPD; information on the data of minors; information on the security applied to personal data; on changes in the privacy policy
In this sense, article 13 of the RGPD, establishes the information that must be provided to the interested party at the time of collection of their personal data. In particular, it states that:
Where personal data are collected from a data subject, the data controller shall, at the time of collection, provide the data subject with all the following information: a) the identity and contact details of the data controller and, where appropriate, his representative; b) the contact details of the data protection officer, if any; c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended and the legal basis for the processing; d) where the processing is based on in Article 6(1)(f), the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party (f) where applicable, the controller's intention to transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation and the existence or absence of a decision on adequacy from the Commission or, in the case of transfers referred to in Articles 46 or 47 or in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), reference to adequate or appropriate safeguards and the means to obtain a copy thereof or the fact that they have been provided.

Neither does this page contain any mechanism that allows the rejection of all cookies, so that it is just as easy to give consent as to revoke it. 
The facts set out above could lead to the claimed entity committing an infringement of Article 22.2 of the LSSI, according to which 
"Service providers may use data storage and retrieval devices on the terminal equipment of the recipients, provided that the recipients have given their consent after being provided with clear and complete information on their use, in particular on the purposes of data processing, in accordance with the provisions of Organic Law 15/1999, of 13 December, on the protection of personal data.
Where technically possible and effective, the recipient's consent to accept the processing of the data may be provided through the use of appropriate browser or other application parameters.
This shall not prevent any storage or access of a technical nature for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network or, to the extent strictly necessary, for the provision of an information society service explicitly requested by the recipient".
This infringement is classified as "minor" in Article 38.4 g) of the aforementioned Law, which considers as such: "Using data storage and recovery devices when the information has not been provided or the consent of the recipient of the service has not been obtained under the terms required by Article 22.2.
