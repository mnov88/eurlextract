<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject -  the complainant - filed a complaint with the AEPD against the organisation “l’Associació per la Participació Política a Catalunya (AppCat)” for failure to comply with his right to be forgotten.
</p>
<pre>Indeed, the data subject required from the data controller the erasure of his personal data. No answer to his request has been received.
</pre>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Does the GDPR allow the data controller to ignore a request for erasure? 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD found that Article 12 GDPR does not allow the data controller to ignore the request after the on-month deadline. In the event where there is no personal data, where the request does not fulfill the requirements for the exercise of the right to erasure but rather the right to rectification or the request has to be rejected, the controller must indicate the reasons of the refusal. In any case the controller must provide an answer which justifies by any means the receipt of the request. Therefore, the APED clarified the obligation upon the data controller to give an express answer without undue delay. 
In the case at hand, the right to erasure has not been complied with due to the lack of answer. Thus, the AEPD ordered the data controller to send the complaint an answer within the limit of 10 working days.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>The order to comply with the GDPR is not a surprise. However, it’s interesting to notice that the AEPD did not give reason for its decision on the basis of Article 17 GPDR (and the equivalent in domestic law) but on Article 12 GDPR. Therefore, this decision reinforces the obligation upon data controller to give an express answer for any rights exercised under Articles 15 to 22 GDPR, by virtue of Article 12 GDPR.
