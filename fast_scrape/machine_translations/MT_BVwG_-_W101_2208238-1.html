<p>The Federal Administrative court held that the consent given to a first controller under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1a" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(a) GDPR</a> to transfer the data to a second controller does not extend to the transfer from the second controller to third parties, unless otherwise indicated by the circumstances of the case.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The two data subjects of this case are minors. They are visiting a private kindergarten. The private kindergarten gave – with the consent of the legal guardians of the data subjects – a list to the municipality of its seat (the controller) which consisted of the name, date of birth and date of admission of all kids attending the kindergarten. Because the municipality did not want to bear the costs for children having their residence in another municipality, it sent a letter to all parents requesting them to take the letter to the municipality of their residence and ask for their financial support. This letter consisted of the already mentioned list as well as another list which additionally contained the days of absence, overall days and the calculated share of costs of each child. 
</p><p>The controller did not ask the legal guardians of the data subjects for their consent before sending the letter out to all parents.
</p><p>The data subjects – represented by their legal guardians – filed a complaint with the DPA. The DPA sustained the complaint.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Federal Administrative Court (Bundesverwatungsgericht – BVwG) upheld the decision of the DSB.  
</p><p>The court concluded that the head of the kindergarten was a third party according to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#10" title="Article 4 GDPR">Article 4(10) GDPR</a> with respect to the sending of the letters. The consent given to the head of the kindergarten did not extend to the municipality and did not encompass the disclosure of the data to the other legal guardians.

b)

                           Reasons for decision:

I. Procedure:


With a letter dated January 3, 2018, improved with briefs dated January 28, 2018 and dated

02.02.2018, brought mj. XXXX , legally represented by Mrs. XXXX , and mj. XXXX ,, - 2 -


legally represented by Mrs. XXXX (= involved parties before the

Federal Administrative Court and applicant before the data protection authority), a
Data protection complaint against the mayor of the market town XXXX (=

Complainant before the Federal Administrative Court and respondent before the

data protection authority) because their right to secrecy had been violated.
They basically justified their data protection complaint as follows:

The complainant had in a letter regarding the assumption of costs

Childcare in a private kindergarten personal data of those involved
Parties passed on to other legal guardians. Specifically, this letter is a list

of all children attending the private kindergarten between September 2016 and August 2017

would have visited, stating the name, date of birth, address and entry
as well as the date of leaving the kindergarten.


With a statement dated February 21, 2018, the complainant led to the

Concerned parties' privacy complaint essentially consisted of:
Since the children of the "XXXX" kindergarten, including the parties involved, for

majority do not have their normal place of residence in the municipal area of the seat municipality,

of the market town XXXX , were forced for financial reasons to
aliquot costs on the main residential communities of the visitors or their

Share parents/guardians. For the fair distribution of the funding share

be the market town XXXX a list with the data of the children or their

a letter from the market town of XXXX to the legal guardians refers, among other things, to the

extraordinary financial burden of the market town XXXX pointed out and the request
been expressed to visit the communities of residence with the letter and to

asking for their children's support. Since the list with all data (first name, last name,

date of birth, entry date, possible exit date and addresses) from the
was handed over to the management of the kindergarten, this list (supplemented by the

pro rata contribution to costs) has been enclosed with the letter to the parents. The one from the

The list (children's list) handed over to the management of the kindergarten is also in writing
been settled. The market town of XXXX assumed that the parents

would have given their consent for the lists to be handed over, especially since the lists had already been

were handed over to the management of the kindergarten.

With a statement dated March 14, 2018, the parties involved essentially gave

the following:, - 3 -


You would understand that the kindergarten gives the children's data to the community XXXX
had to pass on, because without this data the municipality could not

Enter into a cooperation agreement with the municipalities concerned. However be

the conclusion that this constitutes the consent of the parties involved to the general
use of this data is not correct.


By decision of August 7th, 2018, GZ. DSB-D122.840/0005-DSB/2018, gave the

Data protection authority of the data protection complaint of 01/03/2018 and found that
the complainant thereby infringes the parties involved in their right to secrecy

violated by the complainant personal data of those involved

Parties, such as name, date of birth, address, entry date, minus days, total days and the
corresponding share of costs, to legal guardians of others in the same kindergarten

as the parties involved in the period from September 2016 to August 2017

transmitted to visiting children.

In this decision, the data protection complaint made the following findings of fact:

The complainant had one closer to all the guardians of the one

designated kindergarten between September 2016 and August 2017
Children directed undated letter written in which the legal guardians to

have been asked to bear the costs of childcare.
In a list attached to this letter "Children's list […] September 2016 - August 2017".

the following data of the parties involved: name, date of birth, address and

entry date.
In addition, the letter in question is accompanied by a further list “Cost allocation September 1st

2016 - August 31, 2017" attached to which the following data of the parties involved are attached

can be taken from: name, date of birth, entry date, minus days, total days and
cost share.

The letter along with the mentioned lists are the legal guardians of the list

named children have been transmitted.

On the basis of these factual findings, the data protection authority concluded in

from a legal point of view:

About this data protection complaint is procedurally according to the new legal situation (DSG idF
BGBl. I No. 24/2018) according to § 24 Para. 5 DSG. Substantive law is the

However, the case after the date of the alleged infringement of the right
Confidentiality, applicable provisions of §§ 1 to 9 DSG 2000, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999 as amended

Federal Law Gazette I No. 83/2013., - 4 -


According to § 1 para. 2 DSG 2000, the actual transmission is required
personal data of the complainants to legal guardians of others

children attending the same kindergarten as the involved parties

legal basis.
However, such a thing was neither mentioned by the complainant in his statement before the

Data protection authority mentioned XXXX in the justification of § 8 DSG 2000

recognizable and is also not claimed by the complainant.
The complainant's argument that he had assumed that the

Parents would have given their consent to the handover of the lists, do not change anything that is for the

Consent of the parties involved to the transfer in question within the meaning of § 4
Z 14 in connection with § 8 para. 1 Z 2 DSG 2000 would not have resulted in any indications in the proceedings.

If the complainant further claims in this context that the

Data was only given among parents who knew each other well and would see each other on a daily basis
are, nothing can be gained from this argument either, as it is assumed

that not all legal guardians are aware of all transmitted data.

Irrespective of this, a breach of data protection law cannot be cured even then
become when the children's personal data concerned through conversations

between the legal guardians are known.
The appeal was therefore allowed according to the verdict.


In the timely complaint against this decision, the

Complainant essentially before:
The complainant had to assume that the

management of the private kindergarten the relevant clarifications would have been made. Essei

to be assumed that before the data is transmitted to the complainant, the
Management have coordinated the data with the children's legal guardians and

the legal guardians give their consent for the disclosure and use of their data

would have granted. In addition, the management of the private kindergarten did not say so
been informed that the data or that the municipality does not contact the parents

and may transmit the information.

In addition, all those affected (parents and children) have a common interest in the
The continued existence of the kindergarten and the data transfer is exclusively in the interest of

Parents and in the public interest, so that the financeability of the
private kindergarten will be secured. The notification made by the municipality was

been necessary so that the kindergarten could continue to operate and - 5 -


Affordability is secured and is an overriding factor within the meaning of Section 1 (2) DSG 2000
interest of the complainant given that the data had been passed on.

In addition, the justifications according to § 8 DSG 2000 are fulfilled because

In principle, the municipality of residence is responsible for the financing of kindergartens
be, but in the present case children from other communities attend the kindergarten

would have frequented and the data determination/transmission within the meaning of § 8 Para. 1 Z 1 DSG 2000

had been required.
It can also be assumed that the parents would have given their consent and be of this

Reason also the exception according to § 8 Abs. 1 Z 2 DSG 2000 fulfilled.

Furthermore, the disclosure was in the exclusive interest of those affected and
would be the exception according to § 8 para. 1 Z 3 DSG 2000 to be used.

Finally, the complainant has an overriding interest within the meaning of § 8 para. 1 no. 4 DSG

2000, because a municipality only financially for the kindergarten care of children
could be held responsible who also have their place of residence in the municipality and

the complainant could not bear the costs for other municipalities. be this

in the interest of the "own" community citizens, which is why iSd § 8 para. 3 Z 1, Z 3 to 5 DSG 2000
the transmission of the data violated confidentiality interests that are not worthy of protection and

the authority concerned would have had to weigh up the interests involved,
what did not happen.


The complainant thus submitted the applications that the Federal Administrative Court should

    1. Decide on the matter yourself and rectify the contested decision without replacement;
    2. in eventu rescind the contested decision with a resolution and the matter

       refer back to the data protection authority to issue a new decision

       and
    3. conduct an oral hearing.


With a letter from the data protection authority dated October 18, 2018, the complaint was

Administrative act sent to the Federal Administrative Court.




II. The Federal Administrative Court considered:

improved with pleadings dated January 28, 2018 and February 2, 2018, asserted, you, - 6 -

Frame of a letter regarding the assumption of the costs of childcare in one

private kindergarten to personal data of the parties involved

Legal guardians of others use the same kindergarten as the parties involved in the
Passed on to visiting children between September 2016 and August 2017.

Specifically, this letter is a list of all children who attended the private kindergarten in the period from

September 2016 to August 2017, stating the name, des

The complainant sent a letter to all of the children's legal guardians, which "

       and entry date of the parties involved;


    - "Cost allocation September 1, 2016 - August 31, 2017" with name, date of birth,

       Entry date, negative days, total days and cost shares of the parties involved.

It is certain that the complainant neither in writing nor implied consent from

Parents of the involved parties obtained for the processing of the personal data
has.


It can therefore be stated as decisive that the complainant is the co-involved

Parties through the processing (here: the disclosure through transmission) of the above two
mentioned lists with personal data violated in their right to secrecy

1. the time during which the proceedings until the final decision on a preliminary question
is exposed;

2. the time during a procedure according to Art. 56, 60 and 63 DSGVO.


3.3.2.According to the constitutional provision of Section 1 Paragraph 1 DSG, everyone, in particular
in view of respect for private and family life, right to secrecy of

personal data concerning him, insofar as a protection worthy

there is a confidentiality interest in it. Under personal data worthy of protection
are not only easily recognizable as personal in this context

to understand information such as a person's name, gender, address or place of residence,
but, for example, value judgments and thus absolutely personal information.

All personal data - i.e. both automatically processed data

as well as manual data - if there is a legitimate interest in confidentiality,
kept secret or processing of this data is inadmissible.


The central starting point, whether a fundamental right claim according to § 1 para. 1 DSG

exists at all is the existence of "worthy of protection" interests. During their examination
carry out a balancing of interests. The data protection regulations apply here in particular

to take account of the principles of legality and proportionality.


The parties involved have asserted in the present data protection complaint
claimed that their right to confidentiality of personal data had been violated

been because the complainant in a letter regarding the

Assumption of the costs of childcare in a private kindergarten
Data of the involved parties to legal guardians of others the same

Kindergarten like the parties involved in the period from September 2016 to August

passed on to visiting children in 2017. Specifically, this letter is a list of all
Children who attended the private kindergarten in the period from September 2016 to August 2017 - 14 -


would have, stating the name, date of birth, address and the date of entry and
exit date to kindergarten.


According to Art. 6 Para. 1 GDPR, the processing of personal data is lawful if

if, among other things, the data subject has given their consent to the processing of data relating to them
provided personal data for one or more specific purposes or who

processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, which

Responsible subject.

First of all, it should be noted that the transmission of the personal data of

parties involved is not legally covered by the XXXX submitted by the complainant,

which was also not mentioned by the complainant.

The complainant is responsible for the affected parents of those involved

Parties before sending the letter with the attached objective lists

their (written or implied) consent to the processing of their personal data
data collected. The specific content of this letter is therefore irrelevant.


If the complainant claims that he assumed that the parents of the

involved parties would agree to their personal data
to send other legal guardians of the children attending the kindergarten because the

The head of the private kindergarten gave him the two lists, the following is the following
counter: As the head of the private kindergarten (with the consent of those affected)

the complainant provided the two lists, did not foresee them

may require that the complainant at a later date the lists in question
would process to other legal guardians by sending a letter. the

In the given case constellation, the head of the private kindergarten is a "third party" in the sense of the

Definition of Art. 4 Z 10 GDPR.

The responsible senate therefore comes to the conclusion that the complainant as

Person responsible for the personal data of the parties involved through the

Sending the letter together with the two relevant lists to others
Legal guardians of the children attending the kindergarten inadmissibly

has processed (here: disclosure through transmission) and thereby the people involved

parties violated their right to secrecy., - 15 -


Since the contested decision is illegal within the meaning of Art. 130 para.

1 Z 1 B-VG is not adhered to, the complaint raised against it was according to § 28 para. 2 VwGVG
to be rejected in connection with Section 24 (1) and (5) DSG as amended.


3.4. Pursuant to § 24 para. 1 VwGVG, the administrative court shall, upon application or if it is required to do so for

deems it necessary to hold a public oral hearing ex officio.

The complainant has indeed submitted an application for the implementation of a

public hearing, however, in the present case, the omission of a

oral hearing based on the fact that the facts of the case from the file
was resolved. The Federal Administrative Court had only one legal question

recognize (cf. ECHR June 20, 2013, Appl. No. 24510/06, Abdulgadirov/AZE, margin nos. 34ff). Also after

the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court may hold an oral hearing
be omitted if the facts are undisputed and the legal issue is not of a particular nature

Complexity is (VfSlg. 17.597/2005; VfSlg. 17.855/2006; most recently VfGH 18.06.2012, B

155/12).

From the implementation of a verbal hearing was therefore according to § 24 paragraph 1 and paragraph.

4 VwGVG.


3.5. Re B) Inadmissibility of the revision:

According to § 25a Abs. 1 VwGG, the administrative court in the ruling of its knowledge or

Pronounce a resolution as to whether the revision is permissible in accordance with Art. 133 Para. 4 B-VG. the

Statement must be briefly justified.

The revision is not permitted according to Art. 133 Para. 4 B-VG because the decision is not from the

solutionofalegalissuedependsoffundamentalimportance

the present decision from the previous case law of the
administrative court, there is still no case law; further is the

present case law of the Administrative Court also not as inconsistent

judge. There are also no other indications of a fundamental importance of the
solving legal question.
