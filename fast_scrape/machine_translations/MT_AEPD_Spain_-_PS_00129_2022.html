<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The claimant became aware, in the course of a separate judicial process, of an electoral crime consisting of adding people to a census with the purpose of obtaining votes. The claimant  filed a complaint to the AEPD stating that between December and November 2018, a candidate registered 40 people in the municipality of Cacabelos. The complainant complained that the candidate should not have had access to information on the municipal census. 
</p><p>The candidate replied to the AEPD that there was no proof that he had access to the census. Even if there would be, Article 73 of the LOGPD would time bar his infringement as it occurred too many years ago.  
</p><p>The AEPD launched an investigation and determined that the candidate was at the time part of the government team of the City Council of Cacabelos, and so had access to all types of information related to the census. Despite being part of the team he was not authorised to access the census. During this period, the candidate acknowledged that he had registered 37 people for the census. The AEPD launched sanctioning procedures against the city council for an infringement of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD dropped the case due to the time limitations outlined in Article 72 and 73 LOGPD. 
</p><p>The access to the municipal census data by the candidate should have taken place after 30 March 2019 for the infringement not to be considered time-barred. Since there is no record of the exact date and it cannot be demonstrated that the acts that constitute the infringement were carried out in the three years prior to the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, the principle of in dubio pro reo (in case of doubt in favor of the accused) requires the proceedings to be closed on the understanding that the infringement could have been time-barred at the time when the initiation of the proceeding was agreed upon.

     File No.: PS/00129/2022



                RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

From the procedure instructed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based
to the following

                                  BACKGROUND



FIRST: D. A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complaining party) dated February 21,
2022 filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
The reasons on which the claim is based are the following:


That the complaining party has been aware, within a judicial process, of
the complaint made by D. B.B.B., (…) of the Group of Socialist Voters of
Cacabelos, before the Ponferrada Area Prosecutor's Office on May 16, 2019, for a
electoral crime consisting of mass registration with the purpose of obtaining
votes in a candidacy, declaring D. B.B.B. that you have been able to verify:

-
       - That in the months of December and November 2018,
register about forty people in the municipality of Cacabelos, (…).

       - That in the applications for registration in the registry, the same signature appears in all

documents. Note that the name of the declarant does not appear in these applications,
only the DNI corresponding to the registered person.

The complaining party provides a copy of the document sent by D. B.B.B. to the Prosecutor's Office
Ponferrada Area and minutes of the Ponferrada Zone Electoral Board by which

agrees that the allegations of D. B.B.B. exceed the jurisdiction of the Board,
being able to go to court.

prescribed sanctioning procedure, in accordance with current legislation.


SEVENTH: The proposed resolution has been notified in accordance with the established rules
In the LPACAP, the claimed party has not presented a written statement of allegations.



In view of everything that has been done, by the Spanish Data Protection Agency
In this procedure, the following are considered proven facts:

                                PROVEN FACTS

FIRST: In the first months of 2019, D. B.B.B., member of the

government of the Cacabelos City Council, agreed to the requests of
registration of 37 people in ***ADDRESS.1 of Cacabelos, corresponding
to (…).

SECOND: On February 21, 2022, the claimant filed

claim before the Spanish Data Protection Agency denouncing that it has
had knowledge, within a judicial process, that D. B.B.B., as
representative of the Group of Socialist Voters of Cacabelos, has agreed to
data from the municipal register of Cacabelos.


                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                           Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD grants to each authority of
control and according to what is established in articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, it is

competent to initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: “The procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions

in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

                                          II


The claim that gave rise to the sanctioning procedure was presented on 21
February 2022, starting through a start agreement of March 30, 2022.


C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/8








During the probationary period, D. B.B.B. acknowledged that he agreed to the requests of
registration of 37 people in ***ADDRESS.1 of Cacabelos, corresponding
to (…) in the first months of 2019.


That is, despite having proven that an unauthorized person has had
access to personal data from the municipal register of the City Council of
Cacabelos, after completing a very complete test and the instruction of the
procedure aimed, among other issues, at determining the date of commission of
the facts, it has not been possible to determine exactly what is the exact day of the

commission of the facts.

Article 83.4, section a) of the RGPD, under the heading “General conditions for the
imposition of administrative fines” provides that:


“Infringements of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10 000 000 or,
In the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:


a) the obligations of the controller and the processor in accordance with articles 8, 11, 25 a
39, 42 and 43;”

Indicating article 73 of the LOPDGDD, for the sole purposes of the limitation period
the next:


Article 73. Infractions considered serious.

“Based on what is established in article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
are considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that involve a

substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

(…)

f) The lack of adoption of those technical and organizational measures that result

appropriate to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk of the treatment,
in the terms required by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

Every time D. B.B.B. has had access to the municipal registry data in the
first months of 2019, as repeatedly stated without specifying further,

and the agreement to initiate this sanctioning procedure was initiated and notified
to the claimed party on March 30, 2022, the facts are prescribed in
regarding the violation of article 32 of the GDPR.

On the other hand, article 83.5, section a) of the RGPD, under the heading “Conditions

general rules for the imposition of administrative fines” provides that:

“Infringements of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20 000 000 or,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/8








In the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:


a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;”

Indicating article 72 of the LOPDGDD, for the sole purposes of the limitation period
the next:


"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that involve
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:


a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

It is proven in this sanctioning file that the events occurred
in the first months of 2019, without it having been possible to prove a greater

accuracy of such event despite the evidence carried out, so there is doubt
reason that the alleged violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD has expired.
For this reason, access to municipal registry data by D. B.B.B.
should have taken place after March 30, 2019 for the violation not to
is considered prescribed.


Thus, not recording the exact date of commission of the events for the purposes of the
calculation of prescription, and it cannot be demonstrated that the facts that make up the
infringement were carried out in the three years prior to the agreement to start the
sanctioning procedure, the principle in dubio pro reo (in case of doubt in favor of the

accused) forces the procedure to be archived upon understanding that the infraction could have
prescribed at the time the initiation of the procedure was agreed upon.

Therefore, in accordance with applicable legislation, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection RESOLVES:


FIRST: ARCHIVE the procedure PS/00129/2022 initiated by the CITY COUNCIL
DE CACABELOS, with NIF P2403100G.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to the CITY COUNCIL OF
CACABELOS, with NIF P2403100G.


In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this
Resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.

Against this resolution, which puts an end to the administrative procedure in accordance with art. 48.6 of the

LOPDGDD, and in accordance with the provisions of article 123 of the LPACAP, the
Interested parties may optionally file an appeal for reconsideration before the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency within a period of one month to

referred Law.

Finally, it is noted that in accordance with the provisions of art. 90.3.a) of the LPACAP,
