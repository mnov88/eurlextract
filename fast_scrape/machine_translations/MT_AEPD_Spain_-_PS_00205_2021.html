<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>In July 2020, the AEPD initiated an investigation after becoming aware of the dissemination, through a social media network (Twitter), of a video that showed images that could constitute a gender-based violence crime. The video was accompanied by a message aiming to raise awareness about violence perpetrated against women.
</p><p>Although the video was also disseminated by the media, they pixelated the the faces of the victims. However, in the video that was retweeted by the individual against whom the investigation was launched, it was possible to identify the victim of gender-based violence as well as her child. Considering the facts, the AEPD contacted the individual (controller), requesting information about the origin of the video and why the faces of the victims had not been blurred. 
</p><p>Subsequently, the AEPD requested Twitter to remove the content from its platform to which Twitter responded that the Tweets were posted with the intention to raise awareness about violence against women, which is aligned with Twitter’s mission to facilitate public conversation. It further added that the content did not violate the Terms of Service of Twitter, the Twitter Privacy Policy, or the Twitter Rules, and will not be removed from the platform. 
</p><p>Nevertheless, later the AEPD could confirm that the content was labelled as sensitive without being removed from the platform.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD indicated that the physical image of a person constitutes personal data according with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#1" title="Article 4 GDPR">Article 4(1) GDPR</a> therefore its processing falls within the scope of GDPR.  
</p><p>The DPA also analysed whether the controller had an appropriate legal basis for the processing of personal data, and concluded that as the video was recorded and published without the consent of the parties involved, there was no appropriate legal basis in place for the processing of personal data. 
</p><p>The AEPD held that there had been a breach of Article 6(1)GDPR, which was considered 'grave' because of the nature of the infringement, and fined the data subject €10,000, that was reduced to €6000 for voluntary payment and for the admission of guilt.

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (Regulation-
General Data Protection Mention, hereinafter RGPD), recognizes each Authority

Control, and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/12








digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Agency
Data Protection is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.




Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: «The procedures processed by the

Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in their development and, as long as they do not contradict them, in a

subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures. "



II




The physical image of a person, according to article 4.1 of the RGPD, is data
personal protection and their protection, therefore, is the object of said Regulation. In article 4.2

of the RGPD defines the concept of "processing" of personal data.



It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image of

natural persons) carried out through the dissemination of the video object of this
procedure is in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD.




III



In the first place and referring to the publication by Doña A.A.A. of the indicated video

in the background, article 6.1 of the RGPD, establishes the assumptions that allow
consider lawful the processing of personal data:




      "1. The treatment will only be lawful if it complies with at least one of the following
terms:


      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;

      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the

interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
pre-contractual;


C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/12








      c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation
applicable to the person responsible for the treatment;


      d) the treatment is necessary to protect vital interests of the interested party or of
another natural person.

      e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in

public interest or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the person responsible for the
treatment;

      f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests

pursued by the data controller or by a third party, provided that on
said interests do not prevail the interests or the rights and freedoms
fundamental data of the interested party that require the protection of personal data, in

particular when the interested party is a child.

      The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the
treatment carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions. "


      On this issue of the legality of the treatment, also affects the
Recital 40 of the aforementioned RGPD, when it states that “For the
treatment is lawful, personal data must be processed with consent

of the interested party or on any other legitimate basis established in accordance with Law, and
either in this Regulation or by virtue of other Union law or of the
Member States covered by this Regulation, including the need to

comply with the legal obligation applicable to the person responsible for the treatment or the need to
execute a contract with which the interested party is a party or in order to take measures

at the request of the interested party prior to the conclusion of a contract. "

In relation to the above, it is considered that there is evidence that the treatment
of data of the people who appear in the images object of this procedure,

a minor and his mother, has been carried out without legitimizing cause of the collected in the
Article 6 of the RGPD.

The GDPR applies to personal data, which is defined as "personal data":

any information about an identified or identifiable natural person ("the interested party");
an identifiable natural person shall be considered any person whose identity may
be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by an identifier, such as

for example a name, an identification number, location data, a
online identifier or one or more elements of physical identity,
physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social of said person.


Both the minor and his mother, whose data Doña A.A.A. has processed, are identifiable
since their identity can be determined, directly or indirectly.

that the processing operations comply with the provisions of the RGPD, when
proceed, in a certain way and within a specified period - article 58. 2
d) -.


In accordance with the evidence available at the present time of
agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction, it is considered that the facts presented do not comply with the provisions of the

article 6.1. of the RGPD, which could lead to the commission of an infringement
typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, which provides the following:


      "" Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the

global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

      a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

consent in accordance with articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; "

For the purposes of the statute of limitations for infractions, the infraction indicated in the
previous paragraph is considered very serious and prescribes after three years, in accordance with the

Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which establishes that:

      "Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

      b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the

conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679. "

V




In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, provisions that state:



      "Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines

administrative regulations pursuant to this article for the infractions of this

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/12








Regulations indicated in paragraphs 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive. "



        "Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of

each individual case, as an additional or substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j).


Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aforementioned Regulation provides in its art. 58.2 b) —without prejudice
of the provisions of article 83 RGPD - the possibility of directing a warning,
in relation to what is stated in Considering 148:


        "In the event of a minor offense, or if the fine that is likely to be imposed
would constitute a disproportionate burden for an individual, rather than

sanction by fine may be imposed a warning. It must however
pay special attention to the nature, severity and duration of the offense, to its
intentional nature, to the measures taken to alleviate the damages suffered,

the degree of responsibility or any relevant prior infringement, the way in which
that the supervisory authority has had knowledge of the infringement, to the fulfillment
of measures ordered against the person in charge or in charge, to the adherence to codes of

conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance. "

In the present case, without prejudice to the results of the instruction, they have taken into account

It has, in particular, the following elements.

         That it is about the dissemination of data of the image of a woman who is
           being beaten and her youngest son who comes to help her.


         That it is an individual whose main activity is not related to the
           processing of personal data


         That no recidivism is appreciated, as there is no evidence of the commission of any
           offense of the same nature.


For all this, it is considered that the penalty that would correspond to direct is € 10,000
(Ten thousand euros).

If the infringement is confirmed, it could be agreed to impose on the person responsible the adoption of

adequate measures to adjust its performance to the regulations mentioned in this
act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the RGPD, according to the
which each supervisory authority may "order the person in charge of the

treatment that the treatment operations comply with the provisions of the
this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain way and within a

specified term […] '.
