<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 14 July 2021 the data subject mistakenly signed a contract with másLUZ Energía (marketed by SUMINISTRADOR IBÉRICO DE ENERGÍA - SIE) through an SMS. As he later realized that másLUZ Energía was posing as the complainant's own energy supplier, he requested the cancellation of the contract for gas supply on 10 August 2021 and for electricity supply on 26 August 2021.
</p><p>Nonetheless, másLUZ Energía (SIE), the controller, continued issuing energy consumption invoices to the data subject, which were automatically paid via his bank account. Further, in January 2022, the controller again changed the electricity contract without consent of the data subject. On 24 April 2022, the data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA against SIE. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA considered the certification of the digital signature of the supply contract through the sending of an SMS with másLUZ Energía (SIE) on 14 July 2021 and, with this, the registration in the services in August 2021. The DPA also acknowledged the request by the data subject to withdraw from the contract for gas supply on 10 August 2021 and for electricity supply on 26 August 2021. 
</p><p>As a matter of fact, the controller was able to provide evidence (through call recordings and SMS) of the contract, but only with respect to the contract signed on 14 July 2021, from which the claimant withdrew on 10 and 26 August 2021 respectively. However, the controller failed to adduce evidence of the contract of January 2022, according to which two invoices were issued by másLUZ Energía (SIE) between 8 and 18 January 2022, and another one with consumptions made between 19 January and 11 February 2022. The controller thus failed to provide a legitimate basis for processing activities that took place after the data subject withdrew from the contract.
</p><p>Accordingly, the Spanish DPA held that the processing activities carried out after cancellation of the contract lacked a legal basis under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR.</a> In light of this, the DPA issued a fine of €70,000 to másLUZ Energía (SIE) by virtue of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR" title="Article 83 GDPR">Article 83(5) GDPR</a> for unlawful processing activities in violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a>.

Later, he realized what had happened and requested the cancellation of the contract.

Mas luz Energía (SIE) issued three invoices that it paid, despite not having provided its

Luz Energía (SIE) once again changed the electricity services of its

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in

hereinafter LOPDGDD), said claim was transferred to the claimed party, to
to proceed with its analysis and inform this Agency within a period of one month, of the
actions carried out to adapt to the requirements provided for in the regulations of
Data Protection.

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the rules established in Law 39/2015, of

October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of Administrations
Public (hereinafter, LPACAP), was collected on June 7, 2022 as
It appears in the acknowledgment of receipt that is in the file.

On July 7, 2022, this Agency received a response letter indicating:


&lt;&lt;It is necessary to indicate that the procedures for formalizing the contract of
electrical supply in SIE require, logically, verification and
authentication of the client's expression of will to proceed with the signing of the
contract. This implies that, when a telemarketing service provider formalizes
a supply contract on behalf of SIE, you must provide the recording of the

sale.

In this way, SIE can verify that the contracting has been carried out in an
appropriate. After reviewing the recordings of the phone call, we have been able
check that the salesperson at no time said he worked for the third company

company in question, but carried out the contracting process indicating to the
Claimant that said contracting would be carried out with MAS LUZ ENERGÍA, which
is a brand marketed by SIE.

Regarding the origin of the personal data referred to by the Claimant,

The following considerations should be made about the contracting process when
This is carried out by a company that provides telemarketing services.

▪ The telemarketing service provider transfers to SIE the personal data of
interested parties to whom SIE products and services will be offered.


Subsequently, the telemarketing service provider acts as
responsible for the processing of SIE for carrying out the activities of offering
its products and services and contracting the products and services that
correspond.


▪ However, the telemarketing service provider can only carry out
commercial actions on those interested parties who have provided their
consent to the transfer of your personal data to SIE for this purpose.

Taking into account the above, from SIE it is not possible to determine where the

telemarketing service provider the personal data of the Claimant, since
that he obtained them as the independent controller of SIE.



C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/11








At the time of signing the contract for the provision of services, said service provider
telemarketing services acquired the commitment to only transfer the data
personal data of those interested parties who have given their consent for said
purpose.


Additionally, the service provider undertook to inform interested parties
duly and in accordance with the regulations on data protection regarding
of the transfer of your data to SIE.

However, as has been reflected in the first section of this document,
It has been confirmed that the contracting was carried out by informing the

Complainant that this was produced with MAS LUZ ENERGY which is a brand
marketed by SIE, and not with the supplying company with which at that time
At the time he had contracted the electricity supply

For this reason, and although in this case it has been possible to determine after the investigations

made that their actions have been in accordance with data protection regulations
personal, because incidents of a different nature have been detected in the
procedure for contracting its services, SIE has adopted as a measure the
total paralysis of the contracting procedure for its services since the past
March 4, 2022&gt;&gt;.

LOPDGDD, the claim presented by the complaining party was admitted for processing.

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the

LOPDGDD, is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions

regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures".

                                            II
                                 Unfulfilled obligation


Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the assumptions that allow the
processing of personal data.

"1. The treatment will only be legal if it meets at least one of the following

conditions:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;


b) the processing is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures;

c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the

responsible for the treatment;

d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the interested party or another
Physical person.


e) the processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the controller;

f) the processing is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued

by the person responsible for the treatment or by a third party, provided that regarding said
interests do not prevail over the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party requiring the protection of personal data, in particular when the

interested is a child.

The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph will not apply to the treatment
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.

Recital 40 also affects this question of the legality of the treatment.

of the aforementioned RGPD, when it provides that "For the treatment to be lawful, the
Personal data must be processed with the consent of the interested party or on
any other legitimate basis established in accordance with Law, whether in the present
Regulation or under other law of the Union or of the Member States to which
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/11








referred to in this Regulation, including the need to comply with the legal obligation
applicable to the person responsible for the treatment or to the need to execute a contract with
to which the interested party is a party or in order to take measures at the request of the

interested prior to the conclusion of a contract."

In relation to the above, it is considered that there is evidence that the treatment
of the claimant's data that is the subject of this claim has been made without cause
legitimizing those included in article 6 of the RGPD.

The GDPR applies to personal data, which is defined as “personal data”:
any information about an identified or identifiable natural person (“the interested party”);

An identifiable natural person will be considered any person whose identity can be
be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as
for example a name, an identification number, location data, a
online identifier or one or more elements of the physical identity,
physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social of said person.

It has been verified that there is certification of the digital signature of the contract of

supply by sending an SMS with SIE, on July 14, 2021 and, with this,
he was discharged from the services in August 2021; and, on the other hand, it appears in the
entity his withdrawal due to withdrawal on August 10, 2021 for the
gas and August 26, 2021 for the electricity supply.

It should be noted that SIE does not accredit new hires, the part claimed

provides two invoices for consumption made by the complaining party between the 8th and the 18th
January 2022 and another with consumption made between January 19 and January 11
February of the same year, after the date of cancellation of gas services and
electricity carried out in August 2021.

 In short, SIE provides evidence (recording and SMS) of the contracting, but only

regarding the contract carried out on July 14, 2021, about which the party
The claimant was discharged on August 10, 2021, with respect to the
gas and the 26th of the same month and year regarding the electricity service. However,
does not provide justification for the hiring that was carried out in the month of January of the year
2022 and the claimed party provides two invoices for consumption made by the party
claimant between January 8 and 18, 2022 and another with consumption made

between January 19 and February 11 of the same year, after the date of withdrawal
of the gas and electricity services carried out in August 2021 and,
Consequently, the latter are not justified.

Hence, the claimed party does not prove a basis of legitimacy for the treatment of

the data of the complaining party.

                                            III
                        Classification and classification of the offense


In accordance with the evidence available, it is considered that the
facts presented do not comply with the provisions of article 6.1, so it could
involve the commission of the infraction classified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, which
provides the following:

72.1 of very serious infractions, in this case the limitation period being three
years,

“b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.


                                           IV.

g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in

particular whether the controller or processor notified the infringement and, if so, in what

such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct or
indirectly, through infringement.

In relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, in its article 76,
“Sanctions and corrective measures” establishes that:


"2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
may also be taken into account:

a) The continuous nature of the infringement.


b) The linking of the offender's activity with the performance of medical treatments.

g) Have, when not mandatory, a data protection delegate.

h) The submission by the person responsible or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to

In accordance with the transcribed precepts, in order to set the amount of the sanction of
fine to be imposed in the present case for the infraction classified in article 83.5.a)
of the RGPD for which the claimed party is held responsible, are considered concurrent
the following aggravating factors:


- The evident link between the business activity of the defendant and the
      processing of personal data of clients or third parties (article 83.2.k, of the

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/11








      RGPD in relation to article 76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD).

       The Judgment of the National Court of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006), in which,
      with respect to entities whose activity entails continuous processing of
      client data, indicates that “…the Supreme Court has been understanding that
      Imprudence exists whenever a legal duty of care is neglected, that is
      That is, when the offender does not behave with the required diligence. And in the
      assessment of the degree of diligence, special consideration must be given to

      professionalism or not of the subject, and there is no doubt that, in the case now
      examined, when the appellant's activity is constant and abundant
      handling of personal data must insist on rigor and exquisite
      “Be careful to comply with the legal provisions in this regard.”

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with
regarding the infraction committed by violating the provisions of article 6.1 of the

GDPR allows a fine of 70,000 euros (seventy thousand euros) to be set.

Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
