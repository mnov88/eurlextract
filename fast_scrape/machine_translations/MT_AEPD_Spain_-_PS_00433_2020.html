<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The decision is the consequence of a sanction procedure started by the AEPD against the defendant due to a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen (the claimant) stating that, although he had requested his right of access referring to his registration as new customer, the defendant did not answer such requirement nor handed him the recording of their phone calls referring to the registration.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD requested the defendant twice to answer the requirement by the claimant, but the defendant did not answer nor made any action, so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>Without prejudice to the results of the final investigations corresponding to the sanction procedure, the AEPD understood that the defendant could have breached article 58(2)(c) GDPR: on the basis of the available evidence, the defendant did not answer the requirements of the AEPD regarding the exercise of rights by the claimant. Consequently, after considering some aggravating/mitigating circumstances [(i) the defendant has not obtained direct benefits, (ii) former infractions by the defendant, (iii) the total absence of cooperation with the AEPD in order to fix this situation], the AEPD understood that, in case the sanction procedure resulted in a successful decision, this infringement would be fined with 40,000 € to the defendant. In this sense, the AEPD offered the defendant the possibility to settle the issue before the decision takes place by agreeing to a voluntary payment of part of the fine, with two possible discounts based on acknowledgement of guiltiness (32,000 €) and earliness (24,000€). The defendant agreed to both, so it paid 24,000 € and the sanction procedure was closed by the AEPD.
