<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A data subject lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against Niantic, a software developer, regarding their interactive game "Pokemon Go".
</p><p>Pokemon GO is a game in which users interact with the real world, so they share their location in order to walk the map. This include sharing their user data with others when they go to specific locations called "gyms", in which they play together with others. For that, a user needs to be at least at 500m from the site. Therefore, their real location is also known. 
</p><p>However, some users fake their real location, so they can access the gyms from further away. Therefore, the location of other users may be also shared not only with regular players but with players that are faking their location. 
</p><p>From this data, that can easily indicate where a person lives or works, malicious users could access this information and also infer the real identity of these subjects, what may lead to harassment or stalking. It is important to note that a big number of players of the game are minors, what increases the risk. 
</p><p>The complainant had asked Niantic to avoid sharing location data with users that were known to be faking their location. 
</p><p>Niantic stated that they have a security policy in place that tries to tackle that problem. Players who are detected to use these methods are warned with a three-strikes mechanism. They have other additional measures, such as information about the data that is shared, a recommendation not to provide your real name, the lack of a chat where users can directly interact, prohibitions on harassing and misuse, limited sharing of data, and different privacy options and information. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD considered that the controller had correctly assessed the risks and implemented adequate measures to mitigate them. Their three-strikes mechanism for users that fake their location is deemed to be enough to deal with the alleged risk. Therefore, the DPA decided to archive the case.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>Even if the facts of the case have a logical connection with other GDPR Articles, such as Article 32 GDPR, about the security of processing, the AEPD did not consider its content, but limited their analysis to, and only referred to Article 6 GDPR and the lawfulness of the processing.

        Procedure Nº: E / 09208/2018



                   RESOLUTION OF ACTION FILE



Of the actions carried out by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and
based on the following:

                                       FACTS

FIRST: The claim filed by D. A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claimant)

has entry dated September 18, 2018 in the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection. The claim is directed against NIANTIC, INC., With NIF
C3815285 (hereinafter, the claimed one).

       As stated in his claim, he is a player of the Niantic game "pokemon

go ". This game allows data about your geographical location (coordinates and
hour) that are reflected in the gymnasiums (element of the game located virtually in a
real geographic point) are provided to players who should not have access to
that information.


       Well, when they provide a player with data on their geographical location, the
game sets a limitation for access of approximately 500 meters,
necessary for the development of the game. However, there are players who falsify their
geographical location using programs such as fake / fly gps accessing said
information from other cities or even other countries.


       Niantic allows location data to be provided to players without
verify whether or not you have falsified your geographical location.

       In the game all users have a name which in the case of the claimant is

by the claimant against the defendant for the alleged violation of article 6 of the

RGPD that guarantees the legality of the treatment.
