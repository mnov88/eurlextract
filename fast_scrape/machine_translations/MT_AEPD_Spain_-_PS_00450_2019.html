<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On May 14, 2019, the claimant received a call from a client of XFERA MOBILES. In that call, the client informed the complainant that XFERA MOVILES had charged his bank account with a bill of the claimant, being possible for him to visualize her personal data (name, ID and phone number). AEPD informed XFERA MOBILES about the claim, but did not receive any answer.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Was the error by the controller in charging a bill, which allowed a third party to visualize the claimant's personal data, an infringement of the principles of integrity and confidentiality?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>AEPD considered that the facts reported allow to conclude that the controller was not able to guarantee adequate security in the processing of the complainant's personal data, thus violating Article 5.1 f) of the GDPR (Integrity and confidentiality).
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>It is remarkable that in this case, the controller has not used the existing mechanisms in the Spanish Law of administrative procedure (accepting its responsibility and payment in advance) to reduce the fine by 40%.

The claimant states that, on May 14, 2019, she received a call from a Masmovil client who explained that Masmovil had debited her bank account with an invoice, and therefore her personal details were included in the invoice. He added that he had contacted the complainant and she had told him that everything had been caused by an error.

As a result of the investigative actions carried out, it has been established that the person responsible for the processing is the one claimed.
The party complained of is informed of this complaint on 7 August 2019, requiring it to send this Agency, within a period of one month, information on the response given to the complainant in relation to the exercise of the rights regulated in Articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD, the causes that have led to the incident that has given rise to the complaint and the measures adopted to prevent the similar incidents, implementation dates and checks made to verify their effectiveness.

LEGAL GROUNDS 
I
By virtue of the powers that Article 58.2 of the RGPD recognises to each supervisory authority, and as established in Articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.
II
Article 4.11 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 December, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights, defines the consent of the interested party as "any free, specific, informed and unequivocal expression of will by which the interested party accepts, either by means of a declaration or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data concerning him".
In this sense, Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes that "in accordance with Article 4.11 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, consent of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous expression of his/her will by which he/she accepts, whether by statement or by clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data concerning him/her".

On the other hand, Article 5 regulates the principles relating to the processing of personal data, establishing that they must be (a) processed in a lawful, fair and transparent way in relation to the data subject ("lawfulness, fairness and transparency"); (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes; according to Article 89(1), further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, for the purpose of scientific and historical research or for statistical purposes shall not be considered incompatible with the original purposes ("purpose limitation"); (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ('data minimization'); (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; all reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate in relation to the purposes for which they are processed are erased or rectified without delay ('accuracy');
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es 28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es
4/6
(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of the processing of the personal data; personal data may be kept for longer periods provided that they are processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest or for the purposes of scientific or historical research or statistical purposes, in accordance with Article 89(1), without prejudice to the application of appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation to protect the rights and freedoms of the data subject ('limitation of storage period'); (f) processed in a way that ensures appropriate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage, through the implementation of appropriate technical or organisational measures ('integrity and confidentiality').
The controller shall be responsible for compliance with paragraph 1 and shall be able to prove it ("proactive responsibility").
III
It is considered that the facts reported, i.e. the viewing of the claimant's data by an outside third party, make it possible to establish that the claimant has not been able to guarantee adequate security in the processing of the claimant's personal data, thereby violating Article 5.1 f) of the RGPD, which governs the principles of integrity and confidentiality of personal data, as well as the proactive responsibility of the data controller to demonstrate compliance.
IV
Article 72(1)(a) of the LOPDGDD states that 'in accordance with the provisions of Article 83(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that substantially infringe the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, shall be considered very serious and shall be subject to a three-year limitation period:
(a) Processing of personal data in breach of the principles and guarantees laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
V
Article 58(2) of the GPRS states: 'Each supervisory authority shall have all the following corrective powers
(b) to sanction any controller or processor with a warning where processing operations have infringed the provisions of this Regulation
(d) to order the controller or processor to comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate in a particular manner and within a specified time limit;
(i) to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83 in addition to or in addition to
place of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances
of each individual case;
VI
This offence is punishable by a fine of 20,000,000 euros as
maximum or, in the case of an enterprise, an amount equivalent to 4% as
maximum of the total annual overall turnover of the previous financial year,
opting for the higher amount, in accordance with Article 83.5 of the RGPD.
Likewise, it is considered that the sanction to be imposed should be graduated in accordance with
with the following criteria established by Article 83.2 of the RGPD:
The following are aggravating factors:
In the present case we are dealing with non-intentional negligent action, but
identified significant (Article 83(2)(b))
Basic personal identifiers are affected (name,
surname), in accordance with Article 83(2)(g)
Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and assessed the criteria of
graduation of penalties whose existence has been established,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
FIRST: To impose XFERA MÓVILES, S.A., with NIF A82528548, for a
violation of Article 5.1(f) of the GPRS, as defined in Article 83.5 of the GPRS, a

SECOND: ORDER Xfera Móviles, S.A. with NIF A82528548, in accordance with
provided for in Article 58(2)(d) of the GPRS, to proceed within ten days to
