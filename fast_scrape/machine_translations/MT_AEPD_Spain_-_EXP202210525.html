<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The controller was a security guard hired by a private company providing video surveillance services to a prison in Madrid. The guard used his mobile phone to capture images of a visitor from the video surveillance system and sent these images via WhatsApp to other colleagues. In September 2022, the prison's security department filed a complaint against the controller for possible GDPR violations. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA highlighted that the physical image of a person is personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) GDPR. Therefore, their processing is subject to data protection regulations. The DPA concluded that capturing the images of a person from the prison's video surveillance system and disseminating them via WhatsApp violates the provisions of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6 GDPR</a>. For this reason, the DPA fined the controller €10,000.

The images generated by a system of cameras or camcorders are data of
personal nature, so its treatment is subject to the protection regulations

It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image of the
natural persons) carried out through the denounced video surveillance system is
in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.
II

Article 6.1 of the GDPR establishes the assumptions that allow the use of
processing of personal data indicating the following:
"1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following is fulfilled
conditions:
a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;

f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said
interests do not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the

establishes that natural or legal persons, public or private, may carry out
carry out the treatment of images through systems of cameras or video cameras

detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offenses and enforcement of

V
It is considered that the facts exposed, that is, capturing the images with a mobile phone
of the Center's video surveillance system, in which a visitor to the Center appeared,
to spread them by WhatsApp to other colleagues, violate what is established in the
article 6 of the RGPD, for which reason it could suppose the commission of a typified infraction
in article 83.5 of the GDPR, which provides the following:
Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,

the highest amount:
a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;
For the purposes of the limitation period for infringements, the infringement indicated in the
previous paragraph is considered very serious in accordance with article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD,
which states that:
"Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that

following:
b) The processing of personal data without the fulfillment of any of the conditions of

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR, precepts that state:
"Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of administrative fines
under this Article for infringements of this Regulation
indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are effective in each individual case,
proportionate and dissuasive.”
"Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each
individual case, in addition to or in lieu of the measures contemplated in
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine

b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;
c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to mitigate
the damages and losses suffered by the interested parties;

particular whether the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, if so, in what
extent;
i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been ordered
previously against the person in charge or the person in charge in relation to the
same matter, compliance with said measures;
j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or to mechanisms of
certification approved in accordance with article 42, and
k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,
such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or
indirectly, through the infringement.”
Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the GDPR, the LOPDGDD, article 76,
"Sanctions and corrective measures", provides:
"2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, for the purpose of setting the amount of the sanction of
fine to be imposed in the present case on the entity claimed as responsible for a
offense typified in article 83.5.b) of the GDPR, in an initial assessment,
The following aggravating factors are considered concurrent:
o Seriousness of the facts, since the defendant took advantage of his condition
security guard and access to images to capture and disseminate them
o Intentionality in the action, since such actions are not their own
of their professional work.

It is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed on the defendant and set it at the amount of 10,000
€ in accordance with article 58.2 of the GDPR

the facts that have given rise to the violation of the regulations for the protection of

that the type of procedures, mechanisms or concrete instruments for
implement them corresponds to the sanctioned party, since it is responsible for the
treatment who fully knows its organization and has to decide, based on the
proactive responsibility and risk approach, how to comply with the GDPR and the
LOPDGDD.
