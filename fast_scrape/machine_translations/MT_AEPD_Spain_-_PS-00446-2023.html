<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>An ex-employee of the controller filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Authority, alleging that the company, for which they provided services, compelled them to utilize their personal cell phone for work purposes. This requirement involved installing an application, specifically a company wallet card platform. 
</p><p>Despite the complaints raised, the controller's response was adamant that they would not provide the employee with a company cell phone. Subsequently, the ex-employee mentioned that even after leaving the company, their phone number remained part of two WhatsApp groups. Consequently, they continued to receive messages from former colleagues, appearing in those groups as a former member, with their phone number and name still visible.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish Data Protection Authority ruled that the processing activities conducted by the controller violated Article 6.1 of the GDPR. As a result, the DPA imposed a fine of €2,000 on the controller.

(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency

contradict, on a subsidiary basis, by the general rules on the
administrative procedures."

                                           II
       The reported events materialize in the inclusion in WhatsApp groups
without basis of legitimation, which could violate the regulations on protection

of personal data.

       Article 58 of the GDPR, Powers, states:

       "2. Each supervisory authority will have all of the following powers

corrective measures indicated below:

       (…)
       d) order the person responsible or in charge of the treatment that the operations of

       (…)
       i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with Article 83, in addition to or in

                                           III
       Article 5 of the GDPR, Principles relating to processing, states that:

       "1. The personal data will be:


       a) treated in a lawful, fair and transparent manner in relation to the interested party

       Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the assumptions that allow considering
lawful processing of personal data:

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/12








       "1. The treatment will only be legal if it meets at least one of the following
conditions:

       a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
       personal for one or more specific purposes;

       b) the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
       interested party is part or for the application at his request of measures
       pre-contractual;
       c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation
       applicable to the data controller;
       d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the interested party or

       of another natural person.
       e) the processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in
       public interest or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the person responsible
       of the treatment;
       f) the processing is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests

       pursued by the person responsible for the treatment or by a third party, provided that
       The interests or rights and freedoms do not prevail over said interests.
       fundamentals of the interested party that require the protection of personal data,
       particularly when the interested party is a child.

       The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph will not apply to the

processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.”

       Likewise, Recital 40 of the aforementioned GDPR provides that "In order for
processing is lawful, personal data must be processed with the
consent of the interested party or on some other legitimate basis established in accordance
a Law, whether in this Regulation or under other Union law

or of the Member States referred to in this Regulation, including the
need to comply with the legal obligation applicable to the data controller or the
need to execute a contract to which the interested party is a party or for the purpose of
take measures at the request of the interested party prior to the conclusion of a
contract."


       On the other hand, article 4 of the RGPD, Definitions, in sections 1, 2 and 11,
notes that:

       “1) “personal data”: any information about an identified natural person
or identifiable ("the interested party"); Any identifiable natural person will be considered
person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular

by means of an identifier, such as a name, an identification number,
location data, an online identifier or one or more elements of the
physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of said
person;


       “2) “treatment”: any operation or set of operations performed

       “11) “consent of the interested party”: any manifestation of free will,
specific, informed and unequivocal by which the interested party accepts, either through
a statement or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that
concern him.”

                                           IV

       The infraction attributed to the defendant is classified in the
article 83.5 a) of the GDPR, which considers that the violation of “the basic principles
for processing, including the conditions for consent under the
articles 5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned
article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, “with administrative fines of €20,000,000 as

maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% as
maximum of the total global annual turnover of the previous financial year,
opting for the highest amount.”

       The LOPDGDD in its article 71, Infractions, states that: “They constitute
infractions the acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of the

article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to the
present organic law.”

       And in its article 72, it considers for the purposes of prescription, which are: “Infringements
considered very serious:


       1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
involve a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in
in particular, the following:

       b) The processing of personal data without any of the
       conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the

                                           V
       The processing of personal data requires the existence of a database

vital of the affected person or of another natural person or for the fulfillment of a mission
carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the

responsible for the treatment.

       The claimant in his writing of 05/28/2023 stated that the claimant is obliged
its workers to use their personal mobile phone to work (through the
Soldo application) and, furthermore, that having stopped providing services for the same
continues to be included in two WhatsApp groups, with the company refusing to delete the

themselves and forcing their employees to use their personal phones for work.

       The defendant in writing dated 09/13/2023 has stated that “To date,
They created WhatsApp groups to streamline the day-to-day life of the company, it was not a
mandatory requirement, but only verbal consent was requested, since 31

May 2023, written consent is requested from all workers.”

       Therefore, it is considered that the conduct of the defendant violates the principle of
legality enshrined in article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 a) of the
GDPR.


                                           SAW

Article 76, “Sanctions and corrective measures”, establishes that:
