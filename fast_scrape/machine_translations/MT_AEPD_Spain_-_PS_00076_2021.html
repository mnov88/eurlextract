<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A worker of a clinic lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA because their employer had used their image for advertisement purposes without consent. They had placed huge banners with it in a display window. 
</p><p>The banners were on sight for more than a year, despite the worker's repetitive request, via different ways, for them to take them down.  
</p><p>Such banners were, however, taken down after the worker made a notarial request. The clinic alleged, mainly, that the worker had signed an image rights transfer agreement previous to the display of the banner. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA held that the fact that the worker had signed an image rights transfer agreement previous to the display of the banner was considered as a legal basis for data processing. Hence, they did not find a violation of Article 6.

     Procedure No.: PS / 00076/2021


                RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on
to the following:


                                  BACKGROUND

FIRST: D. A.A.A., in the name and on behalf of D. B.B.B. (hereinafter, the
claimant) on November 10, 2020, he filed a claim with the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection. The claim is directed against CLÍNICA

VIVANTA S.L with CIF B82809492 (hereinafter, Vivanta or claimed).

The reasons on which the claim is based are that the claimant has been providing his
services as a maxillofacial surgeon at the Vivanta Clinic, since September
of the year 2009.


Well, the claimed entity Vivanta, at the beginning of 2020 decided to make use of
of the personal image of the claimant for advertising purposes of the clinic by putting
in the shop window of this one a large poster with his image without
ask him anything about it and he does not consent to such action.


Likewise, on numerous occasions he has required those in charge of the clinic to
to proceed to the removal of the poster with the claimant's image, both
verbally as by means of a notarial request, without the complainant having
proceeded to its withdrawal.


Thus, the image without consent has been exposed to the public from the beginning
of the year 2020, approximately one year, without the claimed attending the
requirements for its withdrawal.

Together with the claim, it provides the notarial request made. In the aforementioned

requirement there are various photographs that certify the exhibition of the poster that
motivates the presentation of the claim.

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of the LOPGDD, which has provided for a
mechanism prior to the admission for processing of claims made before

the AEPD, consisting of transferring them to the Data Protection Delegates
designated by those responsible or in charge of the treatment, for the intended purposes
in article 37 of the aforementioned norm, or to these when it has not designated them, it was given
transfer of the claim to the claimed entity to proceed with its analysis and
respond to the complaining party and this Agency within one month.


THIRD: On December 4, 2020, the respondent was asked to
will provide this Agency with the following information:
