<p>The Brussels Court of Appeal ruled that the corrective measures imposed by the Belgian DPA in a case concerning the delisting of search results should have been imposed on the controller (Google LLC) and not on Google Belgium, since the DPA did not sufficiently explain how the activities of the Belgian establishment (Google Belgium) were inextricably linked to Google LLC.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The complainant, an executive at an unnamed large company, had requested the removal of 12 URLs. As Google had refused to remove several of the concerned links, the complainant referred the case to the Belgian DPA. 
</p><p>Building on the principles developed by the CJEU in the Google Spain and Google/CNIL cases, the Belgian DPA decided that Google Belgium is an establishment of Google LLC , triggering the applicability of the GDPR under article 3.1. 
</p><p>Moreover, the DPA referred to a latter sent on 23 June 2020 by Google LLC to the Irish DPC stating it would no longer object to local (non-lead) supervisory authorities exercising local data protection jurisdiction when it comes to the scope of Google LLC's responsibilities. 
</p><p>As a result, despite the designation of the Irish DPC as lead supervisory authority, the Belgian DPA considered it had jurisdiction because the case did not relate to Google Ireland Ltd's processing activities, but to Google LLC. Therefore, the one-stop-shop procedure did not apply. 
</p><p>On these grounds, the Belgian DPA:
</p>
<ul><li>ordered Google Belgium to de-reference the concerned search results;</li>
<li>imposed an administrative fines of EUR600,000, based on Alphabet's (Google's mother company) annual turnover in the three previous years; and</li>
<li>ordered Google to clarify the ambiguity concerning the roles of the different entities involved, and in particular to clearly and precisely clarify which entity is the data controller for Belgium and for which processing activity.</li></ul>
<p>Google Belgium appealed the decisions before the Court of appeal on the grounds that 
- the order was addressed to Google Belgium which is not the controller in this case
</p>
<ul><li>the APD did not sufficiently motivate how it could be established that Google Belgium was linked to the activities of Google LCC as the controller;</li>
<li>Article 58 GDPR does not provide the possibility to impose a corrective measure on another entity than the controller (ie Google LLC);</li>
<li>the APD published the decision without removing Google's name and even communicated in the press on its decision</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Court annulled the decision on the grounds that the decision imposed a corrective measure on Google Belgium whereas the controller at stake is Google LLC (against which the complaint should be filed), without motivating enough how Google Belgium's activities would be inextricably linked to the controller (Google LLC).   
</p><p>Google Belgium could only be subject to a corrective measure if the APD can prove the link between both companies.  
</p><p>Moreover, the Court confirms the decision to publish the decision without removing the name of Google. However, the Court recognises that it does not have jurisdiction to annul any communication of the APD around the case, nor to impose any action in this respect. Nevertheless, the Court regrets that the APD and its members communicate in the press on a case which is still pending.

A supervisory authority cannot exerciseits power only vis-à-vis the controller or processor.The parties agree that the notion of " controller " is akey concept under the GDPR.Article 17. 1 GDPR stipulates that " the data subject has the right to obtain from the responsibleprocessing the erasure, as soon as possible, of personal dataconcerning and the controller has the obligation to erase such datapromptly, where one of the following grounds applies: ...

Inthe case, following X's request for delisting, the Litigation Chamberon the one hand expressly identifies GOOGLE LLC as responsible forprocessing that would have violated GDPR 8, but on the other hand it orders the settingcompliance of the processing and imposes fines on GOOGLE BELGIUM (and not on GOOGLELLC).Insofar as the Litigation Chamber has established that in this case GOOGLE BELGIUM is notnot the controller but that GOOGLE LLC, is the controller andis solely responsible for the alleged violation of the GDPR (with regard to the complaint ofX), the APD cannot impose on GOOGLE BELGIUM a compliance order ora sanction for breaches related to this processing without violating the definition ofcontroller (article 4.7 of the GDPR), the scope of the GDPR (article3.1 of the GDPR), the right to erasure (article 17 of the GDPR) and its powers (article 58.2of the GDPR juncto article 100 §1, 8 ° , 13 of the LCA Law).The person in charge of the disputed treatment, GOOGLE LLC, is in contact with the APD and has already madesubject to decisions by other national authorities.By arguing that ODA has the power to take action with respect to an entity " whosehealth activities inseparably linked with those of the controller ” 9 and that8 Contested Decision, §161 ("Google LLC failed to comply with the obligations enshrined in ..."), §178 ("Google LLC sefinds indeed failing to identify c / airement ...

It appears as well as athis situation falls within the territorial scope of application of Directive 95/46 and Regulation2016/679. "In the present case, the Contested Decision does not demonstrate that “it emerges from the information provided bythe referral decision, on the one hand, that the establishment available to Google in the territory[beige] carries out activities, in particular commercial and advertising activities, which areinseparably linked to the processing of personal data carried out forneeds of the operation of the search engine concerned and, on the other hand, that this engineresearch must, taking into account, in particular, the existence of gateways between itsdifferent national versions, be regarded as carrying out data processing atunique personal character ”.The APD argues:“42. The Litigation Chamber underlines that this position implies that Google Belgium SAseems to admit that the processing is carried out within the framework of the activities of an establishmentof the data controller in the European Union, i.e. Google Belgium SA. Aanother reading of this position would have - as ruled in / 'Google judgment / CN / L - "forconsequence that the processing of personal data [. ..] either subtracted fromobligations and guarantees provided [by directive 95/46 and] by RGPD ”. In othersterms, reading it would jeopardize the usefulness of the application of the GDPR. "This argument does not demonstrate the inseparable link between GOOGLE LLC and GOOGLEBELGIUM regarding the processing of X.The APD gives the following arguments:'44. In its conclusions in response, the complainant maintains in particular that Google BelgiumSA is a subsidiary of Google LLC. mainly active in digital marketing, includinghead office is located in Brussels and its activity targets the inhabitants of Belgium, and thatGoogle Belgium SA and Google LLC activities are inseparable within the meaning of the Google judgmentSpain mentioned above.45. Google Belgium SA does not dispute this. It is also not disputed that Google BelgiumSA actually and effectively carries out activities in Belgium.46. ​​During the hearing, Google Belgium SA was questioned about the various ro / es ofGoogle establishments. It has confirmed that it does not play any role with regard to the data processedwithin the framework of the three phases of the functioning of the Google search engine, namelyits exploration phase, its indexing phase and its selection phase of the resultsdepending on the request introduced by the user. Google LLC would be solely responsible fortreatment in this context.

"51. In addition, since its activities are inextricably linked to those of Google LLC., This subsidiary inBelgium, having regard to the role it plays and describes, can be treated in the same way as aresponsible for the data processing carried out within the framework of the operation of the engineof Google searches and management of requests for de-listing in Belgium.52. In short, the Contentious Chamber considers that Google Belgium SA should be treated asthe same way as a controller on the basis of the elements of the file andthe Google Spain case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.53. In any event, even though Google Belgium SA could not be consideredas data controller, the Litigation Chamber would remain competent toI have regard to Google Be / gium SA because of the presence of this entity in the beige territory,as the following elements demonstrate. "In other words, the Litigation Chamber claims, but does not demonstrate that there isthe species an inseparable link between GOOGLE LLC and GOOGLE BELGIUM regarding the processingdata from X to lead to dereferencing.References to case-law decisions of the Court of Justice (which the Court ofmarkets does not question), justify the theory, but do not justify its application inthe species.6.6.4.Insofar as the Litigation Chamber of the APO has the power - by virtue of Article58.2.i of the GDPR “to adopt all corrective measures, in particular to impose aadministrative fine in application of article 83, in addition to or in place ofmeasures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the specific characteristics of eachcase ”, this does not imply that it has the power to impose an administrative fine on aentity other than the controller or processor 12- without examination andmotivation of the factual circumstances which demonstrate, on a case-by-case basis, activitiesinextricably linked to the processing of data in personal made for- needs of the operation of the search engine concerned. In the absence of suchmotivation, the Attacked Decision lacks the principles of adequate motivation such asthat governed by the beige law (law July 29, 1991).6.7.6.7.1.12 APD summary conclusions of December 18, 2020, §261.1 PAGE01-00002220406-0027-0041-09-01-_J

This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data by acontroller who is not established in the Union but in a place or the law of aMember State applies under public international law. "The GDPR does not allow the APD to impose corrective measures, advertising orfine to GOOGLE BELGIUM, which is - in this case - no more than a simple subsidiaryor an establishment of GOOGLE LLC.An administrative fine, an injunction and publicity are coercive measures whichcould, if applicable, be imposed on GOOGLE LLC in its capacity asprocessing and pursuant to Article 58 of the GDPR.It is the (procedural) choice of the complainant and the Litigation Chamber of the APD not tonot involve GOOGLE LLC and not require that the APD Inspection Servicecarries out investigations.The data subject (in this case X) has the right to obtain from the data controllerprocessing the erasure, as soon as possible, of personal dataconcerning and the controller has the obligation to erase such datastaff as soon as possible (article 17.1 GDPR).This article does not state that national DPAs can act - without other conditions (seeei-avant) - against other parties - i.e. other legal persons in accordance withto the principles of national law which determines the formal and substantive conditions forbecome a party to an administrative procedure - that the person responsible for the processing.GOOGLE LLC being in this case the controller, GOOGLE IRELAND Ltd beingthe main establishment in the European Union.6.9.2.Insofar as the Litigation Chamber of the APD determines that the person responsible fordisputed treatment is GOOGLE LLC but it pursues and nevertheless sanctions(only and to the exclusion of this controller GOOGLE LLC) a completely differentlegal person (namely GOOGLE BELGIUM), the Contested Decision is notproperly motivated since it does not provide adequate motivation (orsatisfactory) - within the meaning of the law of July 29, 1991 - able to justify to the ChamberLitigation the appropriate jurisdiction, based on the interpretation of the judgments of the Court ofJustice, to conduct prosecutions and impose sanctions (points 2 to 5 of the DecisionAttacked) only to GOOGLE BELGIUM SA which is not the controllerwhich is the subject of the complaint and of which it is not established without ambiguity and without contradictionof the reasons (see ei-before) that it would - in this case - be inextricably linked with thecontroller (GOOGLE LLC).Insofar as the complaint must be directed against the controller andit is only with proof that the local establishment is inextricably linked to this1 PAGE□ 1-00002220406-0031-0041-09-01-_J
