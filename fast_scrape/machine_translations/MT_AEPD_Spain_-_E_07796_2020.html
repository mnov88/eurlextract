<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A Spanish football club, Real Madrid, suffered a data breach in which contracts, sport licenses, budgets, and other types of identifying data and economic information, related to around 1000 persons. This was done by a hacker that accessed the system with stolen credentials. 
</p><p>The club diligently informed of such breach to the competent authority and proceeded to scan the deep web and regular Real Madrid information on the web to verify whether the information had been made public or was for sale. There was no evidence that the hacked information had been used, nor received the authority any complaints regarding it. 
</p><p>After the breach, the controller installed additional measures to prevent it from happening again, namely new cyber-security measures, a double factor identification system, new laptop security protocols, and blocking the IPs from which the attack came.
</p><p>The controller issued a report considering that the stolen information would not affect the reputation of the people involved, not pose any kind of risk to them. Therefore, they decided not to communicate the breach to the data subjects.
</p><p>Additionally, a police investigation is taking place. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD concluded that the controller had adequate security measures and was diligent to mitigate its consequences and to report it to the authority. 
</p><p>Such adequate measures included, among others:
</p>
<ul><li>Data protection policy</li>
<li>Security policies and protocols</li>
<li>Measures to prevent computer atacks</li>
<li>Tools for monitoring, detecting, analysis and reporting security incidents</li>
<li>Data protection and security trainings</li>
<li>Access control measures</li>
<li>Risk analysis of the affected data processing activities</li>
<li>Cyber-security reports</li>
<li>Cyber-security guides</li></ul>
<p>Because of this, the AEPD considered that Real Madrid had implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a certain level of security. Therefore, they did not find a violation of Article 32(1) and decided not to fine the controller.
