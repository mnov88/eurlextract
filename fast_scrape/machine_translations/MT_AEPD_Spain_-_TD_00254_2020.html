<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A complainant, a previous worker of Amazon Spain, made an access request to Amazon in order to obtain different pieces of information that Amazon owned in relation to the period in which they were working for the company. The worker needed this data to use it in a court proceeding regarding social security and disability issues. 
</p><p>Amazon answered to their access request extemporaneously, during the course of this procedure, alleging that they were not in possession of some of the data anymore. The respondent was able to provide some data relating to the claimant's production, but not the instructions and personal communications with Amazon's digital assistant.
</p><p>The deleted information corresponds to operational instructions that are automatically generated by internal systems, relating to specific day-to-day tasks, which are displayed on the devices that employees use to work in the respondent's logistics centres. However, operational data and merely functional instructions are deleted after 7 days, for operational purposes and according to their retention policy.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Was Amazon allowed to delete such data or should them had kept it?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD concluded that, even if the access request had been complied with in the end, they would investigate whether Amazon should had blocked and retained the data according to Article 32 of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2018/12/06/pdfs/BOE-A-2018-16673.pdf">Spanish Data Protection Act</a> (LOPD). This Article obliges controllers to block and retain personal data when suppressing or rectifying it, when it may be necessary to comply with obligations or responsibilities regarding the processing coming from data protection authorities, judges, courts, and other public bodies. 
</p><p>They AEPD indicated that, regarding the requested data, they are only competent of the ones that are personal data. Therefore, on the one hand, functional or operative information, automatized instructions for day-to-day tasks, and work organization systems are excluded from the AEPD competence. On the other hand, personal communications and instructions from Amazon's digital assistant are included. 
</p><p>They AEPD decided to uphold the complaint for formal reasons, as the access request was answered extemporaneously, but did not impose any fine or warning on the respondent, as the rights of the complainant were not diminished, given that they had indeed answered.
</p><p>They also remarked that sanction procedures shall have an exceptional character, and that shall be avoided unless there is no other solution or mechanism. For example, they may not necessary when the rights of the claimant have been fully restored.
</p><p>Finally, the AEPD noted that, even if it is not their function to assess anything related to other kind of procedures, such as social security procedures, the data protection right may indeed have an instrumental character with regard to the exercise of other rights.

pia of the personal data that concerns you and that is being processed

of data, the recipients, the planned period of conservation, the possibility of exercising
other rights, the information available on the origin of the data (if these are not
have obtained directly from the complaining party) or the existence of self-determined decisions
nuanced, including profiling.

right of access, and that, after the period established in accordance with the regulations
aforementioned, your request did not obtain the legally required response.

answered the right of access requested, said allegation being subject to transfer
to the complaining party through the Notification Support, without having submitted
any allegation against it.

Despite this, once the documentation in the procedure has been examined, the
complaining party, specifically requests that the operational instructions that

are automatically generated by internal systems, related to specific tasks,
displayed on devices that employees use for work, and that,
are necessary for a litigation in the social jurisdiction, and adds that the claimed has
the obligation to keep the data while legal responsibilities may arise
of the treatment, as in this case, a means of proof before a litigation in said

jurisdiction.
In relation to the instructions and personal communications of the digital assistant that
have been deleted, it should be noted that, for the purposes of the RGPD, "data

personal: any information about an identified or identifiable natural person ("the
interested"); an identifiable natural person shall be considered any person whose identity

online identifier or one or more elements of physical identity,
physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social of said person; ”, therefore

Therefore, the instructions and communications through the digital assistant are messages
that have been sent to the perfectly identified complaining party, therefore,
information about you, information that should have been blocked
As established in the art. 32 of the LOPDGDD and not proceed to its deletion.

This Agency will assess whether there are administrative responsibilities that should be
purified in the relevant procedure and determine if the commission has occurred
or not of an infraction.

Furthermore, it should be noted that questions of a functional nature or of
operational work in the center and on automated instructions in the work
daily and work organization systems, does not fall within the scope of competence

of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection to settle the conflict that underlies between
the parties, or enter into assessments regarding the validity of the employment contract, which

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/7








must be filed before the labor or judicial authority, as it exceeds the scope of competence
of this Agency.


However, in relation to what was stated by the defendant that, it has nothing to do with
with the request to process a request for temporary disability before the authority
Social Security, it is not the responsibility of this Agency to assess said issue, but the
The right to data protection also has an instrumental character for the exercise
of other rights.

the response has been issued extemporaneously, where it is reported that no
has the data related to the instructions and personal communications of the

digital assistant, without requiring the performance of additional actions by
of the person responsible for the file.
