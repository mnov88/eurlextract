<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against IDFinance Spain, S.A.U. (the controller), a financial technology company. The data subject alleged that the controller was unlawfully processing her data concerning an inaccurate debt in its credit information systems.
</p><p>The data subject challenged the debt at issue in court in March 2023, where the case was ongoing. She had also filed a claim with the AEPD, in which the controller stated that it was deleting the data subject’s data from its credit information systems. However, in 27 August 2023, a report by ASNEF, the national association of credit financiers, included the challenged data concerning the data subject which was provided by the controller. 
</p><p>On 29 January 2024, the AEPD initiated sanctioning proceedings against the controller. 
</p><p>In its reply brief, the controller alleged that it had deleted the data subject’s data from the ASNEF file between March and May and that it had security measures to ensure only lawful data is transmitted to information systems. Nonetheless, it acknowledged that in this case, a technical error had occurred which caused the personal data to be re-uploaded on ASNEF. Upon realising the error, the controller immediately removed the data.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD considered that the processing here was erroneous and resulted from a confidentiality shortcoming due to a technical error. As a result, it found no legal basis for the processing in violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a> and recommended a fine of €70,000. 
</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673">Article 20(1)(b) LOPDGDD</a> creates a presumption of legality for the processing of data concerning debts which are certain, due and payable, whose existence has not been the object of a judicial or administrative complaint. However, the AEPD found that this did not extend a legal basis in this case because the debt was the object of complaints and because the debt was not certain or enforceable given the ongoing judicial processes.
</p><p>In calculating the recommended fine, the AEPD considered that the linking of the controller’s activities as a financial institution with the processing of personal data was an aggravating circumstance, given the risk to the data subject (including because other entities offering financial services are implicated). It rejected the controller’s arguments that it is not a credit institution and thus the aggravating circumstances of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673">Article 76(2) LOPDGDD</a> should not apply. It also noted that the unintentional nature of the error does not exonerate the controller.
</p><p>The AEPD recommended a sanction of €70,000. Pursuant to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10565">Law 39/2015</a>, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the AEPD informed the controller that it may acknowledge its responsibility for the alleged violations and/or pay the proposed fine. Each of these actions reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to reduce the fine by 40%, both acknowledging its responsibility for the violations and paying the reduced sanction amount of €56,000.

The GDPR in its article 4.11 defines the consent of the interested party as “any
manifestation of free, specific, informed and unequivocal will by which the
interested party accepts, either by a declaration or a clear affirmative action, the
processing of personal data that concerns you.”


In relation to the legality of the processing of personal data, article 6.1
of the GDPR, establishes the following:

"1. Treatment will only be legal if at least one of the following is met

interests do not prevail over the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party requiring the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child.

The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph will not apply to the treatment
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions.”

In relation to credit information systems, we must go to article 20.1
of the LOPDGDD, highlighting its section b), which establishes the following:

"1. Unless proven otherwise, the processing of personal data will be presumed lawful.
relating to the breach of monetary, financial or credit obligations by

legislation on consumer credit contracts and real estate credit contracts.

                                           IV
                 Classification of the violation of article 6.1 of the GDPR


The inclusion of the personal data of the complaining party in solvency files
patrimonial, despite the fact that the debt is not yet certain or enforceable because it is
questioned in an ongoing judicial process, represents a violation of article 6.1 of the
GDPR.

However, the claimed party states that it is not a credit institution so it cannot

The aggravating circumstance of article 76.2 b) of the LOPDGDD must be applied. Then the
claimed party in response to the initial agreement further states that it has already given
drops the claimant which implies that it has the technical and security measures
necessary organizational measures, the events that concern us being the result of a technical error
(the deconfiguration of the button in the file of the Claimant client), and that it is not

This is no improper data processing.

In this sense, it must be indicated first of all that article 76.2 b) LOPDGDD,
considers as an aggravating circumstance the connection of the offender's activity with the carrying out
of personal data processing, which does not bind only credit institutions,
but also to the entities that provide financial services to users since their

activity involves the processing of personal data, which is why said aggravating circumstance
turns out to be applicable.

In relation to the consideration that this is a technical error, it is not a
argument that allows the claimed party to be exonerated from liability, nor

grants legitimacy in the processing of personal data since this has been a
illicit data processing, since the personal data of the complaining party has
been improperly registered in the ASNEF solvency file, despite the fact that the debt
object of registration is not true since it is being appealed judicially.


For all these reasons, the reported facts represent a violation of article 6.1 of the
RGPD, since the inclusion of personal data in solvency files for a
debt pending judicial resolution, involves processing personal data without
that it is established that the claimed party has carried out the necessary consideration that
allows you to determine the prevalence of your legitimate interest over the interests, rights
and freedoms of the complaining party, as this treatment is not covered by the

presumption of legality contemplated in article 20 of the LOPDGDD since the debt
required object of inclusion in the solvency files is not yet true or enforceable to the
find themselves in an ongoing judicial process.

                                           SAW

           Proposed sanction for violation of article 6.1 of the GDPR

Article 58.2 of the GDPR provides the following: “Each supervisory authority will have
of all the following corrective powers indicated below:


b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with a warning
when the processing operations have violated the provisions of this
Regulation;


C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/13








d) order the person responsible or in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where applicable,
in a certain way and within a specified period;


i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with Article 83, in addition to or instead of the
measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each case
particular;

Likewise, article 72.1 b) of the LOPDGDD states that “depending on what

established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are considered very serious and
infringements that involve a substantial violation will prescribe after three years
of the articles mentioned in that one and in particular, the following:

b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions of

legality of the treatment in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

This violation may be punished with a fine of a maximum of €20,000,000 or,
In the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
of larger amounts, in accordance with article 83.5 of the RGPD.


Likewise, it is considered that it is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the
following criteria established by article 83.2 of the RGPD:

The following are aggravating factors:


     In the present case we are dealing with negligent action (article 83.2 b) since
    that the personal data of the complaining party is included in files of
    solvency, despite the debt being included in the procedure
    judicial in progress. Furthermore, it must be taken into account that the data was kept

    of the claimant despite having knowledge of the judicial procedure.

     The link with the processing of personal data, by the
    recamada entity, being an entity that provides financial services to its
    users, according to article 76.2 b) of the LOPDGDD.


It is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed on the accused and set it at the amount of €70,000
in accordance with article 58.2 of the GDPR.

                                          VII

                                 Adoption of measures

If the violation is confirmed, it could be agreed to impose on the person responsible the adoption of
appropriate measures to adjust its actions to the regulations mentioned in this
act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the RGPD, according to the

which each control authority may “order the person responsible or in charge of the
treatment that the processing operations comply with the provisions of the
this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain manner and within a
specified period…”

In this specific case, it has been indicated by the claimed party that the personal data
of the complaining party are no longer in the solvency file.


However, the claimed party is required to, within a period of one month
since receiving the resolution of this sanctioning procedure, prove that

The imposition of this measure is compatible with the sanction consisting of a fine

It is warned that failure to comply with the possible order to adopt measures imposed by

This body in the sanctioning resolution may be considered as a
administrative offense in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD, classified as
