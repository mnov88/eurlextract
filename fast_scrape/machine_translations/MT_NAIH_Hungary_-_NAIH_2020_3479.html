<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A complainant argued that he continued to receive a newsletter from a controller to an old e-mail address despite numerous attempts to rectify his data. According to the complainant, even when his address had been changed manually by an employer of the controller, he continued to receive the newsletter to the older one.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA stated that the controller infringed Article 16 of the GDPR, as he did not comply with the complainant's request. However, given that that the e-mail address has been corrected as a result of the proceedings, no further measure is required. Additionally, given that the rights of the data subject are closely linked to data protection principles, the DPA concluded ex officio that the controller violated the principle of accuracy under Article 5 (1) (d) of the GDPR.

ARC. Decision

In its application, the Applicant requested the Authority to establish that the Applicant
infringed his right to rectification under Article 16 of the General Data Protection Regulation by his e-mail address
during the change.


Regarding how to provide information on the correction of personal data
the obligations of the controller are detailed in Article 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

It was not possible to prove that fact in a credible manner in the present proceedings - and
The Authority has not identified any other means by which it can be optimally clarified that
Whether or not the applicant clicked on the “confirm” button on 21 February 2020 or

on the same day, the Applicant’s employee manually corrected the Applicant’s email
address. However, it can be stated that before 20 February 2020 alone, the Applicant
The legal declaration communicated by the Commission to the Applicant on the Applicant's interface shall not be considered a data subject
as an application, as in that case it was carried out by only one Applicant
it was an amendment to the data and not a request for a correction indicating the inaccuracy of the data. So the
The applicant's only complaint to the Applicant, submitted on 20 February 2020, was considered
as a request for rectification under Article 16 of the General Data Protection Regulation

without undue delay, but no later than one month.

However, despite the fact that the Applicant lawfully amended the
In view of the applicant's complaint lodged on 20 February 2020, the e-mail address, the so-called campaign
management system illegally on 8 July 2020 only as a result of the present proceedings
corrected the Applicant's email address.


On the basis of all this, in view of the fact that the Applicant to correct the Applicant's e-mail address
has not complied with its request of 20 February 2020, the Authority finds that
The applicant infringed Article 16 of the General Data Protection Regulation. However, given that
that the Applicant has corrected the Applicant's e-mail address as a result of the present proceedings, further
no measure is required. Also given the rights of the data subject
are closely linked to data protection principles, the Authority concludes ex officio that
By violating the details of the exact e-mail address of the Applicant, the Applicant violated it

the principle of accuracy under Article 5 (1) (d) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

The Authority finds, as an infringement related to the above infringement, that at the same time the
treated personal data without legal basis in connection with the sending of the newsletter, as it was two newsletters


                                                                                               7is sent (March 16, 2020 and March 20, 2020) after February 21, 2020 about it
informed the Applicant that he had corrected his e-mail address.


The Acre. According to Section 51 (b), if the authority exceeds the administrative deadline - and
there was no place to make a decision - equivalent to a fee or charge for conducting the proceedings
in the absence of this, he shall pay ten thousand forints to the applicant client, who shall be released from the
from the payment of procedural costs. Consequently, the Authority shall take a decision in accordance with the operative part
brought.

IV.3. Legal consequences


The Authority examined whether it was justified to impose a data protection fine on the Applicant.
In this context, the Authority complies with Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation and Infotv. 75 / A. §-
on the basis of which it considered all the circumstances of the case and found that in the present proceedings
in the case of detected infringements, the warning is a proportionate, dissuasive sanction and therefore a fine
is not required.


The Authority shall use the following criteria for each measure, as appropriate
has decided, in the light of:

    - the gravity of the infringement is low, also taking into account the fact that it has been established
       the infringements are closely linked and the damage suffered has not occurred
       in proceedings [Article 83 (2) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation];

    the infringement is the result of the Applicant 's negligent conduct [general data protection
       Article 83 (2) (b) of the Regulation]

    - the Authority convicted the Applicant of NAIH / 2020/2758/4. In its decision no
       breach of the General Data Protection Regulation, however, NAIH / 2020/2758. No.
       The findings made in the course of the proceedings cannot be regarded as relevant in the present case [General
       Article 83 (2) (e) of the Data Protection Regulation];

    - the personal data (email address) affected by the breach do not constitute special data
       [Article 83 (2) (g) of the General Data Protection Regulation]

    - the Applicant as soon as it becomes aware that the Applicant is not a valid e-mail
