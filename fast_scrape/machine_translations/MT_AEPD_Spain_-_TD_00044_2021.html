<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A data subject filed a complaint against a controller with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) for not answering their erasure request. The data subject had tried to exercise their right to erasure against a news website that had allegedly published false facts about them. After receiving no answer, the data subject exercised their right against Amazon Web Services, whose services were being used by the controller. 
</p><p>AWS rejected the claim, alleging that they were not a controller but a processor, and that they were only following the instructions of the actual controller and could not unilaterally erase any data. The AEPD received the complaint and first sent it to the controller for them to provide an answer. Not having received a satisfactory answer, the DPA launched a proceeding.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD determined that, according to Article 28(3)(e), the processor has the obligation to assist the controller in the fulfilment of the controller's obligation to respond to rights requests, when possible. Therefore, Amazon Web Services should have answered the request of the data subject.
</p><p>The DPA found that the processor had either not answered appropriately to the request, or had not responded to the erasure request, since they did not have any document proving that they did so. The DPA ordered the processor to give an adequate answer to the data subject's request, either upholding the request, or rejecting it in a reasoned way.

                           RESOLUTION NO: R / 00423/2021

Considering the claim made before this Agency by A.A.A. (hereinafter, the part

claimant), against AMAZON WEB SERVICES EMEA SARL SUCURSAL EN ESPAÑA
(hereinafter, the claimed party), for not having been duly attended to their right
suppression.

The procedural actions provided for in Title VIII of the Law have been carried out.
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of

digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the following have been verified


                                       FACTS


FIRST: The complaining party exercised the right of deletion against the complained party and,
Faced with an unsatisfactory response, he filed a claim with this Agency. Bliss
claim was inadmissible by:
“… In the present case, after the analysis carried out on the documents provided and the
concurrent circumstances, there are no rational indications of the existence of a

infringement within the competence of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection,
Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of article 65.2 of Organic Law 3/2018,
of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of rights
digital, IT IS AGREED to reject the claim ... "

Later, the claimant presents an appeal for reconsideration which is favorable and gives

place to the current claim.

analysis and respond to the complaining party and to this Agency within a period of

of the RGPD), and is obliged to respond to requests made no later than a
month, unless you can show that you are unable to identify the
interested party, and to express their reasons in case they were not to attend said

referring to the extremes provided for in article 15 of the RGPD).

The exercise of this right may be considered repetitive on more than one occasion.

during the period of six months, unless there is legitimate cause for it.

On the other hand, the request will be considered excessive when the affected party chooses a medium
other than the one offered that involves a disproportionate cost, which must be
assumed by the affected party.


FOURTH: Article 17 of the RGPD, which regulates the right to delete data
personal, establishes the following:

"1. The interested party shall have the right to obtain without undue delay from the person responsible for the

treatment the deletion of personal data that concerns you, which will be

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/7








a) the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which

b) the interested party withdraws the consent on which the treatment in accordance is based

with Article 6, paragraph 1, letter a), or Article 9, paragraph 2, letter a), and this is not

taking into account the available technology and the cost of its application, it will adopt
reasonable measures, including technical measures, with a view to informing
responsible who are treating the personal data of the request of the interested party

the same.

3. Sections 1 and 2 will not apply when the treatment is necessary:
a) to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information;

e) for the formulation, exercise or defense of claims ”.


FIFTH: In the case analyzed here, it is necessary to assess whether the response of the respondent
is sufficient based on your responsibility in handling the data and the
information that is published regarding the claimant.


On the one hand, the respondent points out that they act as the person in charge of the treatment and the
responsible is the administrator and journalist of the site https://extraconfidencial.com/ that
published your personal data and to whom you should contact to exercise your rights.


In accordance with the definition in charge of the treatment contained in article 4.8 of the
RGPD, provides: “in charge of the treatment or in charge: the natural or legal person,
public authority, service or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the

responsible for the treatment. " and in article 28.3 e) it provides: “will assist the person in charge,
taking into account the nature of the treatment, through technical measures and
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/7








appropriate organizational arrangements, whenever possible so that it can comply with
their obligation to respond to requests that have as their object the exercise of the

rights of the interested parties established in chapter III; "

Therefore, in accordance with the regulations set forth, in the case under examination, it has
it has been established that the complaining party requested the deletion of the information
contained in the url, and that, after the period established in accordance with the regulations

above, your request got a response.
The complained party claims to have met the required right by communicating to the client the
right requested, but does not prove it documentary.
However, from this Agency we consider that in the absence of response from the
entity that produced the news object of the claim, “… The claimant states that
after receiving no response from the administrator of extraconfidencial.com, he was forced to

request the deletion of the complained (AWS)… ”, it is not possible that the complained now (AWS),
consider that you have met the criteria established in the transcribed precepts,
either for not giving an answer or for not having transferred the request to the person in charge
of the treatment, affirmation that they make but do not accredit.


The aforementioned rules do not allow the request to be ignored as if it were not
would have raised, leaving it without the answer that must be issued by the
responsible, even in those cases in which it does not meet the requirements
provided, in which case the recipient of this is also obliged to request the
correction of the deficiencies observed.


Therefore, the request that is formulated obliges the person responsible in question to give
express response, in any case, using any means that justifies
receipt of the reply.

Based on the foregoing, considering that the present procedure is intended to

object that the guarantees and rights of those affected are duly
restored, and since the claimed does not provide a response from his client
(responsible for the information), as you are informed of the request of the
claimant, nor has he documented documentary evidence of having done it, it is appropriate to estimate
this claim.


Considering the cited precepts and others of general application,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: ESTIMATE the claim made by A.A.A. and urge AMAZON WEB

SERVICES EMEA SARL BRANCH IN SPAIN with CIF W0185696B, so that, in
