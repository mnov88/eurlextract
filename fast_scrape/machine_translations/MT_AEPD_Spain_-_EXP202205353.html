<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject was a member of the Hunters Association of Alzira, the controller, and sent a letter to its president requesting access to the accounting books. The president then shared this letter in a Whatsapp group formed by 195 associates, together with private conversations with the data subject. The data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA highlighted that the WhatsApp group in question should limit itself solely to the sharing of information that is necessary for the fulfillment of the ends of the association. Therefore, it held that personal data were unduly disclosed to third parties, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality.
</p><p>Similarly, it found that the Association had not implemented sufficient security measures, in view of the potential risks involved in the data processing activity.
</p><p>For these reasons, the DPA imposed a fine of: a) €2,000 for the violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a>; b) €1,000 for the violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>It is interesting to note two issues in this decision: 
</p><p>a) data processing, consisting of sharing personal information in a WhatsApp group, was carried out without a legal basis. Therefore, there would be a violation of Article 6(1) GDPR in the first place. However, the DPA did not analyze the lawfulness of the processing and went straight to the analysis of the principles in Article 5, in particular, the principle of confidentiality and integrity.
</p><p>b) the DPA applied two separate fines, one for violation of Article 5(1)(f) and one for violation of Article 32 GDPR. Apparently, the Spanish DPA has adopted this method of applying separate fines more recently.
