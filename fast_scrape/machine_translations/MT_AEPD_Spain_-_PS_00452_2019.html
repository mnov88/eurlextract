<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A customer of the data controller filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD), alleging that up to six phone lines had been opened in his name despite the data subject not having given his consent.
</p><p>It was a fraud by which someone pretends to be a real client of the company - after obtaining their documentation - and calls the operator to contract voice or Internet products pretending to be that real user.
</p><p>The situation also led to the inclusion of the customer who reported the operator in the files of ASNEF (Asociación Nacional de Establecimientos Financieros de Crédito), in whose records the customers of companies with outstanding invoices are stored.
</p><p>Orange replied to the AEPD that the consent had been unequivocal and did not attribute falsity to the line registrations that have met the regulatory recruitment requirements
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Is the processing of personal data, without the express consent of the person involved in the contract, a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1a" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(a) GDPR</a>?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD considered that ORANGE ESPAGNE did not act with due diligence to identify the contracting parties. Therefore, it processed personal data without accrediting that it had the legal basis to do so.
</p><p>Furthermore, it was not aligned with the principle of proactive liability, which consists of previously determining that it met the requirements for processing the complainant's data.
</p><p>The fact that it was a non-intentional negligent action, that basic personal identifiers were affected and the continued nature of the infringement were considered aggravating factors, determining the amount of the fine in €80,000.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>In a ruling dated 31 May 2006, the Spanish Audiencia Nacional established that the burden of proof lies with the data controller, who must collect and store the data in order to demonstrate the customer's consent.
</p><p>In the judgement of the Audiencia Nacional of 12 May 2014 it was established that the value of unequivocal consent cannot be given to a telephone call. Similarly, payment of monthly bills arising from the contract cannot be considered as tacit consent.

LEGAL BASES
I
The Director of the Agency is competent to decide on this action
Spanish Data Protection Authority, in accordance with the provisions of Article 48.1
of the LOPDPGDD.
II
With regard to the statements made by the appellant, it is reiterated
basically in the allegations already made in the course of the proceedings
It should be noted that all of them have already been analyzed and rejected in
the Legal Basis from II to IV inclusive, of the Resolution under appeal,
as transcribed below:
"II
The defendant is charged with an infringement of the
Article 6 of the GPRS, "Lawfulness of processing", which states in paragraph 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:
 "1. Processing shall be lawful only if at least one of the following conditions is met
conditions:
a) the data subject has given his consent to the processing of his data
for one or more specific purposes;
(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
interested is a party to or for the application at his request of measures
pre-contractual;
(…)”
 The infraction is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers it as such:
“5. Infringements of the following provisions shall be sanctioned, in accordance with
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 20 000 000 or
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
the total annual turnover for the previous financial year, opting for
the largest:
(a) The basic principles for treatment, including the conditions for
consent under articles 5, 6, 7, and 9.
 Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements considered to be very serious" he states:
"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will expire after three years if
constitute a substantial breach of the articles mentioned in that one and, in
In particular, the following:
 (…)
a) The processing of personal data without any
conditions for the lawfulness of processing laid down in Article 6 of
Regulation (EU)2016/679.
III
The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
Article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it processed the data of the
personal data of the claimant without having any legitimacy to do so. The
The complainant's personal data were incorporated into the information systems
of the company and inclusion in the Asnef credit information file, without
accredited that he had his consent to the collection and processing
of your personal data, or there is some other cause that makes it lawful to
treatment carried out.
On the basis of the above, in the case analyzed, it is
The diligence employed by the respondent to identify the victims of the
persons who carried out the recruitment on behalf of the claimant.
It should be noted that the party complained of in the letter of 9 September 2018
addressed to the complainant stated the following:
"We inform you that by virtue of the complaint you have lodged with the
Spanish Data Protection Agency a study has been carried out by the
Risk Analysis of this company in order to determine the existence of
irregularities in the recruitment carried out on your behalf.
In this respect, the existence of contracts and
recordings of the company verifying the telephone recruitment process in the
which gives consent for the activation of the lines ***TELEFONO.5,
***TELEFONO.1, ***TELEFONO.2, ***TELEFONO.4, ***TELEFONO.3 and
***TELEFONO.6, having the same full appearance of legality. Likewise, it is

for invoices issued between 26/06/2015 and 26/07/2016.
Therefore, since no irregularities could be established
in the contracts made that allow this company to catalog the
controversial contracts as fraudulent, nor has it been
Once the police report has been filed, it is absolutely necessary that this commercial

the regulatory requirements for procurement. That said, the debt that currently
maintained in this mercantile one is considered certain, expired, and exigible".
Well, on the part of the respondent, the claim of the
complainant; it has not been sufficiently established that the processing of
the personal data was collected in accordance with the above-mentioned provisions
previously; it having been established that Orange has associated the personal data
of the claimant to the registration of six telephone lines that he denies having contracted.
 The Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the National Court, in
The Commission has considered that when the holder of the rights to the

existence and the person responsible for processing the data of third parties must collect and
keep the necessary documentation to accredit the consent of the holder.
We quote, for all, the SAN of 31/05/2006 (Rec. 539/2004), Fundamento de Derecho
Fourth.
The claimant's personal data were recorded in the files of the
claimed and included in the Asnef credit information file and were treated
to issue invoices for services associated with the claimant. Consequently,
has processed the personal data without providing evidence that
The legal entitlement to do so counts.
However, and this is the essential point, the claimed does not prove the legitimacy to
the processing of the claimant's data.
In short, the respondent has not provided any document or evidence
any evidence that the entity, in such a situation, would have deployed the
minimum diligence required to verify that your interlocutor was indeed the one
he claimed to hold.
Respect for the principle of legality which is at the heart of the fundamental right
The protection of personal data requires that it be proven that the
the data controller took the necessary steps to prove that
extreme. If this is not done - and if it is not required by this Agency, which is responsible for ensuring
for compliance with the regulations governing the right to data protection of
personal nature - the result would be to empty the principle of legality of its content.
In addition, with regard to the arguments made by the defendant, it is
notes first of all that the prescription did not occur since it is recorded in the
the entity's files the outstanding debt and Orange carried out actions to recover
debt and therefore there was data processing, as stated in the complaint in
his letter of 9 September 2018.
Moreover, as acknowledged by the requested in the articles
64.2 first and second paragraphs and 65.1, 2, and 4 of the LOPDGDD is not established from
the obligation to notify the Resolution of non-admission to the
The complaint will not be processed, nor will the resolution of the appeal for reversal be accepted.
It should be noted that the reference to Article 118(1) of
the LPACAP, that "where new facts or documents are to be taken into account not
in the original file, will be made known to the interested parties in order to within a period of not less than ten days and not more than fifteen days, make the allegations and
submit the documents and supporting evidence they deem appropriate".
 However, the present sanctioning procedure does not concern new
facts are the same. Therefore, the sanctioning procedure has been opened with
all legal guarantees and therefore no such claim has been made.
As regards the merits of the dispute, as indicated by the SAN of 12 May
2014, "Telephone recording which cannot be validly recorded for the purpose of
unambiguous consent, not only because no reference is made to such consent
but, above all, because such consent in Article 6.1 LOPD must be of the
owner of the personal data and in the present case it is evident that he is not,
as the voice on the recording is male and not female.
On the other hand, and with regard to the alleged existence of
tacit consent as a result of the payment of electricity bills by
part of the complainant. That payment does not mean, as this Chamber has stated in
the consent of the person concerned to continue to deal with his or her
personal data by ..."
The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the
obligations imposed by personal data protection regulations
It is therefore obvious. Diligent compliance with the principle of the lawfulness of processing
of third party, data requires that the data controller be in a position
to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).

In accordance with the above provisions, for the purpose of fixing the amount of the
penalty of a fine to be imposed in the present case for the infringement in
Article 83.5.a) of the RGPD for which the Respondent is held responsible, it is considered
The following factors are concurrent:
As aggravating criteria:
- In this case we are dealing with an unintentional negligent action, but
significant identified (Article 83(2)(b)).
- Basic personal identifiers are affected (name, a
identification number, the line identifier) (Article 83(2)(g)).
The balance of the circumstances referred to in Article 83(2) of the GPRS, with
with regard to the infringement committed in breach of Article 6 thereof, allows
set a penalty of 80,000 euros (eighty thousand euros), classified as "very serious", to
