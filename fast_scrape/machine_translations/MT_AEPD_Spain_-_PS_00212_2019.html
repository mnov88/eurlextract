<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that, when she entered the online customer area of the data controller (with the corresponding user and password) in order to cancel a service which had been contracted in the name of her mother, the customer area gave her access to personal data of another person different to her mother (the third one); in the complaint, she included screenshots of the customer area.
</p><p>The data controller did not answer to any investigation requests (neither from the claimant nor from the AEPD), so the AEPD started the sanction procedure. 
</p><p>In this procedure, the data controller alleged that the event probably occurred due to a human error, as both the complainant and the third person called the data controller's customer service on the same day, and the customer service agent probably provided them with the same access code. The data controller claimed that there was no guilt nor intention from its side. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD understood that the data controller has effectively infringed the security of processing principle. 
</p><p>It considered the following aggravating circumstances:
</p><p>(i) the data controller has committed a non-intentional, negligence action, but over significant data that allow personal identification and 
</p><p>(ii) personal identification data such as the name or the online access code has been affected. 
</p><p>It finally decided to impose a fine of EUR 60,000 on the data controller and offered the data controller the possibility of an early payment reduction of the fine, that the data controller accepted. Consequently, the final amount of the sanction has been EUR 48,000.

<pre>RESOLUTION R/00338/2019 TO TERMINATE THE PROCEDURE FOR VOLUNTARY PAYMENT

In the sanctioning procedure PS/00212/2019, instructed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency to VODAFONE ONO, S.A.U.,   In view of the complaint submitted by A.A.A., and on the basis of the following, FIRST BACKGROUND:On 24 June 2019, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against VODAFONE ONO, S.A.U. The agreement to initiate the procedure was notified and after analysing the allegations presented, on 25 July 2019 a proposal for a resolution was issued, which is transcribed below:&lt;Procedure no.: PS/00212/2019From the procedure initiated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following:

BACKGROUND

FIRST: A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complainant) on January 15, 2019 filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency.   The claim is directed against VODAFONE ONO, S.A.U. with NIF A62186556 (hereinafter, the claimant). The reasons for the claim are that on 15 January 2019, when the claimant accesses the customer area with the corresponding user name and password to cancel a service contracted in the name of her mother, she discovers that the computer system of this entity, with this user name and password, provides her with access to the data of a third party unrelated to her mother.On the same day, he communicated these facts by telephone, without having had any news about it until that moment.

FIFTH: Having been notified of the above-mentioned agreement to initiate proceedings, the defendant, on July 15, 2019, submitted a statement of claim in which, in summary, it stated that the facts which are the subject of these proceedings had occurred as a result of a human error.The Complainant argues that on 15 January 2019 the two persons involved made a call to the VODAFONE customer service department and that as a result of this call each of them was sent a code so that they could view their invoices. It is likely that the agent, by mistake, provided the same code, which could have triggered access to the wrong information.This entity points out that in no case was there any intention or culpability in the way of acting, but rather insists that the facts have been produced by a human error.

SIXTH: On July 23, 2019, the instructor of the procedure agreed to open a period of practice of evidence, taking into account the previous actions of investigation, E/01730/2019, as well as the documents supported by the claimed on July 15, 2019:

FIRST: On 15 January 2019, when the claimant accesses the client area with the corresponding user name and password to cancel a service contracted under her mother's name, she discovers that the computer system of the said entity, with the user name and password, facilitates access to the data of a third party unrelated to her mother.

SECOND:VODAFONE claims that on January 15, 2019, the two individuals involved made a call to VODAFONE's customer service department, and that as a result of this call, each of them was sent a code so that they could view their bills. For this reason, it is likely that the agent mistakenly provided the same code, which could have led to the wrong information being accessed. However, in no case was there any intention or culpability in the way of acting, but it is an isolated fact, produced by a human error.
