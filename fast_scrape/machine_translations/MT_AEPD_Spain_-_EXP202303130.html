<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject had health problems arising from conflicts in the workplace in the City Council of Zaragoza (the controller). The Prevention and Occupational Safety Service of the City Council of Zaragoza, issued a medical report recommending that she contact the Health Monitoring Unit to assess an adaptation or change of job. The Health Surveillance Unit issued a decision to adapt the tasks of her post along with an attached document containing the data subject's medical report. This e-mail was sent without a seal or indication marking the information as confidential. This was different to standard procedure for confidential e-mails at the City Council of Zaragoza, who usually use nominal corporate e-mail accounts and an Internal Communications Service (SIC).
</p><p>When the AEPD began its sanctioning procedures, the controller sent a letter to the DPA admitting a personal data breach. However, they made the point that it was an isolated event. Additionally, they claimed adequate security measures had been taken because only "authorised personell" are permitted to open emails. Nonetheless, this does not mean that the email access was limited as anyone within the City Council could have opened it. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA held that the controller violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a> by not using the security measures available to the controller, and by allowing unauthorised persons to access the data. The controller also violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a> by failing to have reasonable security measures on place based on the possible estimated risks. In particular, a messaging system should have been used that guaranteed delivery only to the person/s in positions who must have access to the documents in order to carry out their functions.
</p><p>The AEPD declined to fine the controller, instead ordering the controller to adopt security measures to prevent the dissemination of health data via email so that processing is carried out with complete security.

FIRST: On August 28, 2021, the dissemination of health data from the
claimant by the Occupational Prevention and Safety Service of the City Council of
Zaragoza using an email "without any type of seal or indication that

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Protection of Personal Data and

guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures

processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions

cited article 4.7 of the RGPD.

security of personal data” (hereinafter security breach) as “all
those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or alteration
accidental or unlawful personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed
form, or unauthorized communication or access to said data.”


In the present case, there is a personal data security breach dated 18
August 2021, through the report issued to ***POSITION.1 by (…) in relation
to the worker D. A.A.A., where he is transferred - in an email attachment -
to the direct manager of said worker, (…) Mr. B.B.B..


The document transferred contained the opinion of the Prevention and Health Service
Labor on measures to adapt the functions to be performed by the
worker D. A.A.A., measures that had to be known and applied by their
immediate superior D. B.B.B..


In its defense, the city council has indicated that although for this transfer of
documentation was not used the corporate nominal account of D. B.B.B. nor the Service
Communications Internal -SIC-, the account used ***EMAIL.1 is priority use
of the person in charge of the center, Mr. B.B.B. and in its absence it is only suitable to open it
the personnel to whom he specifically delegates.


It should be noted that the receipt of a complaint about a security breach
does not imply the imposition of a sanction directly, since it is necessary to analyze
the diligence of those responsible and in charge and the security measures applied,
in accordance with the provisions of article 32 of the GDPR.

In this case, a claim is filed because on August 18, 2021,
A report has been issued to ***POSAL.1 by (…) Mr. A.A.A., via email

In this sense, the Zaragoza city council responds that although for this transfer

Zaragoza city council considers that the message contained all the guarantees of
security and data protection, this is not only the name of your recipient and the
content of the file that was being transferred but the legal warning/clause that both the
Data Protection Regulations such as the Data Protection Law establish
with all the information necessary both to guarantee confidentiality and, in
where appropriate, to be able to exercise the rights of access/rectification, cancellation and

opposition at any time.

Despite such statements, it has been found that the city council has been trying
the following personal data of the complaining party: the name and surname, as well as
as personal health data, without respecting the principle of integrity and

confidentiality in your treatment.

These facts imply that the claimed party is violating article 5.1 f) of the
GDPR, indicated in legal basis II for violating the duty of
confidentiality of the personal data it processes when it was confirmed that a

message to the address ***EMAIL.1, which according to the City Council is a priority use of the

Therefore, this Agency considers that making the data available to
unauthorized persons constitutes a violation of art. 5.1.f) of the RGPD attributable to
this case to the ZARAGOZA CITY COUNCIL.

The aforementioned violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD implies the commission of the violations

“Infringements of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
