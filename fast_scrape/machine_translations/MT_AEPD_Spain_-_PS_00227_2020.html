<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 23 July 2020, a citizen reported to the AEPD a harassment campaign that the company RECAMBIOS VILLALEGRE S.L. carried out through Facebook and WhatsApp against a homeless person who, according to the company, had stolen money from the office cash register.
</p><p>The aforementioned company used images collected with security cameras that recorded the street pavement, without having an informative poster on the premises that mentioned the use of these cameras.
</p><p>The same complainant presented another letter on July 25, 2020 to the AEPD informing that several newspapers had reported the alleged theft, that a quick trial had been held and that the indigent person had been acquitted for lack of evidence, since none of the published images could prove that the person had taken money from the offices.
</p><p>Once again, the company published images of the person on Facebook with the aim of negatively affecting their reputation.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Is the recording of personal images (without a notice board) and their subsequent publication on social networks (Facebook and WhatsApp) an infringement of Articles 6 and 13 GDPR?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD decided to impose, for infringement of Article 6 GDPR, a fine of € 10000 and, for infringement of Article 13 GDPR, a fine of € 2000.  
</p><p>In addition, the company was required, within one month, to remove the Facebook posting and the comments affecting the homeless person who was harassed, to put up an information poster of the recording of images with video surveillance cameras, and to have the information for those affected required by the GDPR. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>As factors to be taken into account, in this case, were assessed: 
</p><p>The nature and seriousness of the infringement, taking into account the purpose of the processing operation in question as well as the level of the damage suffered; the intentionality or negligence of the infringement; that it concerns a small enterprise whose main activity is not linked to the processing of personal data That no recurrence is appreciated, since the commission of the infringement is not established, within the period of one year, of more than one infringement of the same nature.

        Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: «The procedures
processed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions

                                              II

        The physical image of a person, in accordance with article 4.1 of the RGPD, is data

personal protection and their protection, therefore, is the object of said Regulation. In article 4.2
of the RGPD defines the concept of "processing" of personal data.

        It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image
of natural persons) carried out through the capture of photography and video

reported is in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD.

                                              III

        In the first place and referring to the publication of the images indicated in the

the claims made, article 6.1 of the RGPD, establishes the assumptions
coughs that allow the processing of personal data to be considered lawful:

      "1. The treatment will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following
terms:
      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data

      personal for one or more specific purposes;
      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
      pre-contractual;
      c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation

      applicable to the person responsible for the treatment;
      d) the treatment is necessary to protect vital interests of the interested party or of
      another natural person.
      e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in
      public interest or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the person responsible

      of the treatment;
      f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests
      pursued by the controller or by a third party, provided that
      the interests or the rights and freedoms do not prevail over said interests

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/15








      fundamental data of the interested party that require the protection of personal data,
      in particular when the interested party is a child.
      The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the

treatment carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions. "
      On this question of the legality of the treatment, the
Recital 40 of the aforementioned RGPD, when it states that “For the
treatment is lawful, personal data must be processed with consent
of the interested party or on any other legitimate basis established in accordance with Law, and
either in this Regulation or by virtue of other Union law or the

Member States to which this Regulation refers, including the need to
comply with the legal obligation applicable to the person responsible for the treatment or the need to
execute a contract with which the interested party is a party or in order to take measures
at the request of the interested party prior to the conclusion of a contract. "


      In relation to the above, it is considered that there is evidence that the
treatment of data of the person who appears in the images object of this
claim has been made without justifying cause of those included in article 6
of the RGPD.

      The RGPD applies to personal data, which is defined as' data

personal information ": any information about an identified or identifiable natural person (" the
interested"); an identifiable natural person shall be any person whose identity
can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier,
such as a name, an identification number, location data, a
online identifier or one or more elements of physical identity,

physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social of said person.

      The person whose data the complainant has processed is perfectly identifiable
since their identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular
through the images and comments that the company has included on Facebook

claimed.
                                            IV

       Second, the photograph that is extracted from the video surveillance system
installed by the claimed invades the sidewalk of the street from which you enter the premises.


      It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image
of natural persons) carried out through the video surveillance system of the
claimed is in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD.

      Article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, regarding the principles of treatment, provides that

personal data will be "adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in
relation to the purposes for which they are processed ("data minimization").&#160;» East
article enshrines the principle of data minimization in data processing
personal. It assumes that said treatment is adjusted and proportional to the purpose to
the one that is addressed, and the processing of excessive data must be restricted or

proceed to the suppression of them.

      The relevance of the data processing must occur both in the field
of the collection of the data as in the subsequent treatment that is carried out of the

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/15








themselves.

      Article 12.1 of the RGPD states: “1. The data controller will take the

appropriate measures to provide the interested party with all the information indicated in the articles
the 13 and 14 "The RGPD lists the categories of information that must be provided to
an interested party in relation to the processing of their personal data in cases where
those that are collected from the same (article 13) or are obtained from another source (article 14).

      12.7 indicates: “The information that must be provided to interested parties by virtue of

Articles 13 and 14 may be transmitted in combination with standard icons
that allow to provide in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible way
an adequate overview of the planned treatment "

      Article 22 of the LOPDGDD establishes the specificities of the treatment of

data for video surveillance purposes, indicating the following:

      "1. Individuals or legal entities, public or private, may carry out the
Image processing through camera or video camera systems with the
purpose of preserving the safety of people and property, as well as their
installations.


      2. Images of public roads may only be captured to the extent that it is
Essential for the purpose mentioned in the previous section.
However, it will be possible to capture the public road in a greater extension
when necessary to guarantee the security of goods or facilities

strategic or infrastructure related to transport, without in any case
may involve capturing images from inside a private home.

       3. The data will be deleted within a maximum period of one month from its
collection, except when they had to be kept to prove the commission of

acts that threaten the integrity of people, property or facilities. In that
In this case, the images must be made available to the competent authority in
a maximum period of seventy-two hours from the knowledge of the
existence of the recording.
The blocking obligation provided for in the
Article 32 of this organic law.


       4. The duty of information provided for in article 12 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 will be understood to be fulfilled by placing an information device
in a sufficiently visible place identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment,
the identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights provided in the

Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the
informational device a connection code or internet address to this
information.
In any case, the data controller must keep available to the
affected the information to which the aforementioned regulation refers.


       5. Under article 2.2.c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, it is considered
Excluded from its scope the treatment by a natural person of images
that only capture the interior of your own home.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/15








This exclusion does not cover the treatment carried out by a security entity
private that had been hired for the surveillance of a home and had access
to the images.


       6. The treatment of personal data from images and
sounds obtained through the use of cameras and video cameras by the Forces
and Security Bodies and by the competent bodies for surveillance and control in
prisons and for the control, regulation, surveillance and discipline of the
traffic, will be governed by the transposition legislation of Directive (EU) 2016/680,

when the treatment is for prevention, investigation, detection or
prosecution of criminal offenses or execution of criminal sanctions, including
protection and prevention against threats to public safety. Outside
of these assumptions, said treatment will be governed by its specific legislation and
supplementary by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and this organic law.


       7. What is regulated in this article is understood without prejudice to the provisions of
Law 5/2014, of April 4, on Private Security and its development provisions.

       8. The treatment by the employer of data obtained through
cameras or video cameras is subject to the provisions of article 89 of this law

organic. "

                                            V

       In order that the duty of information provided for in article 12 of the

RGPD is complied with in a concise and understandable way for the affected party, the aforementioned
Article 22 of the LOPDGDD provides for a "layered information" system.

       It is recommended that the first layer or modality inserted in the
video surveillance area warning contains the most important information, details

of the purpose of the treatment, the identity of the person in charge and a description of the
rights of the interested party, legal basis of the treatment and identification of the person in charge
of the treatment and form of contact. The importance of providing this information
in advance arises, in particular, from recital 39 of the RGPD, not being
necessary to specify the precise location of the surveillance equipment; but nevertheless,
The surveillance context should be clear.


       Thus, in summary, on the poster or badge of the video-monitored area, you must inform
about:

       -The existence of the treatment (video surveillance).


       -The identity of the person responsible for the treatment or the video surveillance system, and
the address of the same.

       -The possibility of exercising the rights recognized in articles 15 to 22

of the RGPD.

       -Where to obtain more information about the processing of personal data.


C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/15








        The information in the second layer should be available in one place
easily accessible to the interested party, be it an information sheet at a reception, cashier
etc. or placed in a visible public space, or refer to a web address with the

rest of the elements of article 13 of the RGPD.

        Article 13 of the RGPD establishes the information that must be provided when
the personal data is obtained from the interested party, which is the following:

        "1. When personal data relating to him are obtained from an interested party, the

responsible for the treatment, at the time these are obtained, will provide
all the information indicated below:

        a) the identity and contact details of the person in charge and, where appropriate, their re-

        b) the contact details of the data protection officer, if applicable;

        d) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter f), the interests

e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, in their

case;
        f) where appropriate, the intention of the person responsible to transfer personal data to a
third country or international organization and the existence or absence of a decision of
adequacy of the Commission, or, in the case of the transfers indicated in the articles
46 or 47 or article 49, paragraph 1, second paragraph, reference to guarantees

appropriate or appropriate and the means to obtain a copy of these or the fact that
that have been borrowed.

        2. In addition to the information mentioned in section 1, the person responsible for the
treatment will facilitate the interested party, at the time the personal data is obtained

sonal, the following information necessary to guarantee data processing

        a) the period during which the personal data will be kept or, when not
where possible, the criteria used to determine this deadline;
        b) the existence of the right to request the data controller for access

to the personal data relating to the interested party, and its rectification or deletion, or the limitation-
treatment, or to oppose treatment, as well as the right to portability

        c) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter a), or the
Article 9, paragraph 2, letter a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent in

any time, without affecting the legality of the treatment based on the
feeling prior to withdrawal;
        d) the right to file a claim with a supervisory authority;
        e) if the communication of personal data is a legal or contractual requirement, or
        a necessary requirement to sign a contract, and if the interested party is obliged

        f) the existence of automated decisions, including profiling, to

        3. When the person responsible for the treatment plans the subsequent treatment of data
personal data for a purpose other than that for which it was collected will provide
to the interested party, prior to said subsequent treatment, information about that other
purpose and any additional pertinent information pursuant to section 2.

        4. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply when and in

the extent to which the interested party already has the information. "

        The second part of the claim is specified in that the claimed entity
It does not have a poster informing about the presence of the cameras.


        In accordance with the foregoing, this Agency considers that there are indications about the
existence of video surveillance cameras installed in the claimed entity without the
necessary informational badge.
