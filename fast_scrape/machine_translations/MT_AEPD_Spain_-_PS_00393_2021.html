<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>An individual lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) alleging that the owner of a restaurant across the street had installed a hidden video surveillance camera that recorded the public space outside the restaurant, including complainant's front door, at all hours. The owner of the cameras claimed that they were installed for security purposes after there thefts in the area but provided no documentation to substantiate that claim.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD held that the cameras constituted excessive surveillance and imposed a fine of €2,000 on the controller for violating the principle of data minimisation in <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.</a> The AEPD fined the controller an additional €1,000 for failing to provide adequate signage in compliance with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a>. The AEPD noted that it is the responsibility of the controller to make sure surveillance cameras are set up in a lawful manner. Surveillance cameras must be oriented towards private property to avoid excessive recording; recording public spaces is an exclusive competence of the Spanish state. Furthermore, cameras must be accompanied by signage indicating their presence, the purpose of surveillance, and the identy of the controller. This is true even in the case of a "simulation" camera which might lead to third parties believe that they are being permanently recorded.

or other types of acts that justify, in the judgment of this body, the presence of

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW


                                             Yo

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director
of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate and to re-
solve this procedure.

                                            II

In the present case, the claim dated 04/12/21 is examined by me-
gave from which the following is transferred as the main "fact":


       "He has placed hidden among the plants a camera with a colored casing.
white as indicated in the attached photo. This camera is oriented towards the door.
entrance door of my house (...)”-folio nº 1--.

The art. 5.1 c) RGPD provides the following: The personal data will be:


       “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes
for which they are processed ("data minimization").

It should be remembered that individuals are responsible for ensuring that the systems installed

the requirements demanded by the regulations in force.

In any case, the cameras must be oriented towards the particular space, avoiding

With this type of device it is not possible to obtain image(s) of public space either.

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 4/7








It should be remembered that even in the case of a "simulated" camera, the same
should preferably be oriented towards private space, since it is considered
that this type of device can affect the privacy of third parties, that they are inti-

measured by it in the belief of being the subject of permanent recording.

       On the part of individuals, it is not possible to install devices for obtaining
images of public space, outside the cases allowed in the regulations.

                                            III


In accordance with the evidence available in this proceeding
sanctioning party, it is considered that the claimed party has a chamber(s) of
video-surveillance with which it controls the public sidewalk "processing third-party data" without
justified cause, lacking proper signage.


       The known facts constitute an infraction, attributable to the party
claimed, for violation of the content of art. 5.1 c) GDPR.

       Item, the establishment lacks an informative sign indicating that it is
a video-monitored area, in such a way that passers-by are unaware that it is

of a video-monitored area, the data being processed by a camera
conveniently simulated.

       So that the exposed facts suppose a violation of art. 13
RGPD, lacking a duly approved informative label, indicating the res-

responsible for the treatment or the purpose(s) of the treatment carried out with the device
in question.

       Article 22 of Organic Law 3/2018 (December 5)-LOPDGDD- provides:


       "1. Natural or legal persons, public or private, may carry out the
processing of images through camera systems or video cameras with the purpose of
to preserve the safety of people and property, as well as its installations.
nes.

       The AEPD, in a related report, stipulates that it is not necessary for car-

TVs are placed just below the cameras. It is enough to do it in a visible place and
that includes open and closed spaces where the video camera circuit is
operative.
       This badge will be displayed in a visible place, and at least, at the entrances to the

gilada in each of them.

       The fact that the owner of the hotel activity has a License for

public space, this being a task reserved for the Police Forces and Corps.

        Remember that the cameras must be oriented (vgr in the case of the store)
da) at most to the facade of the same to avoid as a guideline the breakage of the
storefront or towards the main points of access to it, while the interiors

must be marked with an informative poster indicating the presence of the same
more to the potential clients of the same.
                                            IV

The art. 83.5 RGPD provides the following: “Infringements of the following provisions
will be sanctioned, in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines of 20

EUR 000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, an equivalent amount.
to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover of the financial year
above, opting for the highest amount:

        a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

           consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;
        b) the rights of the interested parties under articles 12 to 22 (…)

When motivating the sanction, the following is taken into account:

        - the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the nature

nature, scope or purpose of the treatment operation in question, as well as
the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages suffered
fried; (art. 83.2 a) RGPD).

        - the intent or negligence in the infringement; (art. 83.2 b) RGPD), to the proce-

to obtain images of a public area, whose competence is reserved to the
State Security Forces and Bodies, being the same considered a negligence
serious agency for the reasons stated.

The cameras are oriented towards the public transit area, exceeding the angle

collection necessary for the protection of the establishment, affecting rights
of third parties who are intimidated by them as they consider themselves to be recorded
by them, not being the same informed with the presence in visible area of
informative poster(s) about it.

        So it is considered correct to impose a sanction encrypted in the amount

€2,000 (two thousand euros) for the violation of art. 5.1 c) GDPR and €1,000 (Thousand euros)
for the infringement of art. 13 RGPD, lacking the required signage, being the
total sum of both amounts €3000 (three thousand euros), sanction located on the scale
lower for this type of behavior.


Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and after assessing the graduation criteria
tion of the sanctions whose existence has been proven,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:


FIRST: IMPOSE the company LODEJU, S.L., with NIF B92047745, for an in-
fraction of Article 5.1.c) and 13 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, a
fine of €3,000 (three thousand euros).
