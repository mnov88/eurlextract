<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 12 December 2022, a data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against CUI ZSQ FOOD, S.L. (the controller) concerning the controller’s video surveillance system. The data subject alleged that the controller used the video surveillance to observe an employee’s absence from his post to use the toilet for 18 minutes and sent the footage to employees in a WECHAT group chat. The video was sent with a caption stating that it observed the employee using the toilet for 18 minutes. It asked the employees if they all thought that it was fair to do so, and if not, that the employee should have the money subtracted from his pay. 
</p><p>The controller argued that the message in the WECHAT group was the result of an angry outburst by the controller’s production overseer due to the employee’s prolonged absence. It did not admonish any employee because it considered that the only purpose of the message was to remind the workers that they should respect the company’s obligations for employees. The controller argued that no employee was identified in the message by name, and that it was not possible to identify the employee from the footage due to its quality. 
</p><p>The AEPD noted that the controller’s facility had several signs indicating a video surveillance zone prior to entering the recorded space. Its alleged purpose for the surveillance was monitoring the security of the workplace and employees, the quality of the products and the work of the employees. The controller claimed that all employees were given a privacy policy which mentioned the video surveillance system and these purposes. The retention period for video surveillance data was 30 days.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD found that the controller violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a> when one of its employees sent a video of the data subject to a WECHAT group. The distribution of the video surveillance footage lacked a legal basis and violated the confidentiality of the data subject’s personal data, along with the other employees visible in the video. 
</p><p>The AEPD recommended a sanction of €70,000. Pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the AEPD informed the controller that it may acknowledge its responsibility for the alleged violations and/or pay the proposed fine. Each of these actions reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to reduce the fine by 40%, both acknowledging its responsibility for the violations and paying the reduced sanction amount of €42,000.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures

processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with a

                                   Previous issues

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of article 4.1 and 4.2 of the RGPD,
involves processing personal data, since the party

of article 4.7 of the GDPR.


                                           III

In the present case, as can be seen from the facts, A.A.A. shipped on May 19
2022 to a WECHAT group with all its employees a video in which you can
see a person leaving their job and another video in which that person
person returns. As recognized by the claimed party in its allegations, said
person was in charge of monitoring production, whose conduct qualifies

as a hot reaction (...) to the absence for a prolonged time of
someone in their workplace, a fact that results in significant harm to
the company and the other workers.

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/12









However, such dissemination lacked any legal basis and violated the
confidentiality of the personal data of the aforementioned worker as well as the rest of the

employees visible in the recording.

Therefore, in accordance with the evidence available herein
moment of agreement to start the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what
results from the instruction, it is considered that the known facts could be
constituting an infraction, attributable to the claimed party, for violation of the

article 5.1.f) of the RGPD.

          Classification and classification of the violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD


The known facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to the party
claimed, typified in 83.5 RGPD, which under the heading “General conditions
for the imposition of administrative fines” provides:
"5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20 000 000 or,

serious the following behavior:

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

considered very serious and will prescribe violations that involve three years
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

       a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
       established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)”

                                 Sanction proposal

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount,

in accordance with the evidence currently available
agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction, it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with
the following criteria established by article 83.2 of the RGPD:


       - The nature, severity and duration of the infraction, taking into account the
       nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
       as well as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damage and
       damages they have suffered (section a): due to the improper dissemination of two

       videos in which you can see a worker who was absent and returned to her
       job, as well as other workers on the production line, in
       a chat with all employees (at least 51 employees in 2022) of the

       company, with the presumed intention of warning - upon being classified as fact
       as a notable detriment to the company and other workers -, in order to
       to avoid possible similar behavior from other workers.

Likewise, it is considered that it is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the
following criteria established in section 2 of article 76 “Sanctions and measures

“corrective measures” of the LOPDGDD:

       - The linking of the offender's activity with the performance of treatments
       of personal data (section b): this is a company used to
       capturing images of its, at least, 51 workers in 2022, when counting

       with 37 cameras in its facilities.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with
regarding the infraction committed by violating the provisions of article 5.1.f) of the
RGPD, allows initially setting an administrative fine of €70,000
(SEVENTY THOUSAND EUROS).

                                Adoption of measures

If the violation is confirmed, it could be agreed to impose on the person responsible the adoption of

appropriate measures to adjust its actions to the regulations mentioned in this
act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the RGPD, according to the
which each control authority may “order the person responsible or in charge of the
treatment that the processing operations comply with the provisions of the
this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain manner and within a

specified period…” The imposition of this measure is compatible with the sanction
consisting of an administrative fine, as provided in art. 83.2 of the GDPR.

It is warned that failure to comply with the possible order to adopt measures imposed by
This body in the sanctioning resolution may be considered as a
administrative offense in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD, classified as

infringement in its article 83.5 and 83.6, and such conduct may be motivated by the opening of a
subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.

Therefore, in accordance with the above, by the Director of the Agency
