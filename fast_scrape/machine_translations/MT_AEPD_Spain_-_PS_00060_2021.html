<p>A Spanish court lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) after delivering a judgment in which it was accredited that an individual had contracted a microloan using the personal data of another person without their consent, for what the individual was convicted.
</p><p>The AEPD launched an investigation.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD concluded that the individual had processed the personal data of a data subject without a legal basis to do so, as they had contracted a microloan using their personal data and without their consent.
</p><p>Therefore, the AEPD found that the individual had violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a>, and fined them €1000. The DPA took into account that the infringement had been committed intentionally.

      personal for one or more specific purposes;
