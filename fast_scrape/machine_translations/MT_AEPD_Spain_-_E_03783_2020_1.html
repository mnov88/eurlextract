<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The Directorate for National Security of the Ministry of Interior issued guidelines for the police forces to monitor news and social networks to spot fake news and misinformation, to prevent some actors from causing social stress, in light of the covid-19 pandemic. 
</p><p>This came to the Spanish DPA (AEPD) knowledge, that launched an investigation to verify that such behaviour complied with the personal data regulations.
</p><p>Such guidelines were issued to prevent and minimize the effects of misinformation, with extreme vigilance and monitoring of networks and websites where false messages and information aimed at increasing social stress are disseminated, and, where appropriate, calling for the intervention measures provided for in the applicable legislation".
</p><p>According to the guidelines, within the surveillance and monitoring of networks and web pages, intervention shall only be carried out in accordance with the aforementioned purposes and principles and always under the protection of the applicable legislation. Also, personal data will only be processed when there is sign of a criminal offence, in accordance with the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L0680">Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data</a>. 
</p><p>If such activities were related to national security, then the processed would be carried out with basis on the national legislation regarding state secrets and classified matters.
</p><p>In their response to the DPA, the Directorate for National Security also stated that they do not collect personal data, but only carry out a daily observation of news or public information from social networks, where the information collected relates to data of a public nature, shared by its authors through social networks and public media, consisting primarily of the content of the communication and the medium of dissemination. 
</p><p>For this, specialized officers from the Spanish Civil Guard ("Guardia Civil") browse the news and create anonymous users to monitor (read) social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Badoo and other websites.
</p><p>Afterwards, reports with reference to cybercrime, cyberterrorism, hacktivism, cyberattacks, misinformation and news summaries are issued. If there is a sign of a criminal offence, evidence is gathered. Such reports are stored for 5 years.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA concluded that there was no violation of the GDPR, that is not applicable in accordance with its Article 2, nor with the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016L0680">Directive (EU) 2016/680</a>, as personal data were not processed, as the reports showed, and there was no evidence that there was any illegal additional processing. Therefore, the presumption of innocence principle applied. 
</p><p>Hence, the AEPD archived the case.

Law, approved by Royal Decree 1720/2007, of December 21, specifies said

       From the actions mentioned in the factual antecedents, it appears
that within the framework of the National Security Strategy and the competencies
attributed by article 11 of the Law of State Security Forces and Bodies,
as well as Royal Decree 463/2002 of March 14, which declares the state
alarm for the management of the health crisis situation caused by COVID-

having carried out a total of 53 reports, one daily, between March 20 and
on May 11, 2020.

       The delegate of Data Protection of the Ministry of the Interior, states that

In these activities, a priori, no data processing is carried out
personal, limiting itself to the daily observation of news or information
public social networks, in which the information collected refers to data from
public nature, shared by their authors through social networks and media
communication audiences, consisting mainly of the content of the
communication and the means of dissemination.


       As stated in the on-site inspection carried out, “these reports are

       The AEPD inspectors collected copies of 3 reports dated 19, 20 and

March 28, 2020, in which it is verified that the structure and content are
corresponds to the above, without the documents provided
contain personal data.

       Therefore, the processing of data from

personal character. It must be taken into account that, to Administrative Law
Sanctioner, due to his specialty, are applicable to him, with some qualification but without
exceptions, the inspiring principles of the criminal order, being clear the full
virtuality of the principle of presumption of innocence.


C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/10








       In this sense, the Constitutional Court, in Sentence 76/1990 considers that
the right to the presumption of innocence implies “that the sanction is based on
acts or means of proof of charge or incriminating the reproached conduct; what

The burden of proof rests with the accuser, without anyone being obliged to prove
his own innocence; and that any shortcomings in the test result
practiced, freely valued by the sanctioning body, should be translated into a
acquittal ”. This principle is expressly stated for
sanctioning administrative procedures in article 53.2.b) of the Law
39/2015, of October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the

Public Administrations, which recognizes the interested party the right “To the presumption of
non-existence of administrative responsibility until proven otherwise "

       In short, the application of the principle of presumption of innocence prevents
impute an administrative infraction when no evidence has been obtained or

evidence from which the existence of an infringement is derived.


       Therefore, in accordance with what was stated, by the director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection,


       HE REMEMBERS:

       FIRST: PROCEED TO THE FILING of these actions.
