<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The complainant is a city council. The respondent is an individual.
</p><p>The city council filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA regarding two video surveillance cameras that the individual put up on their property. The cameras faced the public highway, and the poster signalling their existence did not contain sufficient information on the data controller for the data they collected as well as on who data subjects would need to contact to enforce their rights.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>After restating the law on installing video surveillance cameras, the Spanish DPA held the respondent violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(c) GDPR</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a> by intentionally or negligently positioning the cameras to record public areas without justified cause, therefore processing data of identifiable natural persons, and by failing to provide sufficient information as to the identity of the controller and where data subjects can go to exercise their rights under the GDPR.
</p><p>As such, the DPA imposed a fine of €1500 on the individual and ordered them to move the cameras to comply with the GDPR.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                             I


By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director
of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.


                                             II

The physical image of a person under article 4.1 of the RGPD is personal data
and its protection, therefore, is the subject of said Regulation. Article 4.2 of the GDPR
defines the concept of “treatment” of personal data.


Article 22 of the LOPDGDD establishes the specificities of data processing
for video surveillance purposes, indicating the following:

        "one. Natural or legal persons, public or private, may carry out the
processing of images through camera systems or video cameras with the

purpose of preserving the safety of people and property, as well as their
facilities.

        2. Images of public roads may only be captured to the extent that
is essential for the purpose mentioned in the previous section.


        However, it will be possible to capture the public road in an extension
superior when necessary to guarantee the security of goods or
strategic installations or infrastructures linked to transport, without
In no case may it involve capturing images of the interior of a home
private.


        3. The data will be deleted within a maximum period of one month from its
collection, except when they had to be kept to prove the commission of
acts that threaten the integrity of persons, property or facilities. In that
case, the images must be made available to the competent authority in

within a maximum period of seventy-two hours from the date of knowledge of the
existence of the recording.

        The blocking obligation provided for in
article 32 of this organic law.


        4. The duty of information provided for in article 12 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 will be understood to be fulfilled by placing an informative device
in a sufficiently visible place identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/10








the identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercising the rights provided for in the
Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It may also be included in the
informative device a connection code or internet address to this

information.

        In any case, the data controller must keep available to
those affected the information referred to in the aforementioned regulation.

        5. Under article 2.2.c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, it is considered

excluded from its scope of application the treatment by a natural person of images
that they only capture the interior of their own home.

        This exclusion does not cover processing carried out by a security entity
private that had been contracted for the surveillance of a home and had access

to the images.

        6. The processing of personal data from the images and
sounds obtained through the use of cameras and video cameras by the Armed Forces
and Security Bodies and by the competent bodies for surveillance and control in
penitentiary centers and for the control, regulation, vigilance and discipline of the

traffic, will be governed by the legislation transposing Directive (EU) 2016/680,
when the treatment is for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or
prosecution of criminal offenses or execution of criminal sanctions, including
protection and prevention against threats to public safety. Out of
In these cases, said treatment will be governed by its specific legislation and

additionally by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and this organic law.

        7. What is regulated in this article is understood without prejudice to the provisions of
Law 5/2014, of April 4, on Private Security and its development provisions.


        8. The treatment by the employer of data obtained through information systems
cameras or video cameras is subject to the provisions of article 89 of this law
organic.”

                                            III


        In accordance with the foregoing, the processing of images through a
video surveillance system, to be in accordance with current regulations, must comply with
the following requirements:

        - Respect the principle of proportionality.


        - When the system is connected to an alarm center, you can only
be installed by a private security company that meets the requirements
contemplated in article 5 of Law 5/2014 on Private Security, of April 4.


        - The video cameras will not be able to capture images of the people who
are outside the private space where the security system is installed.
video surveillance, since the processing of images in public places can only be
carried out, unless there is government authorization, by the Forces and Corps of

Security. Nor can spaces owned by third parties be captured or recorded without
the consent of their owners, or, as the case may be, of the persons who are
find.


This rule admits some exceptions since, on some occasions, for the protection
of private spaces, where cameras have been installed on facades or inside,
it may be necessary to guarantee the security purpose the recording of a
portion of public road. That is, cameras and video cameras installed for the purpose of
security will not be able to obtain images of public roads unless it is

essential for said purpose, or it is impossible to avoid it due to the location of
those and, extraordinarily, the minimum space for said
purpose. Therefore, the cameras could exceptionally capture the portion
minimally necessary for the intended security purpose.


       - The duty to inform those affected provided for in the
articles 12 and 13 of the RGPD, and 22 of the LOPDGDD, in the terms already indicated.

       - The person in charge must keep a record of treatment activities
carried out under its responsibility, including the information to which it makes
reference article 30.1 of the RGPD.


       - The installed cameras cannot obtain images from private space of
third party and/or public space without duly accredited justified cause, nor can
affect the privacy of passers-by who move freely through the area. No this
allowed, therefore, the placement of cameras towards the private property of neighbors

with the purpose of intimidating them or affecting their private sphere without just cause.

       - In no case will the use of surveillance practices be admitted beyond the
environment object of the installation and in particular, not being able to affect the spaces
surrounding public, adjoining buildings and vehicles other than those accessing the

guarded space.

In summary and to facilitate the consultation of interested parties, the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection offers through its website [https://www.aepd.es] access to
the legislation on the protection of personal data, including the RGPD and the
LOPDGDD (section “Reports and resolutions” / “regulations”), as well as the Guide

on the use of video cameras for security and other purposes, as well as the Guide
for compliance with the duty to inform (both available in the section “Guides
and tools”).

It is also of interest, in the event of carrying out low-risk data processing, the

facilitates free tool (in the “Guides and tools” section), which, through
specific questions, allows to assess the situation of the person in charge with respect to the
treatment of personal data that it carries out, and where appropriate, generate various
documents, informative and contractual clauses, as well as an annex with measures
guidelines considered minimum.

                                            IV

In the present case, the claim was filed because the respondent has

installed two video surveillance cameras on the facade of his home, oriented
towards the public thoroughfare, with an informative poster without data related to the owner of the file of
recording or who to contact to exercise the rights established in the regulations
of data protection.

As proof of these manifestations, the evidence indicated in the

article 58.2 i)-, or the power to order the controller or processor
that the treatment operations comply with the provisions of the RGPD, when
appropriate, in a certain way and within a specified period -article 58. 2
d)-.


According to the provisions of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the measure provided for in article 58.2
d) of the aforementioned Regulation is compatible with the sanction consisting of a fine
administrative.

                                            v


In accordance with the evidence available and which has not been
distorted in the sanctioning procedure, the claimed party has installed two
video surveillance cameras that could be capturing images of third parties, and
In addition, the informative poster of the existence of said chamber is incomplete, so

It is considered that these facts violate the provisions of articles 5.1.c) and 13
of the RGPD, which supposes the commission of infractions typified in article 83.5 of the
GDPR, which provides the following:

       "Infringements of the following provisions shall be sanctioned, in accordance
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for
the largest amount:

       a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

       consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;
       b) the rights of the interested parties according to articles 12 to 22;
       […].”

For the purposes of the limitation period for infractions, the infractions indicated in

the previous paragraph are considered very serious and prescribe after three years, in accordance with
Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which establishes that:



C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/10








        "According to the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the

following:

        a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees
        established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
        b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
        conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the

        Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
        (…)
        h) The omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the treatment of their
        personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the
        Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and 12 of this Organic Law.

        (…)»

                                            SAW

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate
and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of article 83.1 of the RGPD. Therefore,

It is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the criteria established by the
article 83.2 of the RGPD, and with the provisions of article 76 of the LOPDGDD, regarding
to section k) of the aforementioned article 83.2 RGPD:
