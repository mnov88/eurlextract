<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The claimant, a member of the brotherhood, asserted that their consent had never been obtained for the processing of their data, nor had they been informed of the rights to which they were entitled.
</p><p>The claimant also pointed out that their e-mail address has been exposed in the communications made by the brotherhood to its members, by sending the e-mails without a blind copy.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA found out a violation of Articles 13, 32, and 5(1)(f) GDPR. 
</p><p>Article 13 sets out the Information to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject. From the evidence provided by the brotherhood, it has been established that, at the time of the claimant's registration, there was not adequate information on the reasons of collection and use of e-mail address data and the purpose of the processing.  
</p><p>Article 32 defines rules for ensuring the security of processing. This article has been violated in so far as a security incident occurred in their system allowing access to personal data, e-mail addresses, when forwarded without using the "blind copy" option, allowing other recipients to access personal data, e-mail addresses of the other recipients of the communication in breach of the established technical and security measures. This incident equally violated the general principle of “integrity and confidentiality” as set out in Article (5)(1)(f).
</p><p>For these reasons, the AEPD issued a reprimand to the religious brotherhood and ordered to correct the information provided vie email to new members.

                                    PROVEN FACTS


1) The claimant has been a member of the claimed party since they submitted their “Application for entry into
la Cofradía ”(discharge 07/05/2011) which included, among other information, his e-mail address. The literal
informative data collection indicated that the purpose of data processing is the

"Maintenance of the relationship as a person belonging to the Brotherhood, with the purposes
specific established in the Statutes "" these data may be used to send you information
training of your interest as well as on activities of the Brotherhood ”.

2) On 08/14/2020 the claimant's claim has entered the AEPD stating that it is

member of the Confraternity claimed, and received two emails without hidden copy, being able to see all
two recipients, everyone's addresses, including yours. The emails carried
cha of 03/18 and 09/29/2019. The defendant acknowledges shipments without a hidden copy. The literal in-
training associated with those two emails stated:

"Personal data including your e-mail are treated in accordance with the provisions of the

GDPR "

"The purpose of this treatment will be the management of normal business activity through
communication systems with all stakeholders. "


"We inform you that the data has been obtained by consent of the interested party by
derivation of a contractual obligation, by a legitimate assignment or from a source of
public access ”.

The emails sent did not contain the literal that makes it possible to stop receiving these emails.


3) It highlights a difference in information on the legitimizing base, when the
data, which indicates the associative relationship as the purpose of the data, and WHAT MAY BE
used to "send you information of your interest as well as activities of the Brotherhood"
and the information contained in the e-mails, with the citation in the body of the en-
email transmission from various legitimating bases.


4) The receipt of communications via e-mail from the complained party is not mandatory,
existing in emails dated after the dates of the reported shipments, the option of
"Cancel the subscription", there being no proven subscription properly by the
Guilds. When the claimant registers in the Brotherhood, the use

of the email to have information about the Brotherhood, nor is the option of not using it offered, or not
consent to such use.

5) After 09/29/2019, emails have been sent to the claimant, providing copies, which
They go from 03/13/2020 to 09/07/2020, without incidents.


6) As of 01/10/2020, the respondent hired a new email system in

                                                  I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each control authority

performance.



                                                 II


The respondent is charged with an infringement of article 13 of the RGPD, which determines the information
information that must be provided to the interested party at the time of data collection, sta-

stating the following:

        "1. When personal data relating to him are obtained from an interested party, the respondent
The data controller, at the time these are obtained, will provide you with all the information
indicated below:


        a) the identity and contact details of the person in charge and, where appropriate, their representative

        b) the contact details of the data protection officer, if applicable;

        that have been borrowed.

        2. In addition to the information mentioned in section 1, the data controller

ment will provide the interested party, at the time the personal data is obtained, the
following information necessary to guarantee fair and transparent data processing:

        a) the period during which the personal data will be kept or, when not possible,
        sible, the criteria used to determine this term;
        b) the existence of the right to request the data controller for access to the

        personal data relating to the interested party, and its rectification or deletion, or the limitation
        of its treatment, or to oppose the treatment, as well as the right to portability
        of the data;
        c) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter a), or article
        lo 9, section 2, letter a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent in any-

        at any time, without affecting the legality of the treatment based on the consent
        prior to withdrawal;
        d) the right to file a claim with a supervisory authority;
        e) if the communication of personal data is a legal or contractual requirement, or a re-
        I want necessary to sign a contract, and if the interested party is obliged to provide
        personal data and is informed of the possible consequences of not facilitating

        lite such data;
        f) the existence of automated decisions, including profiling, to which
        referred to in article 22, paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, significant information
        nificant on the applied logic, as well as the importance and consequences
        views of said treatment for the interested party.


        3. When the data controller plans the further processing of data
personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, will provide the interest
given, prior to said further processing, information on that other purpose and any
additional relevant information pursuant to section 2.


        4. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply when and on the
given that the interested party already has the information ”.

In general, the legitimizing basis for data processing would be related to the
scheme provided for in article 6.1b), the treatment is necessary for the execution of a
contract or agreement in which the interested party is a party or for the application at his request of
pre-contractual measures.


Now, in this case, what is involved is the use of e-mail and the setting in the
data collection, its use and purpose.
The denounced events initially materialize in the absence of information about

treatment.


The data collection that occurs when entering the Brotherhood must be distinguished, and contains
some data and information that were given, including the e-mail, indicating that

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/14








will use "for the maintenance of the relationship", adding that: "In addition, these data
may be used to send you information of interest, as well as about activities of
the Brotherhood ”, which is what is done by sending e-mails. This option of being in-

formed, which, it is deduced, as a voluntary one by containing the option to “cancel your subscription
tion ”, it is not related to the maintenance of the relationship, it is not completed with the option
at the time of data collection to opt out of receiving information of interest or of
activities of the Brotherhood.

Likewise, the information contained in the e-mails does not succeed in establishing the legal basis

scammer of these shipments, mixing diverse, different and contradictory motives.

By examining the information that is given in the registration of the members, it is reported in a
general that the purpose of data processing is the "maintenance of the relationship
as a person belonging to the Brotherhood, with the specific purposes established in the

Statutes"

The e-mails indicated:

The purpose of this treatment will be the management of normal business activity through
communication systems with all stakeholders. "


The purpose of the collection must be clearly and specifically identified: it must be
sufficiently detailed to determine what type of treatment is or is not included in
the specified objective, and to allow compliance with the law to be assessed and
data protection safeguards apply. Any purpose must be specified,

that is, define enough to be explicit. The objective must be sufficiently
unequivocal and clearly expressed.

The requirement that the purposes be specified 'explicitly' contributes to transparency and
predictability. It allows an unambiguous identification of the limits of the way in which the

Controllers may use the personal data collected, in order to protect the data
teresados.

Each goal of treatment must be separate and specific. Maintenance o
compliance with the associative relationship is one objective, the information would be another.


The information of the treatment and the legitimizing basis for the use and purpose of the treatment
of the e-mail offered is confusing in the wording:

"We inform you that the data has been obtained by consent of the interested party by
derivation of a contractual obligation, by a legitimate assignment or from a source of

public access "

In the discharge of the members, it is indicated that the data is for the maintenance of the
relationship, not requiring consent. Even less, consent can be made
derive from “a contractual obligation, by a legitimate assignment or from a source of

public access ”as reported in e-mails.

Originally, in the high as Cofrades, the option is not given to the affected, so that
the purpose of maintaining the contractual relationship is differentiated from that of being informed

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/14








do, being different. For the maintenance of the relationship it is not necessary to send the e
mails to associates, which is a voluntary addition, by offering the possibility of canceling
the subscription.


It is the responsibility of the respondent to prove compliance with the provisions of article 13 of the
GDPR. Therefore, it has been proven that, at the time of the claimant's discharge, no
produces adequate information in the collection and use of data from the e-mail address and
purpose of information to members. Circumstance that remains and is credited with the
sending the e-mails that are the subject of the claim, and which persists with the current configuration of

the e-mails, which have not changed.

The respondent should reevaluate the associative purposes of the activity of the respondent,
of which the intrinsic acceptance of the Statutes would be part, which is the basis
original legitimizer of the personal data of the members of the Brotherhood, and

distinguish it from your use of emails to members.

The complained party must take into account the processing of other data under another legitimizing basis.
that does not obey the relationship, in this case statutory between its members and the
claimed. To do this, you must take into account the elements that make up the consent
informed: “for one or more specific purposes”, and the freedom to grant or withdraw it without

suffer any damage, as well as the possibility of revoking it at any time with the
same effects.

In accordance with article 58.2 of the RGPD:


"2. Each supervisory authority shall have all the following corrective powers
indicated below: d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the
processing operations comply with the provisions of this Regulation, when
proceed, in a certain way and within a specified period; "


The respondent must prove the inclusion of pertinent and adequate information to the
treatment of data derived from email with informative use to its members, and inform
of the modality and form by which it would be carried out.

Article 83.5 b) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of "the rights of the interested parties
According to articles 12 to 22 "" is punishable, "with administrative fines of

€ 20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4%
as a maximum of the total annual global business volume of the previous financial year,
opting for the highest amount ”.

                                                III


Regarding the dissemination given to the e-mails that are the subject of a complaint, article 5 of the RGPD is-
establishes the principles that must govern the processing of personal data and mentions between-
among them that of "integrity and confidentiality".


        The aforementioned article points out that:

        "1. The personal data will be:


C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/14








        (…)

        (…)

Article 5, duty of confidentiality, of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5/12, on Protection
of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), signal-

which:

referred to in article 5.1.f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.


        2. The general obligation indicated in the previous section will be complementary to the
duties of professional secrecy in accordance with its applicable regulations.

        3. The obligations established in the previous sections will be maintained even
when the relationship of the obliged with the person in charge or in charge of the treatment has ended.

I lie".

The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the respondent,
violated article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, principle relating to treatment, in relation to article
the 5 of the LOPGDD, duty of confidentiality, when sending emails without using the

blind copy option.

This duty of confidentiality, or duty of secrecy, must be understood as having the purpose of
It is important to avoid data leaks not being consented to by the owners of the
themselves, in this case, the email addresses of the brothers.


Therefore, this duty of confidentiality is an obligation that falls not only on the respondent
member and in charge of the treatment, but to anyone who intervenes in any phase of the
treatment and complementary to the duty of professional secrecy.

The same complainant has indicated that the incident that gave rise to the complaint was motivated by

vada by incorrectly sending emails to members of the
Brotherhood, since the person who managed it involuntarily and accidentally must have
sent as "Bcc" (where each recipient cannot see the other recipients), in
instead of "To" (where each recipient can see the other recipients).


Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the basic principles for the
treatment, including the conditions for consent in accordance with articles 5, 6, 7 and
9 ”is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the aforementioned article 83 of the aforementioned
RGPD, “with administrative fines of a maximum of € 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company
dam, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual turnover

overall for the previous financial year, opting for the highest amount ”.

On the other hand, the LOPDGDD, for prescription purposes, in its article 72 indicates:
“Violations considered very serious:

        1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

        (…) "


                                                IV

Also the conduct of sending emails to third parties violates article 32
of the RGPD "Security of the treatment", which establishes:


        "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of application, and the nature of
lence, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as risks of probability and
variable severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the person responsible and
the person in charge of the treatment will apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to
guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, which, where appropriate, includes, among others:


        a) pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;
        b) the ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience
        permanent maintenance of treatment systems and services;
        c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data of

        d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the
        technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the treatment.

        2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular attention will be paid to
take into account the risks that the data processing presents, in particular as a consequence

of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of personal data transmitted,
stored or otherwise processed, or unauthorized communication or access to said
data.

        3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved in accordance with article 40 or to a
certification authority approved pursuant to article 42 may serve as an element to determine

        4. The person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to guarantee
that any person acting under the authority of the controller or processor and has
access to personal data can only process said data following instructions from the res-

responsible, unless required to do so under Union or State law
members".

The RGPD defines personal data security violations as “all those
security breaches resulting in accidental destruction, loss or alteration or

illicit personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the communication
unauthorized access or access to said data ”.

From the documentation provided to the file, evidence that the respondent has violated the ar-
