<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A Spanish website has published personal photos and other personal data on its website without the consent of the data subject and without providing the data subject with a privacy policy containing the information required by article 13 GDPR.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Is it publishing personal data without the consent of the data subject unlawful? Is it the lack of a privacy policy providing the data subject with the information required under GDPR unlawful?

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The national law LOPDGDD considers the violation of articles 6 and 13 GDPR as "very serious" and therefore the Spanish DPA decided on imposing a fine of € 5 000 for the violation of Article 6 GDPR and € 4 000 for the violation of article 13, under the power conferred by Article 83(5) GDPR.

       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
