<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On the 6th november, the complainant exercised her right of access against Xfera Moviles (the defendant). She did not get any response from the defendant. 
</p><p>The complainant had asked the defendant for the recording of calls done between the 6th and 10th November 2019. She only received a response on the 14th November, where Xfera Moviles refused to grant her access to the recording of these calls. This refusal was made on the basis that recordings are for Xfera Moviles internal use only and would be given only as a result of a court order. 
</p><p>The defendant argued that the request was not in exercise of the complainant's right of access under the GDPR. Instead, the defendant argued that the complainant wanted access to the data as a result of a disagreement regarding Xfera Moviles billing and contract with the complainant.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Is a refusal to give the data subject recordings of her calls in breach of the data subject's right of access under Article 15?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA held that the complainant had exercised her right of access to the recordings in conformity with the GDPR. 
</p><p>The DPA held that a voice recording is "processing" of "personal data" within the meaning of Article 4(1) and 4(2) GDPR. Therefore, the data subject has the right to request access to these recordings. 
</p><p>The DPA did consider that such recordings could include personal data of third parties. Therefore, granting access to them might infringe the GDPR (processing without consent of the third party). However, it concluded that this was not an issue in this case as the complainant only requested access to recordings that she had herself made.
</p><p>The Spanish DPA established that it was not competent to investigate information concerning contracts and incidents linked to them. 
</p><p>The Spanish DPA therefore upheld the complaint. It requested that Xfera Moviles respond to the access request within ten days.

effects, the communication by the person in charge to the affected party of the way in which this

and assessed those questions raised by the complaining party that remain
included within the object of the aforementioned complaints procedure regarding

access to the voice recordings of November 6 and 10, 2019 and,
after the period established in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, your request
obtained the legally required response, given that the required access was not provided.

previously transcribed, the voice is considered personal data. Therefore, in principle,
the complaining party would have the right to have those recordings provided, at the
protection of data protection regulations. However, such recordings
may contain, in addition to their data, information related to third parties who
could not be communicated to you, since, otherwise, it could constitute an assignment of
data without consent.
In this sense, it must be considered that the voice is a peculiar and
individual of each person that makes it identifiable, therefore, it is a data of
personal character. Consequently, the right of access to the recording of your voice
requested by the complaining party if it is covered by current regulations in
data protection matter, facilitating the copy of the recording requested to the party
claimant or, failing that, transcription of its content.
Once the documentation in the procedure has been examined, it is observed

contractual conditions, at least in the documentation submitted to this
Agency, you only request the right of access to some recordings that they made.
The claim of the defendant that he could use the recordings in a
inadequate, it cannot be taken into account since, in application of the
presumption of innocence, in case of doubt regarding a specific fact and
decisive, this procedure could not be rejected taking into account that the
right has not been addressed.
It must be remembered that this Agency only has jurisdiction over data
personal, without being able to assess the information concerning possible contracts
subscribed or incidents on them. This regardless of what other
regulations protect the obtaining of said information, such as, among others, the Real
Legislative Decree 1/2007, which approves the General Law for the Defense of
Consumers and Users, Law 7/1993, on general conditions of
hiring.
The bodies that issue binding resolutions for this purpose include
the Consumer Arbitration Boards (provided that the creditor voluntarily submits to
to them), the Telecommunications User Service Office
(www.usuariosteleco.gob.es) or the judicial bodies. They are not binding, between
others, the decisions of consumer organizations or public offices
municipal consumption.

process.
