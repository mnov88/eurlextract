<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 26 October 2021, the data subject asked BBVA Bank (the controller) for an account holder attestation through the bank app. Instead, they received another customer's contract with their name, surname, ID number, home address, and IBAN number. 
</p><p>The data subject communicated the incident to the controller and manifested their concern for the protection of their own personal data. The bank representative apologised and stated that it was due to an “operational error” and that the data subject’s rights were protected. However, the data subject manifested that they still had access to the third-party's document through the chat. The controller's employee answered that technically it was not possible to delete or retrieve the submission of that document. Consequently, the data subject submitted a complaint before the Spanish DPA against the controller for having access to a third-party contract instead of the requested document. 
</p><p>The DPA started an investigation and notified the controller, who claimed that the chat tool was a secure channel for communications (a log-in mechanism), which allowed access to the chat history, ensuring transparency and traceability of operations. It also manifested that the bank clerk had made an isolated human error and that the controller requested the data subject to delete the document. The controller informed the data subject about the prohibition of its disclosure, reproduction, or distribution. Additionally, the controller eliminated access to the content via the link provided, therefore, additional downloads of the document were not possible.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>Firstly, the Spanish DPA analysed the reaction of the controller to the confidentiality data breach. It observed that the occurence of a data breach does not automatically suppose the imposition of a fine, but requires an analysis of the due diligence and security measures applied by the controller.  
</p><p>Secondly, the DPA highlighted the importance of complying with GDPR provisions regarding personal data integrity and confidentiality, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a>, and the security of processing, foreseen in <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR.</a> The DPA found a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a> and considered as an aggravating circumstance the level of responsibility of the controller regarding its technical and organisational measures applied, as required by <a href="/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR" title="Article 25 GDPR">Articles 25</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">32 GDPR</a>. In this case, the controller had to implement adequate measures to avoid the exposition of personal data to non-authorised third parties. In addition, the security breach was not corrected until February 2022 (lasting for 4 months), which showed that appropriate measures were lacking. The DPA also found a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>. At the time of the data breach, the controller did not have appropriate technical and organisational measures to avoid the incident of disclosing personal data through the link, which was supposed to contain the data subject documentation.
