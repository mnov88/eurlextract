<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 15 February 2019, Mrs A.A.A.&#160; (hereinafter, the complainant) exercised her right to erasure against CGT Sector Federal de Telemarketing (hereinafter, the respondent), but had not received a response to her request. In particular, the request included  that complainant's personal data (such as name, surname and telephone number) should not appear in a bulletin posted on the CGT Telemarketing website when a search is made. The complainant provided a list of the URLs concerned.   
</p><p>In response to the request "to be forgotten", the respondent instructed the complainant to address Google in order to remove the links or the text. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>The respondent stated that the complainant had voluntarily joined the CGT as a member of the Works Council. The complainant's data appeared on the Council's website because she belonged to the Council and to the Workers' Committees and because of her participation in the bulletins and along with thousands of workers, which means that the contact details are published in case any worker needs help or to locate their representatives.  
</p><p>The respondent claimed that the telemarketing sector is not done by the CGT's itself, but by an entity that is part of it and the has control only over the web and content of www.cgt-telemarketing. CGT is an Association of Trade Unions and sectors, each of which has its own legal personality and therefore its own C.I.F. and has not maintained any relationship with the claimant. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>Results of the investigations conducted by the AEPD revealed that when a search is made by the name of the complainant the result is "No results found" for each of the urls in question.   
</p><p>The AEPD decided to dismiss the complaint, regardless of the fact that the search engine refused to cancel the URLs, but given that the claimant's name is not linked to the search results in the URLs claimed and that the controller stated that the complainant's data has been deleted, the claims of the complainant have been satisfied, therefore the claim is dismissed as non-existing.
