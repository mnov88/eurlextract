<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A political party used Google docs to store data of sympathisers and addressees of mailings in Excel files. The files were leaked and made publicly available, the link of the files also being published in an article on a political portal. Given that a large number of data subjects and special categories of data were concerned, the DPA (NAIH) conducted an inspection and found that the security of the processing was not sufficiently ensured by the controller. The controller also did not respond to the demand of the authority to indicate the measures taken to secure the data and to notify the data subjects.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>1)
A) The Controller has not respected Article&#160;32, paragraph (1), point (a) and(b)
and paragraph (2) of that article of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the protection of natural persons in respect of processing of personal data and the) free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter: General Data Protection Regulation) in not applying data security proportionate to the risks of storing data of party sympathisers and activists. 
B) The Controller has infringed Article 5(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, as despite repeated requests from the Authority, it has not fully demonstrated how it has taken measures to reduce the risks of the personal data breach. 
2) Instructs the Controller to demonstrate to the Authority in accordance with Article 5(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), when and in what form and with what content it informed the data subjects of the personal data breach, in accordance with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_34_GDPR" title="Article 34 GDPR">Article 34 GDPR</a>. 
B) inform the Authority of how it adapted the data processing affected by the incident to apply data security
measures proportionate to the risk.
3) Due to the above infringement, the Client shall be obliged within 30 days from the date of the finalisation of the present decision to pay a fine of 3&#160;000&#160;000&#160;HUF, i.e. three million forints
4) Orders the final decision to be published including the Customer’s identification data .
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>Google being a US company played no role in the decision. 
The DPA found, however, that Google docs is not secure enough for special categories of personal data.
The party is in fact a non-conventional player in the political landscape, making more jokes than having a serious programme.

III. Decision


    1. Findings related to the security of data management

Pursuant to Article 32 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data controller is science
and the state of technology and implementation costs, as well as the nature and scope of data management,
its circumstances and purposes, as well as the rights and freedoms of natural persons,
appropriate technical and

implements organizational measures to ensure that the level of risk is appropriate
guarantees level data security. The regulation includes, among other things, Article 32 (1) b)
point, the systems and services used to manage personal data are continuous
ensuring its confidentiality.

According to Article 32 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, security is adequate
when determining the level of
risks, which are especially transmitted personal data to unauthorized public

they result from making or unauthorized access to them.

According to the Authority's opinion, the data processing affected by the incident, i.e. the members of the political party,
personal data of sympathizers and activists (e.g. identification data, contact details, with party
related activities) is considered high risk. This is because it is common
Recital (75) of the Data Protection Regulation refers to data management during which political
data that can be associated with an opinion is treated as fundamentally risky. With this

in this context, it also considers it risky if data management results in discrimination
may arise, and also if the data management covers a large number of stakeholders. Finally, such data
management, of which identity theft or identity abuse (such
in this case, the identification data in the tables, such as: name, address, telephone number, e-mail
address, identity card number, Facebook profile link) may also be risky
considered by these provisions of the decree.




                                                                                               9 According to the Authority's opinion, a total of six items in the published table
the handling of the data of data subjects is considered high risk according to the General Data Protection Regulation
based on the above regulations. Individually, very easily, based on the range of data in the table
various tasks that sympathize with the party during its operation can become identifiable

the handling of the contact information of the parties involved together with the names and party affiliation
because of Violation of the confidentiality of data involves high risks for those concerned
regarding his private sphere, since he belongs to a political organization - even if it may be from the past
- definitely reflects the political opinion of the given person.

Data relating to political opinion is Article 9 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation

belong to a special category of personal data. The highlighting of these data is a
under the general concept of personal data, it is justified by the fact that such information is the data subject
they relate to more sensitive aspects of his life, therefore their disclosure is unauthorized
knowledge of it can be particularly harmful for the person concerned. This data is illegal
its treatment can negatively affect the individual's reputation, private and family life, it is disadvantageous
may be a cause or reason for discrimination against the person concerned.


Finally, the risks of data management are also increased by the fact that a large number of data subjects, more than 2,000, are personal
data were processed together in the tables.

The responsibility of the data controller, i.e. in this case the Customer, is to comply with Article 32 (1)-(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
based on paragraphs that based on the nature, circumstances, purposes and risks of data processing, a
according to the state of science and technology, implement appropriate level of data security measures

finally. Among other things, these data security measures must guarantee that a
managed personal data should preferably not be made public without authorization, or should not be related to them
can be accessed without authorization.

Based on the judgment of the Authority, identification data and political opinion that can be linked to the data subjects
management of reflective data within the framework of Google Sheets, a free online service

in the form in which it was realized in the present case, it does not meet the high risk
the level of data security commensurate with the risks presented by data management.

Google Sheets is a free, web-based spreadsheet program offered by Google
It is part of the Google Docs Editors package. The application allows users to
create and edit files online while collaborating with others in real time
with users. Modifications can be tracked by the user using the modification display

with version history. The position of the editor has an editor-specific color and cursor
highlighted, and an authorization system controls what users can do. THE
documents can be shared, opened and edited by several users at the same time. THE
changes are automatically saved to Google's servers and the system

                                                                                              10Managing the large number of special personal data contained in the tables is in itself very difficult
it entails serious risks for the privacy of those concerned. The Customer is the high risk
in connection with data management, access to the tables was granted to the party's leading officials and
for its activists with the help of a link, since according to the party's internal principles, the activists can also directly
they can keep in touch with each other. In this way, even thousands of stakeholders could access the tables

online at once with a simple link, without any other restrictions. Because Google
Users can simply export and save files from the Sheets online service
to your local computer, therefore such a large number of access any other authorization control (e.g
password access to the table) in the case of provision without, it is very likely that
the occurrence that even unauthorized persons have access to the data, or that
a person entitled to it in advance sends it to others as well, or brings them himself
public. Nor to apply encryption to preserve the confidentiality of files

took place.

Without the application of additional appropriate control measures, it cannot be done by science and
from the point of view of the state of technology, it is sufficient to guarantee that it is very loose
personal data handled under access measures should not be exposed sooner or later
public. The present is an example of the consequences of the lack of stronger security measures
also a data protection incident in the case.


Only in connection with the analysis of the file access log, the Customer could not establish that
whether they were accessed by an unauthorized external attacker, or if the files were made public
is it the result of an internal leak.

In the opinion of the Authority, if the Client stores the files in some internal, appropriate way
with encryption and traceable access control (e.g. with password protection

authorization management and internal logging) would have been handled in a system (e.g. dedicated server), so
the data protection incident that is the subject of the report was also much less likely to follow
and the circumstances of its occurrence would have been easier to reconstruct.

Based on the above, the Authority determines that the Client is appropriate and proportionate to the risks
by data processing in the absence of data security measures, violated the general
Article 32, paragraph (1) and points a)-b) of the data protection regulation, as well as (2) of this article
paragraph.


    2. Measures taken in connection with the handling of the data protection incident that occurred

Based on Article 4, point 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation, a data protection incident is considered a
breach of security, which is the unauthorized disclosure of the processed personal data or related to them
results in unauthorized access. From the point of view of the concept, it is the same as the security event
relationship can be considered a key element. An event involving personal data is only that

cases are considered data protection incidents if it can be caused by some kind of security breach
connected, this is the root cause and there is a causal relationship between the two. The safety
damage may result from the security measures used to protect personal data
incomplete, inadequate, possibly out of date, or due to their complete absence.

In the given case, the security breach was caused by the Customer not using the appropriate equipment
technical and organizational measures regarding the data of party sympathizers



                                                                                              11 in order to preserve its confidentiality (see the provisions of point III/1 of the decision). Appropriate
in the absence of security measures, therefore also the personal data of supporters and members
containing tables, were removed from the
from its management and made public by unknown persons on the Internet.


According to Article 33 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, a data protection incident is defined as
controller without undue delay and, if possible, no later than 72 hours after it is
becomes aware of a data protection incident, must report it to the supervisory authority. The incident
reporting can only be omitted if the incident probably does not involve risk a
regarding the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Assessing the risks associated with the incident
it is the responsibility of the data controller.


Sensitive and accurate data that is classified as special personal data involved in the incident
occurring during inclusive data management due to damage to security measures
a data protection incident is considered high risk. This is because of political activity
after the disclosure of the relevant data, the data controller's influence on their fate is complete
out of your control. Further confidentiality of the data management is not possible in full
guarantee in the future.


The client bears the risks related to their further fate due to the avoidance of data management
cannot take completely eliminating measures, the data – where appropriate illegal –
can no longer fully reduce the risks associated with its further treatment. The file sharing site
(in this case: https://ufile.io)'s subsequent request to delete the data reduces the
risks that the Customer took during incident management.

The Authority is also a factor that further increases the risks posed by the data protection incident

considers that access protection for the tables containing the special data of the data subjects (e.g.
could be accessed without a password), with just a link. Adequate data security
the application of measures would have reduced the risk of special data
third parties should not get to know me without authorization and they should not be made public.

The publication of the special data in comparison with the circumstances of the incident is the Authority
in his opinion, resulted in a high-risk data protection incident.


Based on the above, the Authority considers the data protection incident to be high risk
can be considered, therefore, if the data controller becomes aware of such a case, it must be reported
report to the supervisory authority based on Article 33 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
authority.

In view of the above, the Authority concludes that the data controller has complied with the general requirements
incident notification based on Article 33 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation

obligation, so no violation of law was established in this regard.

    3. Findings related to the principle of accountability

Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation defines "accountability
principle", according to which the data controller is responsible, contained in Article 5 (1) of the regulation
for compliance with its principles and must be able to demonstrate this compliance.



                                                                                               12 The Authority initiated an official inspection and then an official procedure in connection with the incident report
tried several times to inform the Customer about exactly what it was like
took measures to manage the incident and reduce the risks for those involved
however, despite the Customer's knowledge, he did not receive any answers regarding these.


Therefore, the customer did not prove to the Authority, despite repeated requests to provide data,
what exactly measures were taken in relation to the handling of the data protection incident
in order for the data management carried out by it to comply with the regulation from the point of view of the case
relevant regulations. Among other things, the Authority expected confirmation from the Client that it is
how did you transform the data management involved in the incident, so that in the future with the risks
apply proportionate data security measures to avoid a similar incident in the future

order (Article 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation), and that the persons concerned are subject to the high
in relation to a data protection incident with risk, how and with what content you were informed (general
Article 34 of the Data Protection Regulation).

Due to the lack of confirmation by the Client, the Authority cannot therefore establish that
Will the customer's data security measures in the future correspond to a level commensurate with the risks,
furthermore, what measures he took in connection with informing those concerned about the incident

Customer.

Due to the reluctance of the data controller, which can be blamed on him, the Authority also does not know the merits
to control the circumstances related to the handling of personal data, and this is also
leads to a serious reduction in the level of protection provided by the general data protection regulation, which
ultimately, it puts those concerned in a vulnerable position.


Since the Client did not prove to the Authority that the regulation is relevant despite repeated requests
measures taken to comply with its regulations, and therefore violated the general
Article 5 (2) of the Data Protection Regulation.

    4. The applied sanction and its justification

During the clarification of the facts, the Authority established that the Customer violated the general
data protection regulation

    - Article 32, paragraph (1) and its points a)-b) and paragraph (2),
    - Paragraph 2 of Article 5.

The Authority examined whether the imposition of a data protection fine against the Customer is justified. E
in the scope of the Authority, Article 83 (2) of the GDPR and Infotv. 75/A. it was considered based on §
all the circumstances of the case.


In view of this, the Authority informs Infotv. Based on point a) of § 61, subsection (1), in the relevant part
decided in accordance with the provisions, and in this decision, the Client to pay a data protection fine
obliged.


When imposing the fine, the Authority took into account the following factors:




                                                                                              13 When establishing the necessity of imposing a fine, the Authority considered the violations
aggravating, mitigating and other circumstances as follows:

Aggravating circumstances:


    - Data security deficiencies affected the personal data of a large number of stakeholders. [general
       Article 83 (2) point a) of the Data Protection Regulation]

    - The data security gaps arose in connection with data management where special,
       political opinion data were handled together with contact data. On this
       illegal handling of data can negatively affect an individual's reputation, private and
       family life, may be a cause or reason for discrimination against the person concerned,

       moreover, it may also lead to misuse of personal identity. [general data protection
       Article 83 (2) point (g) of the Decree]

    - The Authority regards the established data security deficiencies as a systemic problem
       considers the incident to be not a one-time security deficiency or injury, but
       can be traced back to the illegal handling of entire databases. [general data protection
       Regulation Article 83(2)(a) and (d)]


    - The Client did not cooperate with the Authority during the investigation of the case. THE
       multiple requests for data provision verified by the Customer and procedural fines
       despite this, he did not respond to the Authority's orders clarifying the facts. The Authority did not know that
       fully verify that the risks reported to the stakeholders are appropriate
       has it been reduced? [general data protection regulation Article 83 (2) point f)]


    - When determining the amount of the fine, the Authority took into account that the Customer
       violation committed by, thus Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
       violation is the higher maximum amount according to Article 83 (5) of the regulation
       is considered a violation of the fine category.

Extenuating circumstances:

    - During the procedure, the Authority did not come to the attention of any information that would indicate

       that the affected parties would have suffered any specific disadvantage or damage as a result of the infringement.
       [General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point a)]

    - The Authority took into account that the Client had not previously established the
       violation of the law related to the management of personal data. [83 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
       Article (2) point (e)]


Other circumstances taken into account:

    - The Authority on the violation of the Client according to Article 33 of the General Data Protection Regulation
       found out based on his incident report. The Authority condemns this behavior - since a
       did not go beyond complying with legal obligations - specifically as a mitigating circumstance
       did not appreciate it. [general data protection regulation Article 83 (2) point h)].




                                                                                                 14 - Based on the circumstances of the case and the Customer's statement, the Customer decided the risks
       a technological solution guaranteeing data security that is inadequate from the point of view of
       in addition to its application. However, the Authority could not verify it with the Client later
       not because of its operation, but because of the reasons for choosing the technology
       row, and whether the Customer has performed a preliminary risk analysis in this regard. The

       the intentional or thoughtless nature of the data security breach is therefore expressed by the Authority
       he could not evaluate it as an aggravating or mitigating circumstance. Not together with the Customer
       on the other hand, he evaluated its operation under the aggravating circumstances. [general data protection
       Regulation Article 83 (2) point b]

The Authority is responsible for general data protection when making a decision on the legal consequences
did not consider points c), i), j) and k) of Article 83 (2) of the Decree to be relevant.


The Authority is Infotv. Based on points a), b) and c) of Section 61 (2), the Customer is responsible for the decision
ordered the publication of his identification data, as it is
affects a wide range of persons, that is, through the activities of the Authority's public service organization
brought in connection, and also because of the involvement of special data, the public is the infringement
is also justified by its material weight.
