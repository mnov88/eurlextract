<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The complainant is the father of the data subject acting as their legal representative. The complainant submitted an access request to the controller, the provider of a health center, requesting copy of the complete medical records relating to his minor daughter. The controller refused to satisfy his request because he had restrictions on contact with his daughter due to a criminal offense. 
</p><p>The complainant lodged a complaint with the DPA against the controller's decision to refuse the access. He claimed that the controller failed to justify how it would affect the child if he were to be informed of the content of the medical records. He also pointed out that his parental rights have not been terminated yet, but there was a pending trial on this matter before the court. Therefore, he concludes that the controller violated the principle of proportionality.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA decided to party refuse the complaint. 
</p><p>First, it noted that under Article 20 Personal Data Protection Act (ZVOP-2) the controller may refuse a request from the legal representative of the data subject for access to the data subject’s personal data contained in medical records, if there are specific and objective circumstances that would affect the interests or rights of minors.
</p><p>Second, the DPA took into consideration that other official proceedings against the father in relation to domestic violence were pending. Further, it assessed the medical record of the daughter in relation to the alleged abuse or domestic violence. It concluded that some medical data had an indirect substantive link with the alleged abuse and the rest did not contain any information that is in any way related to the alleged abuse or violence. 
</p><p>Third, it held that an alleged offense of a legal guardian or an order for limited contact does not automatically exclude them from accessing their child’s entire medical file. 
</p><p>Lastly, the DPA held that the controller incorrectly applied the exception of Article 20 of ZVOP-2 to all medical records without a specific assessment. The complainant could have access to the medical records relating to regular or routine medical treatment for medical conditions which are not in any way related to the alleged crime.

R e a s s i o n s:
The proceedings at first instance lasted a long time, and the correspondence that arose in this process is extensive. The IP is therefore limited to the key relevant part of the procedural actions of the applicant and the controller.
The applicant, in his capacity as a legal representative (as a parent), on … submitted a request to the provider to obtain a copy of the entire medical documentation relating to his minor daughter … born .., namely for the period from … to ….
2
Following the interim incomplete decisions of the provider, on … issued a final decision in which he rejected the request in its entirety. He explained that Article 20 of the ZVOP-2 requires the controller to refuse access to the minor’s personal data to the legal representative if certain legal conditions are met. The provider was of the opinion that these conditions were met because the applicant has restrictions on contact with the child due to a criminal offence,
which he was informed about by the CSD ….
The IP received the applicant’s complaint dated … on … (supplemented on … following the IP’s request). In it, he stated in particular that the provider's decision should contain concrete and objective circumstances or reasons for the refusal. The provider only stated in general and inadequate terms that he had restrictions on contacts, without elaborating on which criminal offence it was and how this would affect the child if the applicant were to become familiar with the contents of the medical documentation. Furthermore, it is not logical to reject the request in its entirety. He also explained that his parental care was not restricted in any way. Non-contentious proceedings are pending in court on the care, upbringing, maintenance and contacts of a minor child (appeal No. II …). In these proceedings, a temporary order was issued to restrict contacts, the basis for which was the suspicion of committing a criminal offence … against a person under the age of fifteen. The District State Prosecutor's Office in … dismissed the criminal complaint on …, of which the court and the CSD were informed. The rejection occurred a long time before the provider's rejection decision was made. The applicant further stated that the provider did not apply the principle of proportionality in the decision. Only if the child had been subjected to physical or mental violence, abuse, neglect, maltreatment and exploitation would it be justified to protect certain information about the child, for example, information about the victim, location of residence, planned measures for the protection of the child. Informing the parent and the occurrence of serious health damage to the child must be in a direct causal relationship in the sense that the child's health condition could deteriorate due to the information received. The provider did not carry out this weighing, although it should have done so, as already decided by the IP in a similar case No. 0712-220/2009/2 of 7 May 2009. In the first-instance proceedings, the applicant also submitted the mother's written consent (undated) to familiarize himself with the medical documentation. On …, the IP called on the provider for additional explanations regarding the treatment of the patient and the disputed circumstances regarding the applicant. The provider responded to the call on .
On …, the IP called on the patient's mother for explanations regarding the disputed circumstances and family relationships.
The patient's mother responded to the call on ….
On …, the IP called on the CSD … for explanations regarding the current family relationships and the status of the proceedings and the disputed circumstances. The CSD responded to the call on ….
The appeal is partially justified.
1. Subject and limits of decision-making in the appeal proceedings
Based on the available documentary material, it follows that in these appeal proceedings, only the existence of facts or circumstances due to which the right of the applicant, as the legal representative of a minor patient, should be limited as provided for in Article 20 of the ZVOP-2. Other substantive legal conditions for access in the specific case are not disputed, so the IP did not specifically assess them, but only made sure ex officio that there were no other obstacles to access. Article 20 of the ZVOP-2 regulates the exception regarding the enforcement of an individual's request through a legal representative. The aforementioned article stipulates that the controller may exceptionally refuse an individual's request from Articles 15 to 22 of the General Regulation or access to personal data from the individual's health records submitted through a legal representative if there are concrete and objective circumstances that would justify the conclusion that the benefits, rights or legitimate interests of minors or persons placed under guardianship or other persons for whom the law so provides would be directly or indirectly affected by the disclosure of certain personal data, and if these rights and interests outweigh the interests of the legal representative for access. In this case, the reasons for refusal are available to the supervisory authority, the Human Rights Ombudsman, the conflict of interest trustee, when it concerns personal data from medical records, and to the patient's rights representative under the law governing patient rights. Since the content and purpose of the request is under Article 41 of the ZPacP (right to access one's own medical records), the IP assessed the complaint under this legal basis. The first paragraph of Article 41 of the ZPacP stipulates that a patient has the right to unhindered inspection and copying of medical records relating to him in the presence of a doctor or other healthcare professional or healthcare associate; photocopying or other reproduction of medical records must be ensured by the healthcare provider; the healthcare provider is obliged to ensure authentic reproduction of image records that are not stored in electronic form, if they have the technical means to do so. The IP establishes that the subject of the decision in this appeal procedure is the medical documentation or
"child's medical record" … (born …), which is kept in the provider's pediatric clinic. Based on the
received copy of the medical record, the IP has identified exclusively the following documents or medical
records for the period from … to … (hereinafter the relevant medical documentation):
 Medical examination report dated … (one page);
 Record in the medical record dated … (record on both sides of the sheet);
 Record in the medical record dated … (record on both sides of the sheet);
 Record in the medical record dated … (record on both sides of the sheet);
 Record in the medical record dated … (record on both sides of the sheet);
 Record in the medical record dated …. (record on both sides of the sheet);
 Record in the medical record dated … (record on both sides of the sheet).
The IP did not include the patient in the procedure, as otherwise provided for in the eighth paragraph in conjunction with the ninth paragraph of Article 35 of the ZPacP, because he assessed that questioning a minor child would be too burdensome for him, given the circumstances of the specific case and the young age of the child. The IP assessed the fulfillment of the conditions under Article 20 independently, as he established that in the specific case the assessment does not require the professional knowledge of an expert in the field of pediatrics, psychology or psychiatry. 2. Assessment of the entitlement to information in the specific case The IP first explains that this decision may not state all the specific information provided about the patient by other persons - the professional head of the ZD ....., the CSD ... and the child's mother, nor may the decision disclose the specific content of the requested medical documentation. The IP conducted the assessment on the basis of the specific content of the records in the relevant medical documentation and the established factual situation in relation to the alleged abuse or violence in the family. In doing so, he was convinced of the following:
1. In the medical examination report dated … (one page), the second and third sentences of the first paragraph (between the headings “Diagnosis” and “Status”) and the last part of the second indent under the heading “Opinion and therapy” from the word “care” to the end of the sentence have an indirect substantive connection with the alleged abuse. In the remaining part, the report is not disputed in terms of any substantive connection with the alleged abuse or violence;
2. The entry dated … in the medical record (record on both sides of the sheet) has an indirect substantive connection with the alleged abuse in columns 4, 5 and 6. In the remaining part, the entry is not disputed in terms of any substantive connection with the alleged abuse or violence;
4
3. The entry dated … in the medical record (record on both sides of the sheet) does not contain any information that would be in any way related to the alleged abuse or violence;
4. The record dated … in the medical record (record on both sides of the sheet) does not contain any information that would
be in any way related to the alleged abuse or violence;
5. The record dated … in the medical record (record on both sides of the sheet) does not contain any information that would
be in any way related to the alleged abuse or violence;
6. The record dated … in the medical record (record on both sides of the sheet) does not contain any information that would
be in any way related to the alleged abuse or violence;
7. The record dated … in the medical record (record on both sides of the sheet) does not contain any information that would
be in any way related to the alleged abuse or violence.
In accordance with the above findings, the applicant's appeal had to be rejected (point 2 of the operative part of this decision) with regard to the
second and third sentences of the first paragraph (between the headings "Diagnosis" and "Status") and the last part of the
second indent under the heading "Opinion and therapy" from the word "care" to the end of the sentence in the medical examination report dated .. (one page) and with regard to columns 4, 5 and 6 of the entry dated ... in the list of diseases, and the appeal had to be granted in the remaining part (point 1 of the operative part of this decision), for the reasons set out below.
A. Reasons for partial granting:
I. The exception from Article 20 of the ZVOP-2 does not mean that parents are not automatically entitled to the contents of the child's medical documentation in any case of treatment of parents for alleged criminal acts against the family, sexual integrity or life and body. Limited contact with the child is not an absolute reason for refusing a request for access. Both circumstances only indicate that it is possible that there are reasons why access could be detrimental to the child, but the final answer in each individual case depends on the specific content of the documentation and the specific facts regarding the relationship between the parents and the child (e.g. possible refusal, possible fear, frequency of contact and the manner of contact, mutual attachment, etc.), the health and other conditions of the child (e.g. age, maturity, the child's previous experiences and consequences for him, etc.) and the actions of the parent who filed the request (e.g. public exposure of the child, past actions detrimental to the child, threats and predictions, official treatment or prosecution for various forms of violence). Therefore, the provider's conduct is improper, as it applied the exception from Article 20 of the ZVOP-2 to all health records without a specific assessment and in a lump sum.
II. The exception from Article 20 of the ZVOP-2 is not intended to protect health workers, but only to protect the child.
If the information could have a direct or indirect negative impact on the health worker (e.g., due to the filing of a legal remedy against him), this cannot be a reason for rejecting the request with reference to Article 20 of the ZVOP-2.
III. The exception from Article 20 of the ZVOP-2 also does not serve the function of punishing parents, since this is exclusively intended for criminal legislation.
IV. The applicant already knows the information about the official hearing due to the alleged .., since he was involved in the official procedure as the alleged perpetrator. He also knows which health worker at the provider filed a report against him, when, to whom and why.
V. The District Public Prosecutor's Office in … dismissed the criminal complaint against the applicant
in connection with the criminal offence of ….
5
VI. The second official procedure against the applicant in connection with domestic violence has not yet been concluded, which is why
the information on former domestic violence cannot be assessed or cannot be included in the assessment
of the conditions referred to in Article 20 of the ZVOP-2.
VII. The applicant has certain unsupervised contacts with the child once a week by a temporary order. This
fact clearly indicates that the contact regime has been expanded compared to the old regime and that a certain improved relationship between the applicant and the child is being maintained.
VIII. The applicant's parental care has not been taken away or restricted.
IX. The approved parts of the medical documentation are completely
neutral from the perspective of assessing the conditions referred to in Article 20 of the ZVOP-2. These are records in medical records that concern regular or usual medical treatment for medical conditions that are in no way related to the alleged ... (e.g. dermatological problems, injuries, vaccinations, advice on school enrolment), which objectively do not allow a reasonable conclusion that the benefits, rights and legitimate interests of the child could be directly or indirectly affected by their disclosure. Furthermore, it is undoubtedly evident with regard to these records that the parental rights and interests in relation to the care of the child's health and in relation to participation in medical treatment outweigh the purely hypothetical and unprovable adverse effects that disclosure would have on the child (e.g. parental prohibition on carrying out a certain activity due to a past injury or parental decision to enrol the child in the first grade of school despite the child's opposition). For example, the records in question do not contain statements by the child about the applicant, statements by the mother about the applicant, planned measures or activities of the provider, the mother, the police, the public prosecutor's office or the court against the applicant, subtle intimate confessions regarding the child's condition and past events, and the like. X. The child's mother trusts the provider's decision, but does not state specific facts and circumstances that, with regard to the entire medical documentation, could be the reason for indirect or direct harm to the child if the applicant were to become acquainted with it. The provider also failed to substantiate in the first and second instance proceedings that the exception should extend to the entire medical documentation. B. Reasons for partial refusal:
I. The CSD report shows that the family has been considered since … within the framework of the task “opinion to the court for the protection of the interests of the child in legal proceedings” (divorce proceedings) and within the framework of other tasks (“measure for the protection of the interests of the child – assistance to the victim” and “social welfare services – personal assistance”). In the aforementioned year, the child’s mother filed a petition with the court for divorce and regulation of the interests of the child and filed a report for domestic violence and withdrew to safety.
II. The child’s residential parent is the mother and was recognized by the expert in the legal proceedings as the appropriate parent for the upbringing and protection of the child. The father only carries out the contacts referred to in VII. point above.
III. The mother believes that the provider’s decision is appropriate and trusts it. The mother convincingly claims that she herself had already informed the applicant of key information about the child's health, i.e., information that is important for the applicant from the perspective of cooperation in medical treatment and general care for the child. In addition, the applicant was informed of the child's emotional distress in the context of non-litigious legal proceedings under case no. II ….
IV. According to the mother's statement, the pediatrician had already assessed in the past that certain information (i.e. not all – note IP) could be sensitive and should be treated with particular caution.
6
V. Regarding the rejected part of the records, it is very subtle information about the child, which has at least an indirect connection …..
VI. It is important to protect the child from the risk of deterioration of the child's mental health, since it is confirmed that the child had emotional and behavioral problems and was treated in this regard. Disclosing specific details to an applicant with whom he or she has a complicated relationship could negatively affect the child's sense of security, self-confidence and ability to express his or her own emotions, and ultimately his or her willingness to cooperate in health care. Disclosure could pose a risk of the child's psychological condition deteriorating further, which would further jeopardise his or her personal development. Any unnecessary additional emotional burden on the child in a specific case constitutes a negative consequence or harm. VII. It is also important to protect the child from undue influence, pressure and manipulation, which undoubtedly constitute harm to the child in themselves, regardless of the final consequences of such conduct. Such conduct must therefore be prevented or at least limited. Restrictive measures also include concealing information that could encourage or serve to carry out such conduct. Since in this specific case, abuse and domestic violence are disputed, any information in this regard must be considered sensitive in terms of its useful value for exercising undue influence, pressure and manipulation, and therefore inaccessible to the applicant. In …, the competent CSD found that at that time it had detected strategies of competition, defiance, blackmail and threats by the father towards the child and mother, the child becoming and being a tool in the partnership relationship. The family relationships between the applicant, mother and child have not yet been finally regulated or stabilised, either formally or otherwise, and as long as this is the case, the disputed information must not be a tool for their abuse. VIII. The content that the patient or his legal representative provides to the doctor is confidential and must be protected as a professional secret. This also applies to content that the doctor finds out or creates himself. The treatment is based on the patient's trust, which must not be broken, as this would endanger the therapeutic process due to the child's opposition or non-cooperation. The fragile relationship of mutual trust and respect would undoubtedly be broken if the most subtle information that has some connection with the alleged abuse or violence were to be disclosed. There is a serious danger that approving the applicant's entire request would indirectly lead to the inability to provide the child with effective, appropriate, high-quality and continuous health care, which would undoubtedly be contrary to the child's interests. IX. In the specific case, disclosing the subtle contents that the child has confided in or that have been established would further worsen his psychological condition and put him in distress. 3. In conclusion, the IP partially granted the applicant's appeal (point 1 of the operative part) on the basis of the first paragraph of Article 252 of the ZUP, which stipulates that if the second-instance authority finds that the evidence was erroneously assessed in the first-instance decision, that an incorrect conclusion was drawn from the established facts regarding the factual situation, or that a legal regulation was incorrectly applied, it shall annul the first-instance decision with its own decision and resolve the matter itself. The IP partially rejected the applicant's appeal (point 2 of the operative part) on the basis of the first paragraph of Article 248 of the ZUP, which stipulates that the second-instance authority shall reject the appeal if it finds that the procedure prior to the decision was correct, that the decision is correct and based on the law, and that the appeal is unfounded, and partly on the basis of the third paragraph of Article 248 of the ZUP, which stipulates that if the second-instance authority finds that the operative part of the first-instance decision is legal, but justified by incorrect reasons, it shall state the correct reasons in its decision and reject the appeal. No special costs were incurred in this appeal procedure (point 2 of the operative part). The provider and the applicant shall bear their own costs, if any. This decision is exempt from payment of an administrative fee in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Fees Act (ZUT). Legal remedy:
This decision is not subject to appeal, but an administrative action may be filed within 30 days of receipt of this decision at the Administrative Court in Ljubljana, Fajfarjeva 33, Ljubljana, in writing directly to the said court or by registered mail or orally on the record. If the action is sent by registered mail, it shall be deemed to have been received on time if it was posted on the last day of the deadline for filing an action. The action, with any attachments, shall be filed in at least three copies. The action must also be accompanied by this decision in the original or a copy and the court fee must be paid.
