<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject presented a complaint against the controller alleging that the video cameras installed on private property were also gathering images from a public space. Even though the Spanish DPA held that the public space filmed was not significant, the sign informing data subjects about the video cameras was  insufficient. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA held that there was a breach of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a> since the sign informing citizens about the video surveillance cameras did not present enough information. Even though there was a sign on the private property, it did not mention the identity of the controller nor provided information about how to exercise the data subjects' rights..
