<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The debtor (the controller) collected the phone number during a phone conversation without informing the data subject. Although the debt had been paid, the data subject kept receiving reminder text messages to pay the debt. The data subject therefore filed a complaint with the Hungarian DPA.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA fined the controller HUF 300 000 for illegal collection and use of personal data (the phone number). However, the DPA concluded that the controller did not violate <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15(2) GDPR</a> by asking for more information to identify the data subject when the data subject wanted to have their phone number erased.

According to the Applicant's statement, the subscriber of the telephone number […] is not the Applicant, but [..], but the Applicant is the user of this telephone number.

 

Pursuant to Article 2 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Regulation covers data management and data processing that concerns the data of a natural person.

 

CLXXIX of 2011 on the rights of nationalities. Pursuant to Section 2 (2) of the Act […], an organization with legal personality, ie a non-natural person, can be directly identified on the basis of the telephone number connected to its subscription contract .

 

However, given that the telephone number subscribed by the legal entity can be linked to the Applicant as a user as a representative, it can be contacted directly when making and receiving a call or, in this case, using the telephone number and clearly contacting the Applicant. , so his personal data can be considered under Article 4 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation .

The data controller's measures must promote the principle of accuracy and prevent the use of inaccurate data. 

 

In view of the above , the recording of the telephone number used by the Applicant as the telephone number of the Debtor's customer and the sending of SMS addressed to the Customer to the Applicant's telephone number was not lawful under Article 5 (1) (d) of the General Data Protection Regulation. when his data was recorded, his colleague knew that the telephone number he recorded was not his customer and the customer was not the source of the data.

Thus, compliance with the requirements set out in recital 32 and Article 7 of the General Data Protection Regulation has not been demonstrated for the period up to the deletion.

 

Based on the above, the Authority concluded that the Debtor did not prove that he had the consent of the Applicant to process his personal data , so that the consent recorded the telephone number in his system in the absence of a legal basis, in breach of Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

Given that the Debtor, in violation of the principle of accuracy, recorded the telephone number used by the Applicant with his client, he could not fulfill the Applicant's request for cancellation without providing additional information, as he could not identify him. After providing the additional information , the Debtor deleted the personal data from its records.

 

Due to the above, the Debtor did not violate Article 15 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, as he did not treat the telephone number data provided for contact purposes as personal data concerning the Applicant, however, the - III.2.

The Debtor complied with Article 11 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation and deleted the inaccurate data from its records.

 

III.5. The phone application to be ordered cancellation of em

 

In the part of the application requesting the deletion of the telephone number, the Authority Pursuant to Section 47 (1) (c), the proceedings shall be terminated as the proceedings have become devoid of purpose, and the Debtor shall no longer continue the processing of the objected data.
