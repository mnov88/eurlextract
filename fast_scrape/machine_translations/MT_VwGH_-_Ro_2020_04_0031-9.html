<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>In 2010, debt settlement proceedings were issued against the data subject. The data subject settled the payments of their debts in March 2018. After settling the debts, the civil court ordered to make the personal data of the data subject unavailable to the public in the public insolvency register.  
</p><p>The controller, a credit ranking agency, continued to process and store personal data of the data subject that related to his debt settlement procedure that the controller obtained from the public insolvency register. The purpose of the procesing was to assess the creditworthiness of the data subject and his company. The data subject was the company's sole shareholder.
</p><p>The data subject requested the erasure of his personal data on 4 May 2018, after fulfilling his debt payment plan. The controller did not reply. On 24 October 2018, the data subject lodged a complaint at the Austrian DPA against the controller for the infringement of the right to erasure under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17 GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>The controller informed the DPA by letter the same day that it would not comply with this request.
</p><p>The DPA dismissed the data protection complaint. The decision does not give detail on why the complaint was dismissed. 
</p><p>The data subject appealed this decision at the Federal Administrative Court (Bundesverwaltungsgericht, BVwG).
</p><p>The court dismissed the appeal. The court found that the controller’s processing the personal data in question was necessary, as the purpose of the processing was for making a forecast about the future payment behaviour of the data subject. The court found that the interests of the controller and its third parties outweighed the interests of the data subject The court concluded that the processing of data on historical insolvencies and payment defaults of the data subject was necessary and lawful and that the objections raised by the data subject could not justify his request for erasure. 
</p><p>The data subject appealed to the decision before the Austrian Supreme Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof, VWGH).
</p><p>The Austrian Supreme Administrative Court held off its judgement until the CJEU issued its decision on <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=CJEU_-_Joined_Cases_C%E2%80%9126/22_and_C%E2%80%9164/22_-_SCHUFA">C-26/22 and C-64/22 – Schufa</a>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Supreme Administrative Court ruled on two questions. Firstly, it examined the legality of the storage of data collected from the insolvency registry by the controller.
</p><p>Previous Austrian jurisprudence stated that credit agencies could collect and process personal data collected through the public insolvency register up to 5 years after deletion of the data concerned in the registry. However, the recent <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=CJEU_-_Joined_Cases_C%E2%80%9126/22_and_C%E2%80%9164/22_-_SCHUFA">CJEU C-26/22 and C-64/22 – Schufa</a> case stated that the lawfulness of the processing by the controller must be assessed solely in light of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(f) GDPR</a>. In particular, the CJEU also ruled that credit agencies cannot process data they collected from the insolvency register once that data has been deleted from the registry itself (see <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:62022CJ0026">CJEU C-26/22 and C-64/22 – Schufa</a> para 99). The CJEU noted that in Germany the data in the insolvency register is only kept for up to 6 months and therefore, after the expiry of a six-month period, the rights and interests of the data subject take precedence over those of the public to have access to that information.
</p><p>In light of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=CJEU_-_Joined_Cases_C%E2%80%9126/22_and_C%E2%80%9164/22_-_SCHUFA">CJEU C-26/22 and C-64/22 – Schufa</a> case, the Supreme Administrative Court found that the processing of this data, including the storage, analysis and disclosure of this data to a third party by the controller, constitutes a serious interference with the fundamental rights of the data subject under <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://fra.europa.eu/en/eu-charter/article/7-respect-private-and-family-life">Article 7 CFR</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://fra.europa.eu/en/eu-charter/article/8-protection-personal-data">Article 8 CFR</a>. The processing of such data can significantly harm the interests of the data subject because the disclosure is likely to make it considerably more difficult for him to exercise his freedoms. The Court stated that the objective of a payment plan is the economic recovery of the data subject. The request to erasure of personal data due to fulfilling the payment plan is intended to prevent the data subject from being impaired in business dealings by the public announcement of earlier insolvency proceedings. Therefore, the data subject’s economic recovery is jeopardised if a credit agency, thus the controller in this case, stores data on the data subject’s insolvency proceedings in order to assess the data subject’s creditworthiness, as this data is always used as a negative factor in the assessment. In light of this, the legitimate interests of the controller to process data regarding the insolvency proceedings of the data subject can no longer justify the processing of these personal data after this data in the insolvency register is made unavailable for the public . 
</p><p>The storage of this data by the controller after the decision of the insolvency court to remove the data from the public register can therefore not be based on <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(f) GDPR</a>. Thus, it is unlawful for the controller to store and process data relating to the insolvency proceedings of the data subject from the public insolvency register once the data is not available anymore in the register, contrary to the decision of the DPA and the administrative court.
</p><p>Secondly, the Court examined the request for erasure in accordance with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17 GDPR</a>. The Court ruled that due to the absence of lawful processing of the data subject’s data from the insolvency proceedings, the controller is obliged to erase the data concerned immediately under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1d" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17(1)(d) GDPR</a>.

        The Administrative Court has through the presiding Senate President

        Dr. Kleiser, Councilor Dr. Mayr, court councilor Mag. Hainz-Sator and the court councilors

        Dr. Pürgy and Mag. Brandl as judges, with the participation of the secretary
        Löffler, LL.M., on the revision of the A G in W, represented by the

        Brand Rechtsanwälte GmbH in 1020 Vienna, Schüttelstraße 55, Carré Rotunde,
        against the decision of the Federal Administrative Court of July 28, 2020,

        Zl. W211 2225136-1/6E, concerning a data protection matter
        (authority concerned before the administrative court: data protection authority;

        Co-involved party: K GmbH, represented by BLS Rechtsanwälte GmbH

        in 1010 Vienna, Kärntner Straße 10; other party: Federal Minister of Justice),
        rightly recognized:

        The contested finding is due to illegality of the content

        lifted.

        The federal government has incurred expenses of €1,346.40 for the appeal applicant

        to be replaced within two weeks if otherwise executed. The additional request
        is rejected.


        Reasons for the decision:

1 The appellant's assets were reported in 2010

        Debt settlement proceedings before District Court D (Insolvency Court)
        opened and the repayment rate set in 2012 in mid-March 2018

        Proof of fulfillment of the payment plan by the appeal applicant.


2 The participating party operates, among other things, the business of
        Credit information agency in accordance with Section 152 of the 1994 Trade Code (GewO 1994) and

        stored, among other things, the following excerpts from the data

                                                                2 of 26

        The applicant for appeal is, under the heading “Insolvency”:

        was settled directly by the debtor”, “Liabilities according to the insolvency application

        [EUR] 167,596.54”.

3 On October 24, 2018, the applicant filed an appeal against the party involved

        data protection complaint filed by the party as the respondent
        Violation of the right to deletion in accordance with

        Art. 17 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), after writing
        of May 23, 2018 the deletion of the entry concerning him about his

        Bankruptcy both in his “personal profile” and in the profile of the
        XY GmbH desires the database of the party involved and the

        co-involved party had informed this party in a letter dated the same day

        Not complying with desires.

4 In a decision dated September 20, 2019, the data protection authority (appealed

        Authority) rejects the data protection complaint as unfounded.

5 The complaint lodged by the appellant against this rejected this

        Federal Administrative Court (Administrative Court) with the contested
        The finding of July 28, 2020 was unfounded and stated that the

        Revision is permissible.

6 In summary, the administrative court stated that:

        The participating party processes the data in the course of operating the business
        Credit information agency in accordance with Section 152 GewO 1994 historical information about

        Payment defaults and insolvency proceedings of the appeal applicant
        (potential) creditors in order to determine the risk of any

        to provide payment defaults.

        This is a purpose recognized by the legal system.

        The data on the insolvency proceedings are correct, complete and fundamental

        necessary and suitable to make a forecast about the future
        payment behavior of the appeal applicant.

         The appeal applicant is doing something to hinder and cause damage

         Violation of the general processing principles of the

         inadequate balancing of interests within the framework of Article 6 GDPR, but none

         reasons arising from a special situation affecting him
         would result.


         The “processing of data on historical bankruptcies and
         “Payment defaults” by the appeal applicant by the co-involved party are therefore

         necessary and lawful. The objection raised by the appeal applicant
         could not justify his request for deletion.


 7 The administrative court based its decision on admissibility on the grounds that it was missing
         Jurisprudence of the Administrative Court on the question of which principles

         a balancing of interests in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f of the GDPR must be sufficient;
         in particular, whether and under what conditions the regulations of the

         Capital Adequacy Ordinance as a guideline for determining the permissible

         Storage period of creditworthiness data can be used.

 8 The present ordinary revision is directed against this with the application

26 The administrative court refers (specifically on the question of storage duration)
         in particular to Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 of the European Union

         Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements
         Credit institutions and investment firms and to change the

         in conjunction with recital 42, the use of external

28 In this respect, there is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR

          the processing of the appeal applicant's data
          Debt settlement procedures.


29 In contrast, the processing of this data, in particular with regard to
          the fulfillment of the legally confirmed payment plan, such as

          Storage, analysis and transfer of this data to a third party by the

          The party involved is a serious encroachment on the rights set out in Articles 7 and 8 GRC
          enshrined fundamental rights of the appeal applicant. Since such data as

          negative factor in assessing the creditworthiness of the
          To serve the appeal applicant, they provide sensitive information about it

          Private life. Your processing may be in the interests of the appeal applicant
          considerable harm because the disclosure is likely to jeopardize the exercise of his rights

          to make freedoms considerably more difficult, especially when it comes to

          to cover basic needs. The consequences for interests and private life
          of the appeal applicant are even greater and the requirements placed on them

          The lawfulness of storing this information therefore increases, the higher
          longer this data is stored by the participating party

          (see ECJ C-26/22 and C-64/22, paras. 94, 95).

30 Aim of a public insolvency register, such as the insolvency file

          § 256 IO is to ensure better information for those affected

          Creditors and courts (cf. ECJ C-26/22 and C-64/22, para. 96, as well
          domestically the explanations for

          One year has passed for the payment deadline. Inspection is possible at the request of the debtor
          in the insolvency file can no longer be granted if the

          legally confirmed payment plan has been fulfilled (Section 256 Para. 3 IO).

          The latter option serves to avoid disadvantages for the debtor
          Business transactions (see the explanations for

         Insolvency Law Amendment Act 2010 -IRÄG 2010 RV 612 BlgNR 24. GP 3,

         35).

32 The legislature therefore assumes that with the fulfillment of the

         legally confirmed payment plan, but at the latest upon expiry of a deadline
         of one year since the expiry of the payment period provided for in the payment plan

         the rights and interests of the data subject, as in this case
         The appeal applicant, those of the public, have access to this information

         have, predominate (cf. RV 734 BlgNR 20. GP, 63). After all, that's the goal
         of the payment plan, the economic recovery of the debtor

         (cf. OGH August 18, 2010, 8 Ob 146/09t). In this sense, a “deletion” should occur

         the insolvency file is impaired as a result of fulfilling the payment plan
         of the debtor in business transactions through public announcement of a

         Avoid previous insolvency proceedings (see explanations in
         RV 612 BlgNR 24. GP, 3, 35).


33 However, the realization of this goal would be jeopardized if those involved
         Party as a credit reporting agency to assess the economic situation of the

         Store the appeal applicant's data about his insolvency proceedings and such
         Data could be used after viewing the insolvency file

         § 256 paragraph 2 and paragraph 3 IO can no longer be granted because this data is included
         the assessment of the creditworthiness of the audit applicant is always negative

         factor can be used. Under these circumstances, those entitled to
         Interests of the credit sector, about information regarding the fulfillment

         the legally confirmed payment plan ended the insolvency proceedings

         of the appeal applicant to order the processing of this previously in the

         Insolvency court about the “deletion of the entries from the
         Insolvency file” in accordance with Section 256 Paragraph 3 IO cannot therefore be based on Art. 6

         Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR is supported. The storage of the

         data relating to the debt settlement procedure of the appeal applicant

         The decision of the insolvency court has legal force in accordance with Section 256 (3) IO

         This proves to be contrary to the legal opinion of the authority concerned and the
         Administrative court - as not legal (cf. again ECJ C-26/22 and

         C-64/22, paragraphs 98 and 99).

         Request for deletion according to Art. 17 GDPR


34 Due to the lack of lawfulness of the processing from the insolvency file
         deleted data of the appeal applicant regarding his insolvency proceedings

         The party involved is obliged to provide the relevant data immediately

         to be deleted in accordance with Art. 17 Para. 1 lit. d GDPR (cf. again ECJ C-26/22
         and C-64/22, paragraph 108).

35 In contrast to this, in the VwGH decision May 9, 2023, Ro 2020/04/0037,

         that asserted by the appeal applicant against a credit institution

         Right to deletion in accordance with Art. 17 GDPR in relation to you
         relevant entry of payment experience data in a jointly with

         database operated by other credit institutions (bank warning list).
         This entry did not concern the processing of personal data

         Applicant from the insolvency file. Rather, they were in the

         Payment history data of the audit applicant stored on the bank warning list
         by the credit institution in connection with the existing one

         Current account details of the appeal applicant are collected
         (see VwGH Ro 2020/04/0037, paragraph 57, last sentence). So much for this one

         Knowledge taking into account the Capital Adequacy Ordinance
         Storage period of at least five years in relation to the storage of

         Payment experience data in the bank warning list is generally considered legitimate

         was considered, it should be noted that the Capital Adequacy Ordinance
         in accordance with Article 1, the general supervisory requirements for

         Credit institutions regulate specific areas and are therefore not applicable
         Credit reporting agencies, such as the party involved in this case, apply.

         assessment of evidence or disputed findings of fact, but in the

         Revision legal questions were raised that were not complex in nature
         have, especially since the central legal question already refers to the case law of the ECJ

         could be referred (see VwGH August 3, 2023, Ro 2020/04/0035,
