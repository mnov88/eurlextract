<p>The data subject purchased a product through a website, All About Water S.L. (controller).
</p><p>The data subject later made a complaint to the controller about the product via email. The initial complaint was closed and joined with a second complaint, submitted by another individual. The data subject received a thread of emails relating to the 3rd party’s complaint, revealing their name, surname and contact number. 
</p><p>The third party also erroneously received an email thread revealing the name, surname, address and telephone number of the data subject. 
</p><p>On 15th July 2022, the data subject filed a complaint with the AEPD.
</p><p>During the course of the investigation, it was revealed that the process for merging complaints is performed manually and the incident giving rise to the complaint occurred as a result of human error. The controller did not supply, as requested, details of technical and organisational measures taken to ensure the confidentiality of personal data that employees are given access to.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA rejected the controller’s claim that no infringement of the GDPR occurred as the incident was explicable due to simple human error. The DPA was critical of the lack of technical and organisational measures adopted to ensure the confidentiality of personal data being handled by the employees, noting that issues such as that which arose could have been avoided if suitable measures had have been in place. 
</p><p>The DPA found that the controller had infringed <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a> in failing to process personal data in a manner which ensures its appropriate security. The DPA considered the infringement serious in nature as an irretrievable loss of control occurred over the personal data, and the taking of online orders is the core business of the controller.
</p><p>The DPA fined the controller €3000 and ordered it to adopt appropriate technical and organisational security measures within one month.

SANCTIONING PROCEDURE RESOLUTION

From the procedure initiated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based

on the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: On July 15, 2022, Mr. A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complainant)

filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
complaint is directed against ALL ABOUT WATER, S.L. with NIF B42542290 (hereinafter AAW or the respondent). The grounds for the complaint are as follows:

The complainant filed a complaint with the website manager thebath.es, related to a product purchased through the website. Your complaint, identified
with the number ***CLAIM.1, was closed and linked to another complaint, identified
with the number ***CLAIM.2, associated with another order placed by a third party. This,
according to the documentation provided by the complainant, meant that the third party had
access to the complainant's personal data related to the order placed

(first name, last name, full address, and telephone number).

The notification includes:

- A copy of the communications held with the respondent entity on July 15,

2022, regarding a complaint related to the purchased products.

It includes a communication sent on the same day from the complainant's email address (support@thebath.zendesk.com) to a third party, with a copy to the complainant. It contains a thread informing them, among other things, that request number ***CLAIM.1 was closed and merged with request number ***CLAIM.2. This thread contains information about the order placed by the complainant and includes identifying information (first and last name) and contact information (phone number and postal address).

SECOND: In accordance with Article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), this complaint was forwarded to the respondent so that it could analyze it and inform this Agency within one month of the actions taken to comply with the requirements set forth in the data protection regulations.

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/17

on September 6, 2022, as recorded in the certificate in the file.
No response has been received to this letter of transfer.

THIRD: On October 15, 2022, in accordance with Article 65 of the LOPDGDD (General Data Protection Act), the claim filed by the complainant was admitted for processing.

FOURTH: The Subdirectorate General of Data Inspection proceeded to carry out preliminary investigations to clarify the facts in question, pursuant to the functions assigned to supervisory authorities in Article 57.1 and the powers granted in Article 58.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), and in accordance with the provisions of Title VII, Chapter I, Section Two, of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act), having learned of the following:

Date on which the reported events occurred: July 15, 2022.

The respondent entity has been requested by the Data Inspection to provide information and documentation related to the reported events. On December 7, 2022, this Agency received a written response to the request for information, stating the following:

The entity has a system for responding to clients via tickets; these tickets are managed manually, and when a client sends several different emails, or several messages via different channels, the person in charge of managing them "merges" some tickets with others from the same client to maintain a single conversation thread. In this specific case, this manual merge was performed by mistake with another client's ticket, since the merge is performed using codes. In this case, the error was caused by a number change.

There is no evidence of having received complaints from other clients regarding these events.

o Provide a copy of the conversation history with the customer (here

complainant), which shows that the customer communicated the following:
"Good afternoon, I don't understand why you have merged my request
***CLAIM.1 from the order (...) with this other one that has nothing to do
with me. They have resolved the other one and I cannot add any
comments... My personal data that appears here has been made available

to a third party that has nothing to do with the case and seriously violates
the data protection law. I ask that you take immediate
action." It is verified that 11 minutes later the entity responded
with the following: "We have resolved it. We are sorry. Best regards."

The respondent indicates that on the same day, July 15, the CC (with copy) was removed from the communications so that no further tickets would be
received by both users.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/17

o Does not provide, as requested, information and supporting documentation
on the security controls and measures associated with the confidentiality
of information addressed to employees.

o Does not provide, as requested, a report on the technical and
organizational measures adopted to prevent similar incidents, implementation dates, and controls performed to verify their
effectiveness.

o Regarding the actions taken to minimize the adverse effects of this incident and those adopted for its final resolution,
it states that those responsible for managing said tickets have been notified of the error committed, so that in the future they will be

much more careful with any merger, although no documentation is provided to prove this. It claims that this has never occurred before or since these events, and that this is a completely isolated incident due to human error.

The respondent entity was again requested by the Data Inspectorate on March 24, 2023, to provide information and supporting documentation regarding the security controls and measures associated with the confidentiality of the information, addressed to employees, and to report on the technical and organizational measures adopted to prevent similar incidents, implementation dates, and controls carried out to verify their effectiveness, without receiving a response.

FIFTH: According to the report collected from the AXESOR tool, the entity ALLABOUT WATER, S.L. is a company established in 2017, with a turnover of (...) in fiscal year 2021.

SIXTH: On October 6, 2023, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against the respondent, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), for the alleged violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, classified as such in Article 83.5 of the GDPR, and for the alleged violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, classified as such in Article 83.4 of the GDPR.

PROVEN FACTS

FIRST: This communication was sent from the email address of the respondent entity (support@thebath.zendesk.com) and addressed to a third party, with a copy to the complainant.

This communication contains a thread informing the complainant, among other things, that request number ***CLAIM.1 was closed and merged into request number
***CLAIM.2. This thread contains information about the order placed by the complainant and includes identifying information (name and surname) and contact information (phone number and postal address).

SECOND: On July 15, 2022, the claimant informed them of the following:

"Good afternoon, I don't understand why you have merged my request ***CLAIM.1
from the order (...) with this other one that has nothing to do with me. They have resolved the other one and I cannot add any comments... My personal data that appears here

THIRD: It is verified that 11 minutes later the entity responded with the following:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/17

"We have resolved it. We are sorry. Best regards."

FOURTH: The respondent indicates that on July 15th, it proceeded to remove the CC (with copy) from the communications so that neither user would receive any tickets.

FIFTH: The respondent submits a statement of allegations in which it acknowledges that the incident occurred and that it took no more than eleven minutes to take measures to safeguard its client's data.

LEGAL BASIS

I

Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR) and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary manner, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II
Preliminary Questions

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.1 of the GDPR, it is established that personal data is being processed, since the respondent, among other processing operations, collects, records, stores, uses, accesses, and deletes personal data of natural persons, such as: name and surname, tax identification number (NIF), postal address, telephone number, email address, etc.

The respondent carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller, as it determines the purposes and means of such activity, pursuant to Article 4.7 of the GDPR.

Article 4, paragraph 12 of the GDPR broadly defines “personal data security breaches” (hereinafter, personal data breaches) as
“any breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.”

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/17

In the present case, there is a personal data breach under the circumstances indicated above, categorized as a confidentiality breach due to the
exposition of the complainant's personal data to an unauthorized third party.

Among the processing principles set forth in Article 5 of the GDPR, the integrity and confidentiality of personal data is guaranteed in section 1.f) of the aforementioned article. The security of personal data is regulated in Article 32 of the GDPR, which governs the security of processing.

III
Allegations to the Initiation Agreement

In response to the allegations presented by the respondent entity, the following should be noted:

The respondent entity alleges that the documentation provided shows the measures taken to correct the error committed, both internally and with staff, thus ensuring compliance with the GDPR.
The attached documentation is detailed below.

After analyzing the documentation, it should be noted that some of the documentation stated in the statement of allegations has not been received, and the documentation provided does not attest to the controls and security measures associated with the confidentiality of information addressed to employees. There is also no report on the technical and organizational measures adopted to prevent similar incidents, implementation dates, and controls carried out to verify their effectiveness. Finally, there is no record of notification of the personal data breach to this Agency.

It is clear that the mere mention of said documentation does not constitute or attest to the implementation of said measures.

This Agency is surprised that nothing has been provided to date despite the requests made both during the preliminary proceedings and in the statement of allegations phase.

Consequently, the information provided allows us to affirm that there is a deficiency in the

compliance with the proactive obligations that current data protection regulations require of the data controller. The principle of proactive responsibility constitutes the core of the GDPR and requires, for its compliance, a conscious, diligent, and continuous attitude on the part of entities. This attitude is not based solely on reacting when something happens, but also requires always being ahead of the curve. Therefore, security measures and controls aimed at guaranteeing the privacy of personal data must be implemented as a preventive measure. And compliance must be demonstrated, an issue that has not been proven. From the procedural instruction, as inferred from the Proven Facts, it has been established that the security measures implemented by the respondent in relation to the data it processed as data controller were not adequate at the time of the personal data breach, specifically with respect to the processing of customer complaints. C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/17

since it is carried out manually and, according to its statements, it is not unusual for customers to send messages via different channels, generating different tickets related to the same complaint. The data controller then proceeds to merge them and maintain them in a single conversation thread. This system is susceptible to errors, as has been demonstrated in the case at hand, which has led to a breach of the confidentiality of personal data.

It is clear that the implementation of security measures could help prevent, in

the future, incidents such as the one at issue in this procedure and
would improve the quality of the claims handling process. Therefore, the
lack of a more secure system in the post-sale claims management process
denotes the inadequacy of reasonable technical and organizational measures
based on the estimated potential risks.

In any case, the error that the defendant claims to have committed does not exclude its
liability, since, according to established case law, the
existence of such an error cannot be deemed when it is attributable to the person who committed it or could have been avoided
with the exercise of greater diligence. In this case, the alleged error is incompatible with the due diligence the entity is obliged to observe, since the security measures must be adopted in consideration of each and every risk present in the processing of personal data, including the human factor.

Furthermore, the claim that it took no more than eleven minutes to take measures to safeguard its client's data cannot be accepted, given that the email was sent to a third party and the subsequent measures did not eliminate the risks to the complainant's data protection, since the data had already been sent and that is when the loss of control over the personal data materialized, as the complainant lost the power to dispose of it.

Consequently, the allegations must be dismissed, meaning that the arguments presented do not distort the essential content of the violation declared to have been committed nor do they constitute sufficient justification or exculpation.

IV

Allegations to the Proposed Resolution

In response to the allegations presented by the respondent entity, the following should be noted:

After analyzing the allegations presented, it is found that neither the documentation provided by the respondent entity, nor the interpretation of its content, reveals any circumstance that could distort the essential content of the violations declared to have been committed, since the controls and security measures associated with the confidentiality of information directed at employees remain unproven. There is also no report on the technical and organizational measures adopted to prevent similar incidents, the dates of their implementation, and the controls carried out to verify their effectiveness.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/17

As already indicated in this Agency's response to the allegations submitted to the Initiation Agreement, the documentation provided does not constitute or prove the implementation of these measures.

Therefore, reference should be made to the response given by this Agency, which appears transcribed in Legal Basis III of this Resolution.

V
Breached Obligation

Article 5.1.f) “Principles relating to processing” of the GDPR establishes:

“1. Personal data shall be:
(…)

f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, by applying appropriate technical or organizational measures (“integrity and confidentiality”).”

In the present case, it is established that the complaining party's personal data was improperly disclosed to a third party when the client's (hereinafter, the complainant) complaint was merged with that of another client. This resulted in the other client receiving a copy of the communications with the complainant, which included his or her personal data (name and surname, telephone number, postal address, and email address).

Consequently, the proven facts are considered to constitute an infringement, attributable to the respondent, for violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR.

VI

Classification and classification of the violation

The aforementioned violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR entails the commission of the violations classified in Article 83.5 of the GDPR, which, under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines," provides:

"Violations of the following provisions shall be punished, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

a) the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9; (...)"

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its Article 71 "Violations," establishes: that

“The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute violations.”
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/17

For the purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 72 "Very Serious Violations" of the LOPDGDD states:

"1. Pursuant to the provisions of Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, violations that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:

a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees established in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)"

VII
Sanction

For the purposes of setting the amount of the penalty for a violation of Article 5.1 f) of the GDPR, the fine should be adjusted according to the criteria established therein. Article 83.2 of the GDPR, taking into account:

- Article 83.2.a) GDPR: Nature, severity, and duration of the violation.

The nature of the violation is considered serious since it entails a loss of confidentiality and, therefore, irremediable loss of access and control over personal data.

Furthermore, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following criteria established in section 2 of Article 76 "Sanctions and corrective measures" of the LOPDGDD:

As aggravating factors:

- Article 76.2.b) LOPDGDD. Link between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data: The defendant is engaged in the online sale of retail products (sanitary products, plumbing, and bathroom furniture), making it necessary, therefore, to continuously process its customers' personal data.

Considering the factors outlined above, the fine is estimated at 5,000 (five thousand euros) for violating Article 5.1 f) of the GDPR.

VIII

Unfulfilled Obligation

Article 32 “Security of Processing” of the GDPR establishes:

“1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the

nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/17

organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which, where appropriate, includes, among others:

a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
b) the ability to guarantee the permanent confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services;
c) the ability to restore availability and access to personal data quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
d) a process for regular verification, evaluation, and assessment of the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of processing.

2. When assessing the adequacy of the level of security, particular account shall be taken of the risks posed by data processing, in particular as a result of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.

3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or a certification mechanism approved pursuant to Article 42 may serve as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.

4. The controller and the processor shall take measures to ensure that
any person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor and
having access to personal data may only process such data on
instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law." (emphasis added)

It should be noted that the GDPR in the aforementioned provision does not establish a list of the
security measures to be applied according to the data being processed, but rather establishes that the controller and the processor shall implement technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk posed by the processing, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the
nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, the likelihood and severity of the risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

Furthermore, the security measures must be appropriate and proportionate to the risk identified, noting that the determination of the technical and organizational measures must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymization and encryption, the ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience, the ability to restore availability and access to data after an incident, verification process (not audit), evaluation, and assessment of the effectiveness of the measures.

In any case, when assessing the adequacy of the security level, the risks posed by data processing will be particularly taken into account, such as the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration of personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed, or unauthorized communication or access to such data that could cause physical, material, or immaterial damage.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/17

In this same sense, Recital 83 of the GDPR states that “(83) In order to maintain security and prevent processing from infringing the provisions of this Regulation, the controller or processor should assess the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate them, such as encryption. These measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of their implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. When assessing the risk in relation to data security, the risks arising from the processing of personal data should be taken into account, such as the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.” data, likely
in particular to cause physical, material, or immaterial damage."

In the present case, AAW is engaged in the online sale of certain products, electronically addressing customer complaints, all of which poses a risk in the processing of personal data that it must assess and take into account.

Therefore, it must exercise special diligence in the technical and organizational measures to

ensure adequate security in the processing of personal data,
establishing appropriate procedures and measures. Among other things, it must establish
a secure system for managing post-sales complaints.

According to the respondent itself, it uses a system to respond to customers

through tickets, which are managed manually. When a customer sends
several different emails, or several messages via different channels, the person in charge of
managing them "merges" some tickets and others from the same customer to maintain a single thread of conversation.

Therefore, at the time the breach occurred, it cannot be stated that the respondent had adequate security measures in place based on the potential risks estimated to prevent the incident, specifically with respect to the customer complaint processing process, since it is carried out manually and, according to its statements, it is not unusual for customers to send messages via different channels, generating different tickets related to the same complaint. The manager then proceeds to merge them and maintain them in a single conversation thread. This system is susceptible to errors, as has been demonstrated in the case at hand, which has enabled a third party to access the complainant's personal data. The respondent's liability is therefore determined by the breach of security revealed in the complaint and by the lack of sufficient accreditation, through the documentation provided, of the security controls and measures aimed at preventing incidents such as the one that occurred, since it is responsible for making decisions aimed at effectively implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

Consequently, the proven facts are considered to constitute an infringement, attributable to the respondent, for violation of Article 32 of the GDPR.

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/17

IX
Classification and qualification of the infringement

The aforementioned infringement of Article 32 of the GDPR entails the commission of the infringements classified in Article 83.4 of the GDPR, which, under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines," provides:

"Infringements of the following provisions shall be sanctioned, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 10,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the total global annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

a) the obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43; (…)”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its Article 71 “Infractions,” establishes that
“The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute infringements.”

For the purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 73 “Infractions Considered Serious” of the LOPDGDD states:

“Based on the provisions of Article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that entail a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular, the following, are considered serious and will expire after two years:

f) Failure to adopt those technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing, in the terms required by Article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)

X
Penalty

For the purposes of setting the amount of the penalty for a violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, the fine must be graded according to the criteria established in Article 83.2 of the GDPR, taking into account:

- Article 83.2.a) GDPR: Nature, severity, and duration of the violation.

The nature of the violation is considered serious because it implies that the person complained of does not have adequate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, or, if these exist, they have not been observed or correctly implemented.

Furthermore, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the following criteria established in section 2 of Article 76 "Sanctions and corrective measures" of the LOPDGDD:

As aggravating factors:

- Article 76.2.b) LOPDGDD. Link between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data: The defendant engages in the online sale of retail products (sanitary products, plumbing, and bathroom furniture), making it necessary to continuously process its customers' personal data.

Considering the factors outlined above, the fine is estimated at €3,000 (three thousand euros) for violating Article 32 of the GDPR.

XI
Adoption of Measures

The resolution establishes the violations committed and the events that led to the breach of data protection regulations. From this, it is clear what measures to be adopted, without prejudice to the fact that the specific procedures, mechanisms, or instruments to implement them are the responsibility of the sanctioned party, since the data controller is fully familiar with its organization and must decide, based on proactive responsibility and a risk-based approach, how to comply with the GDPR and the LOPDGDD.

In the present case, this authority hereby requires the data controller to implement, within one month, the necessary corrective measures to bring its actions in line with personal data protection regulations and prevent similar incidents from recurring in the future, and to inform this Agency, within the same period, of the measures adopted.

Please note that failure to comply with the order to adopt measures imposed by this body in the sanctioning resolution may be considered an administrative violation pursuant to the provisions of the GDPR, classified as a violation in Articles 83.5 and 83.6. Such conduct may lead to the opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure. Therefore, in accordance with applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for graduating the sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: TO IMPOSE ALABOUT WATER, S.L., with Tax Identification Number B42542290,

- for the violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, classified in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.5 of the GDPR, classified as very serious for the purposes of the statute of limitations, in Article 72.1 a) of the LOPDGDD, with a fine of 5,000 euros.
