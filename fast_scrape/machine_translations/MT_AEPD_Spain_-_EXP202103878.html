<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject’s parent (claimant) submitted a complaint before the Spanish DPA stating that images of the data subject, a minor below 16 years old, were published on a pornographic website. The claimant added that those photos were manipulated by taking the data subject’s face and putting it on naked bodies. In addition, the claimant had already reported the facts to the police and requested the deletion of the material from the website with no answer from them. 
</p><p>The Spanish DPA started an investigation proceeding according to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_57_GDPR" title="Article 57 GDPR">Articles 57(1)</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR" title="Article 58 GDPR">58(2) GDPR</a> for the processing of personal data without the consent of the data subject, as foreseen in <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6 GDPR</a>.  
</p><p>Firstly, the DPA found out that the request to the website did not expressly asked for the exercise to the right to erasure of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17 GDPR</a>, however, the photos were deleted from the website. 
</p><p>Secondly, the police sent the file to a court which started an investigation and finally closed the case due to the lack of evidence to assign the authorship of the crime to a particular person. The court had requested information regarding the IP addresses from the website, whose representative stated that they acted as an archiving service for content and public information from another website without keeping any type of information from their users except for an email address. However, they were able to delete the content in question. After visiting the other website, no material related to the investigation was found. 
</p><p>Finally, the DPA proceeded with the search on Google for all the photos from the investigation with no results.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>Having analysed the case, the Spanish DPA dismissed the complaint since, as a result of the investigation, it was not possible to assign the authorship of illegal processing to a particular person, considering that the investigating court closed the case for the same reason. Furthermore, the DPA held that the request to exercise the right to erasure (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17 GDPR</a>) was observed since the photos had been deleted from the website.
</p><p>In addition, the DPA highlighted that the publication of images of persons in videos or news available on the internet constitutes the processing of personal data and the person who does it must rely on one of the legal basis of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6 GDPR</a>. Consent being the most common legal basis, the controller must hold evidence of that consent.
