<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A complainant requested a controller to provide him with accurate, personalized information about processing of personal data. The controller failed to do so and shared with him only a general data protection notice. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA found out that a content of controller's reply did not provide the complainant with an accurate, personalized information about the handling of his personal data. The DPA concluded that the controller has breached the general rule of Article 15 (1) (a), c) and d) of the GDPR by not giving substantive, specific answers to the request under Article 15 and by sharing only a link to a general data protection notice.
