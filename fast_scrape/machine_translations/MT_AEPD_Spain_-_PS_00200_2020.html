<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The complainant sent a complaint to the Castilla y León Basketball Federation (FEDERACIÓN DE BALONCESTO DE CASTILLA Y LEÓN) and this organization shared his personal data without his consent.
</p><p>On 30 August 2017, the complainant filed a complaint with the AEPD against the FEDERACIÓN DE BALONCESTO DE CASTILLA Y LEÓN for the disclosure without consent of his personal data via the Internet and a newspaper.
</p><p>It was demonstrated that the FEDERACION de BALONCESTO de CASTILLA Y LEÓN sent the document with the personal data of the claimant, and therefore it is responsible for the violation of confidentiality when sending this document with the personal data of the claimant to a newspaper.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Does sharing a complainant's personal data without their consent a breach of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD considered that the conduct of the defendant's employees - sending personal data from a complaint - infringes Article 6(1) GDPR, by unlawfully processing the complainant's personal data, in relation to Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, which governs the principles of integrity and confidentiality of personal data, as well as the proactive responsibility of the data controller to demonstrate compliance. This is an infringement punishable under Article 83(4)(a) GDPR.
</p><p>Assessing the circumstances that modify the responsibility contemplated in Article 83(2) GDPR, in this case, the aggravating circumstances for being a non-intentional but significant negligent action (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR), and for being data known as basic personal identifiers such as name and address (Article 83(2)(g) GDPR).
</p><p>The AEPD set the amount of the administrative fine at € 3000.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>In the first place, the AEPD did not admit the complaint about processing, stating that the processing of the complainant's data relating to his status as a representative of a sports organization is outside the scope of application of the LOPD and, therefore, outside the scope of action of the AEPD.
The complainant filed an administrative appeal with the Audiencia Nacional, a court that declared the previous resolutions of the AEPD null and void, and therefore the AEPD agreed to initiate preliminary investigation proceedings.
</p><p>The defendant/sanctioned benefited from the reduction provided for in Article 85 of Law 39/2015, of 1 October, on the Common Procedure of Public Administrations.
In fact, two reductions of 20% were applied to it: one for acknowledging his responsibility and the other for the voluntary payment prior to the resolution of the procedure.
</p><p>Therefore, the initial penalty corresponded to EUR 5,000 and was reduced by 40%, resulting in a final figure of €3000.

any media.

preferential to freedom of expression over other constitutional rights when
on the basis of the truthfulness of the information provided, the facts reported are
considered to be of public relevance. This relevance is projected not only on those who
public activity, but also in those who participate in events that
are considered to be of interest to citizens. Case law has also
determined that the discussion about the veracity of the published information is not
incompatible with the pre-eminence of the right to information over the right to
