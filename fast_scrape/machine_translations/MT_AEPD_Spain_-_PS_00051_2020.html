<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The complainant, a former affiliate to the political party, had fully unsubscribed from the political party and requested the erasure of all her personal data (even receiving a confirmation to that respect by the DPO of the controller). Notwithstanding that, she later received an email asking her about the possibility of acting as a party's representative in the Spanish general elections of November 2019. The complainant, therefore, assumes that her personal data had not been duly deleted. The controller answered to the first AEPD investigation stating that, as soon as the data subject sent the deletion request, her personal data were totally erased.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>The Authority has to assess the lawfulness of the processing following the withdrawal of consent under Article 7(3) GDPR. The Authority also considers the existence of a deletion request under Article 17 GDPR.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD concludes that VOX España has infringed the lawfulness principle as per Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.
</p><p>The controller has processed the personal data of its former representative without her consent and despite the fact that she had requested the full erasure of her data. Consequently, after considering some circumstances including, (1) the local scope of the processing activity made by the defendant, (2) only one person has been affected by the processing activity, (3) there is no evidence that the defendant has adopted any measures in order to prevent such issues to happen again in the future, (4) there is no evidence of wilful misconduct by the defendant, even being this issue a very serious breach of the law, (5) the link between the activity of the defendant and the processing of personal data, and (6) the defendant is a national political party, the AEPD decided to impose a fine of 1,500 € to the defendant.
