<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The decision is the consequence of a sanction procedure started by the AEPD against the defendant due to a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that the defendant had unlawfully checked his/her personal data at the Equifax debtors list, as there was no previous contract relationship between the defendant and the claimant. The complaint included the answer of Equifax to the right of access exercised by the Spanish citizen, proving that the defendant had checked his/her personal data.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>The defendant answered to the AEPD investigation requests stating that there was a contract relationship with the claimant: in 1993, the claimant appeared as "authorized person" in a contract for the obtainment of a shopping centre commercial card, and in 1998 the claimant had also subscribed a loan agreement with the defendant. The AEPD started the corresponding investigation procedure, and it determined that (i) the claimant did not appear as a party to the commercial card contract, but as an "authorized person", (ii) the defendant did not have any copy of the loan agreement subscribed with the claimant, (iii) against the claim of the claimant before the Bank of Spain, the defendant stated that the claimant did not appear anymore as "authorized person", and it blocked his/her personal data, (iv) the loan agreement was cancelled in 1999 and the commercial card contract was cancelled in 2019, as the claimant did not acknowledge any relation with such, (v) the defendant declared that the only reason in order to check the claimant's personal data at the debtors list of Equifax was to "guarantee the best resolution" for the claim, always acting under its internal contracting policies and respecting the law. The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>Without prejudice to the results of the final investigations corresponding to the sanction procedure, the AEPD understood that the defendant could have breached the lawfulness of processing principle as per article 6(1) GDPR, as well as article 20 of the Spanish Law on Personal Data Protection and Guarantee of Digital Rights (debtors data can only be checked as long as the checking party has a contract relationship with the debtor implying the payment of any amount): on the basis of the available evidences, the defendant did not take the due diligences to avoid such situation, and it did not prove the lawfulness of the data processing. Consequently, after considering some aggravating circumstances [(i) there is a negligence/intentionality by the defendant, and (iii) basic personal data have been affected], the AEPD understood that, in case the sanction procedure resulted in a successful decision, this infringement would be fined with 30,000 € to the defendant. In this sense, the AEPD offered the defendant the possibility to settle the issue before the decision takes place by agreeing to a voluntary payment of part of the fine with two possible discounts: (i) acknowledging of its liability (24,000 €) and early voluntary payment (18,000 €). The defendant agreed to both concepts, so it paid 18,000 € and the sanction procedure was closed by the AEPD.

4/13IIArticle 58 of the RGPD, " Powers ", says:"2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powerscorrective indicated below:(…)b) sanction any person responsible or responsible for the treatment with warningwhen the processing operations have violated the provisions of thisRegulation;(...)d) order the data controller or processor that the operations oftreatment complies with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,in a certain way and within a specified period.(…)i) impose an administrative fine pursuant to article 83, in addition to or instead ofmeasures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances of the caseparticular(…) ”IIIThe RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern thetreatment of personal data and mentions among them that of " legality, loyalty andtransparency". The precept provides:"1 . The personal data will be:a) Treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to theinterested (&lt;&lt; legality, loyalty and transparency &gt;&gt;); ”Article 6 of the RGPD, “ Lawfulness of treatment ”, details in its section 1 theAssumptions in which the processing of third-party data is considered lawful:C / Jorge Juan, 6www.aepd.es28001 - Madridsedeagpd.gob.es

The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is metterms:a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their datapersonal for one or more specific purposes;b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which theinterested party or for the application at the request of this measurespre-contractual;(…) ”The infringement for which the claimed entity is responsible is foundtypified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading " General conditions forthe imposition of administrative fines ”, states:"5 . Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordancewith paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,In the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of thetotal global annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting forthe largest amount:a) The basic principles for treatment, including conditions forconsent pursuant to articles 5,6,7 and 9. "Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee ofDigital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading “ Infractionsconsidered very serious ” states:"one. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of Regulation (EU)2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions thatsuppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, inIn particular, the following:(…)b) The processing of personal data without any of theconditions of lawfulness of the treatment established in article 6 of theRegulation (EU) 2016/679. ”C / Jorge Juan, 6www.aepd.es28001 - Madridsedeagpd.gob.es

6/13IVThe documentation in the file provides evidence that BBVA,violated article 6.1 of the RGPD.Likewise, article 20 of the LOPDGDD, provides in its section e) “that thedata referring to a specific debtor can only be consulted whenWhoever consults the system maintains a contractual relationship with the affected party whoinvolves the payment of a monetary amount or this would have requested the celebrationof a contract involving financing, deferred payment or periodic invoicing such asit happens, among other cases, in those provided for in the legislation ofconsumer credit and real estate credit contracts ” .Therefore, according to the above, in order to consult the data it is necessary tothat the interested party has hired or requested the hiring, which is not the case.The record shows that the claimant intervenes as a PersonAuthorized; and in this sense it does not sign any contract with the entity.Based on the above, in the case analyzed, it is questionedthe diligence used by BBVA.The Administrative Litigation Chamber of the National Court, inassumptions such as the one presented here, has considered that when the owner of thedata denies the hiring the burden of proof corresponds to those who affirm theirexistence and the person responsible for the data processing of third parties must collect andkeep the necessary documentation to prove the owner's consent.We cite, for all, the SAN of 05/31/2006 (Rec. 539/2004), Law FoundationFourth.However, and this is the essential, BBVA does not accredit the legitimacy for thetreatment of the claimant's data.Respect for the principle of legality that is at the core of the fundamental rightof personal data protection requires that it be proven that theresponsible for the treatment deployed the essential diligence to prove thatextreme. If this Agency does not act like this - and this Agency does not demand it, who is responsible for ensuringfor compliance with the regulatory regulations of the data protection right ofpersonal character - the result would be to empty the principle of lawfulness of content.C / Jorge Juan, 6www.aepd.es28001 - Madridsedeagpd.gob.es
