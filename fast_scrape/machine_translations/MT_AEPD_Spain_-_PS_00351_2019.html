<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The decision is the consequence of a second complaint submitted in June 2019 by a Spanish citizen stating that, after a first complaint (July 2018) in which he informed the AEPD that he had exercised his rights of access and erasure before the data controller without results (and, according to which, the AEPD had issued a decision requesting the data controller to grant such rights), the data controller only granted the erasure right to the citizen, but not the access right. 
</p><p>The data controller answered to the AEPD investigation requests that it had sent the citizen the corresponding information on the reason why it could not grant such access right: it had not been able to do so because it had already managed and granted the erasure right also requested.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Did the data controller infringe its obligation to fulfill the data subject's rights of access and erasure?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD found that the data controller did not comply with its previous decision (as it did not grant the access right to the citizen) and, after considering some aggravating (the data controller has the consideration of a big company) and extenuating (the data controller has not obtained any benefits from its actions) circumstances, it decided to impose a fine of 30,000 € to the data controller.

<pre>Procedure No: PS/00351/2019
938-051119
RESOLUTION OF PENALTY PROCEEDINGS
The procedure conducted by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and on the basis of the following:
BACKGROUND
FIRST: The Spanish Data Protection Agency (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos) proceeded with the opening of legal protection, TD/00127/2019, on the basis of the following facts:
On 27 July 2018, Mr A.A.A.  ( the complainant) exercised the rights of access to and disposal of Telefónica Móviles España, S.A.U. with NIF A78923125 (hereinafter: the respondent party).In particular, it requested data protection (access rights and deletion).
SECOND:The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency, made an appeal under Law TD/00127/2019 on 4 June 2019, to review the complaint made by A.A.A. and to  invite the respondent to submit, within ten working days following notification of the present decision, to the complainant certifying that he has complied with his right of access or a reasoned refusal to state reasons why his or her request should not be granted.
That agreement was served on the party claimed on 10 June 2019.
THIRD:On 20 June 2019, he received a letter from the complainant in which he states that the time-limits allowed to the respondent party had been exceeded by the latter’s decision.
Despite having upheld the decision with regard to the right of access which was not served, the party complained against still has no bearing on that right.
