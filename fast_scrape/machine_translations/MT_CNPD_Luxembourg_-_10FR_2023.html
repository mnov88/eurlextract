<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>Following a general check carried on all Luxembourg municipalities in the summer of 2022, the Luxembourg DPA decided to open an investigation on the Municipal Administration of Leudelange (the controller).
</p><p>Specifically, the controller aimed to evaluate the controller’s conformity with its obligation to appoint a DPO and whether it communicated the DPO's contact details to the DPA, as provided by <a href="/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR#1a" title="Article 37 GDPR">Article 37(1)(a) GDPR</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR#7" title="Article 37 GDPR">Article 37(7) GDPR</a>. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA noted that pursuant to the entry into force of the GDPR, public bodies were obliged to designate a DPO no later than 25 May 2018. Meanwhile, on the date the investigation was opened, and after consulting the register of DPOs, no DPO had been identified for the controller. The controller appointed a DPO only on 10 March 2023, namely after the opening of the investigation. Thus, the controller violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR#1a" title="Article 37 GDPR">Article 37(1)(a) GDPR</a>. Moreover, the DPA acknowledged that when the investigation began, the controller had not communicated to the DPA the contact details of the DPO, breaching <a href="/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR#7" title="Article 37 GDPR">Article 37(7) GDPR</a>.
</p><p>Observing <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2018/08/01/a686/jo">Article 48 of the National Data Protection Law</a>, the DPA may impose administrative fines as provided in <a href="/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR" title="Article 83 GDPR">Article 83 GDPR</a>, except against the State or municipalities. Hence, the DPA found it appropriate to issue a reprimand to the controller under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2b" title="Article 58 GDPR">Article 58(2)(b) GDPR</a>. In light of this, the DPA recognised that during the proceedings, the controller took steps to remedy the shortcomings identified by the head of the investigation.
</p>

              Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of
                 survey n°[…] carried out with the municipal administration of Leudelange


                                                                                                       2/9 In the absence of a reaction from the Mayor, the president of the CNPD told him

   On the date of writing of this letter, and after consulting the register of

data protection delegates, the investigating officers did not identify any

appointment of a DPO for your municipality”.


      The person being inspected responded to the letter opening the investigation by mail dated March 10

              Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of
                 survey n°[…] carried out with the Leudelange municipal administration


                                                                                                      3/9 II. Place


   II.1. On the reasons for the decision



   On the failure linked to the obligation to appoint a DPO and communicate the
contact details at the CNPD



   1. On the principles


      In accordance with article 37.1.a) of the GDPR, any data controller or subcontractor

processor must designate a DPO if the “processing is carried out by a public authority or
a public body, with the exception of courts acting in the exercise of their function

jurisdictional”.


      Based on article 37.7 of the GDPR, any data controller or subcontractor

is also obliged to communicate the contact details of the DPO to the supervisory authority,

that is to say in this case to the CNPD.


       In its guidelines on DPDs, the Article 29 Working Group has

clarified the relevant provisions of the GDPR in this area in order to help those responsible

processing and subcontractors to comply with the legislation, but also to assist the DPOs

in their role.


       Note that the European Data Protection Committee, which succeeded the

Article 29 Working Group on May 25, 2018, took up and reapproved the adopted documents

by the said Group between May 25, 2016 and May 25, 2018, as precisely the lines
                      3
aforementioned guidelines.


   2. In the present case


       The head of investigation noted in his statement of objections that on “the date

opening of an investigation, and after consultation of the register of delegates for the protection of






2 The Guidelines on DPDs were adopted by the Article 29 Working Group on
December 13, 2016. The revised version (WP 243 rev. 01) was adopted on April 5, 2017.

 ________________________________________________________________

              Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of
                 survey n°[…] carried out with the Leudelange municipal administration


                                                                                                        4/9 data, the investigating agents did not identify the designation of a DPO for

the Municipal Administration of Leudelange”.


   Furthermore, he noted that the auditee “designated a DPO on March 10, 2023, i.e.
after the opening of the investigation.


   Therefore, he held that “the conditions of article 37, paragraph (1) point a) of

GDPR has not been respected. 4


       Restricted Training would first of all like to emphasize that the controlled is a

Luxembourg municipal administration and therefore, a public body obliged to
designate a DPO no later than May 25, 2018, the date the GDPR comes into force.


       It then notes that the person being inspected had responded on March 10, 2023 to the letter from

head of investigation of February 3, 2023 informing him of the opening of the investigation into him. In

annexed to this letter of March 10, 2023 was an extract from the deliberations of the

College of mayor and aldermen of March 10, 2023, as well as the application form

declaration from the DPD to the CNPD, signed and dated on the same day, according to which the
Government Data Protection Commissioner at the State had been

designated as DPO of the controlled person.


       The Restricted Panel can therefore only agree with the findings of the head of investigation

that on the date of opening of the investigation, that is to say December 9, 2022, the person inspected did not have

still designated a DPD, despite the reminder letters from the CNPD of August 11, 2022 and
from September 23, 2022.


       In view of the above, it concludes that at the start of the investigation, the person controlled failed

to its obligation arising from article 37.1.a) of the GDPR.


       Furthermore, the Restricted Formation notes that on the date of the opening of

the investigation, the person controlled had not communicated the contact details of his DPO to the CNPD
in accordance with article 37.7 of the GDPR. Therefore, as the control of compliance with said

article appeared within the scope of the investigation in question (see point 2 of this decision),

                survey n°[…] carried out with the Leudelange municipal administration


                                                                                                     5/9she considers that the person inspected also failed to fulfill his obligation arising from article 37.7
of the GDPR.


   II. 2. On corrective measures


   1. On the principles


       In accordance with article 12 of the law of August 1, 2018, the National Commission

has the powers provided for in article 58.2 of the GDPR:

   “a) notify a controller or a processor of the fact that the operations

processing envisaged are likely to violate the provisions of this

regulation;


   b) call to order a controller or a processor when the

processing operations have resulted in a violation of the provisions of this Regulation;

   (c) order the controller or processor to comply with the

requests submitted by the data subject with a view to exercising their rights in

application of this regulation;


   (d) order the controller or processor to put the operations
processing in accordance with the provisions of this regulation, where applicable,

in a specific manner and within a specific time frame;


   (e) order the controller to communicate to the data subject

a personal data breach;


   (f) impose a temporary or permanent limitation, including a ban, on the
treatment;


   g) order the rectification or erasure of personal data or the

limitation of processing pursuant to Articles 16, 17 and 18 and the notification of these

measures to recipients to whom personal data have been disclosed
pursuant to Article 17(2) and Article 19;


   (h) withdraw a certification or order the certification body to withdraw a

certification issued pursuant to articles 42 and 43, or order the body to

                survey n°[…] carried out with the Leudelange municipal administration


                                                                                                     6/9certification not to issue certification if the requirements applicable to certification

are not or no longer satisfied;


   (i) impose an administrative fine pursuant to section 83, in addition or

instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the characteristics
specific to each case;


   j) order the suspension of data flows addressed to a recipient located in

a third country or an international organization.


       In accordance with article 48 of the law of August 1, 2018, the CNPD may impose

administrative fines as provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, except against

the State or municipalities.


       The Restricted Training would like to point out that the facts taken into account in the framework
of this decision are those noted at the start of the investigation. The possible

modifications relating to the data processing subject to the investigation that have taken place

subsequently, even if they make it possible to fully or partially establish the

compliance, do not allow retroactive cancellation of a noted breach.


       However, the steps taken by the auditee to comply

with the GDPR during the investigation procedure or to remedy breaches
noted by the head of investigation in the statement of objections, are taken into account by

Restricted Training as part of any corrective measures to be taken.


   2. In the present case


       In the communication of grievances the head of investigation “proposes to the Training

Restricted from issuing a call to order against the Controlled Party according to which he must

comply with the applicable legislation regarding the appointment of a protection delegate

       As for the corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation and with reference to

point 21 of this decision, the Restricted Training takes into account the procedures

 ________________________________________________________________
              Decision of the National Commission sitting in restricted formation on the outcome of
                survey n°[…] carried out with the Leudelange municipal administration



                                                                                                     7/9 carried out by the auditee in order to comply with the provisions of articles 37.1.a) and 37.7

of the GDPR, as detailed in its letter of March 10, 2023.

       More particularly, it notes that as of March 10, 2023, the person inspected had

sent to the CNPD, the extract of the deliberations of the College of Mayor and Aldermen

relating to the meeting of March 10, 2023, as well as the DPO declaration form, signed

and dated the same day, and according to which the Government Protection Commission
of data with the State had been designated as DPO of the controlled.


       However, on the date of the opening of the investigation, the person inspected had neither designated a

DPD, nor communicated its contact details to the CNPD.


       For these reasons, the Restricted Panel considers that it is appropriate to pronounce the

corrective measure proposed by the head of investigation in this regard and taken up in point 22 of the
this decision and to call the controlled person to order for having violated articles 37.1.a) and

37.7 of the GDPR.


       Finally, under the terms of article 52 of the law of August 1, 2018, “CNPD may

order, at the expense of the sanctioned person, the publication in full or in extracts of

its decisions with the exception of decisions relating to the imposition of penalty payments, and under
reserves that:


   1° the means of appeal against the decision have been exhausted; And


   2° the publication does not risk causing disproportionate harm to the parties in question.

   cause ".


   The Restricted Panel considers that the publication of this decision does not risk
not cause disproportionate harm to the person being controlled, but that it is justified in view of

of the public interest in knowing the results of the general verification that the CNPD had

carried out in all Luxembourg municipalities during the summer of 2022.
