<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>In March 2024, the DPA initiated an investigation of Boliglag.dk (the controller) after receiving multiple complaints from property owners (data subjects). Upon searching for addresses or a person’s name, the website shows information on property. Results include information such as name, gender and age of present and former owners of a respective property. It also showed historical data on property sales and sales values, neighborhood information, property values, estimated property taxes and titles against the property. The data was compiled from multiple public registries.
</p><p>The DPA submitted a request for comment to the controller. The controller stated, that all personal information such as name and gender would be temporarily removed from the website, while the DPA was investigating the matter.   
</p><p>The controller explained that the purpose of his website is to create transparency on the Danish property market through an easy, simple and freely accessible overview of publicly available property information on a single platform. The controller stated that similar paid platforms already exist for realty professionals and argued that through these platforms realtors achieved an advantage over consumers who had no access to such information. Much of the information could also be found on other websites.
</p><p>The controller maintained that the processing was within the scope of legitimate interest (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(f)</a>) after receiving the DPA’s guidance on access to public registers and a number of telephone conversations with the DPA. The controller believed that it's legitimate interest was not overridden by the interest or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA found that it's generally legal to process data from one or multiple public registers, which have already been publicised, for the purpose of  furthering transparency on the property market according to the <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(f) GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>However, the DPA did not find it necessary to process personal data like individual's historical property holdings, name, gender and age for the controller’s purpose.  It held, that the intended purposes can be served with smaller impacts on data subjects’ right to privacy and protection of personal data. 
</p><p>Furthermore, the DPA argued, that even if the processing was to be considered necessary for the controller's purposes, the interest of increasing market transparency is overridden by fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, particularly because data subjects cannot reasonably expect such extensive interconnection and publication of their personal data to property information. As a consequence, the DPA held, that the controller's processing of such personal data could not be based lon <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(f) GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>The DPA issued a reprimand, considering that the controller swiftly took action to temporarily remove personal data from the website.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p><i>The DPA finds that the purpose of creating greater transparency in the Danish property market is both factual and relevant. Yet, this worthwhile purpose is not enough to legitimise the processing of already public information under legitimate interest <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(f)</a>.</i>

Boliglag.dk receives criticism for illegal processing of information about homeowners

Date: 16-10-2024

Decision Private companies Criticism Supervision / self-employed case Processing basis

The Danish Data Protection Authority has completed its investigation of www.boliglag.dk. In its decision, the Authority criticizes that the processing of information about homeowners did not have a lawful basis according to data protection regulations.

Case number: 2024-431-0033.

Summary

In March 2024, the Danish Data Protection Authority initiated a case of its own motion against Boliglag ApS regarding the processing of personal data on the website www.boliglag.dk.

The investigation was initiated based on a number of complaints and inquiries that the Danish Data Protection Authority had received.

In this connection, the Danish Data Protection Authority found that it was possible to search for information about properties on the website by searching either for a specific address or by searching directly for the name of a natural person. The search results showed the profile of the home, which included information about, among other things, the name, gender and age of the current and previous owners of the home, as well as the home's sales history and sales value.

The Danish Data Protection Authority has now made a decision in the case and is criticizing Boliglag ApS.

It will often be lawful for a data controller to process – including publishing – personal data that has been obtained from one or more publicly available registers and that has already been published.

However, after a specific assessment in the case of www.boliglag.dk, the Danish Data Protection Authority found that the processing of personal data on the website cannot take place within the framework of the “balancing of interests rule” in Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

The Danish Data Protection Authority emphasized that although the purpose of making housing data easily accessible and creating transparency in the housing market is objective and relevant, this purpose can only be achieved in a way that is less intrusive to the privacy of the persons concerned.

The Danish Data Protection Authority also emphasized that data subjects cannot reasonably expect such extensive linking and publication of their personal data as the solution on www.boliglag.dk entailed. The publication was of a particularly intrusive nature as the information could be retrieved by searching for the individual person's name.

Decision

The Danish Data Protection Authority hereby returns to the case, where on 12 March 2024 the Authority initiated an investigation into Boliglag ApS' (hereinafter "Boliglag") own processing of personal data on the website www.boliglag.dk.

The Danish Data Protection Authority notes that with this decision the Authority has only taken a position on the lawfulness of the processing of personal data on the website www.boliglag.dk, as it existed at the time the Authority initiated its investigation.

1. Decision

The Danish Data Protection Authority finds that there is reason to express criticism that Boliglag's processing of personal data has not been carried out in accordance with the rules in Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation[1].

Below follows a detailed review of the case and a justification for the Data Protection Authority's decision.

2. Case presentation

2.1. Information in the case

On 12 March 2024, the Danish Data Protection Authority initiated an investigation of its own operations into the processing of personal data on the website www.boliglag.dk, which Boliglag administers, as the Authority had received a number of inquiries and complaints from data subjects who were concerned about the publication of information about them, including protected name and address information. &#160;

In connection with the initiation of the investigation, the Danish Data Protection Authority found that it was possible to search for information about properties on the website by searching either for a specific address or by searching directly for the name of a natural person. A search resulted in the profile of the property, which included information about, among other things: name, gender and age of current and previous owners of the home as well as the home's sales history and sales value.

On this basis, the Danish Data Protection Agency requested Boliglag for a statement regarding www.boliglag.dk.

On 14 March 2024, DAHL Advokatpartnerskelskab (hereinafter DAHL) stated on behalf of Boliglag that all personal data such as name and gender would be removed from the website as a temporary measure in light of the Danish Data Protection Agency's investigation of the matter.

This information has therefore not been available on www.boliglag.dk around the end of March 2024.

2.2. Boliglag's comments

DAHL has stated on behalf of Boliglag that the purpose of the website www.boliglag.dk is to create greater transparency in the Danish housing market by providing an easy, simple and clear insight into Denmark's publicly available housing data on one platform - free for everyone - for use in housing transactions, housing information, etc.

The information on the platform included Danish homes' sales history, neighborhood, assessments, estimated property value tax, land tax, liens, homeowner names, addresses and gender of homeowners.

Boliglag was aware that similar platforms already existed in the housing market that made the same data available to professional players (e.g. real estate agents) for a fee. This gave these players a negotiating advantage over the average consumer, who generally did not have access to the same information when buying and selling real estate. Furthermore, much of the same information could be found on websites such as Krak, Proff, CVR, Boligsiden, Boliga, BBR, DenGeo, etc. With its platform, Boliglag wanted to collect all housing data on one website and make the information publicly available to everyone without payment.

Boliglag has further stated that Boliglag – based on the Danish Data Protection Agency’s guidance on the processing of information from publicly available registers and a number of telephone inquiries to the Data Protection Agency – assessed that the basis for the processing of personal data was Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

As justification for the processing being carried out within the framework of this provision, Boliglag has stated that an assessment has been made of whether the interests and fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects outweighed Boliglag’s interest in being able to offer a website with public housing data. In this connection, Boliglag found that the value of everyone being able to access housing data was of the utmost importance, as several of the personal data could already be accessed on other public websites. Boliglag has further stated that Boliglag has sought guidance from the Data Protection Agency on the basis for the processing on several occasions.&#160;

Boliglag has also stated that the data published on the website www.boliglag.dk originates from the following sources:

Owner Register (”EJF”) Danish Address Register (”DAR”) Building and Housing Register (”BBR”) Property Location Register (”EBR”) Cadastral Register (“MAT”) Property Valuation (”VUR”) Danish Addresses Web API (“DAWA”) Danish Energy Agency Digital Land Registration

Boliglag has, to the relevant extent, created an account to gain access to information from, among others, BBR, EBR, Danish Energy Agency and MAT. It is Boliglag’s assessment that no action has been taken in violation of the user terms of the registers in question. The information retrieved from VUR and DAWA is publicly available.

With regard to EJR, Boliglag has stated that upon request Boliglag has been granted access to data from EJF at “Level 1”, i.e. personal data without CPR numbers and without protected name and address information. This ensured that Boliglag did not gain access to protected name and address information. Boliglag has further stated that it is Boliglag's overall assessment that Boliglag has not acted in breach of the terms of use for EJR.

Boliglag has briefly collected information on liability and owner information from Digital Tinglysning, but stopped doing so when Boliglag became aware that this could be in breach of the terms of use.

3. Relevant rules, practices, etc.

3.1. Relevant rules&#160;&#160;

It follows from Article 6(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation that processing is only lawful if and to the extent that at least one of the conditions in the provision applies. For example, processing is lawful if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data take precedence over this, in particular if the data subject is a child, cf. Article 6(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation. 1, letter f (the “balancing of interests rule”).&#160;

In order to use Article 6, paragraph 1, letter f of the Data Protection Regulation as a basis for processing, it is a condition that the data controller or a third party pursues a legitimate interest, that the processing is necessary for the pursuit of this interest, and that this interest does not outweigh the interests of the data subject.

In connection with the specific balancing of the conflicting interests, it follows from recital 47 that a careful assessment must be made, including whether a data subject can reasonably expect, at the time of and in connection with the collection of personal data, that processing for the purpose in question can take place. In connection with the balancing of the conflicting interests, particular account must therefore be taken of, inter alia, the reasonable expectations of the data subjects.&#160;

4. Reasons for the Danish Data Protection Authority's decision

The Danish Data Protection Authority assumes that the personal data that Boliglag collects and disseminates on the website www.boliglag.dk is covered by Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation. The personal data is obtained from public registers and on the basis of access permits.

The Danish Data Protection Authority further assumes that Boliglag is the data controller for the processing of personal data that occurs in connection with the website.

The Danish Data Protection Authority further assumes that Boliglag's processing of personal data occurs on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation, which stipulates that the processing of personal data may occur if it is necessary for the data controller or a third party to pursue a legitimate interest, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject take precedence over this. This is therefore a rule that requires a specific balancing of interests.

Finally, the Danish Data Protection Authority assumes – in accordance with what Boliglag stated – that the purpose of the processing of personal data on www.boliglag.dk is to create greater transparency in the housing market and to promote access to publicly available housing data in an easy and clear manner without payment for the use of housing trade, etc.

In the opinion of the Danish Data Protection Authority, this must be considered a legitimate and relevant purpose.

In the opinion of the Danish Data Protection Authority, it will typically be lawful for a data controller to process personal data that has been obtained from one or more publicly available registers and that has already been published, cf. Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

In relation to the question of necessity, the Danish Data Protection Authority finds that the publication of systematised information about individuals, including their (historical) property holdings, name, gender and age, cannot, in the opinion of the Danish Data Protection Authority, be considered necessary in light of the purpose pursued by Boliglag with the website.

The Danish Data Protection Authority notes in this regard that an objective of making housing data easily accessible and creating transparency in the housing market can be achieved in a way that is less intrusive to the fundamental rights of the persons concerned, in particular their right to respect for privacy and to the protection of personal data.

The processing cannot therefore take place in this situation within the framework of Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation and thus does not have a lawful basis.

Even if the Danish Data Protection Authority assessed that the processing of personal data was necessary, the Danish Data Protection Authority finds, after a specific weighing of the nature of the processing and the conflicting interests in the present case, that the interests of the data subjects, including the protection of privacy, outweigh the interests of ensuring increased transparency in the housing market, etc.

In this connection, the Danish Data Protection Authority emphasises that, in the opinion of the Authority, the data subjects cannot reasonably expect such extensive linking and publication of their personal data as the website www.boliglag.dk entails, and which is of a particularly intrusive nature as a result of the information being searchable by searching on the individual's name.&#160;&#160; &#160;

The Danish Data Protection Authority notes in this regard that the reasonable expectations of the data subjects must be given considerable weight in the balancing of interests, in particular in order to limit the risk that the data subjects will be unnecessarily surprised by a given processing of their personal data and its potential consequences.

In relation to the issue of Boliglag's publication of information about persons with name and address protection, the Danish Data Protection Authority assumes, based on the information from Boliglag, that Boliglag, in accordance with the terms of use, has not had access to such protected information. The Danish Data Protection Authority has also established that Boliglag has handled objections to the processing from data subjects, and therefore finds no basis for investigating this matter further.

Based on the above, the Danish Data Protection Authority finds that Boliglag's processing of personal data on the website www.boliglag.dk has not been carried out in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

After an overall assessment, the Danish Data Protection Authority finds that there are grounds for criticizing Boliglag's processing of personal data.

In choosing the sanction, the Danish Data Protection Authority has particularly placed emphasis on the fact that Boliglag quickly implemented temporary measures to remove the personal data from the website as a mitigating circumstance.

Below follows a detailed review of the case and a justification for the Danish Data Protection Authority's decision.

On this basis, the Danish Data Protection Authority requested Boliglag for a statement regarding www.boliglag.dk.

On 14 March 2024, DAHL Advokatpartnerskelskab (hereinafter DAHL) stated on behalf of Boliglag that all personal information such as name and gender would be removed from the website as a temporary measure in light of the Danish Data Protection Authority's investigation of the matter.

This information has therefore not been available on www.boliglag.dk around the end of March 2024.
