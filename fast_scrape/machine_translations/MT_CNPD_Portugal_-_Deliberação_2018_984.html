<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>CNPD's investigation revealed that the hospital’s staff, psychologists, dietitians and other professionals had access to patient data, notably data which was part of the Electronic Patient Records (EPR) - which should only be accessed by doctors - through their information system accounts. The profile management system revealed other flaws, as the hospital had 985 registered doctor profiles, while only having 296 doctors. Moreover, doctors had unrestricted access to all patient files, regardless of the doctors' specialty.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Does granting hospital’s staff, psychologists, dietitians and other professionals access to Electronic Patient Records (EPR) breach articles 5(1)(c), (f), and 32(1)(b), (d) of the GDPR? 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>While the controller argued that (i) professionals other than doctors needed access to health data to fulfill their roles and that (ii) system access permissions were not configured by the controller, but by the Health Ministry's shared services (SPMS), the Portuguese DPA found that it was the controller who voluntarily determined said professionals should have indiscriminate access to EPRs and that the controller never asked SPMS to adjust the hospital's professionals' access profiles. 
When determining the amount of the fine, the Portuguese DPA took into account the number of affected data subjects (dozens of thousands), the nature of the personal data at stake (health-related data) and the intentional character of the breach by the data controller (who did not implement a reliable audit system after a prior instruction by the DPA).

Case No. 9932/20181NATIONAL COMMISSIONDATA DEPROTECTIONRESOLUTION No. 984/2018| - The National Data Protection Commission (CNPD) prepared, on July 17,2018, deliberation project, in which the defendant was imputedthe practice of two predicted and punishable violations under the terms ofcombined provisions of Articles 5, paragraph 1 to 1. c) and article 5, paragraph 1 al. f) with article83, paragraph 5, al. a), the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation679/2016, of April 27, hereinafter GDPR), punishable, each, with a fine of €0.00 to € 20,000,000.00 or up to 4% of annual turnover, depending on the amounthigher, as well as the practice of a predicted and punishable violation under the termsof the combined provisions of article 32, paragraph 1, subparagraphs b) and d) and article 83, paragraph 4, al.a), of the GDPR, with a fine of € 0.00 to € 10,000,000.00 or up to 2% of turnoverper year, whichever is the highest.The defendant was notified of the content of the said project and, pursuant to the provisions of article 50.of Decree-Law No. 433/82, of October 27, to present its defense, came to claim(see pages 38 to 82), in short, that:1. The CNPD cannot be considered as a national control authority under theterms of article 51, paragraph 1 of the GDPR, as it has not yet been indicated asformally. Admitting otherwise would violate the principle of legality contained in the article266 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic (CRP);2. The conducts foreseen in the GDPR as sanctionable with the fines of the article83 are not sufficiently densified, so the intervention of thenational legislator is indispensable for them to apply, under penalty ofviolation of the principle of typicality formulated in article 29 of the CRP;3.

Assumes, also in relation to these inactive accounts, the correction of thesesituations, using internal processes and technical certification;14. Given the impossibility of modeling, altering or correcting the technical aspects ofsystems used, understands to have acted without guilt, therefore it is not imputableany conduct conduct.He gathered eleven documents and four witnesses.Il - Appreciation1) On the alleged existence of a violation of the principle of legality by virtue ofCNPD arrogates itself in a condition that, by way of delight, will not (yet) belong to it,it will always seduce that such an argument does not succeed. Deselogo, and as explainedin the deliberation project, the CNPD is, for all intents and purposes, and as such notis changed, “the national authority whose role is to control and supervisecompliance with legal and regulatory provisions in the field ofprotection of personal data, in strict respect for human rights andfor the freedoms and guarantees enshrined in the Constitution and22, no. 1 of Law no. 67/98, of 26 October, amended by Law no. 103/2015, ofAugust 24, hereinafter LPDP).Such a provision does not contain only a will of the national legislator inassign to CNPD any national matter related to the protection of personal data,but rather the distinct intention of entrusting you with any matter of this nature thatit is not specifically prohibited by law. And we don't see how it can violatethe principle of legality.In addition, the GDPR contains several novelties aimed at standardizing the powerscontrol authorities across the European Union (EU), precisely toallow the useful effect sought by the use of this legal instrument. This respects,for example, the possibility for any of the supervisory authorities in the EU to beequipped with adequate powers of investigation and correction, ending,thus, with the disparity that prevailed until the 25th of May.Ruade São Bento, 148-3º + 1200-821 LISBON21/393/00 39)Tel: 213928400Fax: 213976832PRIVACY LINEwww.cnpd.ptWorking days from 10 am to 1 pmdoubts (Qenpd enfoot

4)5)8)Processon. 9932/2018 2vIt happens, however, that, in Portugal, the CNPD has had this type ofpowers, the relevant GDPR not being a novelty, except with regard to theobligations to cooperate with other EU supervisory authorities, withoutthat the paradigmatic transition of hetero-regulation is forgotten (whose mostvisible consisted in the prior evaluation and authorization of data processingpersonal data) for self-assessment, and it is now up to those responsible fortreatments and subcontractors provide for the legality of data processingpersonal actions that they carry out, without any intermediation ofsupervisory authorities.In addition to all these arguments, there is another one, of a purely formal nature, thatit is the institutional representation of Portugal that CNPD already already ensures in the EU.Indeed, the new European Data Protection Committee, foreseen in theSection 3 of Chapter VIl of the GDPR, must, under the terms of paragraph 3 of article 68 of theregulation, be “composed of the director of a supervisory authority for eachMember State ”. This new European Union body then assumes thateach country is represented by the director (or president) of each authoritycontrol of the various Member States, which, in the Portuguese case, resulted in theintegration, as a right member, of CNPD into CEPD, disregards the firstmeeting dated May 25, 2018.As for the principle of typicality invoked by the defendant, even less in theseems to be serviceable. It will suffice, to remove it, to remember, from the outset, the intentionstandardizing the regulation, especially in the area of ​​fines,uncontroversially expressed in recital 150 of the GDPR “In order to reinforceand harmonize administrative sanctions for violations of thisRegulation, supervisory authorities should be empowered to imposeFinnic. This regulation should define the violations and the amountmaximum and the criterion for setting the value of the fines resulting therefrom [underlineddust

Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque, in his “Commentaryof the General Regime of Administrative Offenses ”, in annotation 16 to article 2, illustratedo exemplarily when it states that “the infraction based on the violationgeneral clauses (general duties of zeal and urbanity) and other obligationsdoes not violate the datipity principle (TC judgment 338/2003, whichfocused on article 82, al. b), of Decree-Law no. 422/89, of 2.12). The samecan be concluded from the breach of the generic duty regarding the organizationaccounting (judgment of TC no. 455/2006, related to article 14 of Law no.56/98, and the judgment of TC No. 198/2010, relating to Article 29 of Law No. 19/2003). ".8) Regarding the matter of fact, it is enlightening that the defendant confirms theexistence of the access profiles as they were described in the project ofdeliberation. In effect, the policy for assigning access credentialsallowed at least 9 (nine) employees of the functional group “TECHNICAL / A”to enjoy the level of access reserved for the functional group “MEDICO”, ​​whichtranslates into the indiscriminate possibility of consulting clinical processes ofall hospital users.9) Regardless of recognizing external standardization and availabilityof a certain set of profile types, it was the defendant who volunteered andconsciously determined that those professionals could, throughprofiles not suited to their functions and professional category, to have accessindiscriminate access to clinical processes throughout the hospital, rather than establishingRua de São Bento, 148-3º «1200-821 LISBOA213930039)Tel: 213 928400Fax: 213976832PRIVACY LINEwoetce

Case nº9932 / 2018 | 3mother procedures, perhaps more time consuming, but certainly lessintrusive protection of personal data that any citizen should deserve.10) Without disregarding this critical judgment, the arguments related to theinability to determine, a priori, which information is relevant to eachof technicians with the aforementioned access profiles, a difficulty that isexponentiated by the architecture of the systems that do not allow the definition,and step or case series of access to certain clinical information, a fact that,again, it cannot be attacked to those who do not have the instruments toremedy or mitigate the effects of such construction.11) We even believe that this hypothesis removes direct intent from the defendant's conduct,makes the necessary deception questionable, but does not in any way preclude theexistence of eventual fraud. So much so, that the defendant confesses to always havingproceeded with knowledge of the existence of these weaknesses of the system,however, refraining from continuing to assign undue access privileges to asetinprofessionalswhatNevershouldpoweraccessindiscriminately to clients' clinical files.12) It is unsustainable to defend that any social worker can access thetotality of the client's clinical file in order to perform its function,such defense is even more unsustainable if access to thesemolds without time limit.13) How equally indefensible is the existence of access credentials thatallow any doctor, of any specialty, at any timeaccess customer data for a given hospital. The beginningminimization of data and the principle of “need to know” (or, in the“Need to know” anglicism), prohibit or intend to prohibit collection, but alsoaccess and other treatments to information unnecessary for the purposetarget.

Process No. 9932/2018 | 4NATIONAL COMMISSIONDATA DEPROTECTION14) For all these reasons, the CNPD cannot admit that the technical limitations mentionedcan justify the unrestricted adoption of access validation procedureswhich practically render the essential nucleus of the fundamental right toprotection of personal data.15) The defendant's allegation, which points to a much greater restrictiveness of the profiles ofaccess to non-medical professionals with functional group profiles“TECNICO” and the “MEDICO” activity group is clearly reductive since,even if such restrictions exist, they were not enough to avoid eventhat the CNPD technicians would see the defendant's SSI created a user oftest (just from the “TECNICO” functional group and activity group“MEDICO”) that allowed them to “search for registered registrants at that institutionhospital without restrictions and that it was allowed access to all elementsthat make up the clinical process of these assistants ”, as shown in the reportannex to the draft resolution (see pages 6).16) By knowingly allowing professionals from several different categories toaccess to unrestricted information about the clinical process of the clients ofThedefendant did not take the slightest care to ensure compliance with that principle,moreover, having circumvented a limitation of the systems that had been adoptedfor security and privacy reasons.17) In addition to this, according to the defendant's own defense, the defendant will never havecare of the intermediary of the SPMS in order to correct this aspect of the systemwhich, as the recent update demonstrates, should and could be changedpreviously.18) Let it be said, regarding the matter of the possibility of accessing non-existent informationnecessary or relevant allowed by these profiles that, the inspection teamverified and collected proof of access to the PDS from the user account ofRua de São Bento, 148-3º «1200-821 LISBOA'21 / 393/0039Tel: 213928400Fax: 213976832PRIVACY LINEwww.enpd.ptBusiness days from 10 am to 1 pmWhat are you looking for?Jr
