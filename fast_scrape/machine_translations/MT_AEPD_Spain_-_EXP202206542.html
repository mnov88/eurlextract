<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject had hired a private detective (controller) to investigate a personal matter. According to the data subject, the investigation contract did not include any wording about privacy and data protection. Moreover, a request to obtain a privacy notice under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a> had been ignored by the controller. On 19 May 2022, the data subject lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (DPA), claiming general lack of information around the controller's data processing activities in violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR.</a> The DPA started an investigation and found that the contract between the data subject and controller contained a URL of a website. In turn, this website contained a contact-form which enabled the controller to collect personal data. However, the website itself did not provide any privacy notice. The DPA also notified the controller during the investigation. However, the controller ignored these requests. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>In the present case, the DPA held that the controller was collecting personal data on its website with the contact form. However, the data subject was not given any information about the way in which their personal data was going to be processed.  Furthermore, the website did not have a privacy notice. This lack of information was in violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a>. For this violation, the DPA fined the controller €2,000 pursuant of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR" title="Article 83 GDPR">Article 83(5) GDPR</a>. The DPA also ordered the controller, pursuant to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR" title="Article 83 GDPR">Article 83(5)(b) GDPR, ⁣</a> to add the privacy notice to future contracts with its clients and to its website.

                           FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

                                            Yo
In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each

control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.


Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."



                                            II
Pursuant to article 5.1 of the GDPR, the processing of personal data must be governed by
by the following principles:


"one. Personal data will be:
    a) Treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner with the interested party (...)
2. The controller will be responsible for compliance with the provisions
in paragraph 1 and able to prove it”


One of the manifestations of the principle of transparency is the right that the GDPR
grants the owners of the data to receive information and the correlative obligation that
requires the data controller to provide the data subject with the information
detail articles 12, 13 and 14 of the GDPR.


These last two provisions contemplate two different assumptions: That the data is
obtained directly from the interested party (article 13), as in the present case,
since the data is obtained either when signing the contract, or when filling out the questionnaire
of the web page to request information, or that the data is not obtained from the
interested party (article 14).


Article 13 of the GDPR establishes:

"one. When personal data relating to him or her is obtained from an interested party, the
responsible for the treatment, at the time they are obtained, will provide you with

all the information listed below:
a) the identity and contact details of the person in charge and, where appropriate, their
representative;
b) the contact details of the data protection officer, if applicable;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/8








c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data is intended and the legal basis
of the treatment;
d) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter f), the interests

legitimate of the person in charge or of a third party;
e) the recipients or categories of recipients of personal data, in their
case; f) where appropriate, the intention of the controller to transfer personal data to a
third country or international organization and the existence or absence of a decision of
adequacy of the Commission, or, in the case of the transfers indicated in the
Articles 46 or 47 or Article 49, paragraph 1, second subparagraph, reference to the

adequate or appropriate guarantees and the means to obtain a copy of these or
to the fact that they have been lent.

2. In addition to the information mentioned in section 1, the person responsible for the
treatment will provide the interested party, at the time the data is obtained

personal data, the following information necessary to guarantee data processing
fair and transparent
a) the period during which the personal data will be kept or, when it is not
possible, the criteria used to determine this term;
b) the existence of the right to request the data controller access to the
personal data relating to the interested party, and its rectification or deletion, or the limitation

of their treatment, or to oppose the treatment, as well as the right to portability
of the data
c) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter a), or article
9, paragraph 2, letter a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent in
at any time, without affecting the legality of the treatment based on the

consent prior to its withdrawal;
d) the right to file a claim with a control authority;
e) if the communication of personal data is a legal or contractual requirement, or a
necessary requirement to sign a contract, and if the interested party is obliged to provide
personal data and is informed of the possible consequences of not

provide such data;
f) the existence of automated decisions, including profiling, to which
referred to in Article 22, paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, information
significant about the applied logic, as well as the importance and consequences
provisions of said treatment for the interested party.


3. When the person responsible for the treatment plans the subsequent processing of data
personal information for a purpose other than that for which it was collected, will provide the
data subject, prior to said further processing, information about that other purpose
and any additional information pertinent under section 2. 4. The
provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply when and to the extent

that the interested party already has the information.”

Recitals 39 and 60 of the GDPR help to specify the scope of the right
of information that is given to the interested parties.


Recital 39 establishes: "All processing of personal data must be lawful and
loyal. It must be completely clear to natural persons that they are being collected,
using, consulting or otherwise processing personal data that
concerned, as well as the extent to which said data is or will be processed. The beginning

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/8








of transparency requires that all information and communication related to the treatment of
said data is easily accessible and easy to understand, and that language is used
simple and clear. This principle refers in particular to the information of the

interested parties on the identity of the person responsible for the treatment and the purposes of the treatment and
to the information added to guarantee a fair and transparent treatment with
regarding the natural persons affected and their right to obtain confirmation and
communication of personal data concerning them that are subject to
treatment. Natural persons must be aware of the risks,
rules, safeguards and rights relating to the processing of personal data,

as well as how to assert your rights in relation to the treatment. In
In particular, the specific purposes of the processing of personal data must be
explicit and legitimate, and must be determined at the time of collection. [...].”

Recital 60 clarifies that "The principles of fair and transparent treatment

require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the processing operation and
their ends. The data controller must provide the interested party with all
additional information is necessary to guarantee fair treatment and
transparent, taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which
process personal data. The interested party must also be informed of the existence
profiling and the consequences of profiling. if the data

data are obtained from data subjects, they must also be informed whether they are
obliged to provide them and of the consequences in case they did not do so.”

In the present case, from the claim presented by the claiming party, it is inferred
that you were not informed of the way in which your personal data would be processed.

Likewise, it is verified that on the web page ***URL.1 there is at least one form
collection of personal data without containing any information related to the policy
applicable privacy

                                            II

Article 83.5 of the GDPR under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of
administrative fines” provides:

Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the

the highest amount:
       (…)
       b) the rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22;
       (…)”


In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 "Infractions" establishes that
"The acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4,
5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result
contrary to this organic law”.

h) The omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the processing of their data
personal in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU)
2016/679 and 12 of this organic law.”


                                          IV.
For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount
considers that it is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed according to the criteria that
establishes article 83.2 of the GDPR.


Likewise, it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the
criteria established in section 2 of article 76 "Sanctions and corrective measures"
of the LOPDGDD.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the GDPR and the
Article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the offense committed by violating the

established in article 13 of the GDPR, allows a penalty of €2,000 (two thousand

considered as an administrative offense in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR,
classified as an infraction in its article 83.5 and 83.6, being able to motivate such conduct the
opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.


                                          SAW
