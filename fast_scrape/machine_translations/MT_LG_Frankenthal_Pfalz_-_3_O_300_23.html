<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subjects are tenants in a house which an estate agent (data processor) was commissioned to sell by the owners (controllers). 
</p><p>On 11 August 2022, pictures of the interior were taken by the data processor's employees at an appointment with the data subjects while present, inviting the employees in. These pictures were published under a sales advertisement on a real estate website and included in a printed exposé that was handed out to prospective buyers during viewing appointments. 
</p><p>Following the publication, the data subjects were approached by persons about the pictures of their living quarters, causing them to feel exposed and observed.
</p><p>On 12 January 2023, the controllers were requested by the data subjects to provide information about the storage of the pictures and to submit proof of a declaration of consent to the taking of the pictures by the data subjects. The same was requested of the data processor on 13 February 2023.
</p><p>The data processor was also requested to pay pre-trial legal fees of €659,74 by 24 February 2023. On 03 March 2023, the processor rejected the data subjects' claims, citing the immediate deletion of the pictures that had taken place since finding out the data subjects felt uncomfortable by them.
</p><p>The data subjects alleged that the processor took the pictures in question without their consent. The publication and resulting "unmasking" caused the subjects non-material damages that cannot be compensated by simply deleting the pictures. Therefore, they claim the processor is obligated to provide information and pay appropriate compensation for pain and suffering. 
</p><p>They requested that the data processor be ordered to provide information about the pictures taken as well as whether and to what extent digital and/or analog copies of pictures on which the data subjects can be recognized in the property were made and where these are stored, that the processor be forced to provide verifiable evidence of this. They also requested a copy of personal data is held and for what it is used, as well as who is receiving the data. The data subjects request the processor pay appropriate damages in the amount of €1,000 with interest, plus a further €766.36 plus interest for out-of-court legal proceedings costs.
</p><p>The processor requested the case to be dismissed. They claimed that the data subjects consented to the taking of pictures. After receipt of the letter from 12 January 2023, all pictures were allegedly immediately deleted and no copies exist according to the processor. They allege the data subjects have no claim for damages as a result of their consent.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>First, the court decided that the processor has violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR#3" title="Article 7 GDPR">Article 7(3) GDPR</a> by failing to inform the data subjects of the right to withdraw their consent, but that no further violations have occurred. It pointed out that the obligation to provide information about the right of withdrawal is not a genuine prerequisite for the effectiveness of consent, so a breach of instruction does not mean that the consent should be considered invalid from the beginning.

</p>
<pre>Guiding Principle

1. A negative response may constitute information within the meaning of Art. 15 (1) GDPR. (para. 29)

2. The granting of consent pursuant to Art. 4 No. 11 GDPR does not have to be in writing or explicitly and can therefore also be implied. Such a case arises when the tenants of a semi-detached house allow the employees of a real estate agent appointed by the owner into the property they occupy so that they can take photographs of the interior for the sale of the house. (para. 38)

3. Despite the standard's heading "Conditions for Consent," the obligation to provide information about the right of withdrawal is not a genuine prerequisite for the effectiveness of consent. A breach of the instructions does not mean that the consent should be considered invalid from the outset, or that the consent should be considered invalid due to a teleological reduction ex tunc. (para. 40)

4. The plaintiffs' statement that they were "unmasked" by the publication of the photos, which resulted in a vague feeling of being observed, is not sufficient, in this general form, to demonstrate personally distressing consequences of the data protection violation to justify a claim for damages. Insufficient evidence of an objective nature has been presented to reflect the plaintiffs' corresponding feelings, which, moreover, are not even remotely described. (para. 50)

Opinion

1. The action is dismissed.

2. The plaintiffs shall bear the costs of the litigation.

3. The judgment is provisionally enforceable. The plaintiffs can avert the defendant's enforcement by providing security in the amount of 110% of the amount enforceable under the judgment, unless the defendant provides security in the amount of 110% of the amount to be enforced prior to enforcement.

Facts

Paragraph 1

The plaintiffs are seeking information from the defendant and damages arising from an alleged data protection violation.

Paragraph 2

The plaintiffs are tenants of the semi-detached house XXX, which the defendant was commissioned to sell by the owners. In preparation for the sale of the property, photographs of the interior were taken by defendant's employees at an appointment agreed upon with the plaintiffs on August 11, 2022, in their presence. These photographs were subsequently published under a corresponding sales advertisement on the "Immoscout" website and included in a printed exposé that was handed out to prospective buyers during viewing appointments. Following the publication of the sales advertisement with the corresponding photographs, the plaintiff was approached by persons, some of whom she knew and some of whom she did not know, about the photos and her living quarters, which is why the plaintiffs now feel exposed and a vague feeling of being observed has developed. In a letter dated January 12, 2023, from the plaintiffs' legal representatives, the owners were initially requested, and then, in a letter dated February 13, 2023, the defendant was also requested to provide information about the storage of the photographs taken of the interior premises and to submit a declaration of consent to the taking of the photographs by the plaintiffs. The defendant was also requested to pay pre-trial legal fees of €659.74 by February 24, 2023. In a letter dated March 3, 2023, from the defendant's legal representatives, the defendant rejected the plaintiffs' claims, citing the immediate deletion of the photographs.

Paragraph 3

The plaintiffs claim that the defendant took the photographs in question without their consent. The publication of the photographs and the resulting unmasking caused the plaintiffs non-material damages that cannot be compensated by simply deleting the photographs. Therefore, the defendant is obligated to provide information and pay appropriate compensation for pain and suffering.

Paragraph 4

In the action served on the defendant on October 25, 2023, the plaintiffs request:

Paragraph 5

1. that the defendant be ordered to provide information about the images taken of the interior of property XXX, as well as whether, and if so, to what extent, digital and/or analog copies were made and where these are stored;

Paragraph 6

2. that the defendant be ordered to provide verifiable evidence of this;

Paragraph 7

3. that the defendant be ordered to provide information about all original recordings and/or copies in its direct or indirect possession, as well as (electronic) copies and other media, including existing printouts or other visually or audiovisually perceivable items on which the plaintiffs can be recognized in property XXX;

Paragraph 8

4. that the defendant be ordered to provide information about whether it has any personal data concerning the plaintiffs. within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 2 GDPR.

Paragraph 9

If so, the defendant is to be ordered to provide information about:

Paragraph 10

a. which personal data concerning the plaintiffs the defendant processes (e.g., surname, first name, address, date of birth, occupation, medical findings, images, audio, video data, etc.),

Paragraph 11

b. for what purpose and for what purposes the defendant processes this data,

Paragraph 12

c. where this data concerning the plaintiffs originates,

Paragraph 13

d. whether the defendant transmits this data to third parties or plans to transmit it to third parties, if so, to whom, when and for what purpose and for what purposes,

Paragraph 14

e. how long the defendant processes the personal data concerning the plaintiffs,

paragraph 15

f. whether the defendant has created a profile of the plaintiffs; if so, to order the defendant to provide the plaintiffs with information about the content of this profile and the manner in which this profile was created,

paragraph 16

g. whether the defendant processes the data concerning the plaintiffs using further automated decision-making; If so, the defendant should be ordered to provide information on the relevant information regarding the logic involved, as well as the scope and intended effects of the procedure(s) used.

Paragraph 17

5. The defendant should be ordered to provide the plaintiffs with a copy of the personal data stored by it free of charge.

Paragraph 18

6. The defendant should be ordered to pay appropriate damages – at the discretion of the court – in the amount of EUR 1,000, with interest at five percentage points above the respective base interest rate since the action was brought.

Paragraph 19

7. The defendant should be ordered to pay the plaintiffs a further EUR 766.36 – costs of out-of-court legal proceedings – plus interest thereon at five percentage points above the respective base interest rate since the action was brought.

Paragraph 20

The defendant requests that

Paragraph 21

the action be dismissed.

Paragraph 22

The defendant claims that the plaintiffs consented to the taking of photographs. After receipt of the letter dated January 12, 2023, all photographs were immediately deleted; no copies exist. Therefore, the information was provided in full. The plaintiffs have no claim for damages as a result of their consent.

Paragraph 23

The court took evidence by examining witnesses XXX and XXX. For the results of the evidence, reference is made to the minutes of the oral hearing of April 30, 2024. Furthermore, for further details of the facts and issues in dispute, reference is made to all exchanged written submissions, including attachments, and the entire remaining contents of the file.

Reasons for the Decision

Paragraph 24

The admissible action is unfounded.

I.

Paragraph 25

The plaintiffs have no claim against the defendant for the provision of information or photocopies, nor a claim for damages.

1.

Paragraph 26

The plaintiffs have no claim against the defendant for the provision of information pursuant to Art. 15 (1) GDPR, since the defendant, in the letter dated March 3, 2023, attached to the file as Exhibit K2, and the statement of defense dated November 21, 2023, provided negative information to the effect that after the deletion of the disputed photographs of the interior of the property occupied by the plaintiffs, no further data relating to the plaintiffs would be stored, which is why the claim to the provision of information (claims 1 to 5) has been fulfilled pursuant to Section 362 (1) of the German Civil Code (BGB).

Paragraph 27

The fact that, in the plaintiff's opinion, the defendant's information is incorrect does not preclude fulfillment of the claim.

Paragraph 28

A claim for information is generally fulfilled within the meaning of Section 362 (1) of the German Civil Code (BGB) if, according to the debtor's declared intention, the information represents the entire amount owed. If the information is provided in this form, any possible inaccuracy in its content does not preclude fulfillment. The suspicion that the information provided is incomplete or incorrect cannot justify a claim to more extensive information. Therefore, essential for fulfilling the claim for information is the – possibly implied – declaration by the party obliged to provide information that the information is complete (see Federal Court of Justice, judgment of June 15, 2021, case no. VI ZR 576/18; Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf, judgment of March 9, 2023, case no. 16 U 154/21).

Paragraph 29

These requirements are met in this case. From the defendant's written submissions, in particular the defendant's statement of defense dated November 21, 2023, it can be inferred that the information provided is the information owed in its entirety and that it is complete. In this regard, even according to the wording of Article 15(1)(1) GDPR, a negative response, as in the present case, can constitute corresponding information (Steinrötter, in: Beck OK IT-Recht, 13th Edition, as of January 1, 2023, Article 15 GDPR, para. 14; Franck, in: Gola/Heckmann, GDPR, 3rd Edition 2022, Article 15, paras. 5 et seq.).

Paragraph 30

The fulfillment of the claim covers not only the plaintiffs' requests under points 1, 3, and 4, but also the requests under points 2, 4, letters a) to g), as well as the request under point 5, since the defendant has expressed through the negative information that it is only obliged to provide the information required by Article 15 (1) sentence 1 GDPR, stating that no personal data of the plaintiff is processed by the defendant (Bienemann, in: Sydow/Marsch, GDPR, 3rd ed. 2022, Article 15, para. 23 with further references).

2.

Paragraph 31

Furthermore, the plaintiffs have no claim against the defendant for payment of compensation for pain and suffering in the amount of at least €1,000.00 pursuant to Article 82 (1) GDPR (claim under section 6).

Paragraph 32

Although, according to Article 82 (1) GDPR, every person has a right to compensation for damages against the controller or processor if they have violated the provisions of the GDPR, such a claim under Article 82 (1) GDPR requires, on the one hand, a relevant violation of the Regulation, but this is not sufficient; rather, specific non-material damage must also be demonstrated and proven.

Paragraph 33

Although a violation of the provisions of the GDPR can be established in the present case, this violation has not been causal for the plaintiffs' alleged non-material damage. Furthermore, there is also no evidence of actual non-material damage suffered by the plaintiffs.

a)

Paragraph 34

In this case, the defendant has only violated Article 7 (3) sentence 3 GDPR; no further violations have occurred.

(1)

Paragraph 35

The defendant has not, first of all, violated Article 6 (1) subparagraph 1 letter a) GDPR in conjunction with Article 7 (1) GDPR, since the plaintiffs validly consented to the processing of personal data, namely the taking of photographs of the interior of the property occupied by the plaintiffs, and the violation of Article 7 (3) sentence 3 GDPR does not retroactively invalidate the consent given by the plaintiffs.

Paragraph 36

The plaintiffs initially gave their consent to the taking of photographs of the interior of the property in question in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR.

Paragraph 37

According to Article 4 (11) GDPR, consent within the meaning of the GDPR is any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes in the form of a statement or other unambiguous affirmative action by which they signify their agreement to the processing of personal data concerning them. Consent need not be given in writing or explicitly; Rather, according to the wording of Art. 4 No. 11 GDPR, this consent can also be given through another unambiguously confirmatory act, i.e., impliedly (see Steinrötter, in: BeckOK IT-Recht, 13th Edition, as of July 1, 2023, Art. 7 GDPR, paras. 10 et seq.). However, it must be given for a specific case, prior to data processing, and must be given by the consenting party in an informed manner, assuming a reasonably well-informed, situationally attentive, and circumspect user (Steinrötter, op. cit., para. 12).

Paragraph 38

The plaintiffs have given such consent in this case. They allowed the defendant's employees into the property they occupied so that they could take photographs of the interior. In doing so, they implicitly and unambiguously expressed their intention that the taking of photographs was covered by their consent. The plaintiffs confirmed this during their briefing before the court. The plaintiffs also stated that it was clear that the photographs were intended for the sale of the house. In this respect, the plaintiffs also gave their consent knowing that the photographs would be made available to third parties in the context of the sale of the property in dispute, i.e., for a specific case, which in this respect also corresponds to general life experience. They therefore also consented to the taking of photographs in an informed manner. The plaintiffs therefore consented to the collection and use of photographs as personal data.

Paragraph 39

Despite the plaintiffs' consent, the defendant – regardless of the disputed instruction to the plaintiffs regarding such data processing – did not in any event inform them of the plaintiffs' right to withdraw their consent to data processing at any time in accordance with Article 7 (3) (3) GDPR. Although witness XXX stated that he had instructed the plaintiffs that they could refuse to take photographs of the interior of the property, this does not constitute sufficient instruction, regardless of the credibility of witness XXX's testimony or his credibility, since the instruction merely stated that the plaintiffs could refuse to take the photographs before they were taken, but not that they could subsequently withdraw their distance at any time.

Paragraph 40

However, this violation does not imply, as is sometimes argued in the literature, that the plaintiffs' consent should be considered invalid from the outset or that the consent should be considered invalid as a result of a teleological reduction ex tunc (Steinrötter, loc. cit., para. 29; at least in the case where no information is provided before the start of data processing, see Klement, in: Simitis/Hornung/Spiecker, Datenschutzrecht, 1st ed. 2019, para. 95). In this respect, the court is of the opinion that the obligation to provide information about the right of withdrawal is not a genuine prerequisite for the validity of consent, despite the provision's heading "Conditions for Consent" (Ernst, ZD 2020, 383; Buchner/Kühling, Kühling/Buchner, GDPR BDSG 4th ed. 2024, Art. 7 para. 40b). Especially with regard to Art. 7 (2) GDPR, which provides for an explicit legal consequence in the event of a violation of the separation and transparency requirement, such a legal consequence is not specified in Art. 7 (3) GDPR (Heckmann/Paschke, in: Ehmann/Selmayr, General Data Protection Regulation, 3rd ed. 2024, Art. 7, para. 94; Ernst, op. cit.). Furthermore, if the assumption were otherwise, the possibility of implied consent, explicitly provided for in Art. 4 No. 11 GDPR, would be deprived of any practical possibility (see also Ernst, op. cit.), which cannot be the intention of the legislature. In addition, there is a risk of overloading the declaration of consent to such an extent that there is a risk of violating the transparency requirement of Article 5 (1) (a) GDPR, which in turn would render the consent invalid. Taking further account of the consequences with regard to declarations of consent made in the past, which almost never contained corresponding instructions on the right of withdrawal and would therefore be invalid in their entirety (Ernst, loc. cit.), the Court therefore concluded that the consent given by the plaintiffs remains valid.

(2)

Paragraph 41

The defendant has also not violated the provisions of Article 17 (1) (b) and (2) GDPR in conjunction with Article 19 (1) GDPR.

Paragraph 42

The defendant has, in principle, not yet fully satisfied the asserted right to erasure. Witness XXX stated – in agreement with witness XXX – that the photographs in question were immediately deleted from the real estate portal Immoscout following a letter from his lawyer dated January 12, 2023, and, according to further information from witness XXX, also from the defendant's computers. However, it remained unclear whether witness XXX, who took the photographs, had also deleted them from his iPhone's iCloud, or whether he was even using them. Whether a deletion was carried out that complies with the requirements of Art. 17 GDPR, which requires deletion in such a way that neither the controller nor a third party can access, read or process existing data (Worms, in: Wolff/Brink/v.Ungern-Sternberg, BeckOK Datenschutzrecht, 47th Edition, as of August 1, 2023, Art. 17, para. 55; Herbst, in: Kühling/Buchner, op. cit., Art. 17, para. 37), which also applies to all data storage devices and backup copies (Herbst, op. cit., para. 42; Worms, op. cit., para. 55), could therefore not be confirmed by the examination of the witnesses. Furthermore, the defendant would not have fulfilled its obligation under Article 17 (1) (b) in conjunction with Article 19 (1) GDPR, since it did not notify the prospective property buyers, as recipients within the meaning of Article 19 (1) in conjunction with Article 4 (9) GDPR, to whom a printed exposé was handed out during the property viewing, of the deletion of the photographs in question, which – according to witness XXX's estimate of ten to fifteen prospective buyers – would not have involved disproportionate effort.

Paragraph 43

However, the defendant has no claim to deletion, since no effective revocation of the consent granted has yet taken place. According to Art. 17 (1) (b) GDPR, the controller is only obligated to immediately delete the personal data of a data subject if the data subject revokes his or her consent and there is no other legal basis for the processing. In this respect, the declaration of revocation is lacking.

Paragraph 44

In this case, it is not apparent from the letters submitted to the court by the plaintiff's legal representative (Exhibits K3, K5, and K7), nor from the content of the statement of claim, that the plaintiffs actually declared or intended to declare the revocation of their consent. The relevant letters, as well as the statement of claim, merely asserted a right to information and demanded the submission of a declaration of consent. The assertion of a right to information is not, by its very wording, synonymous with a declaration of revocation, and it is not a necessary consequence of asserting a right to information that a subsequent declaration of revocation is made. Rather, the declaration of revocation may be waived even after the information has been provided. Furthermore, especially with regard to the plaintiffs' legal representation, the assertion of the aforementioned rights to information and submission cannot be considered an implied declaration of revocation. The fact that the defendant assumed, upon receipt of the plaintiff's letter dated January 12, 2023, that the plaintiffs had declared their revocation of consent and, consequently, assumed that they, in turn, were obligated to delete the photographs taken, also does not constitute a valid declaration of revocation by the plaintiffs. According to the principle of "falsa demonstratio non nocet," it is not detrimental if the declarant and the recipient of the declaration agree on a certain content of the declaration that was not actually declared. However, these principles are not applicable in this case, since the plaintiffs, both in their out-of-court letters and in the statement of claim, did not intend to declare any revocation at all, since, in the plaintiff's view, such a declaration no longer needed to be made due to the lack of consent. Therefore, in the present situation, there is no consistent declaration of the content of the declaration by the parties. Consequently, it remains to be determined that the plaintiffs have not declared an effective revocation of their implied consent.

Paragraph 45

There was no need for the court to issue a notice pursuant to Section 139 (2) Sentence 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure in this regard, since even a revocation declared now would only have ex nunc effects and could not thereby establish a past violation of Article 17 GDPR by the defendant.

b)

Paragraph 46

Furthermore, the plaintiffs have not suffered any material damage.

Paragraph 47

With regard to the violation of Article 7 (3) Sentence 3 GDPR, the plaintiffs' claim for damages for pain and suffering fails because the violation was not causal for the plaintiffs' alleged damage. For causality to exist, it would have been necessary to demonstrate that the plaintiffs would have already exercised their right of revocation at an earlier point in time had they been properly informed by the defendant of the existence of such a right. There is a complete lack of any corresponding submission in this regard. Furthermore, there was no need for a corresponding court notice, since, taking into account the plaintiffs' own statements at the oral hearing on April 30, 2024, it cannot be assumed that a revocation would actually have been declared earlier. The plaintiffs stated that when the photographs were taken, they had consented to their creation and their subsequent use for the purpose of selling the house, and that they were only alarmed by strangers viewing their living spaces after being approached by several people, both known and unknown to them. In this respect, the decisive reason for the plaintiffs' decision to refrain from publishing the photographs of their premises was the approach by third parties about their living situation, which is why a revocation would not have been made up to that point anyway. Furthermore, it is also unclear what specific damage the plaintiffs are alleged to have suffered as a result of the delayed – in fact, non-existent – declaration of revocation.

Paragraph 48

Regardless of this, the plaintiffs ultimately failed to demonstrate that they suffered any material or non-material damage at all. According to recent case law of the European Court of Justice, it is not sufficient for the controller to merely violate the provisions of the GDPR, since the existence of material or non-material damage is also a prerequisite for the existence of a claim for damages according to the wording of Article 82(1) GDPR (ECJ, judgment of April 11, 2024, case C-741/21; previously also ECJ, judgment of May 4, 2023, case C-300/21).

Paragraph 49

Therefore, a conclusive demonstration of non-material damage going beyond the data protection breach in the form of personal and/or psychological impairment due to the data protection breach is required. Personal and psychological impairments, unless – as in this case – pathological disorders are alleged, are internal processes. The existence of internal facts that are only partially accessible to proof can only be inferred indirectly from evidence that is generally based on external facts. With regard to the subjective consequences of a data protection violation in an individual case, it is therefore sufficient, but also necessary, for the affected person to explain the circumstances in which their experienced feelings are reflected and that, based on their life experience, the data protection violation and its consequences influence their subjective perceptions (Higher Regional Court of Hamm, judgment of August 15, 2023, case no. 7 U 19/23 with further references).

Paragraph 50

In this regard, the plaintiffs have failed to provide a sufficient explanation of the damages. The plaintiffs' statement that they were, so to speak, "unmasked" by the publication of the photos, which gave rise to a vague feeling of being observed, is not sufficient in this general form to demonstrate personally burdensome consequences of the data protection violation, because it does not provide sufficient evidence of an objective nature that reflects the plaintiffs' corresponding feelings, which, moreover, are not even remotely described (cf. on the requirement of a concrete statement regarding non-material damage in alleged violations of the GDPR (here in relation to scraping cases), for example, Higher Regional Court of Bremen, decision of July 16, 2021, case no. 1 W 18/21; Higher Regional Court of Hamm, loc. cit.; Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart, judgment of November 22, 2023, case no. 4 U 20/23; Higher Regional Court of Cologne, judgment of December 7, 2023, case no. 15 U 108/23; Higher Regional Court of Dresden, judgment of December 5, 2023, case no. 4 U 1094/23). The court had also expressed concerns in this regard during the discussion with the parties at the oral hearing on April 30, 2024, citing the case law of the European Court of Justice. The fact that this was not recorded in the minutes is merely an oversight.

3.

Paragraph 51

Due to the lack of a principal claim, there is no claim to interest or reimbursement of pre-trial legal costs.

II.

Paragraph 52

The decision on costs is based on Section 91 (1) Sentence 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO). The ruling on provisional enforceability follows from Sections 708 No. 11 and 711 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

Paragraph 53

Order

Paragraph 54

The value in dispute is set at €5,100.00.
