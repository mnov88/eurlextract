<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The Dutch DPA ('AP') received a notification on 11 January 2019 that CP&amp;A processes the health data of its employees. From this notification, the AP concluded that CP&amp;A maintained an online register, containing data on the cause of absenteeism in its employees. In response, it launched an own volition investigation into CP&amp;A's compliance with Article 9, as well as Article 32 GDPR. Since Article 9 GDPR prohibits the processing of special categories of data, including health data, it was necessary for the AP to determine whether one of the exceptions outlined in Article 9 applies. The AP also sought to determine whether whether CP&amp;A had taken sufficient technical and organisational measures to ensure a risk-appropriate level of security for the health data under Article 32 GDPR. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AP's investigation found that the relevant online register included employees' names, addresses, email addresses and social security number, which made employees directly identifiable. The register also included employees' reasons for absence (concerning both physical and mental health), including the names of illnesses, specific symptoms, and indications of pain. This constituted health data within the meaning of Article 4(15) GDPR. By digitally storing, updating, and making this data available, CP&amp;A was processing health data.  
</p><p>The AP considered whether CP&amp;A could process health data in line with the exception established by Article 9(2)(b), whereby processing is necessary for the carrying out of the controllers rights or obligations in the field of employment, so far as this is authorised by Union or member state law. In the Netherlands, Article 30(1) of the UAVG stipulates that the processing of personal data concerning health is permitted if this is necessary for the reintegration or guidance of employees in connection with illness or disability. With respect to this reintegration, further details are provided in the Section 658a(2) of the Dutch Civil Code, which requires employees to take the necessary measures to enable a sick employee to perform their work as soon as possible. 
</p><p>The AP found that the processing of the names of illnesses, specific symptoms, and indications of pain is not necessary for the reintegration of employees, in accordance with Article 30(1) UAVG, meaning it could not invoke the exception established at Article 9(2)(b) GDPR. Since no other exceptions were applicable, CP&amp;A's processing of the health data was considered unlawful. 
</p><p>With regards to Article 32 GDPR, the AP found that CP&amp;A's security measures concerning the online register were inappropriate. In particular, the register was accessible without any form of authentication. Given the sensitive nature of the data, the fact that the health data was processed on the internet, the CP&amp;A should have taken further measures to mitigate the risk of unauthorised access to the data.  
</p><p>On account of the violations of Articles 9 and 32 GDPR, the DPA imposed a fine of €15,000.

4. Assessment


4.1 Processing of data on health

As mentioned in Chapter 3, the AP has determined that CP &amp; A in each case from March 12, 2019

with 2May2019, a absenteeism registration in a GoogleDrive file has kept where the following
personal data of 25 (sick) employees were stated: the name, surname, the

4.3 Violation of the prohibition on processing health data

4.3.1 Introduction
Health data falls under the special category of personal data.

Personal data that is particularly sensitive deserves specific protection because of the processing
of it can entail increased risk for fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms

        residual possibilities and implications for the type of work that the employee can still do);

    - any advice about adjustments, work facilities or interventions that the employee has for
        reintegration.

4.4 Violation of security of processing

4.4.1 Introduction

To ensure security and prevent the processing of personal data from being breached
on the AVG, the controller is required by Article 32 of the AVG
processing to assess risk and take measures to mitigate risk
measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, taking into account the situation

of technology and implementation costs set against the risks of the nature of the protection
personal data. The AP will check in the following whether CP &amp; A has an appropriate security level
used for processing the health data in her absenteeism register, such as that
was accessible through the web address.


4.4.2 Assessment
On the basis of Article 32, first paragraph, of the GDPR, the controller must apply one
technical and organizational measures to address the risk-adjusted security level

This lack of security could have been avoided by, for example, a matching one

user of the absenteeism registration can provide evidence.
considering the current state of the engineering and implementation costs, appropriate.

The AP is therefore of the opinion that CP &amp; A has infringed Article 32, first paragraph, of the AVG because CP &amp; A has

4.4.3 Conclusion
The AP comes to the conclusion that CP &amp; As controller of any case 12 March 2019

until 2 May 2019 Article 32, first member, of the AVG has violating types of
health data in her absenteeism registry and inadequate management of an appropriate security level.
