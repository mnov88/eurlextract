<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A data subject received a number of advertising emails that stated his personal data was part of an 'automated file' on a database managed by AD735 Data Media Advertising. He sent an email to the company requesting the deletion of his personal data from all such databases and cancel any further commercial communications.
</p><p>Following this first email, the data subject kept receiving automated advertising emails and sent four reminders of his request, three of which were ignored. Thus, he complained to the AEPD.

III.- On the sending of advertising emails without the consent of the
interested,

In this sense, article 21 of the LSSI provides the following:


"1. The sending of advertising or promotional communications by co-
electronic mail or other equivalent electronic means of communication that previously
have not been requested or expressly authorized by the recipients of the
themselves.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/8









2. The provisions of the preceding section shall not apply when there is a relationship
prior contractual provision, provided that the provider has obtained lawfully the

contact details of the recipient and will use them to send communications with
related to products or services of your own company that are similar
those who were initially contracted with the client.

In any case, the provider must offer the recipient the possibility of opposing the
processing of your data for promotional purposes through a simple procedure

and free of charge, both at the time of data collection and in each of the
commercial communications to direct you.

When the communications have been sent by email, said me-
The diode must necessarily consist of the inclusion of an email address

address or other valid electronic address where this right can be exercised, remain-
It is prohibited to send communications that do not include said address. "

Therefore, based on the evidence available at this time,
and without prejudice to the results of the investigation, the facts presented could lead to
ner the violation of article 21 of the LSSI, by the claimed entity, when entering

send advertising emails without the consent of the affected party.

The aforementioned offense is classified as minor in art. 38.4.d) of said norm
ma, which qualifies as such, “Sending commercial communications by email
sole or other equivalent electronic means of communication when in said shipments

the requirements established in article 21 are not met and does not constitute an infringement
serious".

In accordance with the provisions of article 39.1.c) of the LSSI, minor offenses may
be sanctioned with a fine of up to € 30,000, establishing the criteria for its

regulation in article 40 of the same rule.

After the evidence obtained, it is considered that in this case it acts as an aggravation
tea:

    - The existence of intentionality (section a), since, the claimed entity in-

        saw commercial advertising on the claimant's phone, through emails
        advertising only, without the consent of the interested party.


In accordance with these criteria, it is considered appropriate to impose a sanction on the defendant
5,000 euros (two thousand euros), for the violation of article 21 of the LSSI

                                              IV
The balance of the circumstances contemplated in the present case, with respect to the
infractions committed by the claimed entity allows setting a total sanction of

15,000 euros, (fifteen thousand euros): 10,000 euros for violation of article 17.1 of the
RGPD and 5,000 euros for violation of article 21 of the LSSI.
