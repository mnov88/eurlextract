<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 13/02/2019 AEPD received a complaint from the claimant against the entity GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL SPAIN, S.L.U. The complaint stated that an employee of the company (the Head of Occupational Risk Prevention) opened, scanned and emailed to his inmediate boss the results of medical tests of the claimant.
To clarify the facts, AEPD transferred the complaint to the company, so that it could proceed with its analysis and provide a response within one month to the information requested. Nevertheless, the company did not respond to the AEPD’s request for information. After that, due to an error in the notifications, both the claimant and the respondent were notified of the admission to process the claim. This led to the claimant  misconception that it was entitled to appeal against the admission agreement.
</p><p>In this (erroneous) appeal to the admission agreement, the company stated that the subjects involved were interrogated and that the leaked information was immediately deleted. The appeal was not admitted as the company was not in a position to appeal, but the measures taken by the company were considered.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Does opening, scanning and forwarding an employee's medical test results imply a violation of Article 32 GDPR?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>AEPD considered that the conduct of one of the employees of the respondent- the opening of the envelope with the results of the medical tests to which the claimant was subjected, the scanning of the document and its transmission by e-mail to at least one employee of the entity - infringes Article 32. 2 and 32.4 of the RGPD, an infringement punishable under Article 83.4.a of the GDPR.  
</p><p>Assessing the circumstances modifying liability, both adverse and favourable, contemplated in article 83.2 GDPR, the AEPD established the amount of the administrative fine at EUR 5,000. However, two attenuating circumstances of the Spanish Law on Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (Article 85) could be applied, which may respectively reduce the fine by 20%. The first mitigating factor is to acknowledge their responsibility within the time allowed for the submission of claims. The second mitigating factor is, at any time prior to the resolution of the proceedings, to make voluntary payment of the proposed penalty.
</p><p>On June 6, 2020, the respondent company proceeded to pay the sanction in the amount of EUR 3000 applying therefore the two previously mentioned reductions. This implied the recognition of their responsibility and the resignation to any action or appeal in administrative channels against the sanction. After these events, the AEPD decided to terminate the procedure.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>This case is interesting, as there was an error in the notification of the start of the procedure. Both the defendant and the respondent were notified. This error created a false sense that the respondent could appeal the initiation of the proceedings. The appeal was not accepted, but certain information provided by the company was taken into account (the investigation that was carried out on the company's own initiative and the fact that they made sure that the information that had been read out was deleted). These two aspects were taken as mitigating factors, reducing the amount of the fine.

He says that the head of Occupational Risk Prevention opened, scanned and
e-mailed her immediate boss, with a copy to her, the results of the
medical tests performed on him at a company sponsored examination and
not, as would have been correct, only the report issued by the Mutual with the conclusion
of fit or unfit for work. He adds that the Mutual had sent the company
claimed the result of his medical tests in a sealed envelope addressed to his
care and that their health data were also communicated to other persons in the
company as D.ª B.B.B.
The claimant explains that she has provided her services to the entity in question
as a company travel agent until 02/01/2019 and that on 15/10/2018

send it to them online and they would send it in print to the company's headquarters and
social, in ***DIRECTION.1, indicating that it had been sent by mail on
29/10/2018 so it would be close to being received.
He explained that after the conversation with the Mutual he had sent an email to
his superior officer, D.C.C., to inform him that his medical exam was
to be received at the headquarters and ask him that, since he planned

she would stop by the respondent's office to pick it up personally. She adds that
D.C.C.C. replied that they would forward your email to D.D.D., who was responsible for
prevention of occupational hazards for the company to help him.
The complainant states that on 05/11/2018, on the occasion of the visit that D.C.C.
made to the premises where she worked, she informed her that the
written medical report "but that another boss, B.B.B., already had the report of the fit
I had already gone up to the client's platform and didn't worry about it.
On 08/11/2018 reads an email received the day before sent by D. D.D.D.,
responsible for occupational hazards, to the head of the claimant, D.C.C., with a copy to her,
with which it attaches, in addition to the report of the applicant, the full result of the
medical examination photocopied and scanned in black and white.

The complainant claims that the medical information came in a sealed envelope to her
name with the indication that it was confidential and that D.D.D., after
scanned the results received, destroyed the document in which they were collected.
Attached to your claim are, among others, copies of the following documents:
- E-mail dated 05/11/2018 sent by Mr. D.D.D. "To"
prevention of occupational hazards, with a copy to the claimant, which states
as "Topic" "VR: values informational prevention-Medical recognition

Thank you."
- E-mail sent on 07/11/2018 by D. D.D.D. "for" C.C.C. with copy
to the claimant. A pdf document is attached. The text of the message is the
next: "Hi, I just got the A.A.A. report, I'm passing it on to you scanned."
- E-mail that the complainant sent on 11/16/2018 to the department of
Human Resources (HR), for the attention of F.F.F. Explain that you are writing this
email to record a very serious incident.

with the complainant apologizing and informing her that the company has
made the necessary arrangements so that all the documentation sent is
eliminated and means have been put in place to ensure that this does not happen again.
SECOND: A. In accordance with the mechanism prior to the admission to
claims made to the AEPD, provided for in Article 65.4 of the Law
Organic 3/2018 of 5 December on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of

Once the period of one month granted to evacuate the procedure has elapsed, the claimed
had not responded to the information request from the AEPD.
B. On 18 June 2009, having analysed the documentation in the file, the
The Director of the AEPD issued a resolution in the framework of E/ 7551/2019, in which she agreed
to admit the claim.
The claimant was notified of the settlement and, as a result of a
incident in the electronic management of notifications, also to the GLOBAL
BUSINESS TRAVEL SPAIN S.L.U., the claimed.
Article 65.4 of the LOPDGDD provides that "The decision on the admission or
inadmissibility, (...), must be notified to the claimant within three months".

communicates the admission agreements to the respondents.
The fact that the entity complained of was improperly notified on

was entitled to appeal the plea agreement.
The circumstances described above led the defendant to bring an action before

The Agency - as stated in resolution RR/120/2020 - chose to give
The applicant did not have the right to bring an action (ex
Article 112.1 of Law 39/2015 on Common Administrative Procedure, hereinafter
LPACAP). This Agency - having regard to the fact that it had been notified to the
the claimant's admission agreement and given that
the text of that agreement led to the erroneous interpretation that
was entitled to appeal - responded to the appeal made. The decision
The rejection of RR/120/2020 was notified to the respondent and the appellant on
11/05/2020 (date of acceptance of the electronic notification)
The appellant, now the respondent, has stated that the claimant spent the
medical examination before the Mutual on 15/09/2019 and informed his immediate boss,
C.C.C., who, given that the report would reach the company, "as soon as I received it, I
sent to Iberdrola (not to bring it to you, as the complaint says). Note that it was not
specified in the A.A.A. instructions how the shipment should be made, i.e., whether
by mail, email or other means, only to be sent to
Iberdrola".
He added that the report of the Mutua Valora arrived at the headquarters of the claimed entity
on 07/11/2019, by mail "in an envelope in the name of the entity" "so given the
emergency situation, as explained, the risk prevention manager
D.D.D., scanned it and sent it immediately, by email in the
chain of emails where the subject was being discussed and where it was, in addition to
A.A.A. ..., your immediate boss C.C.C."
The defendant has stated that after learning of the events he adopted several
measures: asked the people involved who might have had contact with the
file an explanation and immediate deletion of the information. The address of
HR of the entity requested information from the occupational risk prevention technician
who responded by email on 11/19/2018 a copy of which is provided. He adds that this
person, D.D.D.D. left the company on 26/03/2019 without specifying the reasons.
It also states that it requested information about the incident from D.C.C. employees and
D.ª B.B.B. and that the Technology Department proceeded to delete the
D.D.D. and Dª. C.C.C. terminals of the transmitted report.
The respondent annexed to its writ of appeal for reversal, among others
documents, the following emails:
- Sent by the claimant to D.C.C. on 11/05/2018:
"(...) I have contacted Valora prevención because I have received the email to

October 15 (...). I am informed in Valora that ... the medical report is not
put on the web so you can download it, but print it out and send it
to ***DIRECTION.1 for my attention. I have been told that it was printed on
last October 29th so if he hasn't arrived yet he's about to
the office. I'll let you know in case it's delivered and if you can get it to me
to Iberdrola."
- Sent by D. D.D.D. on 09/11/2018: "(...) The full report on its

Barcelona and I accidentally scanned it and sent it to him without realizing that he was
responding to an email from C.C.C. instead of her alone..."

LEGAL FOUNDATIONS
I
By virtue of the powers conferred on each individual by Article 58(2) of the GPRS, the
supervisory authority, and as established in Articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to resolve this procedure.
II
Article 58 of the RGPD, "Powers", states:
"2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers
corrections indicated below:
(…)
(i) to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to or instead of
of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of the
individual situation
(…)”
III
Article 5 of the RGPD deals with the principles that should govern the
processing of personal data and mentions among them those of "integrity and
confidentiality":
"1. Personal data shall be:
(…)
(f) processed in such a way as to ensure appropriate security of the data
including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing or

Article 5.2. RGPD adds:
"The controller shall be responsible for compliance with
provided for in paragraph 1 and capable of demonstrating it (&lt;&lt;proactive responsibility&gt;&gt;)"
Under Chapter IV, "Controller and person in charge of
treatment", the RGPD dedicates Article 32 to "Security of treatment" precept
that you have:
"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
the controller and the processor shall implement technical and
appropriate organisational arrangements to ensure a level of safety appropriate to the risk,
which in your case includes, among others:
(a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data
(b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, permanent availability and resilience of processing systems and services;
(c) the ability to restore the availability of and access to personal data quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;

The violation of article 32 of the RGPD is typified in the article
83.4 in the following terms:
"Violations of the following provisions shall be sanctioned, in accordance
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 10,000,000 Eur or,
in the case of a company, for an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of
total annual turnover for the previous financial year, opting for
the largest:
(a) the obligations of the person responsible and of the person in charge under Articles
8,11,25 to 39, 42 and 43;"
For the purposes of the statute of limitations, Organic Law 3/2018 on Data Protection
Personal and Guaranteed Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) qualifies as an infringement
Article 73(f) "Failure to take such technical and
appropriate organizational arrangements to ensure a level of safety appropriate to the risk of
treatment, as required by Article 32(1) of Regulation (EU)
2016/679
The conduct that is the subject of this complaint is specified in the opening
by an employee of the claimed entity - the head of Risk Prevention
Work - from the envelope containing the results of the medical tests carried out at
the claimant by the Mutual, which was allegedly directed to the attention of the
claimant; in scanning it and in communicating it by e-mail to other employees
of the company.
The documentation in the file provided by the claimant
corroborates that the claimant's medical report received from the
Mutua Valore was opened by D. D.D.D., scanned and emailed as

On the other hand, according to the documents provided by the claimant and the
The claim does not show that the head of the Prevention of Occupational Risks would have
known the information that was included in the document.
In addition to the above, D. C.C.C., the head of the claimant, who
as demonstrated received an email from D. D.D.D. containing as a file

I attach the document with the results of the medical tests of the affected person,
stated in the e-mail sent on 28/11/2018 that he only opened the page that
said that the claimant was fit to work on inplants and that the rest of the
document didn't get to look at it.
The Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the National Court has held
repeatedly in its resolutions, during the validity of the Organic Law
15/1999, on the protection of personal data (LOPD), that the violation of
The principle of confidentiality, insofar as it is an infringement of result, presupposes that
there has been an actual disclosure of data to a third party not entitled to

disclosure of data to third parties, if this has not been done in a way
effective and has been proven - without the mere presumption being admissible - is not
possible to charge an infringement of this nature; infringement of the duty established by the
Article 10 of the repealed LOPD and which is now covered by Article 5(1)(f) of the
RGPD.
Therefore, at this stage of the proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the
There is no evidence to attribute to the Respondent, as alleged by the
a violation of the principle of confidentiality.
The documentation in the file shows that the
The company had not implemented the criteria for action among its staff
with respect to private documents containing health data from the
employees. Furthermore, with the exception of the e-mail sent by D.C.C. at the end
November 2018, it seems that the company's personnel give the same treatment
to the report issued by the Mutual Insurance Company on fitness for work or unfitness for work
than the result of the medical tests the claimant underwent.
Article 32 of the RGPD obliges the controller to take measures to ensure that any person acting under his authority and having access
a personal data may only be processed on the instructions of the person responsible. These instructions must be based on a prior assessment by the
risk involved in each of the processing operations carried out to ensure the security of the data. This is particularly the case when the data is requested, in compliance with the

In this line of argument, recital 74 of the RGPD states that "It should be

In order to specify the amount of the administrative fine that would correspond
The provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD must be complied with,
precepts that they point out:
"Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of fines

as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damages that
have suffered;
(b) the intentional or negligent nature of the infringement;
(c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to

(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case,
as the financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or
indirectly, through the infringement."
With respect to section 83.2 (k) of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, section 76,
"Sanctions and corrective measures," he says:
"In accordance with Article 83(2)(k) of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 may also be taken into account:
(a) the continuing nature of the infringement
(b) The linkage of the activity of the offender with the carrying out of processing operations

(c) The profits obtained as a result of the commission of the offence.
(d) the possibility that the conduct of the person concerned might have led to the commission
of the infraction.
(e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the
infringement, which cannot be attributed to the acquiring entity.
(f) Affecting the rights of minors.
g) To have, when it is not compulsory, a data protection delegate.

alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, in those cases where

there are disputes between them and any interested party." 
Aggravating circumstances are taken into account
next:
- Article 83(2)(f) of the GPRS which refers to the "extent of cooperation with the
authority in order to remedy the infringement and to mitigate the possible
adverse effects". Let us recall that the respondent did not respond to the request

that it is established that service of the application has been properly effected
informative.
- Article 83(2)(g) of the GPRS on categories of character data

- The obvious link between the business activity of the respondent and the
processing of personal data, not only of its employees but also of persons
travel is managed for, as this is the business of
the company (Article 83.2.k of the RGPD in relation to Article 76.2.b of the
LOPDGDD)
The following circumstances would apply as mitigating factors:
-The one provided for in Article 83(2)(a) RGPD, which refers to the gravity of the infringement
taking into account, among other variables, the purpose of the processing operation and
the level of damages that the affected person has suffered. The purpose of the operation
