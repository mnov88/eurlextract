<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 10 November 2023, an ambulance service (the controller) transported a patient (the data subject) during a medical emergency. In the course of this operation, the controller collected personal data through the data subject's e-card. This included the data subject’s name and address. The stated purpose for this initial data collection was to provide emergency services.  
</p><p>On 11 December 2023, the controller sent a postal donation request to the data subject for paramedic training, referencing the prior emergency transport. On 26 December 2023, the data subject filed a complaint with the DPA. They argued that the data used included health data within the meaning of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR" title="Article 4 GDPR">Article 4(15) GDPR</a>, meaning the controller could not rely on legitimate interests (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(f) GDPR</a>) to further process the data. Furthermore, the processing for direct marking without consent violated the GDPR and their right to confidentiality of their personal data. 
</p><p>In a response dated 13 March 2024, the controller argued that the change of purpose was permissible under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(4) GDPR</a>. The further processing complied with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR" title="Article 14 GDPR">Article 14 GDPR</a> because said change was noted in the footer of the donation letter. Furthermore, the controller contended that no special category data (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR" title="Article 9 GDPR">Article 9 GDPR</a>) was processed.
</p><p>On 1 July 2024, the DPA upheld the complaint. It found that the further processing of the data subject’s information for the purpose of sending a donation request violated their right to confidentiality under <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=10001597">National data protection law (DSG)</a> and was unlawful under the GDPR. Strikingly, the DPA found that the data constituted personal data under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR" title="Article 4 GDPR">Article 4(1) GDPR</a> and also as health data under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR" title="Article 4 GDPR">Article 4(15) GDPR</a>. None of the exemptions under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR" title="Article 9 GDPR">Article 9(2) GDPR</a> applied, rendering the further processing unlawful under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR" title="Article 9 GDPR">Article 9(1) GDPR</a>. Even if the data in question had not qualified as health data, the DPA found that the controller had violated the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and purpose limitation under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(a) and (b) GDPR</a>; the further processing of data for a new purposes (i.e. marketing) was incompatible with the original purpose. The DPA also held that the controller failed to meet the conditions, and that referencing the new purpose only in the footer of the letter was insufficient to meet the controller’s duty as per <a href="/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR" title="Article 14 GDPR">Article 14 GDPR</a>.
</p><p>The controller appealed the DPA’s decision in full, disputing all findings.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Federal Administrative Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the DPA’s decision. However, it limited its assessment strictly to the lawfulness of the processing under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR" title="Article 9 GDPR">Article 9(2) GDPR</a>. The Court did not examine the DPA’s alternative reasoning concerning the hypothetical processing of non-sensitive personal data under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Articles 5</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">6</a>, or <a href="/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR" title="Article 14 GDPR">14 GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>The Court agreed that the controller had processed health data within the meaning of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR" title="Article 4 GDPR">Article 4(15) GDPR</a>, as the combination of the data subject’s name, address, and reference to a medical rescue operation implied information about their health status. Referring to CJEU judgments <a href="/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C%E2%80%9121/23_-_Lindenapotheke" title="CJEU - C‑21/23 - Lindenapotheke">C-21/23 (Lindenapotheke)</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C-184/20_-_Vyriausioji_tarnybin%C4%97s_etikos_komisija" title="CJEU - C-184/20 - Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisija">C-184/20</a>, the Court reiterated that health data must be interpreted broadly to include personal data from which sensitive health information can be inferred. Since no valid exception under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR" title="Article 9 GDPR">Article 9(2) GDPR</a> applied (the data subject had not given consent, and none of the other legal bases were applicable), the processing was found to be unlawful under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR" title="Article 9 GDPR">Article 9(1) GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>The Court did note, however, that the DPA’s decision was too broadly worded; while the combination of name, address, and reference to treatment rendered the data sensitive, name and address alone do not constitute health data within the meaning of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR" title="Article 9 GDPR">Article 9(1) GDPR</a>. The Court thus emphasised that only the combined context rendered the data sensitive and required more precise legal framing. Ultimately, the Court held that the controller’s processing breached the data subject’s right to confidentiality under <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=10001597">Section 1 DSG</a>, as the donation letter established a clear and direct link to the individual’s use of emergency medical services. The DPA’s decision was thus upheld.

Text

Reasons for the Decision:

I. Course of proceedings: Roman one. Course of proceedings:

The co-participating party (hereinafter referred to as the mP) was transported on November 10, 2023, in an ambulance belonging to the complaining party (hereinafter referred to as the bP). During this time, the bP collected data from the mP.

In a letter dated December 11, 2023, the bP thanked the mP for the trust placed in it "...on the way to and from your treatment..." In the subsequent paragraphs of the letter, the mP was requested to make a donation for the training of paramedics.

In a letter dated December 26, 2023, the MP filed a complaint with the Data Protection Authority, enclosing the donation letter in question dated December 11, 2023. The complaint essentially stated that the further processing of personal data for the creation of the submitted donation letter, which had been extracted from the e-card during a rescue operation, violated the GDPR, or rather, the right to confidentiality of their personal data. The MP had not given consent for this.

In a statement dated March 13, 2024, the bP justified itself by arguing that it was dependent on donations and that the data was collected for documentation purposes and for billing insurance providers. The collected data (name and address) were permissible subject to a change of purpose for sending the donation letters, in compliance with the criteria of Art. 6 (4) GDPR. The further processing was therefore legally compliant. The mP was informed of the change of purpose in the footer of the letter dated December 11, 2023, in accordance with Article 14 of the GDPR. In a statement dated March 13, 2024, the bP justified this by stating that it relies on donations and that the data is collected for documentation purposes and for billing insurance providers. The collected data (name and address) were subjected to a permissible change of purpose for sending donation letters, in compliance with the criteria of Article 6, Paragraph 4, GDPR. The subsequent processing was therefore legally compliant. The mP was informed of the change of purpose in the footer of the letter dated December 11, 2023, in accordance with Article 14 of the GDPR.

During a hearing, the MP further argued that her data constituted health data within the meaning of Article 9 (1) GDPR and was therefore not accessible to a balancing of interests pursuant to Article 8 (1) (f) GDPR. During a hearing, the MP further argued that her data constituted health data within the meaning of Article 9 (1) GDPR and was therefore not accessible to a balancing of interests pursuant to Article 8 (1) (f) GDPR.

In the contested decision of the DSB dated July 1, 2024, the DSB upheld the MP's complaint and found that the further processing of the MP's data to create a donation letter had violated her right to confidentiality. The decisive factor for this decision was that the processed data had to be qualified as "personal data" within the meaning of Article 4, Paragraph 1 GDPR and had also to be regarded as health data within the meaning of Article 4, Paragraph 15. Although the primary processing was covered by Section 1, Paragraph 2 of the Data Protection Act (DSG), the further processing of the personal health data (secondary processing) was not subject to any exceptions under Article 9, Paragraph 2 GDPR and was therefore not lawful. In the contested decision of the DSB dated July 1, 2024, the DSB upheld the mP's complaint and found that the further processing of the mP's data to create a donation letter had violated her right to confidentiality. The decisive factor for this decision was that the processed data had to be qualified as "personal data" within the meaning of Article 4, Paragraph 1 GDPR and had also to be regarded as health data within the meaning of Article 4, Paragraph 15. Although primary processing is covered by paragraph 1, paragraph 2, of the Data Protection Act (DSG), the further processing of personal health data (secondary processing) is not subject to any exceptions under Article 9, paragraph 2, GDPR and is therefore not lawful.

Even if one assumes that no health data exists (and therefore only that personal data exists within the meaning of Article 4, paragraph 1), further processing is inadmissible, since the existence of an overriding interest pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 1, letter f, GDPR alone is not sufficient; all other principles of Article 5 GDPR must also be observed. In the present case, the principle under Article 5 (1) (a) and (b) GDPR was violated, and thus the data processing in question was unlawful under Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Even if one does not assume the existence of health data (and therefore only the existence of personal data within the meaning of Article 4 (1)), further processing is inadmissible, since the existence of an overriding interest under Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR alone is not sufficient; all other principles of Article 5 GDPR must also be observed. In the present case, the principle under Article 5 (1) (a) and (b) GDPR was violated, and thus the data processing in question was unlawful under Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

The present complaint, filed in a timely manner by the bP, was directed against this decision and is essentially based on the fact that the data processed as part of the change of purpose does not constitute a special category of personal data. It was ensured that the department that processed the data had not received any of the mP's health data and only knew that she was a client of the bP. A context regarding the mP's health could not be established, and therefore the data was not health data. Since only a portion of the data set, not the entire data set, was subject to a change of purpose, the DPO misjudged the legal situation.

In the context of the DPO's alternative approach (assuming that no health data existed), Article 6 (4) GDPR must be examined. The criteria specified therein were all met, and the GS also acted in good faith. Furthermore, the mP's information about the change of purpose of her data was timely, as it was brought to her attention at the same time as further processing. Therefore, there was no violation of the right to confidentiality, and the appeal was requested. If appropriate, the appeal should be upheld and the matter referred back to the authority of first instance for a decision.

II. The Federal Administrative Court considered: Roman II. The Federal Administrative Court considered:

II.1. Findings: Roman II.1. Findings:

1.1 In November 2023, during a rescue operation, at least the name and address of the mP were recorded by the bP for billing the costs to the social insurance provider and for documentation purposes.

1.2. From this existing data set, the name and address were further processed to address a donation letter to the mP.

1.3. In the donation letter subsequently dated December 11, 2023, the printed phrase "... I would like to thank you for the trust you have placed in me on the way to and from your treatment." refers to a service previously provided by the bP in connection with transporting the mP to and from treatment.

1.4. The mP did not consent to the further processing of her data.

1.5. There was no necessity for the data processing in question to assert the mP's rights under labor or social law.

1.6. There was no regular contact between the bP and the mP.

1.7. The mP had not previously made the data in question public.

1.8. The processing of the data was not in the public interest.

II.2. Assessment of evidence: Roman II.2. Assessment of evidence:

Regarding 1.1.: The finding corresponds to the previous submissions of both parties and is conclusively derived from the available file contents and the contested decision of the DSB dated July 1, 2024.

Regarding 1.2.: The change of purpose of the data collected by the bP with regard to the name and address is evident from the file contents and is undisputed in the proceedings.

Regarding 1.3.: The finding in 1.3. This is evident from the letter from the Federal Administrative Court (BVwGG) to the Federal Administrative Court (MP) dated December 11, 2023, submitted by the MP in the proceedings, and the wording used in the first paragraph of this letter.

Regarding 1.4.: The lack of consent from the MP to the further processing of her data is evident from the MP's undisputed submissions in this regard in the administrative proceedings, and this was also the basis for the administrative decision.

Regarding 1.5.-1.8.: The above findings are based on the fact that no indications for such positive findings emerged in the proceedings.

II.3.2.1. On the legal situation in the present complaint proceedings: Roman II.3.2.1. On the legal situation in the present complaint proceedings:

Section 1 of the Data Protection Act reads in part: Paragraph one of the Data Protection Act reads in part:

Fundamental right to data protection

Section 1. (1) Everyone has the right to confidentiality of personal data concerning him or her, in particular with regard to respect for his or her private and family life, provided that there is a legitimate interest in doing so. The existence of such an interest is excluded if data is not accessible to a claim of confidentiality due to its general availability or its inability to trace back to the data subject. Paragraph one. (1) Everyone has the right to confidentiality of personal data concerning him or her, in particular with regard to respect for his or her private and family life, provided that there is a legitimate interest in doing so. The existence of such an interest is excluded if data cannot be subject to a claim to confidentiality due to their general availability or their inability to trace them back to the data subject.

(2) To the extent that the use of personal data is not in the vital interest of the data subject or with their consent, restrictions on the right to confidentiality are only permissible to protect the overriding legitimate interests of another person, and in the case of interventions by a state authority, only on the basis of laws that are necessary for the reasons stated in Article 8 (2) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), Federal Law Gazette No. 210/1958. Such laws may only provide for the use of data that, by their nature, are particularly worthy of protection to safeguard important public interests and must simultaneously establish appropriate safeguards to protect the interests of data subjects in confidentiality. Even in the case of permissible restrictions, the interference with the fundamental right may only be carried out in the mildest way that achieves the objective. (2) Insofar as the use of personal data is not in the vital interest of the data subject or with his consent, restrictions on the right to confidentiality are only permissible to protect the overriding legitimate interests of another person, and in the case of interference by a state authority only on the basis of laws that are necessary for the reasons stated in Article 8, paragraph 2, of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), Federal Law Gazette No. 210 of 1958. Such laws may only provide for the use of data which, by their nature, are particularly worthy of protection to protect important public interests and must at the same time establish appropriate guarantees for the protection of the data subject's interests in confidentiality.

However, this also constitutes health data within the meaning of Article 4, Paragraph 15 GDPR, as will be discussed later. Roman II.3.2.2.1.

II.3.2.2.2. This raises the question of whether the processed data also fall into the category of health data within the meaning of Article 4(15) of the GDPR. While the DPO affirms this after a thorough examination, this is again questioned and ultimately denied in the appeal. Roman II.3.2.2.2. This raises the question of whether the processed data also fall into the category of health data within the meaning of Article 4(15) of the GDPR. While the DPO affirms this after a thorough examination, this is again questioned and ultimately denied in the appeal.

Article 4(15) of the GDPR defines the technical term "health data" as personal data relating to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of healthcare services, and from which information about that person's health status can be derived. This term is to be interpreted broadly. This includes, for example, descriptions of conditions, findings, events, illnesses, and information on alcohol, medication, and drug use or abuse, as well as on therapies. Both current and past data are recorded, regardless of whether they are still current. The origin of the data is irrelevant (RIS-Justiz RS0132575). Article 4, Item 15 GDPR defines the technical term "health data" as personal data relating to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of healthcare services, and from which information about their state of health can be derived. The term should be interpreted broadly. This includes, for example, descriptions of conditions, findings, events, illnesses, and information on alcohol, medication, and drug use or abuse, as well as on therapies. This includes both current and past data, regardless of whether they are still current. The origin of the data is irrelevant (RIS-Justiz RS0132575).

In its landmark decision of October 4, 2024, Case C-21/23 (Lindenapotheke), the ECJ also clarified that, for example, the sale of non-prescription but pharmacy-only medicines involves the processing of health data. This understanding of the scope of Article 9 of the GDPR can therefore be seen as quite broad.

In its landmark decision of October 4, 2024, Case C-21/23 (Lindenapotheke), the ECJ also clarified that, for example, the sale of non-prescription but pharmacy-only medicines involves the processing of health data. This understanding of the scope of Article 9 of the GDPR can therefore be seen as quite broad.

Furthermore, according to the case law of the ECJ, data from which sensitive information can be indirectly derived by means of a reasoning process, deduction, or comparison also falls within the general prohibition on processing in Article 9 (1) GDPR (ECJ 1 August 2022, C-184/20). Furthermore, according to the case law of the ECJ, data from which sensitive information can be indirectly derived by means of a reasoning process, deduction, or comparison also falls within the general prohibition on processing in Article 9 (1) GDPR (ECJ 1 August 2022, C-184/20).

In this specific case, at least the following data was used for processing:

- Name of the mP

- Address of the mP and

- Information that the mP had been cared for during a rescue operation

The latter information conclusively indicates that the mP had required the assistance of an emergency service in the past, which in turn suggests that the mP had limited health. A connection between the name, address, and the fact that the mP required an emergency service is straightforward and easy to establish, since the bP explicitly referred to the service provided by the bP in her letter of December 11, 2023.

In the present case, therefore, in the court's legal opinion, this constitutes processing of health data within the meaning of Article 4, Paragraph 15 of the GDPR.

II.3.2.2.3. Pursuant to Article 9(1) GDPR, the processing of personal health data is prohibited. It must be examined whether one of the exceptions listed in paragraph 2 of the leg. cit. applies. Roman II.3.2.2.3. Pursuant to Article 9(1) GDPR, the processing of personal health data is prohibited. It must be examined whether one of the exceptions listed in paragraph 2 of the leg. cit. applies.

II.3.2.2.3a.: Consent to the processing of the personal data mentioned was not given (see finding 1.4.). Roman II.3.2.2.3a.: Consent to the processing of the personal data mentioned was not given (see finding 1.4.).

II.3.2.2.3b.: The processing in question was not necessary or required to pursue a right arising from labor or social law. There is no such connection (see finding 1.5.).
II.3.2.2.3c.: During the proceedings, it neither emerged that the vital interests of the mP had to be protected, nor that the mP would have been unable to consent to such data processing. Roman II.3.2.2.3b.: The processing in question was not necessary or required to pursue a right arising from labor or social law. There is no such connection (see finding 1.5.).
II.3.2.2.3c.: During the proceedings, it neither emerged that the vital interests of the mP had to be protected, nor that the mP would have been unable to consent to such data processing.

II.3.2.2.3d.: The file does not indicate that the MP could ever have been a member of the bP's organization, nor were there regular contacts related to the purpose of the bP's activities (1.6.). Roman II.3.2.2.3d.: The file does not indicate that the MP could ever have been a member of the bP's organization, nor were there regular contacts related to the purpose of the bP's activities (1.6.).

II.3.2.2.3e.: There is no evidence that the MP has obviously made her personal data public (1.7.). Roman II.3.2.2.3e.: There is no evidence that the MP has obviously made her personal data public (1.7.).

II.3.2.2.3f.: The initial data collection (primary processing of the data) at that time was, as the official proceedings have shown, lawful and sufficient to enable settlement with the social insurance provider. However, the further processing in question was not necessary for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for actions by the courts in the course of their judicial activities.

However, the further processing in question was not necessary for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for actions by the courts in the course of their judicial activities.

II.3.2.2.3g.: A public interest in processing the health data did not emerge during the procedure (1.8.). Roman II.3.2.2.3g.: A public interest in processing the health data did not emerge during the procedure (1.8.).

II.3.2.2.3h.: Secondary processing was not necessary for the purposes stated in Article 9 (2) (h) GDPR. Roman II.3.2.2.3h.: Secondary processing was not necessary for the purposes stated in Article 9 (2) (h) GDPR.

II.3.2.2.3i.: A public interest in processing the health data did not emerge during the procedure. Roman II.3.2.2.3i.: A public interest in processing the health data did not emerge during the procedure.

II.3.2.2.3j.: A public interest in processing the health data did not emerge during the procedure. Roman II.3.2.2.3j.: A public interest in processing the health data did not emerge during the procedure.

&#160;

&#160;

II.3.2.3.: Accordingly, none of the exceptions listed exhaustively in Article 9 (2) GDPR are met, and the further processing of the health data in question is unlawful. Therefore, by further processing the mP's health data, the bP has violated her right to confidentiality. Roman II.3.2.3.: Accordingly, none of the exceptions listed exhaustively in Article 9 (2) GDPR are met, and the further processing of the health data in question is unlawful. Therefore, by further processing the mP's health data, the bP has violated her right to confidentiality.

II.4.: In the court's legal opinion, the administrative ruling under point 1. was too broad, as the name and address data do not constitute sensitive data in themselves within the meaning of Article 9 (1) GDPR, but are nevertheless covered by the wording of the administrative decision. The ruling therefore needed to be narrower.

The ruling therefore needed to be narrower.

II.5.: Pursuant to Section 24 (1) VwGVG, the administrative court must hold a public oral hearing upon request or, if it deems it necessary, ex officio. Roman II.5.: According to Section 24, Paragraph 1, of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court must hold a public oral hearing upon request or, if it deems it necessary, ex officio.

According to Section 24, Paragraph 4 of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court may – unless otherwise provided by federal or state law – dispense with a hearing notwithstanding a party's request if the records indicate that the oral discussion is unlikely to provide further clarification of the legal matter, and neither Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the ECHR nor Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights preclude the dispensation of the hearing.According to Section 24, Paragraph 4, of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court may – unless otherwise provided by federal or state law – dispense with a hearing notwithstanding a party's request if the records indicate that the oral discussion is unlikely to provide further clarification of the legal matter, and neither Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the ECHR nor Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights preclude the dispensation of the hearing.

In the present case, the omission of an oral hearing can be based on the fact that the facts of the case were clear from the file. The Federal Administrative Court was required to rule exclusively on a point of law (cf. ECtHR June 20, 2013, Appl. No. 24510/06, Abdulgadirov/AZE, paras. 34 et seq.). According to the case law of the Constitutional Court, an oral hearing may also be omitted if the facts are undisputed and the legal issue is not particularly complex (VfSlg. 17,597/2005; VfSlg. 17,855/2006; most recently, for example, VfGH June 18, 2012, B 155/12). In the present case, the omission of an oral hearing can be based on the fact that the facts of the case were clear from the file. The Federal Administrative Court had to rule exclusively on a point of law (see ECtHR 20.06.2013, Appl. No. 24510/06, Abdulgadirov/AZE, paras. 34 et seq.). According to the case law of the Constitutional Court, an oral hearing may be omitted if the facts are undisputed and the legal issue is not particularly complex (VfSlg. 17.597/2005; VfSlg. 17.855/2006; most recently, for example, VfGH 18.06.2012, B 155/12).

Therefore, an oral hearing could be omitted.

II.3.3. On point B) of the ruling – Admissibility of the appeal on points of law: Roman II.3.3. Regarding Decision B) – Admissibility of an appeal:

According to Section 25a, Paragraph 1 of the Administrative Court Act (VwGG), the administrative court must state in its decision or ruling whether the appeal is admissible pursuant to Article 133, Paragraph 4 of the Federal Constitutional Constitution Act (B-VG). The decision must be briefly reasoned. According to Section 25a, Paragraph 1 of the Administrative Court Act (VwGG), the administrative court must state in its decision or ruling whether the appeal is admissible pursuant to Article 133, Paragraph 4 of the Federal Constitutional Constitution Act (B-VG). The decision must be briefly reasoned.

In the present case, the court has declared the appeal admissible pursuant to Article 133(4) B-VG because there is still no case law of the VwGH on the question of the interpretation of health data within the meaning of Article 4(15) GDPR and the solution to this question is of fundamental importance.In the present case, the court has declared the appeal admissible pursuant to Article 133(4) B-VG because there is still no case law of the VwGH on the question of the interpretation of health data within the meaning of Article 4(15) GDPR and the solution to this question is of fundamental importance.
