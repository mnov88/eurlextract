<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The complainant is an individual. The respondent is a property owner community.
</p><p>The Spanish DPA received a complaint about cameras that recorded the public road on the property of the respondent. The DPA contacted the company that installed the cameras, which denied the allegation that they monitored adjoining land, inside houses or private spaces.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>After an inspection of the property which determined that the cameras were  excessively directed outwards (onto public land), the Spanish DPA held that the property owners were the controllers responsible for the cameras and violated the principle of data minimisation under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(c) GDPR</a>.
</p><p>Thus, it imposed a fine of €3000 on the property owner community.

days the team of 8 cameras”.
