<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 1st of August 2022, the data subject submitted a complaint against a neighbor since he had installed a video surveillance camera on his property facing the data subject’s property, more specifically at the swimming pool, without being authorized to do so.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA considered that the data subject provided a photograph without date and time and, based on this, it was impossible to specify which was her private area on a location plan. Also, AEPD considered that the allegations were insufficient as they do not provide a proper "screen print" of what is being captured by the data controller or the specific orientation of the camera.
</p><p>AEPD highlighted that individuals can install cameras, but only on their own private property and it must be oriented towards his own private property.
</p><p>The Spanish DPA considered that the data controller had a camera system in place that was poorly oriented and deficient in terms of information signs. It was concluded that the information signs had irregularities, since it did not have an effective address to which any person can address himself.
</p><p>The Spanish DPA fined €600 the controller for installing security cameras that focused beyond his private property, violating <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(c)</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">13 GDPR.</a>
</p><p>AEPD determined the removal of the cameras in question or the reorientation of the cameras, in accordance with current legislation, so that they do not record or capture images of the data subject's private space. In addition, the controller must include an informative sign in accordance with the regulations.
