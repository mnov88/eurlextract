<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The defendant had installed a video surveillance system composed of four cameras in the building where he/she owns three apartments (of which two used for tourism activity), without asking for permission of the other people living in the building. These four cameras recorded data of personal character that had been incorporated into some type of computer file managed by the defendant. No information about the video surveillance was displayed in the building, leaving therefore the data subjects without notice. The surveillance system recorded every person passing without limitations.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Was the system put in place violating the principle of data minimization and the obligation to give information to the data subjects as per articles 5 and 13 GDPR? 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA considered that the surveillance system installed was violating the minimization principle: the fact that some of the apartments in the building are dedicated to tourist activities does not legitimize the recording of the common areas, unless by agreement of the board of owners. The DPA imposed therefore a fine of €2000 for violation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. 
</p><p>Regarding the obligation to provide information to the data subjects, as there is no informational poster that informs the people affected about the data processing, the identity of the controller and the possibility of exercising their rights, there is a clear breach of the duty of information as per article 13 GDPR. The DPA imposed thus a fine of €1000 for violating Article 13 GDPR.

     Procedure No.: PS / 00151/2020

                RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE


Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on
to the following

                                  BACKGROUND



FIRST: URBAN GUÀRDIA OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF FIGUERES (hereinafter,
the claimant) on October 2, 2019 filed a claim with the Agency
Spanish Data Protection. The claim is directed against A.A.A. with NIF
*** NIF. 1 (hereinafter, the claimed one). The reasons on which the claim is based, in its

Spanish translation, are the following:

“[…] On July 26, 2019 at 6:00 p.m., the agents of the Guardia Urbana de
Figueres with *** TIP.1 and *** TIP.2 in non-uniformed service go to the
*** ADDRESS. 1 to check what activity is carried out in this property due to

complaints from various residents of the area regarding constant entrances and exits of
different people and noises that disturb your rest.

Agents identify three people who reside on the first floor for rent:


a) A.A.A. calling himself B.B.B. […]

The agents warned that both at the entrance door of the property on the
interior as in each door of the floors 1º, 2º and 3º there were cameras of
video recording in operation. There was no informational poster […].

may carry out image processing through camera systems or
video cameras in order to preserve the safety of people and property,
as well as its facilities ”. This treatment, which is legitimized in the cause of

fulfillment of a mission public interest public interest included in the article
6.1.e) of the RGPD, must comply with the principles set forth in article 5 of the
cited European standard.

One of these principles is that of data minimization (article 5.1.c), which establishes the
The need for the data to be processed to be the minimum necessary to carry out

carry out the purpose pursued by the person in charge. In this way, the cameras
installed will only be able to capture images of public roads to the extent that they are
essential and will avoid affecting the legal sphere of rights of third parties
people without just cause, so it will not be possible to obtain images of spaces

On the other hand, individuals who use this type of device are responsible

with article 77.5 of the LPACAP, “The documents formalized by the civil servants

corresponding legal requirements the facts verified by those

Taking into account the above, the proven facts show that the
The complainant has installed a video surveillance system - alleging reasons of
security related to the tourist accommodation business that you run— in areas
common areas of the building, such as the portal and the landings of the floors. The system like this

installed violates the principle of data minimization in that the cameras in
operation capture areas that exceed those that would be covered by the
mentioned security purpose. The fact that some real estate in the building

edifice.
