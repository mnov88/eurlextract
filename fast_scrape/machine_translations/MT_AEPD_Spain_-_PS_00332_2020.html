<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>In 2016, the complainant contacted BORJAMOTOR, S.A. and objected to the processing of his personal data for direct marketing via e-mail. However, the complainant continued to receive e-mails with offers, although less frequently. 
</p><p>The complainant contacted the company on two further occasions to stop receiving emails: in November 2018 and in September 2019. During the latest unsubscribe request, the complainant used the contact form on the company's website to insist that he did not want to receive any more advertisements and to inform the company that he was going to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. The company responded to the data subject by showing its apologies. The AEPD decided to dismiss the case under the wrong impression that the situation had been rectified. However, in June 2020, the complainant received an SMS from the defendant with advertising content, so the data subject filed a new complaint with the AEPD.
</p><p>After a request for information, the company said that the complainant had received the SMS because months before he had used the contact form on the BORJAMOTOR, S.A. website to inform them about his complaint. In order to send the complainant's message correctly, it was necessary to accept the privacy policy and, therefore, the sending of electronic commercial communications.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Did the obtained a valid consent from the data subject to send him commercial communications? Is it correct to send commercial communications to a person just because they used a contact form?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD maintains that the defendant infringed the LSSI by sending commercial communications without consent. Likewise, the AEPD points out that the contact form did not meet the requirements of the GDPR regarding consent. The data subject simply wanted to communicate with the company about a data protection issue. To do so, he was forced to accept that his personal data would be processed (also) for advertising purposes. Therefore, the consent was neither free nor specific (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#11" title="Article 4 GDPR">Article 4(11)</a>).
</p><p>The AEPD decided to impose on the defendant €4000 for each of the infringements, that is, €8000 in total. Finally, the company used the system of reductions for voluntary payment provided for in the Spanish administrative law and paid a fine of €4800.

Withdrawal of consent will not affect the legality of the treatment based on the
consent prior to its withdrawal. Before giving consent, the interested party

will be informed of it. It will be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.

4. When evaluating whether consent has been freely given, it will be taken into account in the
as much as possible the fact whether, among other things, the performance of a contract,
including the provision of a service, is subject to consent to the treatment of
personal data that are not necessary for the execution of said contract ”.


In relation to these two cited articles, it should also be taken into account the
considering (32) of the RGPD, as it indicates that:

“Consent must be given through a clear affirmative act that reflects a

free, specific, informed, and unequivocal manifestation of the interested party
accept the processing of personal data that concerns him ... Therefore, the
Consent must be given for all processing activities carried out with the
same or the same ends. When the treatment has several purposes, the
consent for each of them, freely and without obligation.


For its part, article 6.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes, on the treatment based on the
consent, that: "When it is intended to base the processing of data on the
consent of the affected party for a plurality of purposes, it will be necessary that
It is specifically and unequivocally stated that said consent is granted to
All of them".


Well, in accordance with everything indicated, data processing requires the
existence of a legal basis that legitimizes it, as in this case, the execution of a
contract in which the interested party is a party (the realization of a request, a query or
a comment) through its website, in which case, the answer to the question

raised would be supported by this precept. Not so, when the shipment is
communications that do not have the same purpose as that included in the request
made, in which case the consent of the interested party is required
freely for each of the other purposes, such as, for example, the
sending advertising communications. Situation that is not fulfilled in the present

case, because to send the request or query to the entity, it must be accepted without option
to refusal that the user receives commercial communications from the claimed entity.

carry out the collection of consent through a mandatory action to receive

any type of communication, even if it is different from the purpose for which they have been

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
of greater amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.


In accordance with the indicated precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the sanction to be imposed in

with the following criteria established in article 83.2 of the RGPD:

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with
Regarding the offense committed by violating the provisions of Article 13, it allows
set a penalty of 4,000 euros, (four thousand euros).


Therefore, the total sanction to impose, for infractions in the cookie policy in
