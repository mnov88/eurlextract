<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The plaintiff is a consumer organisation registered as a qualified entity from another Member State of the European Union within the meaning <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2020/1828/oj/eng">Directive 2020/1828</a>. The respondent, and controller, is the subsidiary of Meta Platforms Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd.   
</p><p>On 14 April 2025, Meta announced, via press release and via in-app notifications and emails, that from 27 May 2025 it would start using the public content of adult users and their interactions to train its AI models in its products. 
</p><p>On 27 June 2025, the plaintiff filed a preliminary injunction application before the higher regional court (Higher Regional Court Schleswig-Holstein - OLG Schleswig). It requested that Meta stops, for the purpose of the development and improvement of AI technologies and regarding consumers in Germany, the processing of: 
</p><p>1. personal data published by users on their Facebook and Instagram accounts and personal data collected about them by third parties and transmitted to Meta on the basis of legitimate interest,  
</p><p>2. special categories of personal data published by them on the Facebook and Instagram services without their explicit consent, and 
</p><p>3. content created and shared by users on the Facebook and Instagram services for use outside of these services without providing for this in the General Terms and Conditions for the respective platform usage agreements. 
</p><p>4. in the alternative, to prohibit Meta from combining personal data from Facebook with personal data from Instagram and/or to further use personal data from Facebook and/or Instagram in other services provided by Meta without giving end users the specific choice and obtaining their effective consent. 
</p><p>The plaintiff argued that the contested data processing violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR" title="Article 9 GDPR">Article 9 GDPR</a>, as well as the prohibition of merging and the prohibition of further use under Article 5 DMA. It further claimed that no effective objection was made possible for the data subjects, especially if they were not registered users of Meta’s platforms. It also argued that data from advertising partners would also be used for the development of the AI applications.   
</p><p>On the other hand, Meta claimed that compliance with the provisions of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR" title="Article 9 GDPR">Article 9 GDPR</a> was ensured by the de-identification and tokenisation of the individual learning data sets. Obtaining the consent of users to the processing of their data for the development and improvement of AI models was disproportionate. It further claimed that the likelihood that its AI model will extract personal data from private individuals is extremely low, due to the various protective measures taken.  Lastly, Meta stated that "AI at Meta" is not a separate service, but an integrated function of all its platforms.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The court rejected the interim injunction application as inadmissible. 
</p><p>The court held that the element of urgency required for the issuance of an interim relief, under the Federal Act Against Unfair Competition (§12UWG), the Act on injunctions in consumer law and other infringements (§5 UKlaG) and ECJ case law (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&amp;num=C-465/93">Case C-465/93</a>), was absent.  The further questions of admissibility, in particular with regard to the active legitimation of the plaintiff for the injunction, and the question of the merits of the application are therefore irrelevant. 
</p><p>First, it held that it remains undisputed that the plaintiff in the injunction was already aware of the conduct complained of due to Meta’s announcements some time before it began. In particular, the processing of personal data based on legitimate interest instead of consent, the processing of special categories of personal data, the use of the content published on Facebook and Instagram to develop and improve AI technologies outside these services (like Meta’s AI application ‘Llama’), the processing of personal data of data subjects appeared in institutional profiles and that the processing would affect more people, where all known from the emails sent by Meta. Insofar as the plaintiff claimed that Meta actually uses personal data of its users for AI training, which it receives from advertising partners, it has not made this disputed allegation credible. 
</p><p>Second, the court held that the plaintiff waited for a month to file the application for a preliminary injunction after becoming aware of Meta’s alleged imminent infringement, so there was no longer any urgency with regard to the requested legal protection. The plaintiff also failed to demonstrate a valid reason as to why it waited until Meta had actually began the objectionable conduct to file the application.

Against this background, the processing of special categories of personal data covered by <a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR" title="Article 9 GDPR">Article 9 GDPR</a> cannot be processed under the legal basis of legitimate interest. It should also be borne in mind that it is not possible for data subjects to find out whether their data are being unlawfully processed in the AI’s learning data set and AI model itself.

Guiding principle

It is detrimental to urgency within the meaning of Section 12 of the German Unfair Competition Act (UWG) in conjunction with Art. 5 UKlaG if a consumer protection association, after the announcement of a practice contrary to consumer protection, waits until the beginning of the conduct complained of to apply for interim relief. Urgency no longer exists, in any case, if more than one month elapses between the announcement and the beginning of the conduct, and an application for an interim injunction would have been possible before the beginning of the conduct.

Opinion

The application for an interim injunction is dismissed.

The plaintiff shall bear the costs of the interim injunction proceedings.

Facts

Paragraph 1

The plaintiff is a non-profit foundation under Dutch law. Its statutory duties include protecting and enforcing the interests of natural persons, in particular consumers and minors, when using online services within the EU. The plaintiff is registered as a qualified entity from another Member State of the European Union within the meaning of Section 3 (1) No. 1 of the UKlaG in the European Commission's register pursuant to Article 5 (1), fourth sentence, of Directive (EU) 2020/1828 of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 25, 2020, on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers and repealing Directive 2009/22/EC.

Paragraph 2

The defendant is a subsidiary of Meta Platforms, Inc., located at 1 Meta Way, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA. It operates the social networks "Instagram" and "Facebook" on the websites "www.instagram.com" and "www.facebook.com," as well as apps for mobile devices.

Paragraph 3

It is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. It has a subsidiary, Facebook Germany GmbH, based in Hamburg. According to the defendant, this subsidiary is not involved in data processing related to the development and improvement of AI applications. Its website, https://www.meta.com/de-de/about/ (accessed on July 27, 2025), does not indicate the defendant's registered office or the location of its worldwide branches. Nor does it contain any imprint. The defendant's registered office and representatives can be found in the entry in the lobby register of the German Bundestag (see https://www.lobbyregister.bundestag.de/suche/R002238, last accessed on August 6, 2025).

Paragraph 4

According to the website https://about.fb.com/de/media-gallery/offices-around-the-world/meta-hamburg/ (last accessed on August 6, 2025), "Meta" has an office in Hamburg. An employee of the defendant from Hamburg also reported to the Senate during the oral hearing. Upon the Senate's request, the defendant was unable to demonstrate that its office in Hamburg was not a branch of the defendant.

Paragraph 5

On April 14, 2025, the defendant publicly announced in a press release – in addition to further announcements regarding data processing in connection with the development and improvement of its AI models in the period prior to mid-2024 – that it would soon begin using the public content of adult users and their interactions with artificial intelligence to train its AI models in Meta products:

Paragraph 6

"In the EU, we will soon begin training our AI models on the interactions that people have with AI at Meta, as well as public content shared by adults on Meta Products." (https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/making-ai-work-harder-for-europeans/)

Paragraph 7

(Translation: "In the EU, we will soon begin training our AI models based on the interactions humans have with AI on Meta, as well as on public content shared by adults on Meta products.")

Paragraph 8

The defendant subsequently announced this to all users on its Facebook and Instagram platforms by the end of April 2025 via in-app notifications and emails. The plaintiff also received these notifications because she herself has a Facebook account. Board member M. and the Director of Financing K. also received notifications via the Facebook app and email in April 2025.

Paragraph 9

In the defendant's emails to users dated April 17, 2025, and April 19, 2025 (see pages 4/5 of the defendant's written submission of July 21, 2025), the defendant pointed out that Meta was (already) using "public information." It undisputedly states, among other things:

Paragraph 10

[...]

Paragraph 11

"We are continuously improving AI at Meta. "AI at Meta" refers to our features and experiences that utilize generative AI, such as Meta AI and AI Creative Tools, as well as the models underlying them. We also provide models via an open platform to support researchers, developers, and other members of the AI community."

Paragraph 12

[...]

Paragraph 13

"We would like to inform you that, in order to provide these user experiences, we use public information, such as posts and comments from accounts whose owners are at least 18 years old. This includes all public information you have shared in Meta products since creating your account."

Paragraph 14

[...]

Paragraph 15

Apparently in response to these public announcements by the defendant, the Consumer Advice Center of North Rhine-Westphalia issued a warning letter dated April 30, 2025. On May 12, 2025, it applied for an interim injunction before the Higher Regional Court of Cologne (I-15 UKl 2/25) with the aim of prohibiting the defendant from processing, in the context of commercial transactions, the personal data published by consumers on the Facebook and Instagram services on the basis of the legitimate interest in developing and improving artificial intelligence systems and, alternatively, from merging this data of users from both platforms for this purpose. The Cologne Higher Regional Court rejected the application for a preliminary injunction by judgment of May 23, 2025, arguing, among other things, that, after a summary review in the preliminary injunction proceedings, the data processing intended to begin on May 27, 2025, did not violate Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016, on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC - General Data Protection Regulation), as the legitimate interest of the defendant outweighed the fundamental rights and interests of the affected consumers. Extensive media coverage of the proceedings and the judgment continued on May 23, 2025. The judgment, including the reasons for the judgment, was served on the plaintiff's legal representatives, who had also represented the North Rhine-Westphalia Consumer Center before the Cologne Higher Regional Court, on June 13, 2025.

Paragraph 16

It is undisputed that, as of May 27, 2025 at the latest, the defendant, in accordance with its announcement, processed the personal data of its adult users in public posts and comments on the Facebook and Instagram platforms, as well as their interactions with the AI functionalities in the applications for the development and improvement of its AI models.

Paragraph 17

The plaintiff warned the defendant regarding this data processing by letter dated June 13, 2025 (Exhibit ASt5), setting a deadline of June 20, 2025. After an extension of the deadline to June 23, 2025, the defendant responded by letter dated June 23, 2025 (Exhibit ASt6).

Paragraph 18

The plaintiff argues that the disputed data processing violates Articles 6 and 9 of the GDPR, as well as the prohibition on combining and further use under Article 5 of the Digital Markets Act (Regulation (EU) 2022/1925 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 September 2022 on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector and amending Directives (EU) 2019/1937 and (EU) 2020/1828). The defendant fails to provide transparent information about the use of personal data for the development and improvement of AI models.

Paragraph 19

The plaintiff claims that sensitive data and data of children are processed. There is no effective objection for those affected, especially if they are not registered users of the defendant's platforms. Only registered users of the platforms could object, and only with regard to the data they themselves published. Institutional profile owners could not object to the use of their data.

Paragraph 20

It further believes that the data processing actually commenced on May 27, 2025, goes beyond the announcement of April 14, 2025, as data from advertising partners would also be used for the development of AI applications, as is clear from the data protection guidelines effective from May 27, 2025. It was only during the oral hearing before the Cologne Higher Regional Court that it became clear which data specifically would be processed as part of AI development. Only then did it become clear that the data would also be used for the defendants' AI applications outside of the platforms.

Paragraph 21

It believes that European law does not provide for an urgency period for the application for an interim injunction, and that the period between becoming aware of a violation of law and applying for interim relief must be sufficiently long to ensure the effective enforcement of European law.

Paragraph 22

The plaintiff requests that

Paragraph 23

the defendant be prohibited by way of an interim injunction, on pain of a fine of up to EUR 250,000.00 to be imposed by the court for each infringement and, if this cannot be collected, detention of up to six months, to be served on its legal representatives, from:

Paragraph 24

in the context of commercial transactions with consumers in Germany,

1.

Paragraph 25

processing personal data published by them on the Facebook and Instagram services and personal data collected through them by third parties and transmitted to the defendant on the basis of the legitimate interest in developing and improving artificial intelligence technologies, if this occurs as set out and described in Annexes ASt2 and ASt3,

Paragraph 26

and/or

2.

Paragraph 27

processing by them on the Facebook services and Instagram without the express consent of the data subjects for the development and improvement of artificial intelligence technologies, if this occurs as shown and described in Annex ASt3,

paragraph 33

alternatively, to prohibit the Respondent from combining personal data from the Facebook platform service with personal data from the Instagram platform service for the development and improvement of artificial intelligence technologies in the context of commercial transactions with consumers in Germany.

paragraph 34

and/or

paragraph 35

from further using personal data from the Facebook and/or Instagram platform services in other services provided by the Respondent for the development and improvement of artificial intelligence technologies without giving end users a specific choice and obtaining their effective consent,

paragraph 36

if this is done as shown and described in Annexes ASt 2 and ASt 3.

paragraph 37

The Respondent requests that

paragraph 38

the application for a preliminary injunction be dismissed.

Paragraph 39

The defendant claims, among other things, that the plaintiff lacks standing to sue because it does not meet the requirements for qualified entities pursuant to Section 3 (1) Sentence 1 No. 1 of the UKlaG (United Kingdom Act), interpreted in accordance with Article 4 (3) of the Collective Actions Directive, and in particular, that there is no lack of profit-making purpose. The Senate is obligated to review the plaintiff's standing to sue pursuant to Article 5 (4) Sentence 3 of the Collective Actions Directive. It further claims that the data processing in question does not go beyond the announced scope. Compliance with the provisions of the GDPR, in particular Articles 6 and 9 GDPR, is ensured by de-identification and tokenization of the individual learning data sets. The probability that the defendant's AI model will disclose personal data of private individuals due to the various safeguards implemented by the defendant is extremely low. Obtaining users' consent to process their data for the development and improvement of AI models is disproportionate. "AI at Meta" is also not a separate service, but an integrated function of the platforms.

Paragraph 40

For further details of the parties' submissions, reference is made to the exchanged written submissions and attachments and the minutes of the oral hearing before the Senate on August 5, 2025. The Senate heard the data protection authority responsible for the proceedings in Germany, the Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, pursuant to Section 12a of the UKlaG (United Kingdom Act on the Protection of Personal Data), before making its decision.

Reasons for the Decision

1.

Paragraph 41

The requested preliminary injunction was not to be granted, as the application is inadmissible in any event.

Paragraph 42

The Schleswig-Holstein Higher Regional Court has jurisdiction over the proceedings. International jurisdiction arises from Art. 79 (2) Sentence 2 GDPR, and subject-matter jurisdiction follows from Sections 6 and 2 (2) No. 13 UKlaG. With regard to local jurisdiction, according to Section 6 (1) Sentence 1 UKlaG, the Hanseatic Higher Regional Court in Hamburg may also have jurisdiction over the proceedings because the defendant itself has a branch in Hamburg or has at least created the legal appearance of such a branch there. However, in addition to the place of jurisdiction pursuant to Section 6 (1) Sentence 1 UKlaG, the place of jurisdiction for tortious acts pursuant to Art. 7 (2) EuGVO (Brussels Ia Regulation) also applies, so that the Senate has jurisdiction over the proceedings (cf. MüKoZPO/Micklitz/Rott, 6th ed. 2022, UKlaG Section 6, marginal no. 11). Finally, a violation of rights due to the complained unlawful data processing may also occur for affected consumers in Schleswig-Holstein, i.e., within the district of the Schleswig-Holstein Higher Regional Court.

Paragraph 43

However, the urgency required under Section 5 UKlaG and Section 12 Unfair Competition Act (UWG) for the issuance of a preliminary injunction is lacking with regard to all applications for interim relief. The further questions of admissibility, in particular regarding the plaintiff's standing to sue, and the question of the merits of the application are therefore irrelevant.

Paragraph 44

The grounds for the injunction are a special form of legal interest and must therefore be examined ex officio as a prerequisite to the proceedings (see Köhler/Feddersen/Köhler/Feddersen, 43rd ed. 2025, UWG Section 12, marginal no. 2.12). To the extent that Section 12 (1) of the Unfair Competition Act (UWG) is applicable accordingly, as is the case here, it establishes a presumption of urgency according to established case law (see Köhler/Feddersen/Köhler/Feddersen, op. cit., para. 2.13). If the defendant has refuted the presumption of urgency, it is incumbent on the plaintiff to demonstrate and credibly establish the urgency.

Paragraph 45

The reason for the requirement to issue a preliminary injunction in interim relief proceedings, with their special procedural provisions pursuant to Sections 935 and 916 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), as opposed to regular legal proceedings, is fundamentally the existence of a particular urgency for the claimant. The provisions for interim relief in the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) ensure that data subjects in Germany can assert an effective legal remedy within the meaning of Art. 79 GDPR against the controller in the event of urgency (see BeckOK DatenschutzR/Mundil, 52nd ed., February 1, 2024, GDPR Art. 79 paras. 10 and 11). Interim relief serves to avert factual violations that are difficult to reverse in a timely manner (Paal/Pauly/Martini, 3rd ed., 2021, GDPR Art. 79 paras. 16-17a; ECJ, judgment of June 19, 1990, Case C-213/99, para. 21). Contrary to the plaintiff's opinion, the ECJ also considers that particular urgency is required for the issuance of an interim injunction (see ECJ, judgment of November 9, 1995 - Case C-465/93, NJW 1996, 1333).

Paragraph 46

The Senate is of the opinion that the presumed urgency of the plaintiff's request within the meaning of Section 12 of the Unfair Competition Act (UWG) is refuted by the defendant's submissions, since the plaintiff had knowledge of the conduct complained of long before the commencement of the conduct complained of through the defendant's announcements (see a.). Despite knowledge of these clear announcements, the defendant failed to seek interim relief until one month after the commencement of the announced actions. It is therefore clearly no longer possible to assume any urgency that could justify the issuance of an interim injunction (see b.).

a.

Paragraph 47

All of the defendant's conduct complained of in the applications was already the subject of its announcement of April 14, 2025, and the subsequent emails to users between April 17 and 19, 2024, and was therefore known to the plaintiff from that point onward.

Paragraph 48

It remains undisputed that the plaintiff was aware of the defendant's announcement of April 14, 2025, and that during the second half of April 2025, both itself and parts of the management board received in-app and email notifications regarding the disputed data usage. Contrary to the plaintiff's opinion, the defendant's announcements undoubtedly included the actions now challenged by the plaintiff in the application for a preliminary injunction.

Paragraph 49

To the extent that the plaintiff, through its legal counsel, pointed out at the oral hearing before the Senate that the plaintiff still does not know the extent to which the defendant uses its users' personal data to develop and improve its AI models, this could already indicate that the plaintiff's applications are unfounded, since a review of unspecified practices contrary to consumer protection can hardly be the subject of interim relief proceedings under the UKlaG. Nevertheless, the plaintiff has indicated in the applications filed which specific conduct of the defendant it objects to. However, despite the Senate's corresponding advice before the oral hearing, the plaintiff failed to explain and credibly demonstrate when the individual persons acting within the plaintiff actually became aware of announcements regarding the disputed data usage, and which considerations and decisions on the part of these persons led to the preliminary injunction being filed not as early as the beginning or mid-May 2025, but only on June 27, 2025.

Paragraph 50

Regarding the applications in detail with regard to the consistency of the announcements with the actual data usage:

aa.

Paragraph 51

Application 1 alleges that the defendant processes personal data published on the Facebook and Instagram services and personal data collected by third parties and transmitted to the defendant solely on the basis of legitimate interest, i.e., without consent, for the development and improvement of artificial intelligence technologies.

Paragraph 52

The defendant already announced this behavior on April 14, 2025, when it pointed out that it would begin training its AI models using information publicly shared by adults in meta-products. This announcement clearly indicates that this content will not only involve the personal data of the adult users themselves, whose profiles contain this information. It is clear that such an announcement will also encompass the processing of personal data of children, young people, and other third parties, as well as special category data pursuant to Art. 9 GDPR, namely in cases where such data is mentioned in public (image) posts or public comments on the profiles of adult users, or is depicted in published images of such profiles, with or without the consent of the data subjects. Although the defendant apparently took various measures, such as de-identification and tokenization of content, in the period prior to the start of the announced data processing, and partly in coordination with the competent data protection authorities, in order to increase the level of data protection of the intended data processing, according to its own submissions, it by no means effectively ruled out the possibility that personal data of unregistered users or children and young people, or data of special categories pursuant to Art. 9 GDPR, are contained in the training data sets for an AI model or in the AI model itself. Finally, the defendant itself states (written submission of July 23, 2025, pages 28 and 35) that it cannot be ruled out that the AI model could output personal data about private individuals, but only that the probability is extremely low. If the AI model can output such data, even though, according to the defendant's submission, it is programmed not to output such data, it appears to the Senate to be certain that such data is contained in the AI model itself and thus also in the training data set. It should be noted that if the AI model's output prompt is reprogrammed or if the learning dataset is evaluated using an AI model, de-identification and tokenization can be expected to be fully or partially reversed. Precisely against this backdrop, the processing of sensitive data of special categories within the meaning of Art. 9 GDPR of persons not registered as users, whose data was published on accounts by registered users without their consent, is fundamentally prohibited under Art. 9 (1) GDPR and cannot be subject to a balancing of interests under Art. 6 (1) Sentence 1 (f) GDPR. It should also be noted that, unlike with internet search engines, it is not possible for all data subjects to find out whether their data or images are being used unlawfully in the AI's learning dataset and thus possibly also in the AI model itself.

Paragraph 53

Since April 14, 2025, and up to the present day – as the Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information also pointed out in his statement at the oral hearing before the Senate – a violation, in particular of Article 9 GDPR, insofar as data of unregistered users contained in public posts, comments, and images is concerned, is likely to have occurred due to the announced and implemented conduct of the defendant and the data processing in the learning dataset and the AI model. However, this was already recognizable to the plaintiff long before May 27, 2025, and thus known to the plaintiff – especially as a professional association.

Paragraph 54

The email from the defendant dated April 19, 2025, submitted by the plaintiff itself (page 5 of the pleading dated July 21, 2025), also clearly demonstrates that the defendant pointed this out and therefore had positive knowledge that the publicly shared information was to be used on the "basis of legitimate interest" and not on the basis of consent. Users were informed of the possibility of objection, so it must have been clear to the plaintiff that this was not a "diffusely communicated" announcement, but rather a very specific intended data processing. While the data processing process was not described in detail, it was described in detail which data would be affected. It was also stated that these AI models would be used not only on Facebook or Instagram, but in other products of the defendant.

Paragraph 55

To the extent that the plaintiff argues that the institutional profiles on the defendant's platforms cannot object to the use of data for AI purposes, the defendant correctly points out that the plaintiff does not represent the defendant's interests, but rather those of consumers. To the extent that the plaintiff argues that consumer data could also have been published on such profiles without their consent and then become the subject of AI training, this should in principle be considered, but the Senate is convinced that this is also covered by the defendant's announcements by April 2025 at the latest. Thus, the email dated April 19, 2025, which the plaintiff submitted (page 5 of the pleading dated July 21, 2025), contains no indication that the data processing does not relate to the data of institutional profiles. It states:

Paragraph 56

"We would like to inform you that, in order to provide these user experiences, we use public information, such as posts and comments from accounts whose owners are at least 18 years old."

Paragraph 57

In the Senate's opinion, this also includes the content of institutional profiles, such as a kindergarten or a trade union, since it can be assumed that the natural persons responsible for registering and maintaining such profiles are adult users. The assessment would be different if the defendant had pointed out in the email that it only used the public information from profiles of "natural persons" and, contrary to expectations, had actually used the profiles of institutions. Despite the Senate's general guidance on the issue of urgency, the plaintiff was unable to comprehensibly explain and credibly demonstrate why the responsible persons at the plaintiff might have originally assumed that the content of institutional profiles would not be used for AI training, and on the basis of which facts this assumption might have subsequently changed.

Paragraph 58

To the extent that the plaintiff claims that the defendant actually uses personal data of its users for AI training, which it receives from advertising partners, it has not credibly substantiated this disputed claim. The defendant has expressly refuted this argument and argued that it does not use technical log data and personal data from third parties, which are collected about its users and then made available there, for AI training, as these are unsuitable for such purposes (page 6, para. 13, written submission of July 23, 2025). This argument is comprehensible and plausible to the Senate. The plaintiff's general statement that such use arises from the data protection guidelines (page 7 of Annex ASt2) is not suitable for establishing credibility, since such a specific use of personal data does not arise from these guidelines. Page 130 of 149 of the printout of the data protection guidelines (page 340 of the file) only provides the general category regarding the origin of all potentially processed data. Accordingly, it only informs users that the defendant generally receives and processes information about the user from third parties. This is clearly not linked to a statement that the defendant actually uses personal data of its users or other persons, which it has received from advertising partners, for the purposes of developing or improving its AI technologies.

bb.

Paragraph 59

The second motion alleges that the defendant is processing special categories of personal data published on its services without the express consent of the data subjects for the development and improvement of artificial intelligence technologies. As already explained, this very conduct was clearly covered by the announcement of April 14, 2025. The case would only be assessed differently if the defendant had announced that it did not intend to process such data as part of comprehensive data processing and then acted contrary to this announcement.

cc.

Paragraph 60

The third motion alleges that the defendant is using the content published on Facebook and Instagram to develop and improve artificial intelligence technologies outside of these services, without providing for this in the platforms' terms and conditions as of January 1, 2025. The defendant had already announced this use of content in the notification of April 14, 2025, and the subsequent emails in April 2025, as they referred to "our AI models" and explained "AI at Meta." Especially for the plaintiff, as a consumer protection association specializing in online matters, it was therefore clearly evident that this concerned not only platform-integrated AI functions, but also the AI application "Llama" of the defendant, or rather the Meta group of companies, which, as the Senate is aware, has been on the market since 2023.

Paragraph 61

The fact that, according to the plaintiff's submission, the defendant does not provide for such use in its general terms and conditions does not, in essence, constitute any conduct different from that already alleged in the motions 1 and 2. Finally, in motions 1 and 2, the plaintiff did not limit its request to AI tools and services within the two platforms, Facebook and Instagram, but extended it generally to the defendant's "artificial intelligence technologies." This thus encompasses all AI technologies and offerings of the defendant. By objecting that the defendant does not provide for such use in its terms and conditions, the plaintiff again complains that users have not consented to such use, thus, this use has not become part of the contract.

dd.

Paragraph 62

Motion 4 alleges that the defendant is combining user data from the Facebook and Instagram platforms for the development and improvement of AI technologies, does not give users a choice, and does not obtain consent to the use of the data. The announcement of this contested conduct also occurred on April 14, 2025, when the defendant announced that it would use the public content "on meta products" for "our AI models." The Senate is convinced – at least from the perspective of a consumer protection association – that this cannot be understood to mean that Facebook data is used only for Facebook's internal AI technology and Instagram data is used only for Instagram's internal AI technology. Rather, it clearly allows the conclusion that the defendant is developing a cross-platform "AI at Meta" technology using the data from all meta products, which is then embedded in the individual meta products. The plaintiff has not explained why which specific individuals within the plaintiff might have developed a different understanding.

Paragraph 63

Here, too, the defendant did not announce a more restricted use, e.g., limited to a platform-specific AI application, and then subsequently use the data somewhat beyond that.

b.

Paragraph 64

From the plaintiff's perspective, the necessary urgency no longer existed at the time the application for a preliminary injunction was filed on June 27, 2025. After learning of the announcement of the practices complained of that violate consumer protection, the plaintiff waited so long to file an application for a preliminary injunction that, from the plaintiff's perspective, there is no longer any urgency with regard to the legal protection sought.

Paragraph 65

When considering the urgency required for the issuance of an interim injunction, which is also required according to the established case law of the ECJ, neither German nor European law stipulates a specific period of time after which it can no longer be assumed that there is such an urgency that, in terms of the procedural relationship between the parties, the issuance of an interim injunction could justify it. The predominant opinion of German higher courts assumes a period of approximately one month from the date of receipt (see overview in Köhler/Feddersen/Köhler/Feddersen, 43rd ed. 2025, Unfair Competition Act § 12 paras. 2.15b, 2.15c). The beginning of the urgency period is generally based on the certain knowledge of an impending infringement, rather than the infringement itself (Higher Regional Court of Munich, judgment of June 28, 2012 - 29 U 539/12 - juris; Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main, judgment of January 17, 2013 - 6 U 88/12, GRUR-RR 2014, 82). The Senate is convinced that this would have been April 14, 2025, so that urgency could no longer be assumed at the time of the application on June 27, 2025.

Paragraph 66

However, in individual cases, a longer period may also be considered appropriate if the plaintiff presents and credibly demonstrates compelling reasons for a longer delay (see Köhler/Feddersen/Köhler/Feddersen, loc. cit.). Despite the Senate's advice, the plaintiff failed to provide such compelling reasons from the perspective of its agents. The plaintiff was unable to provide a comprehensible explanation as to why it, unlike the North Rhine-Westphalia Consumer Advice Center, waited so long to file the application in these proceedings until the defendant actually began the complained-of conduct on May 27, 2025, even after the Senate's express inquiry at the oral hearing on August 5, 2025. This clearly demonstrates that, given the plaintiff's knowledge of the potential scope of data use, even if the details of any restrictions and protective measures, as well as the technical implementation, were unknown to the plaintiff at the time or today, it would have been possible, just like the North Rhine-Westphalia Consumer Advice Center, to apply for an interim injunction against the defendant by May 12, 2025, at the latest.

Paragraph 67

This does not conflict with the guarantee of effective legal protection within the meaning of Art. 79 GDPR. It is recognized under European law that Member States must ensure the granting of effective interim legal protection to enable those affected to avert factual violations that are difficult to redress in a timely manner (Paal/Pauly/Martini, 3rd ed. 2021, GDPR Art. 79 paras. 16-17a; ECJ, judgment of June 19, 1990, Case C-213/99, para. 21). The assumption of urgency is therefore particularly obvious if the data processing in question has not yet begun.

Paragraph 68

The specific conduct of the plaintiff in this case has deliberately led to the lapse of this prerequisite for the requirement of a temporary prohibition of data processing. The plaintiff, without any comprehensible reason, not only waited until the day on which the unlawful data processing complained of by the plaintiff began, but even allowed another month to pass thereafter. Even if the data processing complained of by the defendant significantly violated the rights of consumers, the plaintiff's conduct contributed to the realization of this violation by failing to take timely action.

Paragraph 69

To the extent that the plaintiff argues that the extent of the data processing by the defendant only became clear to her or her legal representatives during the oral hearing before the Cologne Higher Regional Court on May 22, 2025, this does not justify assuming urgency to ensure effective legal protection for consumers. Rather, this very argument, and the reasons for the judgment of the Cologne Higher Regional Court also support this, makes it clear that at that time, it was already possible to examine interim relief for consumers to the extent of all issues also at issue in the present proceedings regarding data processing in connection with the development and improvement of artificial intelligence technologies. The fact that the plaintiff disagrees with the outcome of the Cologne Higher Regional Court's review neither creates a new urgency nor indicates the need to initiate further interim relief proceedings to provide effective legal protection for consumers, despite the considerable passage of time and the data already being used.

Paragraph 70

The decision regarding costs is based on Section 91 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO).
