<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA regarding the website of a football club. The DPA's investigation confirmed that controller's website required users to fill in forms with personal data but did not have a privacy policy.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA reiterated that when personal data are collected, there must be accompanying disclosures per <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a>, including identifying the means and purposes of processing, the identity and contact details of the controller, and the existence of data subjects' rights under the GDPR.
</p><p>The DPA considered as mitigating factors that (a) the controller was a small company (b) had not profited from its violations, and (c) had no prior violations; it therefore assessed a fine of €3,000 and ordered an appropriate privacy policy be added to the controller's website.
