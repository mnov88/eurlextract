<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The respondent company sent an e-mail to the claimant requesting the return of a credit. To facilitate payment, the email included a link. When the complainant clicked on the link, he had access to another customer's personal data, not his own. Specifically, the complainant was able to see the other customer's personal identification, location, financial and contractual data.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>The claim is based on the alleged security breach in the respondent's systems and the consequent violation of the principle of confidentiality in the processing of personal data by the data controller. In this regard, the respondent alleged that it did not know how the claimant could have received the link by e-mail, since it is only generated to be sent via SMS.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA (AEPD) maintains that the respondent did not adopt the necessary technical and organizational measures to guarantee the confidentiality of the information and to respect its own security protocols. This therefore breached Article 5(1)(f) GDPR and Article 32 GDPR. 
</p><p>The initial sanction for infringing Article 5(1)(f) was a fine of €5000 and the initial sanction for breach of Article 32 was a warning. However, the AEPD closed the proceedings due to the voluntary and early payment of €3000.
