<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 17 January 2022, A.A.A. (the complainant) filed an access request against ESCO EXPANSION, S.L.. On 18 January 2022, the complainant received a call informing that their request would be transferred to CAIXABANK, S.A (the controller) who was responsible for the corresponding procedure.   
</p><p>The complainant requested access to the phone call, to whose recording they could not object. In response, the controller provided only a transcript of the phone conversation. Consequently, the complainant sent another letter specifically requesting a "copy of the call".  The controller explained that the recording could not be provided and must be requested from superior instances.  
</p><p>Since the requests of the complainant were not fulfilled, on 26 January 2022, they started a claim against the controller before the Spanish DPA. The complaint was based on two grounds. First, in what format should the copy of the phone call be provided. Second, whether the controller had lawfully recorded the call.  
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>First, the Spanish DPA emphasised that the voice constitutes personal data as it renders a person identifiable and, therefore, is protected under the GDPR and Spanish law. At the same time, recordings of phone calls also contain information about third parties, which cannot be disclosed without a valid legal basis. The DPA concluded that since the controller provided a transcript of the recording, the right of access as provided for in <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15 GDPR</a> and Article 13 LOPDGDD was exercised. 
</p><p>Secondly, the DPA noted that a valid legal basis under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a> is required in order to record a phone call without the consent of the data subject. In the present case, the recording was necessary for the performance of a contract.  Hence, the recording of the phone call with the complainant was lawful and did not require their consent. 
</p><p>As a result, the DPA dismissed the claim.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW
FIRST: The Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of section 2 of article 56 in
in relation to section 1 f) of article 57, both of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of
individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and the free
circulation of these data (hereinafter GDPR); and in article 47 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD).
SECOND: In accordance with the provisions of article 55 of the RGPD, the Agency
Spanish Data Protection is competent to perform the functions that
are assigned to it in its article 57, among them, that of enforcing the Regulation and
promote awareness of controllers and processors
about the obligations incumbent on them, as well as dealing with claims
presented by an interested party and investigate the reason for them.
Correlatively, article 31 of the RGPD establishes the obligation of those responsible
and those in charge of the treatment to cooperate with the control authority that requests it in
the performance of their duties. In the event that they have appointed a
data protection delegate, article 39 of the RGPD attributes to it the function of
cooperate with that authority.
Similarly, the domestic legal system, in article 65.4 of the LOPDGDD, has
foreseen a mechanism prior to the admission to processing of the claims that are
formulated before the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, which consists of giving
transfer of the same to the data protection delegates designated by the
responsible or in charge of the treatment, for the purposes provided in article 37 of
the aforementioned norm, or to these when they have not been designated, so that they proceed to the
analysis of said claims and to respond to them within a month.
In accordance with this regulation, prior to the admission for processing of the
claim that gives rise to this procedure, it was transferred to the
responsible entity to proceed with its analysis, respond to this Agency
within a month and prove that they have provided the claimant with the due response,
in the event of exercising the rights regulated in articles 15 to 22 of the
GDPR.
The result of said transfer did not allow to understand satisfied the claims of the
claiming party. Consequently, on April 26, 2022, for the purposes
provided for in article 64.2 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to admit the submitted claim for processing. Saying
agreement of admission to procedure determines the opening of the present procedure of
lack of attention to a request to exercise the rights established in the
articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD, regulated in article 64.1 of the LOPDGDD, according to the
which:

"1. When the procedure refers exclusively to the lack of attention of a
request to exercise the rights established in articles 15 to 22 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, will start by agreement of admission to process, which will be

In this case, the term to resolve the procedure will be six months from

claim".
The purging of administrative responsibilities in the framework of the
of a sanctioning procedure, whose exceptional nature implies that it is chosen,
whenever possible, due to the prevalence of alternative mechanisms that have
protection in current regulations.
It is the exclusive competence of this Agency to assess whether there are responsibilities
administrative that must be purged in a sanctioning procedure and, in
consequently, the decision on its opening, not existing obligation to initiate a
procedure before any request made by a third party. Such a decision must
be based on the existence of elements that justify said start of the activity

With this procedure, the guarantees and guarantees are duly restored.
claimant's rights.
THIRD: The rights of individuals in terms of data protection
personal data are regulated in articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD and 13 to 18 of the
LOPDGDD. The rights of access, rectification, deletion,
opposition, right to limitation of treatment and right to portability.
The formal aspects related to the exercise of these rights are established in the
articles 12 of the RGPD and 12 of the LOPDGDD.
It also takes into account what is expressed in Considerations 59 and following of the
GDPR.
In accordance with the provisions of these rules, the data controller
must arbitrate formulas and mechanisms to facilitate the interested party in the exercise of their
rights, which will be free (without prejudice to the provisions of articles 12.5 and 15.3
of the RGPD), and is obliged to respond to the requests made no later than one
month, unless you can show that you are unable to identify the
interested party, and to express his reasons in case he was not going to attend said
request. The proof of compliance with the duty of
respond to the request to exercise their rights made by the affected party.
The communication addressed to the interested party on the occasion of their request must
be expressed in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible manner, with a
clear and simple language.
Regarding the right of access to personal data, in accordance with the
established in article 13 of the LOPDGDD, when the exercise of the right is
refers to a large amount of data, the person in charge may request the affected party to

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es
5/7
specify the “data or treatment activities to which the request refers”. The
right will be understood granted if the person in charge provides remote access to the data,
taking the request as granted (although the interested party may request the information
referring to the ends provided for in article 15 of the RGPD).
The exercise of this right may be considered repetitive on more than one occasion.
for a period of six months, unless there is legitimate cause for it.
On the other hand, the request will be considered excessive when the affected party chooses a means
other than the one offered that involves a disproportionate cost, which must be
assumed by the affected party.
FOURTH: In accordance with the provisions of article 15 of the RGPD and article 13 of the
LOPDGDD, "the interested party has the right to obtain from the data controller
confirmation of whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed and, in such
case, right of access to personal data”.
Before going into the substance of the matter, that is, whether or not the requested access proceeds,
It should be noted that, in accordance with the provisions of sections 1 and 2 of article 4 of the
RLOPD, the voice is considered personal data. Therefore, in principle, the claimant
would have the right to be provided with these recordings, under the protection of
Data Protection. However, such recordings may contain, in addition to
your data, information related to third parties that could not be communicated,
since, otherwise, it could constitute a transfer of data without consent.
In this sense, it must be considered that the voice is a peculiar and
individual of each person that makes it identifiable, therefore, it is a data of
personal character. Consequently, the right of access to the recording of your voice
requested by the claimant if it is covered by current regulations on
data protection, therefore, they must provide the copy of the recording
requested from the claimant or, failing that, a transcript of its content.
In the case analyzed here, the complaining party exercised its right of access,
arguing that he could not oppose the voice recording carried out by the
commissioning of the treatment, which facilitates the transcription of the recording and not the
Voice recording. That the right of access to the voice recording was requested before
ESCO EXPANSION, S.L. and not before CAIXABANK, S.A.
ESCO EXPANSION, S.L. communicates to the complaining party that it acts as manager
of the treatment and proceeds to transfer the claim to CAIXABANK, S.A. as
responsible for the treatment and this, as responsible facilitates the requested access
facilitating the transcription of the telephone conversation.
In accordance with the definition in charge of the treatment contained in article 4.8 of the
RGPD, provides: "in charge of the treatment or in charge: the natural or legal person,
public authority, service or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the
responsible for the treatment.” and in article 28.3 e) it provides: “the person in charge will be assisted,
taking into account the nature of the treatment, through technical measures and
appropriate organizational arrangements, whenever possible so that it can comply with
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es
6/7
its obligation to respond to requests that have as its object the exercise of the
rights of the interested parties established in chapter III;”
Therefore, in accordance with the regulations set forth, in the case examined,
It has been proven that the complaining party requested access to a voice recording,
and that, after the term established in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, its
request obtained the legally required response, given that the claim was transferred
to the person in charge of the treatment and this, attended the required access in accordance with the
criteria established in the transcribed precepts, facilitating the transcription of the
Voice recording.
In relation to the fact that it was not possible to oppose the voice recording, it should be noted that the
lawful processing of personal data must be covered by one of the
legal bases established in article 6.1 of the General Regulations of
Data Protection.
In this way, various legitimizing causes of the treatment are established, so that the
consent does not operate as the only possible one.
It must be ensured that personal data will be collected for certain purposes.
determined, explicit and legitimate, and will not be treated in a manner incompatible with
other purposes.
If the data is necessary in the context of the execution of a contract or the intention
to conclude the same, the treatment of the data will be lawful when it refers to the
parties to a business, labor or administrative relationship and are necessary for its
maintenance or compliance.
Therefore, it should be reported at the beginning of the conversation, the legitimacy of the
treatment, in this case, voice recording.
Based on the foregoing, considering that this procedure has as
object that the guarantees and rights of those affected are duly
restored, it is appropriate to dismiss the claim that originated this procedure
considering that the right of access to the voice recording was carried out in the
due form.
In view of the aforementioned precepts and others of general application, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection RESOLVES:
FIRST: DISMISS the claim made by Ms. A.A.A. versus
CAIXABANK, S.A.
SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to Ms. A.A.A. and CAIXABANK, S.A.
In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this
Resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.
