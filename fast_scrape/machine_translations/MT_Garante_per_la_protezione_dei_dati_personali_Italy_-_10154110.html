<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject, a policyholder of three life insurance policies with Poste Vita, filed a complaint alleging unlawful disclosure of her personal data. Between 2021 and 2023, Poste Vita responded to several email requests for policy information. These requests appeared genuine, containing her handwritten signature and precise contract details such as account numbers and transaction amounts. Believing them to be authentic, Poste Vita disclosed documents and data.
In fact, the emails came from an unauthorised third party who later used the information in court proceedings. The data subject discovered this only in September 2024, when she denied having created or used the email account in question. Poste Vita then suspended communications and opened an internal inquiry. However, the company notified the Garante of the personal data breach only in January 2025, nearly four months later.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Garante found that Poste Vita, as controller, had unlawfully disclosed personal data to a third party without adequate verification measures, breaching the principles of lawfulness, fairness, integrity and confidentiality under Article 5(1)(a) and (f) GDPR. The DPA also held that the company failed to notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority “without undue delay and, where feasible, within 72 hours” as required by <a href="/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR#1" title="Article 33 GDPR">Article 33(1) GDPR</a>.
</p><p>Although Poste Vita argued it had acted in good faith and was deceived by a fraudster, the Garante stressed that the company remained responsible for ensuring appropriate safeguards before releasing personal data, especially since no official email address had ever been registered by the policyholder.
</p><p>In determining the sanction, the Garante considered the seriousness of the violation, the negligence of staff, the delay in notification, and the corrective measures adopted afterwards. It imposed an administrative fine of €80,000 and ordered publication of the decision.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>The ruling reinforces two GDPR principles. First, the accountability principle requires controllers to establish effective identity verification procedures before disclosing personal data; reliance on apparent authenticity is insufficient. Second, the timeliness of breach notification under Article 33 is interpreted strictly: once there is reasonable certainty of a compromise, the 72-hour period begins, regardless of internal investigations. The decision illustrates that good faith or third-party fraud does not relieve controllers of their obligations.

REPORTER: Guido Scorza, Attorney;

WHEREAS

1. The complaint against the company and the investigation.

In a complaint filed with this Authority on October 24, 2024, Ms. XX alleged that, at Poste Vita S.p.A. (hereinafter "Poste Vita" or "the company"), her personal data—referring to three life insurance policies held by her—had been unlawfully disclosed to an unauthorized third party, who then used them in legal proceedings. Specifically, the complainant stated that the aforementioned company, in response to specific requests for information containing her personal details and signature, transmitted detailed information and extensive documentation to a "German email address [...]" that she "never created or used."

Following the Office's request on January 24, 2025, to provide comments regarding the complainant's allegations, Poste Vita S.p.A., in a letter dated February 13, 2025, reconstructed the details of the incident, stating, in particular, that:

a) "with a communication dated November 27, 2021, bearing the interested party's handwritten signature, sent by email from mailbox XX, the Company was requested to provide information regarding additional payments made on existing accounts with Poste Vita by debiting her postal savings booklet no. [...] jointly held" with another individual. The appointed operator, after analyzing the request, "proceeded to verify it, believing it to have come from a person authorized to access information relating to the Policies, taking into account that the aforementioned request bore the Interested Party's handwritten signature and precisely indicated the dates and amounts of the additional payments made with regard to the Policies, as well as the identification details of the postal savings book to which the payments had been debited. This first request was followed by further requests, dated December 29, 2021, January 5, 2022, February 21, 2022, and July 10, 2023, always aimed at obtaining information relating to the Policies and always bearing the Interested Party's handwritten signature and containing precise identifying elements capable of inducing one to believe that the same came from a person authorized to know the information. Therefore, the Company verified these requests" until, in a note dated September 22, 2024, the interested party sent A formal denial of the aforementioned requests; thus, the company learned "that the aforementioned information requests came from an unauthorized party, who had allegedly sent them to the Company impersonating the Data Subject. Consequently, the Company initiated the appropriate investigations, also instructing its operators to no longer process requests from the disavowed email address and proceeding to notify this Respected Authority, pursuant to Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of a personal data breach (Your ref. DB007859-1 – protocol.I.0006738.20/01/2025)";

b) the disclosure of the data subject's data to a third party was therefore "originated by the unlawful and artificial conduct of the third party, who sent the access requests impersonating the data subject. Specifically, the fact that these requests contained the data subject's handwritten signature, as well as the mention of a series of unique elements (dates and amounts of additional payments relating to the Policies and precise identification of the relevant debit account), led the Company's staff to believe that they originated from the data subject herself."

c) "Regarding security and verification procedures," it emerged that "the data subject does not appear to have registered in the Reserved Area of the insurance company's website" and that "there are no indications of alternative email addresses provided by the data subject in the Company's records." The requested information was therefore provided because "reliance was placed on the authenticity of the requests received, in light of the specific information on transactions carried out by the interested party, which only she, as the contracting party, could have known, supported by signed documentation";

d) given the above, "it is specified that the Company's corporate procedures stipulate that requests for information relating to contractual relationships may be processed only if the following conditions are met:

- originating from certified addresses, i.e., those corresponding to those registered in the Reserved Area accessible online by customers;

- alternatively, through the Company's acquisition of an identity document of the applicant, attached to the request.

In this case, the first request from the so-called Ms. XX was received precisely during the implementation phase of the aforementioned corporate procedures";

e) "In any case, following the interested party's report, received by the Company on September 22, 2024, the following corrective measures have been adopted:

- all communications to the unknown email address have been suspended;

- all communications signed by her that reached the Company via email from address XX have been forwarded to the interested party (see attached communications dated September 26, 2024 and October 8, 2024)."

Furthermore, Ms. XX has been informed of the procedure for registering in the Insurance Reserved Area, where she can provide a certified email address for future communications […].

In this regard, it is important to clarify that the part of the Complaint in which Ms. XX claims that the only address used for official communications is XX is untrue, as, as anticipated, there is no evidence of this in the Company's records, nor is there evidence that the Interested Party has provided documentation proving that she indicated to the Company that she wishes to receive communications at the address in question.

2. Notification of violations and defense brief.

With communication dated April 10, 2025, the Office notified the Company of the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings, pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 5, of the Code for violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letters a) and f), and 33, paragraph 1 of the Regulation.

With a letter dated May 6, 2025, Poste Vita S.p.A. submitted its defense briefs pursuant to Article 18 of Law No. 689/1981, reiterating that it has "always acted in good faith and with due diligence in believing the requests received on behalf of the interested party to be legitimate" and that it has "unfortunately been the subject of fraudulent activity by a third party (...), who intentionally and skillfully misled the operator in order to obtain information useful for another purpose, thus perpetrating a veritable deception," it further highlighted the following. Specifically:

a) "To protect its customers, as informally indicated on several occasions by IVASS, the Company will follow up on requests made [...], regardless of the channel they arrive through, including registered mail, regular mail, and email, if such communications can be traced with reasonable certainty back to the policyholder or beneficiary." In this case, the operator relied on the genuineness of the requests received from the address XX considering - in addition to the presence of unequivocal and detailed elements and the handwritten signature - "that the interested party had not communicated to the Company any email address to which she wished to receive communications (neither in the Reserved Area nor in any other way). In any case," as already stated in the response of February 13, 2025, "the Company's corporate procedures are continuously updated" and "currently, all requests for information relating to contractual relationships can only be fulfilled under certain specific conditions," as outlined above (see paragraph 1, letter d));

b) "As soon as it received the communication from the interested party, on September 22, 2024, the Company, although not yet certain of the fraud, acted immediately," suspending all communications to the unknown email address and initiating "the appropriate internal investigations." In particular, the complaint was received (on December 16, 2024) in which "Ms. XX, through her trusted lawyer, Mr. XXX”, provided further details about the incident, stating “that she had been sued - together with her children in their capacity as beneficiaries of the life insurance policies - before the Court of XXX by one of her nephews, a certain XXX, and that, only after having access to the court file, she had become aware of the filing in the case documents by the plaintiff of a series of information and documents relating to the products in question, sent by the Company to the email address, in fact, unknown to the same”. The Complaints Function reported the event to the Privacy Function of the Company, as well as to the Legal Function, for the purposes of assessments within the competence of each”. Therefore, "following the necessary investigations, the GDPR Assessment Team, tasked pursuant to internal regulations with assessing events that may give rise to data breaches and whose assessments are submitted to the opinion of the Poste Italiane Group's DPO, notified the Data Protection Authority of the data breach related to the matter in question on January 20, 2025, within 72 hours of becoming aware of the event, which occurred on January 17, 2025." Subsequently, "on February 7, 2025, the Company filed a complaint against unknown persons with the Judicial Authority to protect the interests of the Company and the Data Subject for the events that occurred. The criminal proceedings are currently in the preliminary investigation phase."

c) It is important to note that "prior to that date [January 17, 2025], even considering that Ms. XX had not provided the Company with an email address as her contact information, the Company did not have sufficient evidence to believe that the communications received were from anyone other than the Interested Party, given the numerous and precise details provided in the requests and the presence of the handwritten signature. In fact, the Company began to doubt the authorship of the communications received in the Interested Party's name only upon receipt of the communication dated September 22, 2024, which, moreover, came from a different address ("XX"), also unknown to the Company, in which the Interested Party indicated that at the time she merely suspected she had suffered identity theft."

d) furthermore, "the 72-hour deadline for notification of the breach is not a mandatory deadline indicated by Article 33 of the GDPR, as the provision itself specifies that notification must be made "where possible within 72 hours of [the controller] becoming aware of it. Indeed, the provision reflects a realistic principle, as, in more complex organizations, such as the Company, becoming aware of a data breach requires complex checks and controls, involving multiple structures and requiring compliance with specific processes, especially to protect its customers. Therefore, even if the Authority were to deem a delay in notification, the Company would not be attributable to any breaches in this regard."

e) finally, it must be considered that the personal data breach that occurred "did not involve sensitive data as per Article 33 of the GDPR." 9 of the GDPR" and that the related investigations required more time, considering that the data were "extorted" from the Company by a person who used artifice and deception to obtain the information, thus committing criminal conduct [...]".

3. Outcome of the investigation.

Following the examination of the statements made to the Authority during the proceedings (for the veracity of which the author is responsible pursuant to and for the purposes of Article 168 of the Code), as well as the documentation acquired, it appears that the Company, as data controller, processed the complainant's personal data in a manner that did not comply with the regulations on personal data protection.

In particular, it emerged that Poste Vita S.p.A. communicated personal data relating to the life insurance policies held by the complainant to an unauthorized third party; This occurred due to an error committed by company operators who, when examining requests for information regarding the aforementioned policies and received between 2021 and 2023 via an email address containing the interested party's first and last name, provided information and documentation to the email address itself, believing that the information at their disposal was adequate and sufficient to guarantee that the requests originated from the complainant, the policyholder.

Only some time after the incident, on September 22, 2024, following the interested party's disavowal of the email address in question, did the Company initiate appropriate investigations, while also immediately suspending all further communications to the email address in question.

The reasons identified by the Company as the cause of its conduct, including, in particular, the fact that the requests encountered presented elements of authenticity such as to suggest that they originated from the data subject (handwritten signature and specific, detailed information about the data subject and the transactions carried out by her), cannot be considered sufficient to exclude that the processing of personal data carried out by the company violated the principles set forth in Article 5, paragraph 1, letters a) and f) of the Regulation.

Given that, in this specific case, the data subject had not provided—either at the time of signing the contract or subsequently—an email address for receiving communications of interest, the Company, before sending documentation and information relating to the data subject by email, should have implemented all appropriate measures to verify that the email address in question corresponded to the customer's identity.

In this regard, it should be noted that the Company, during the proceedings, stated that it had since "updated corporate procedures, also to optimize customer protection measures," stipulating that "all requests for information relating to contractual relationships may be processed only if conditions are met" that allow the identity of the requester to be ascertained.

Regarding the delay in notifying the Authority of the personal data breach pursuant to Article 33, paragraph 1 of the Regulation on January 20, 2025, the Company's arguments—according to which it had actual and certain knowledge of the breach only on January 17, 2025 (the date of the GDPR Evaluation Team meeting), while as of September 22, 2024, there was no "reasonable certainty" that the breach had occurred—cannot be considered sufficient to overcome the objection raised.

This is because, given the data subject's disavowal of the email address, the Company had "reasonable" evidence that the data relating to the email address had been sent by one of its operators to an unrelated party. This resulted in the Company's obligation to provide, without undue delay and, where possible, within 72 hours, the notification pursuant to Article 33, paragraph 1 of the Regulation (notification that, however, was provided almost four months later and without any indication of the reasons for the delay).

In this regard, reference is made to the "Guidelines 9/2022 on the Notification of Personal Data Breach under the GDPR," adopted by the European Data Protection Board on March 28, 2023 (which replaced the previous "Guidelines on the Notification of Personal Data Breach under Regulation (EU) 2016/679," adopted by the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, most recently on February 6, 2018, and endorsed by the European Data Protection Board on May 25, 2018), which specify that "The EDPB considers that the controller should be considered to be 'aware' when it is reasonably certain that a security incident has occurred that has led to the compromise of personal data."

In any case, "The precise moment at which a controller can be considered to have 'awareness' of a particular breach will depend on the circumstances of the breach. In some cases, it will be relatively obvious from the outset that a breach has occurred, while in others, it may take some time to establish whether personal data has been compromised. However, the emphasis should be on timely action to investigate an incident to establish whether personal data has actually been breached and, if so, take remedial action and notify, if necessary" (see pages 31 and 33 of the cited Guidelines).

4. Conclusions: declarations of unlawfulness of processing. Remedial measures pursuant to Article 58(2) of the Regulation.

In light of the above findings, the Authority believes that the statements, documentation, and reconstructions provided by the data controller during the investigation do not fully address the concerns notified by the Office in the initiation of the proceedings and are therefore unsuitable for dismissing the present proceedings. Furthermore, none of the cases provided for in Article 11 of the Italian Data Protection Authority Regulation No. 1/2019 apply.

The processing of the data subject's personal data by Poste Vita S.p.A. is unlawful, in the terms set out above, as it violates Articles 5, paragraph 1, letters a) and e), and 33, paragraph 1, of the Regulation.

For this reason, the complaint must be considered well-founded, and the Authority, in exercising its corrective powers under Article 58, paragraph 2, of the Regulation, orders the application of an administrative fine pursuant to Article 11 of the Italian Data Protection Authority Regulation No. 1/2019. 83, commensurate with the circumstances of the specific case (Article 58, paragraph 2, letter i) of the Regulation).

5. Adoption of an injunction order for the application of the administrative pecuniary sanction and additional sanctions (Articles 58, paragraph 2, letter i), and 83 of the Regulation; Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code).

The Guarantor, pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, letter i) of the Regulation and Article 166 of the Code, has the power to impose an administrative pecuniary sanction pursuant to Article 83 of the Regulation, by issuing an injunction order (Article 18 of Law No. 689 of 24 November 1981) in relation to the processing of personal data carried out by Poste Vita S.p.A., which has been determined to be unlawful, in the terms set out above.

Deemed it appropriate to apply Article 83(3) of the Regulation, which provides that "where, for the same or linked processing operations, a controller […] intentionally or negligently infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement," the total amount of the fine is calculated so as not to exceed the maximum fine provided for in the same Article 83(5).

With reference to the elements listed in Article 83(1), 2 of the Regulation for the purposes of applying the administrative fine and its quantification, given that the fine must "in any case be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive" (Article 83, paragraph 1 of the Regulation), it is noted that, in this case, the following circumstances were taken into consideration:

- the significant nature of the violation, which affected general principles of personal data processing (lawfulness and fairness, integrity, and confidentiality), and the fact that the data controller became aware of the violation only following the data subject's report;

- the negligent nature of the event due to the error of the operators who, when processing requests for information received from an email address, failed to verify the identity of the undersigned;

- the fact that the Company, upon becoming aware of the incident, immediately initiated the necessary investigations to reconstruct the incident, resulting in a complaint against unknown persons to the competent authorities;

- the declarations made during the proceedings regarding "updating company procedures, including to optimize customer protection measures," stipulating that "all requests for information relating to contractual relationships may be processed only if conditions are met" that allow the identity of the requester to be ascertained;

- the fact that the Company actively cooperated with the Authority throughout the proceedings;

- the absence of specific precedents against the Company.

Furthermore, it is believed that, given the aforementioned principles of effectiveness, proportionality, and dissuasiveness, which the Authority must adhere to in determining the amount of the fine (Article 83, paragraph 1, of the Regulation), the following are of primary importance in this case: the financial situation of the offender, determined based on the company's revenues in the ordinary financial statements for 2023.

In light of the above factors and the assessments made, it is deemed appropriate, in this case, to impose an administrative fine of €80,000.00 (eighty thousand) against Poste Vita S.p.A.

In this context, it is believed that, pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Guarantor Regulation No. 1/2019, this chapter containing the injunction order should be published on the Garante's website.

This is in consideration of the type of violations identified, which resulted in the disclosure to an unauthorized third party of personal data relating to the life insurance policies held by the complainant.

NOW THAT, THE GUARANTOR

deems the processing carried out by Poste Vita S.p.A., represented by its legal representative pro tempore, with registered office at Viale Europa, 190, 00144, Rome, VAT no. 05927271006, unlawful for violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letters a) and f), and 33, paragraph 1, of the Regulation;

ORDERS

pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, letter a), i) of the Regulation, to the same company to pay the sum of €80,000.00 (eighty thousand) as an administrative fine for the violations indicated in this order;

HEREBY ORDERES

therefore, the same company to pay the aforementioned sum of €80,000.00 (eighty thousand) according to the methods indicated in the attachment, within 30 days of notification of this order, under penalty of the adoption of the subsequent enforcement proceedings pursuant to Article 27 of Law No. 689/1981.

It is recalled that the violator retains the right to settle the dispute by paying—again according to the methods indicated in the attachment—an amount equal to half the fine imposed, within the deadline set out in Article 10, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree No. 150 of September 1, 2011, provided for the filing of the appeal as indicated below (Article 166, paragraph 8, of the Code);

ORDERS

- pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Regulation of the Data Protection Authority No. 1/2019, the publication of the injunction order on the website of the Data Protection Authority;

- pursuant to Article 154-bis, paragraph 3, of the Code and Article 37 of the Regulation of the Data Protection Authority No. 1/2019, the publication of this provision on the website of the Data Protection Authority;

- pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation No. 1/2019, the recording of the violations and measures adopted in accordance with Article 58, paragraph 2 of the Regulation, in the internal register of the Authority provided for by Article 57, paragraph 1, letter b). u) of the Regulations.

Pursuant to Article 78 of the Regulations, Articles 152 of the Code, and Article 10 of Legislative Decree No. 150/2011, this decision may be challenged before the ordinary judicial authorities by filing an appeal with the ordinary court of the place identified in the same Article 10, within thirty days of the date of notification of the decision, or sixty days if the appellant resides abroad.

WHEREAS

1. The complaint against the company and the investigation.

In a complaint filed with this Authority on October 24, 2024, Ms. XX complained that, at Poste Vita S.p.A. (hereinafter "Poste Vita" or "the company"), her personal data—related to three life insurance policies held by her—were unlawfully disclosed to an unauthorized third party, who then used them in legal proceedings. Specifically, the complainant claimed that the aforementioned company, in response to specific requests for information containing her personal details and signature, transmitted detailed information and extensive documentation to a "German email address [...]" that she "never created or used."

Following the Office's request on January 24, 2025, to provide comments regarding the complainant's allegations, Poste Vita S.p.A., in a letter dated February 13, 2025, reconstructed the details of the incident, stating, in particular, that:

e) finally, it must be considered that the personal data breach that occurred "did not involve sensitive data as per Article 33 of the GDPR." 9 of the GDPR" and that the related investigations required more time, considering that the data were "extorted" from the Company by a person who used artifice and deception to obtain the information, thus committing criminal conduct [...]".

3. Outcome of the investigation.

Following the examination of the statements made to the Authority during the proceedings (for the veracity of which the author is responsible pursuant to and for the purposes of Article 168 of the Code), as well as the documentation acquired, it appears that the Company, as data controller, processed the complainant's personal data in a manner that did not comply with the regulations on personal data protection.

In particular, it emerged that Poste Vita S.p.A. communicated personal data relating to the life insurance policies held by the complainant to an unauthorized third party; This occurred due to an error committed by company operators who, when examining requests for information regarding the aforementioned policies and received between 2021 and 2023 via an email address containing the interested party's first and last name, provided information and documentation to the email address itself, believing that the information at their disposal was adequate and sufficient to guarantee that the requests originated from the complainant, the policyholder.

Only some time after the incident, on September 22, 2024, following the interested party's disavowal of the email address in question, did the Company initiate appropriate investigations, while also immediately suspending all further communications to the email address in question.

The reasons identified by the Company as the cause of its conduct, including, in particular, the fact that the requests encountered presented elements of authenticity such as to suggest that they originated from the data subject (handwritten signature and specific, detailed information about the data subject and the transactions carried out by her), cannot be considered sufficient to exclude that the processing of personal data carried out by the company violated the principles set forth in Article 5, paragraph 1, letters a) and f) of the Regulation.

Given that, in this specific case, the data subject had not provided—either at the time of signing the contract or subsequently—an email address for receiving communications of interest, the Company, before sending documentation and information relating to the data subject by email, should have implemented all appropriate measures to verify that the email address in question corresponded to the customer's identity.

In this regard, it should be noted that the Company, during the proceedings, stated that it had since "updated corporate procedures, also to optimize customer protection measures," providing that "all requests for information relating to contractual relationships can be processed only if conditions are met" that allow the identity of the requester to be verified.

Regarding the delay in notifying the Authority of the personal data breach pursuant to Article 33, paragraph 1 of the Regulation on January 20, 2025, the Company's arguments—according to which it had actual and certain knowledge of the breach only on January 17, 2025 (the date of the GDPR Evaluation Team meeting), while as of September 22, 2024, there was no "reasonable certainty" that the breach had occurred—cannot be considered sufficient to overcome the objection raised.

This is because, given the data subject's disavowal of the email address, the Company had "reasonable" evidence that the data relating to the email address had been sent by one of its operators to an unrelated party. This resulted in the Company's obligation to provide, without undue delay and, where possible, within 72 hours, the notification pursuant to Article 33, paragraph 1 of the Regulation (notification, however, was provided almost four months later and without any indication of the reasons for the delay).

In this regard, reference is made to the "Guidelines 9/2022 on the Notification of Personal Data Breach under the GDPR," adopted by the European Data Protection Board on March 28, 2023 (which replaced the previous "Guidelines on the Notification of Personal Data Breach under Regulation (EU) 2016/679," adopted by the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, most recently on February 6, 2018, and endorsed by the European Data Protection Board on May 25, 2018), which specify that "The EDPB considers that the controller should be considered to be 'aware' when it is reasonably certain that a security incident has occurred that has led to the compromise of personal data."

In any case, "The precise moment at which a controller can be considered to have 'awareness' of a particular breach will depend on the circumstances of the breach. In some cases, it will be relatively obvious from the outset that a breach has occurred, while in others, it may take some time to establish whether personal data has been compromised. However, the emphasis should be on timely action to investigate an incident to establish whether personal data has actually been breached and, if so, take remedial action and notify, if necessary" (see pages 31 and 33 of the cited Guidelines).

4. Conclusions: declarations of unlawfulness of processing. Remedial measures pursuant to Article 58(2) of the Regulation.

In light of the above findings, the Authority believes that the statements, documentation, and reconstructions provided by the data controller during the investigation do not fully address the concerns notified by the Office in the initiation of the proceedings and are therefore unsuitable for dismissing the present proceedings. Furthermore, none of the cases provided for in Article 11 of the Italian Data Protection Authority Regulation No. 1/2019 apply.

The processing of the data subject's personal data by Poste Vita S.p.A. is unlawful, in the terms set out above, as it violates Articles 5, paragraph 1, letters a) and e), and 33, paragraph 1, of the Regulation.

For this reason, the complaint must be considered well-founded, and the Authority, in exercising its corrective powers under Article 58, paragraph 2, of the Regulation, orders the application of an administrative fine pursuant to Article 11 of the Italian Data Protection Authority Regulation No. 1/2019. 83, commensurate with the circumstances of the specific case (Article 58, paragraph 2, letter i) of the Regulation).

5. Adoption of an injunction order for the application of the administrative pecuniary sanction and additional sanctions (Articles 58, paragraph 2, letter i), and 83 of the Regulation; Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code).

The Guarantor, pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, letter i) of the Regulation and Article 166 of the Code, has the power to impose an administrative pecuniary sanction pursuant to Article 83 of the Regulation, by issuing an injunction order (Article 18 of Law No. 689 of 24 November 1981) in relation to the processing of personal data carried out by Poste Vita S.p.A., which has been determined to be unlawful, in the terms set out above.

Deemed it appropriate to apply Article 83(3) of the Regulation, which provides that "where, for the same or linked processing operations, a controller […] intentionally or negligently infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement," the total amount of the fine is calculated so as not to exceed the maximum fine provided for in the same Article 83(5).

With reference to the elements listed in Article 83(1), 2 of the Regulation for the purposes of applying the administrative fine and its quantification, given that the fine must "in any case be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive" (Article 83, paragraph 1 of the Regulation), it is noted that, in this case, the following circumstances were taken into consideration:

- the significant nature of the violation, which affected general principles of personal data processing (lawfulness and fairness, integrity, and confidentiality), and the fact that the data controller became aware of the violation only following the data subject's report;

- the negligent nature of the event due to the error of the operators who, when processing requests for information received from an email address, failed to verify the identity of the undersigned;

- the fact that the Company, upon becoming aware of the incident, immediately initiated the necessary investigations to reconstruct the incident, resulting in a complaint against unknown persons to the competent authorities;

- the declarations made during the proceedings regarding having "updated company procedures, including to optimize customer protection measures," stipulating that "all requests for information relating to contractual relationships may be processed only if conditions are met" that allow the identity of the requester to be ascertained;

- the fact that the Company actively cooperated with the Authority throughout the proceedings;

- the absence of specific precedents against the Company.

Furthermore, it is believed that, given the aforementioned principles of effectiveness, proportionality, and dissuasiveness, which the Authority must adhere to in determining the amount of the fine (Article 83, paragraph 1, of the Regulation), the financial circumstances of the offender, determined based on the company's revenues in the ordinary financial statements for 2023, are relevant in this case.

In light of the above factors and the assessments made, it is deemed appropriate, in this case, to impose an administrative fine of €80,000.00 (eighty thousand) against Poste Vita S.p.A.

In this context, it is believed that, pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Regulation of the Italian Data Protection Authority No. 1/2019, this chapter containing the injunction should be published on the Italian Data Protection Authority's website.

This is in light of the type of violations identified, which resulted in the disclosure to an unauthorized third party of personal data relating to the life insurance policies held by the complainant.

NOW THAT THE AUTHORITY

determines the unlawfulness of the processing carried out by Poste Vita S.p.A., represented by its legal representative pro tempore, with registered office at Viale Europa, 190, 00144, Rome, VAT No. 05927271006, for violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letters a) and f), and 33, paragraph 1, of the Regulation;

ORDERS

pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, letter i), of the Regulation, the same company to pay the sum of €80,000.00 (eighty thousand) as an administrative fine for the violations indicated in this order;

HEREBY ORDER

therefore, the same company to pay the aforementioned sum of €80,000.00 (eighty thousand) according to the methods indicated in the attachment, within 30 days of notification of this order, under penalty of the adoption of the subsequent enforcement proceedings pursuant to Article 27 of Law No. 689/1981.

It is recalled that the offender retains the right to settle the dispute by paying—again according to the methods indicated in the attachment—an amount equal to half the fine imposed, within the deadline set forth in Article 10, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree No. 150 of September 1, 2011, provided for filing an appeal as indicated below (Article 166, paragraph 8, of the Code);

ORDERS

- pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Italian Data Protection Authority Regulation No. 1/2019, the publication of the injunction order on the Italian Data Protection Authority's website;

- pursuant to Article 154-bis, paragraph 3, of the Code and Article 37 of the Italian Data Protection Authority Regulation No. 1/2019, the publication of this provision on the Italian Data Protection Authority's website;

- pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation No. 1/2019, the recording of violations and measures adopted pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, of the Regulation, in the Authority's internal register provided for by Article 57, paragraph 1, letter u) of the Regulation.

Pursuant to Article 78 of the Regulation, as well as Articles 152 of the Code and 10 of Legislative Decree No. 150/2011, an appeal against this provision may be lodged with the ordinary judicial authority, with an appeal filed with the ordinary court of the place identified in the same Article 10, within thirty days of the date of notification of the provision itself, or sixty days if the appellant resides abroad.
