<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 15 January 2020, Norconsulting (the controller), a human resources company established in Spain with contractual relations with various ad platform such as Linkedin, Infojobs or Xing AAA , sent an email to A.A.A., a data subject established in Germany (the data subject). The purpose of this email was to advertise targeted job offers to the data subject.
</p><p>On the same day, the data subject wrote back to the controller and requested: (i) access to the information under (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15</a>(1)), (ii) deletion of the data (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17</a>); (iii) communication to the recipients of these data (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_19_GDPR" title="Article 19 GDPR">Article 19</a>); and (iv) deletion of these data from the sites where they have been published (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17(2)</a>).
</p><p>On 4 February 2020, the controller responded to the data subject, explaining that it had obtained the data subject’s contact through ad platforms to which the data subject was or had been, registered. The controller stated that it would delete the data subject’s email from its files. 
</p><p>The data subject contacted the controller by email on 4 February, 15 March and 31 March 2020, stating that the response was not valid under the GDPR. On 31 March 2020, the data subject filed a complaint to the German DPA of Berlin on the matter. In accordance with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_56_GDPR#1" title="Article 56 GDPR">Article 56(1) GDPR</a> and in application of the procedural rules applicable to cross-border cases, the Berlin DPA transferred the case to the Spanish DPA, as lead supervisory authority.
</p><p>In the course of the proceedings, the controller claimed that it had obtained the data subject’s email address from contractual partners to which the data subject had agreed to share its data. The controller also stated that it deleted the data subject’s email address after their request. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA underlined that the focus of the legal proceedings was the exercise of the right of access and the right of erasure of the data subject, rather than the lawfulness of the processing carried out by the controller. 
</p><p><b>Right of access</b>
</p><p>The Spanish DPA found that the controller processed at least the data subject’s name, surname, e-mail address, professional profile and preferences in terms of job offer. The Spanish DPA held that the controller responded to the data subject’s first email in a generic manner, stating where the data came from, and did not answer any of the further emails of the data subject. Thus, the Spanish DPA found that the controller did not respond adequately to the data subject’s request, in violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15 GDPR</a>.

this part throughout the entire procedure processed by this Administration.

indicates that GRUPO NORCONSULTING S.L. only proceeded to delete the email
claimant's email, however, we must state that my
represented once sent the email of February 2020, proceeded to delete any
data related to the claimant, since no interest has for my represented the
Saving of data of a person who requests its deletion.
In any case, and as claimed, the contact details are obtained from

GRUPO NORCONSULTING S.L., in a legitimate way, through dedicated platforms
to the contact of professionals.

there is no record of this part, they were sent coinciding with the period in which the

Government of Spain decreed the State of Alarm by COVID and in which the Company
undertook ERTES in which the workforce was temporarily unemployed, which
must be taken into account with respect to the special business situation.

of the LOPDGDD is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency.


Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures processed
by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of article 4.1 of the GDPR, the

processing of personal data, since NORCONSULTING performs
the collection and storage of, among others, the following personal data of persons
physical: email, name and surname, among other treatments.

NORCONSULTING carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller,

given that it is who determines the purposes and means of such activity, by virtue of article 4.7 of the
GDPR. In addition, it is a cross-border treatment, since NORCONSULTING
is established in Spain, although it provides service to the entire European Union.

The GDPR provides, in its article 56.1, for cases of cross-border processing,
provided for in article 4.23), in relation to the competence of the supervisory authority

principal, that, without prejudice to the provisions of article 55, the supervisory authority of the
main establishment or the only establishment of the person in charge or of the person in charge of the
treatment will be competent to act as main control authority for the
cross-border processing carried out by said controller or processor pursuant to
to the procedure established in article 60. In the case examined, as has been stated,

NORCONSULTING has its main establishment in Spain, so the Agency
Española de Protección de Datos is competent to act as control authority
major.

For its part, article 15 of the GDPR regulates the information that can be requested

through the exercise of the right of access of article 15 and, on the other, article 17 of the

28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 10/20








Formulated resolution proposal by the instructor of this procedure, in the
hearing procedure for the interested party, allegations are presented by
NORCONSULTING to which we proceed to respond below:

1.- NORCONSULTING proceeded to delete any data related to the part

claimant once sent the email of February 2020.

NORCONSULTING has not maintained a clear position in this regard. Here we are told
that proceeded to delete the data of the complaining party when it sent the email of
February 2020. In the allegations submitted to the initiation agreement dated 09/13/2022,
it was said that NORCONSULTING had never had the data of the complaining party

following: "... In any case, we must make it clear that our client, never
had the data of the complaining party…”. Finally, as referred to in the
allegations presented to the resolution proposal, it is pointed out that the data were
eliminated upon receipt of the claim: "...since it once had
proof of the claim has proceeded with the deletion of data…”.


NORCONSULTING does not certify having deleted personal data (name, surname,
professional profile...) that he had of the complaining party. In addition, by not having attended the
request to exercise the right of access, not even as a result of this
procedure, it has not been possible to determine all the personal data subject to

treatment. As an example, in the email dated 01/15/2022 NORCONSULTING
proposes to the complaining party to have a telephone conversation about their preferences
professionals, asking for the most recent documentation of your experience, will not
they ask for their phone number, which they apparently already have.

2.- The data is obtained by NORCONSULTING in a legitimate way.


This question was already answered in the motion for a resolution, specifically in the
second point of response to the allegations made to the initiation agreement. It's not
object of this procedure the legitimacy of the treatment carried out by
NORCONSULTING, but the alleged infractions committed by the inadequate attention
of the exercise of rights requested by the claimant, specifically, the exercise of the

right of access and the exercise of the right to delete your data. to major
abounding, that the treatment was legitimate in principle is not an obstacle for the
complaining party to exercise their rights before the data controller and these are
cared for correctly.

3.- Subsequent emails, and of which NORCONSULTING supposedly did not

has the record, they were sent coinciding with the period in which the Government of Spain
decreed the State of Alarm by COVID.

In this regard, this Agency wishes to point out that the complaining party reiterated its request for the
exercise of the right of access on 02/04/2020, from that date until the beginning of the state of

alarm more than a month elapsed, therefore the maximum period established by the
Article 12.3 of the GDPR to attend to this type of request. If we take into account the
first request, dated 01/15/2020, which was not duly attended to, almost
two months before the start of the state of alarm, so there was enough time to
meet the said request.

For all the above, the allegations presented are dismissed.

                                             IV.

                             Evaluation of the practiced test

On 08/29/2022, the instructor of the procedure agreed to carry out the practice of
documentary evidence, regarding the security of the processing of personal data object
of this procedure. On 09/13/2022, NORCONSULTING presented documentation,
before which the following assessments can be made:


1.- On the date of the events in the file, NORCONSULTING worked with a
software provided by the Company ***COMPANY.1, which, in the pandemic period due to
COVID, was replaced by the software (...), for which NORCONSULTING alleges that it does not
You can access the information for that period.


In this regard, this Agency points out that NORCONSULTING cannot accept a change
of management software to neglect, on the one hand, the obligations that, as
responsible for treatment, is attributed by the GDPR in terms of guaranteeing the interested parties the
due attention to your requests to exercise your rights and, on the other, the
consequences derived from non-compliance with these requests. In Recital 15, the

GDPR even goes further, determining that its precepts are binding regardless of
of the technology used, by establishing that: "In order to avoid a serious risk of
circumvention, the protection of natural persons must be technologically neutral and must not
depend on the techniques used.


2.- NORCONSULTING indicates that it never had the data of the complaining party, but
who simply made contact through the platform or social network for professionals
LINKTEAM, communicating in the email sent on 02/04/2020 to the claimant the
deletion of your email.


However, the message sent by NORCONSULTING dated 02/4/2020 says: "But, as
you have no interest in receiving job offers from us, we will proceed to delete your email from
our automated files for which this company is responsible”, which we can translate as:
"But, since we are not interested in receiving job offers from us, we will proceed to
remove your email from our automated files from which this company
it's responsible". In addition, in the first email sent by NORCONSULTING to

the complaining party dated 01/15/2020, there is also other personal data such as the
name and surname of the recipient.

Therefore, in accordance with the test carried out, this Agency considers that
NORCONSULTING has not provided any means of proof, which allows it to conclude that the

email and other personal data of the complaining party (name, surname,
professional profile, preferences regarding job offers...) has been removed from
your automated files. In addition, we do not know all the data
personal data of the complaining party that were subject to treatment and were included in said
automated file for which NORCONSULTING is responsible, as the

exercise of the right of access requested by the complaining party in the email dated
01/15/2020.

                              Right of access of the interested party

Article 15 "Right of access of the interested party" of the GDPR establishes:


"1. The interested party shall have the right to obtain from the data controller confirmation of
whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed and, in such a case, the right to

2. When personal data is transferred to a third country or to an organization
international, the interested party shall have the right to be informed of the adequate guarantees in
under article 46 relating to the transfer.


3. The data controller shall provide a copy of the personal data object of
treatment. The person in charge may receive for any other copy requested by the
interested party a reasonable fee based on administrative costs. When the interested

Otherwise, the information will be provided in a commonly used electronic format.

4. The right to obtain a copy mentioned in section 3 will not negatively affect the
rights and liberties of others.”


In the present case, the complaining party, by email, requests the
NORCONSULTING, in the exercise of the right of access of article 15 of the GDPR, the
following information about the processing of your data:


C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 13/20








“a) What personal data has been stored or processed.
b) Purpose of processing my data.

GDPR and to file a claim with the competent control authority.

g) Information on the origin of the data; and
h) If there is automated decision-making, including profiling, of
in accordance with article 22 of the GDPR.
i) If my personal data has been transferred to a third country or to an organization
international".


The complaining party requested NORCONSULTING the right of access to their data
personal data and the information referred to in the previous paragraph on 02/15/2020. Well then,
NORCONSULTING responds to said request in a generic way, with a brief
information in which it only refers to the fact that the data of the interested party have been obtained
in any job portal (Infojobs, Experteer...) with which they work, in any of

to which the claimant would be subscribed. Because NORCONSULTING does not
adequately responds to the requested information, the complaining party again requested
said information in emails of 02/04/2020 and 03/15/2020, provided together with the
claim, without getting any response. The personal data of the complaining party
object of treatment by NORCONSULTING are, at least, name, surname, email

email address, professional profile and preferences regarding job offers.

In accordance with the evidence available at this time of resolution of
sanctioning procedure, it is considered that the known facts constitute a
infringement, attributable to NORCONSULTING, for violation of article 15 of the GDPR.

                    Classification of the infringement of article 15 of the GDPR

The aforementioned infringement of article 15 of the GDPR supposes the commission of the infringements

typified in article 83.5 of the GDPR that under the heading "General conditions for the
imposition of administrative fines” provides:

Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of

annual global of the previous financial year, opting for the one with the highest amount:
       (…)
       b) the rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22; (...).”


In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 "Infractions" establishes that "They constitute
offenses the acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this law
organic”.

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 "Infractions considered very serious" of
the LOPDGDD indicates:


1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:

                     Penalty for violation of article 15 of the GDPR


For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount,
in accordance with the evidence available at the present time of resolution of
disciplinary procedure, it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed according to
in accordance with the following criteria established in article 83.2 of the GDPR.


As an aggravating circumstance:

          - The nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement, taking into account the
              nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question,
              as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and

              damages they have suffered (section a): Due to the failure to attend to at least three
              requests for access to your personal data, the first dated
              01/15/2020, which to date have not been duly addressed.

          - Negligence in the infringement (section b): The complaining party reiterated up to

              twice the request for information through emails sent on
              02/04/2020 and 03/15/2020, without obtaining a response from
              NORCONSULTING, which supposes the lack of a minimum diligence in the
              compliance with your obligations as data controller.

As a mitigation:


          - Any measure taken by the person in charge or in charge of the treatment to
              alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties (section c): In a

              economic activity is the management of human resources, which entails a
              High processing of personal data.


The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the GDPR and 76.2 of the
LOPDGDD, with respect to the offense committed by violating the provisions of article 15
of the GDPR, allows a penalty of €10,000 (ten thousand euros) to be imposed.

Upon confirmation of the infringement, the Spanish Agency for Data Protection orders
NORCONSULTING that within 30 days certify before this Agency that it has complied with
the exercise of the right of access by the complaining party, answering all the information

taking into account the available technology and the cost of its application, it will take reasonable measures,
including technical measures, with a view to informing those responsible who are processing the
personal data of the request of the interested party to suppress any link to those
personal data, or any copy or replica thereof.


3. Sections 1 and 2 will not apply when the treatment is necessary:

a) to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information;

b) for compliance with a legal obligation that requires data processing
