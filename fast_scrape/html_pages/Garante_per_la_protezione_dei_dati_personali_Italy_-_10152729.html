<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>In 2023 the DPA started several <i>ex officio</i> investigations on the use of cookies and other trackers on the websites of a number of businesses. One of these businesses was car retailer Confalonieri S.r.l. (the data controller).
</p><p>The DPA found that the controller’s website displayed a cookie banner with three buttons: “Accept all”, “Learn more”, and an “X” button that closed the banner. The website included links to a cookie policy, a privacy notice, and a page with cookie settings.
</p><p>The investigation highlighted the following issues:
</p>
<ul><li>If visitors clicked the “X” button, the cookie banner was displayed again upon subsequent visits to the website;</li>
<li>The website did not store unnecessary cookies when visitors clicked the “X” button. However, the cookie banner did not inform users that they could refuse cookies this way;</li>
<li>The cookie policy did not list the recipients of personal data;</li>
<li>The cookie policy and the privacy notice both contained outdated legal references.</li></ul>
<p><br />
The controller changed its website during the investigation. After the update, the website displayed a small footer that succinctly informed visitors that they “declare that they read the privacy policy (…) and consent to the processing of their personal data for the required service”. The only available buttons were “Accept” and “Privacy notice”. The cookie policy was no longer available on the website and the privacy notice contained no mention of cookies and other trackers.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA found the following violations:
</p>
<ul><li>The controller violated Articles <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR" title="Article 12 GDPR">12</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">13 GDPR</a> by providing insufficient information about the processing of personal data;</li>
<li>The controller nudged visitors towards giving (invalid) consent by repeatedly displaying the cookie banner after they clicked the “X” button. This practice violated Articles <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR" title="Article 4 GDPR">4(11</a>), <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">5</a>, and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR" title="Article 7 GDPR">7 GDPR</a> as well as Art. 122 d. lgs. 196/2003<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>:</li>
<li>The controller violated Articles <a href="/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR" title="Article 24 GDPR">24</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR" title="Article 25 GDPR">25 GDPR</a> by failing to inform users that they could reject cookies via the “X” button.</li></ul>
<p>The DPA issued a warning and ordered the controller to bring its practices into compliance.

SEEN Note No. 38468 of March 3, 2023, by which the Unit provided the lists of potential recipients, indicating their geographical area of origin and turnover;

SEEN Note No. 130776 of September 21, 2023, according to which, in compliance with the principles of uniformity of the intervention and in application of a predetermined and uniform selection criterion throughout the country, also based on size and geographic indicators, Confalonieri S.r.l. was identified among the entities subject to said inspections, which were actually carried out on November 7, 2023, in relation to the website www.confalonieriauto.it;

WHEREAS, the following emerged:

- When opening the website, an instant-popup banner about the use of cookies appears, stating: "Cookie Policy - This site and the third-party tools integrated into it process personal data (e.g., browsing data or IP addresses) and use cookies, pixels, tags, or other identifiers necessary for its operation and to achieve the purposes described in the cookie policy, including improving the site's functionality and providing personalized advertising. By clicking the "Accept All" button, you agree to the use of these technologies. Alternatively, you can customize your choices using the appropriate button."

- This banner contains the "X," "Learn more," and "Accept all" buttons;

- By clicking "Accept all" or "Learn more" to customize your preferences, the banner will not reappear upon subsequent visits to the site; whereas by clicking the "X" button, the banner will reappear upon each subsequent visit to the site.

- The website footer contains a link to the Cookie Policy, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Settings;

- The Cookie Policy contains references to repealed laws and does not specify the recipients of the data;

- The privacy policy refers to personal data protection laws no longer in force and to the health emergency resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.

SEEN the note dated March 1, 2024, in which, pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 5, of the Code, the Authority notified Confalonieri S.r.l. of the initiation of proceedings for the possible adoption of the measures referred to in Article 58, paragraph 2, of the Regulation and the alleged violations of the law, identified, in this case, as the violation of Articles 4, point 11, 5, 7, 12, 13, 24, and 25 of the Regulation and Article 166, paragraph 5, of the Code. 122 of the Code, as well as the indications contained in the Cookie Guidelines, attributable to:

- the incompleteness of the information provided regarding data processing through the use of cookies, characterized by a lack of information on the recipients of the data, the reference to now-repealed provisions of the Code, and the absence of a warning indicating that closing the banner by selecting the "X" button will result in the retention of the default settings, all of which prevent the provision of free, informed, and specific consent;

- the reappearance of the banner upon each subsequent access to the site if the user clicks the "X" button, which, in addition to compromising the fluidity of the user experience, is likely to force consent in order to continue browsing;

ACKNOWLEDGING that, in a defense brief dated March 28, 2024 (acquired on March 29, 2024 with file no. 39693), Confalonieri S.r.l. merely clarified that the site was managed by a third-party company and that, on its own, it did not have the "technical expertise to directly update the cookie policy";

NOTED that following a further access to the site by the Office, conducted after the investigation conducted by the Unit and the subsequent notification of the communication pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 5 of the Code, it emerged that, pending the proceedings, the data controller had modified the banner so that it now reads "I declare that I have read our Privacy Policy pursuant to Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and consent to the processing of my data for the requested service." Furthermore, the only possible actions available to the user are those related to selecting two buttons: "Privacy Policy" and "I Accept." Finally, it has been determined that the cookie policy is no longer available and the currently available privacy policy does not contain any reference to the processing of user data through cookies or other tracking tools;

CONSIDERING that, pursuant to current legislation, the data controller is required to provide information on the processing of personal data carried out through the use of cookies or other tracking tools, and that in the event of the use of cookies or other tracking technologies other than technical ones, the data controller is also required to obtain the user's consent;

Furthermore, based on the information acquired during the investigation conducted by the Special Unit for the Protection of Privacy and Technological Fraud of the Guardia di Finanza, in the case at hand:

- given the lack of a cookie policy and the inadequacy of the information provided in the short notice available in the banner, the Company has processed personal data in violation of Articles 12 and 13 of the Regulation and the provisions of the Cookie Guidelines;

- the reappearance of the banner upon each subsequent access to the website www.confalonieriauto.it, if the user has clicked on the "X" button, may influence the data subject's will, resulting in a violation of Articles 4, point 11, 5, and 7 of the Regulation, as well as Article 122 of the Code.

- the fact that the banner does not even contain a warning that closing it by selecting the "X" button will result in the retention of the default settings and therefore continuation of browsing without cookies or other tracking tools other than technical ones (see section 7.1 Cookie Guidelines) constitutes a violation of Articles 24 and 25 of the Regulation;

CONSIDERING that the conduct of the data controller constitutes a violation of Articles 4, point 11, 5, and 7 of the Regulation, as well as Article 122 of the Code. 4, points 11, 5, 7, 12, 13, 24, and 25 of the Regulation and Art. 122 of the Code, as well as the indications contained in the Cookie Guidelines;

Furthermore, CONSIDERING:

a) that the changes made by the data controller pending the proceedings are not only inadequate to restore the site's compliance, but also non-compliant with the applicable regulations in several other respects, as further detailed above;

b) that it is therefore necessary to order the data controller, pursuant to Art. 58, paragraph 2, letter a), to: d) of the Regulation, to align the processing of personal data performed through cookies and other tracking tools used by the website www.confalonieriauto.it with current legislation on the protection of personal data, by configuring the banner to allow users to provide specific and informed consent to the use of cookies other than technical cookies, and by supplementing the general information on the processing of personal data with specific reference to the processing of data performed through cookies;

c) given the specific nature of the investigation, to dispense with the imposition of financial penalties in this specific case, limiting itself, however, to issuing Confalonieri S.r.l. a warning pursuant to Art. 58, paragraph 2, letter b) of the Regulation, for failure to comply with the provisions regarding the processing of personal data through the use of cookies and other tracking tools;

CONSIDERING that the conditions exist for making an entry in the Authority's internal register pursuant to Article 57, paragraph 1, letter u), of the Regulation, regarding the measures adopted in this case against Confalonieri in accordance with Article 58, paragraph 2, of the Regulation itself;

CONSIDERING the documentation in the file;

CONSIDERING the observations of the Office, formulated by the acting Secretary General pursuant to Article 15 of the Regulation of the Guarantor No. 1/2000 of 28 June 2000;

RAPPORTEUR: Professor Pasquale Stanzione;

NOW CONSIDERING ALL THE FOREGOING, THE GUARANTOR

a) pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, letter d), of the Regulation, orders Confalonieri s.r.l., with registered office in Sassari (SS), at Via Predda Niedda No. 33, VAT No. 01117710903, as data controller, to align the processing of personal data performed through cookies and other tracking tools used by the website www.confalonieriauto.it with current data protection legislation, specifically by configuring the banner to allow users to provide specific and informed consent to the use of cookies other than technical cookies, and by supplementing the general information on personal data processing with specific reference to data processing performed through cookies;

b) pursuant to Art. 58, paragraph 2, letter b) of the Regulation, issues a warning to Confalonieri s.r.l. for failure to comply with the applicable provisions regarding the processing of personal data through the use of cookies and other tracking tools, for the reasons better explained in the reasoned section;

ORDERS

pursuant to Art. 17 of the Regulation of the Italian Data Protection Authority no. 1/2019, the recording in the Authority's internal register, provided for by Article 57, paragraph 1, letter u) of the Regulation, of the violations and the measures adopted.

Pursuant to Article 78 of the Regulation, Articles 152 of the Code, and Article 10 of Legislative Decree No. 150 of September 1, 2011, an appeal against this decision may be lodged with the ordinary judicial authority, with an appeal filed either with the court of the place where the data controller resides or has its registered office or with the court of the place of residence of the interested party within thirty days of the date of notification of the decision itself, or sixty days if the appellant resides abroad.
