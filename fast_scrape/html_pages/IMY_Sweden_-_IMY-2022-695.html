<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The DPA initiated the case after a complaint from a data subject who stated that they had received a summons to a healthcare visit by mail. The complainant's name and address, and the health care facility the summons referred to was fully visible in the window of the envelope.
</p><p>The Medical Board of Region Darlarna held themselves out to be the controller. The controller had already  identified the risk that personal data other than the address might become visible in the window envelope and therefore purchased an additional service to hide information in the window envelope. The medical letters of the region were sent with the help of Postnord Strålfors AB's (Strålfors) function eBREV. The invitations were sent securely in digital format from Region Dalarna's journal system to Strålfors, which mechanically printed, enveloped and sent the notice to the addressee. 
</p><p>The board launched an internal invesitgation and discovered that whenever a letter contained more than 5 A4 pages, Strålfors would send the letter in a normal envelope which contained two windows. The Board informed the DPA that the processing subject to supervision had not ceased. Until an agreement could be reached with Strålfors, the Board changed the template for invitations to visits to the three units (Barn- och ungdomsmedicinska mottagningen Mora, Samtalsmottagningen barn og young Falun and Sömnlaboratoriet in Avesta) that were identified to have sent invitations with attachments that exceed five A4 sheets. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA held that "processing of personal data wholly or partly by automatic means" covered the sending of documents by post when the underlying processing of the personal data was automated. Thus <a href="/index.php?title=Article_2_GDPR" title="Article 2 GDPR">Article 2(1) GDPR</a> applies and the processing falls within the scope of the GDPR. 
</p><p>The DPA assessed that a summons to one of the three healthcare facilities included in the case constituted data concerning health according to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR" title="Article 4 GDPR">article 4(15) GDPR</a>. The DPA came to this conclusion because the concept of health is to be interpreted broadly and assesses that the care that given at the health care facilities in question is so specific that an invitation to visit one of the of these clinics may be considered to provide information on the individual's physical or mental state of health. Therefore, the data processed also constituted special categories of data according to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR" title="Article 9 GDPR">article 9(1) GDPR</a>.
</p><p>According to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(2) GDPR</a> the data controller is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing is carried out in accordance with the GDPR. The DPA then determined that for the controller to have implemented adequate safety measures, the data concerning health should have been hidden in the window envelope. 
</p><p>The controller had therefore violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">article 32(1) GDPR</a> by not concealing data concerning health in the window envelope. The DPA noted that although the controller had taken measures to prevent the disclosure of personal data by purchasing an additional service to hide information, the controller should have ensured that the service functioned as intended by the controller.

                               Account of the supervisory matter


                               IMY has initiated supervision of the committee due to information that emerged in one

                               complaint from a person who, on 6 May 2021, received an invitation via letter to a healthcare visit
                               within Region Dalarna. The complaint states that the summons was in a window envelope and that
                               information that it was a summons, the complainant's name and address and the care facility

                               ning the summons was fully visible in the window of the envelope. The purpose of IMY's supervision is to
                               investigate the board's processing of personal data in connection with the use of
                               the current type of window envelope for invitations to health care visits meets the requirements for
                               security in connection with the processing according to article 32 of the data protection regulation.

                               Within the framework of the supervisory matter, IMY has only reviewed the committee's mailing of summonses
                               regarding the Child and Adolescent Medical Clinic Mora, Call Center
                               children and young people Falun and the Sleep Laboratory in Avesta.


                               The board has essentially stated the following. The committee is a healthcare provider and personal

                               The board identified the risk of using double windows when the service
                               was procured and therefore bought an additional service which means that envelopes which only

                               contains a window with the recipient's address to be used. On these envelopes is written
                               Region Dalarna's postal address printed where the sender's address is usually placed and
                               the name of the clinic/department that sent the summons is therefore not shown. The board's

                               opinion is that the sending clinic should not appear on the envelope.

                               In a statement to IMY dated 28 April 2022, the board stated that it had started a

                               investigation together with Strålfors. In an opinion dated 16 June 2022, the board stated i
                               mainly the following. It is unclear when the committee started sending summons where the patient's
                               name and the care facility to which the summons refers appear on the window of the envelope.

                               The investigation shows that the additional service where the sender is hidden only applies to sending
                               of a maximum of five A4 sheets. If the mailing contains more A4 sheets, a larger envelope is required
                               be used and then there are no customer-unique envelopes in the assignment that has been signed

                               eBREV, standard envelopes with two windows are used instead. In the same opinion stated
                               the committee that the investigative work to review the flow regarding the sending of summonses via
                               eBREV and risks linked to these that could generate a personal data-

                               incident in progress. In parallel with this, a discussion is being held with Strålfors about the need to
                               renegotiate the customer assignment to ensure that the correct type of envelope, with hidden
                               sender, used for all mailings.


                               In an opinion dated June 16, 2022, the board stated that the treatment that is
                               subject to supervision had not ceased. In a supplement that the board submitted to IMY

                               on July 6, 2022, it was stated that the board, until an agreement is reached
                               with Strålfors, will change the template for invitations to visit the three units
                               (Children's and youth medicine clinic Mora, Children's and youth consultation clinic

                               young Falun and the Sleep Laboratory in Avesta) that have been identified send invitations with
                               attachments exceeding five A4 sheets. The board has attached a picture that shows that
                               the invitations will be sent in an envelope with two windows, where Region Dalarnas

                               postal address appears in one window and information that it is a visit
                               via video link and the patient's name and address in the second.


                               In an opinion dated August 9, 2022, the board stated that previous answers have been deleted
                               from invitations sent through the Take Care IT system. It is about 2,500
                               summons per year, which corresponds to 0.5 percent of the total number of summons sent

                               through the current system.


                               Justification of the decision


                               Applicable regulations

                               Scope of the Data Protection Regulation

                               Article 2.1 of the data protection regulation states that the regulation must be applied to
                               such processing of personal data that is fully or partially carried out automatically
                               as well as on other than automatic processing of personal data that is part of or will be

                               to be included in a register.

                               In doctrinanges that because the data protection regulation includes partially automated

                               processing of personal data, the regulation is applicable in the case of disclosure on paper of
                               personal data that is in data format. Furthermore, the Chancellor of Justice has assessed that

                                the expression "fully or partially automated processing of personal data" in the present
                                the repealed Personal Data Act (1998:204) covered the sending of documents by post

                                when the underlying processing of the personal data was automated. 4


                                Personal data is defined in Article 4.1 of the Data Protection Regulation as any information
                                which refers to an identified or identifiable natural person.


                                Processing is defined in Article 4.2 of the Data Protection Regulation as an action or
                                combination of measures concerning personal data or sets of
                                personal data, regardless of whether it is performed automatically or not, such as collection,

                                registration, organization, structuring, storage, processing or modification,
                                production, reading, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or
                                otherwise providing, adjusting or combining, limiting, erasing

                                or destruction.

                                Personal data responsibility and the principle of accountability

                                According to Article 4.7 of the data protection regulation, the person in charge of personal data means a
                                natural or legal person, public authority, institution or other body which
                                alone or together with others determines the purposes and means of treatment

                                ling of personal data. If the purposes and means of the processing are determined by
                                Union law or the national law of the Member States can the personal data controller

                                or the special criteria for how he is to be appointed are prescribed in Union law or in
                                national law of the Member States.


                                According to ch. 2 Section 6 of the Patient Data Act (2008:355), PDL, is a care provider personal data-
                                responsible for the processing of personal data carried out by the care provider. In a region or
                                a municipality is any authority that provides health care personal data-

                                responsible for the processing of personal data carried out by the authority.

                                According to Article 5.2 of the Data Protection Regulation, the person in charge of personal data shall be responsible

                                for and be able to demonstrate that the principles in Article 5.1 are complied with (the principle of
                                liability).


                                The personal data controller is responsible for implementing appropriate technical and
                                organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing is carried out in
                                in accordance with the data protection regulation. The measures must be implemented taking into account

                                the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing and the risks, of
                                varying degrees of probability and seriousness, for the freedoms and rights of natural persons.

                                The measures must be reviewed and updated if necessary. It appears from Article 24.1 i
                                data protection regulation.


                                Data on health
                                Information about health is defined in Article 4.15 of the Data Protection Regulation as personal
                                data relating to a natural person's physical or mental health, including

                                provision of healthcare services, which provide information about his
                                health status. Information about health constitutes so-called sensitive personal data. It is
                                prohibited to process such personal data according to Article 9.1 of the Data Protection Ordinance

                                ning, unless the processing is covered by one of the exceptions in Article 9.2 i

                                Recital 35 of the data protection regulation states the following. Personal information about health should
                                include all the information relating to a registered person's state of health which
                                provides information about the data subject's past, present or future physical or

                                mental health conditions. This includes information about the natural person who
                                collected in connection with registration for or provision of health and

                                healthcare services to the natural person according to the European Parliament and the Council
                                directive 2011/24/EU, a number, a symbol or a characteristic such as the physical
                                the person assigned to identify him for health care purposes, data

                                arising from tests or examination of a body part or body substance,
                                including genetic information and biological samples, and other information about, for example

                                disease, disability, risk of disease, medical history, clinical treatment or the
                                recorded physiological or biomedical conditions, regardless of the source, for example
                                show from a doctor or other healthcare professional, a hospital, a medical technician

                                product or an in vitro diagnostic test.


                                In the case Lindqvist (C-101/01, EU:C:2003:596, point 51), the Court of Justice of the EU has determined that
                                information that a person has injured their foot and is on part-time sick leave constitutes a person-
                                data relating to health according to the data protection directive (the directive was repealed by

                                data protection regulation). The European Court of Justice stated in the case that with regard to the purpose of
                                the data protection directive, the expression "data relating to health" should be given a broad interpretation and

                                considered to include data relating to all aspects of a person's health, both physical and
                                psychological ones (see point 50). The European Court of Justice has further in a later ruling
                                Vyriausioji tarnybinės etikos komisiya (C-184/20, EU:C:2022:601) stated that

                                the concept of sensitive personal data according to article 9.1 of the data protection regulation shall
                                interpreted broadly and judged that even personal data that indirectly reveals a physical
                                a person's sexual orientation constitutes sensitive personal data according to the person in question

                                the provision.


                                The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has stated that the concept of health data
                                according to the data protection regulation must be interpreted broadly against the background of, among other things, EU
                                the court's judgment in the Lindqvist case and as it appears from reason 53 of the data protection

                                the regulation that information about health deserves extensive protection. IMY has in one
                                legal position deemed that information about guardianship according to the parental code

                                are information about health (IMYRS 2022:3).

                                The requirement for security when processing personal data

                                It follows from Article 32.1 of the data protection regulation that the personal data controller and
                                the personal data assistant must take appropriate technical and organizational measures to

                                ensure a level of safety that is appropriate in relation to the risk of the treatment.
                                It must take into account the latest developments, implementation costs
                                and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing as well as the risks, of

                                varying degree of probability and seriousness, for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.


                                When assessing the appropriate security level, special consideration must be given to the risks that
                                the processing entails, in particular from accidental or illegal destruction, loss or
                                alteration or unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to personal data which

                                transferred, stored or otherwise processed. It appears from Article 32.2 i

                               Recital 75 of the data protection regulation states factors that must be taken into account in the assessment
                               of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Loss of, among other things, is mentioned
                               confidentiality with regard to personal data subject to confidentiality and whether

                               the processing concerns information about health or sexual life. Further must be taken into account
                               the processing concerns personal data about vulnerable natural persons, especially children,
                               or if the processing involves a large number of personal data and applies to a large

                               number of registrants.

                               In recital 76 of the data protection regulation, it is stated that how likely and serious the risk is to it

                               data subject's rights and freedoms should be determined based on the nature of the processing,
                               scope, context and purpose. The risk should be evaluated on the basis of a
                               objective assessment, through which it is determined whether the data processing includes

                               a risk or high risk.

                               If the personal data controller hires a personal data assistant to carry out a

                               processing, the personal data controller shall only employ personal data assistants who
                               provides sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational
                               measures. It must take place in such a way that the processing meets the requirements of

                               data protection regulation and that the data subject's rights are protected. It appears from
                               article 28.1 and recital 81 of the data protection regulation.


                               The Swedish Privacy Protection Authority's assessment

                               The investigation into the matter shows that the board during the period from 6 May 2021 to and including

                               on 6 July 2022 has used a service for sending physical letters which meant that
                               some invitations to health care visits have been sent out in window envelopes with information that it is
                               a summons, the patient's name and address and the care facility to which the visit relates

                               were fully visible.

                               The Data Protection Regulation is applicable

                               The information in the summons that was visible through the window envelopes refers to
                               identified persons. It is therefore a matter of personal data. The board's
                               processing of the personal data consists of a series of measures where the board's
                               disclosure of personal data by physical mail has been a part. The underlying part

                               of the process, which, among other things, means that invitations are sent in digital format from
                               Region Dalarna's journal system is automated. IMY therefore assesses that it is a question
                               about a partially automated processing of personal data covered by

                               scope of application of the data protection regulation.

                               Personal data responsibility

                               The board has stated that it is the healthcare provider responsible for personal data for that treatment
                               of personal data in the event of invitations to healthcare visits within the Dalarna Region that are subject to
                               supervision, which is supported by the other investigation in the case. IMY therefore assesses that

                               the committee is responsible for personal data for the current processing.

                               The treatment involved a high risk

                               As a personal data controller, the board must, according to Article 32.1 of the Data Protection Ordinance,
                               ning, take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a
                               appropriate level of security in relation to the risks involved in processing personal data. The

                               also applies when personal data is processed by a personal data processor. IMY does
                               the following assessment of the risks of the treatment in question. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-695 6(8)
                                Date: 2023-01-17






                                According to information from the board, summonses that have shown sender reception have been sent
                                from the Child and Adolescent Medicine Clinic Mora, Children's Call Center

                                and young Falun and the Sleep Laboratory in Avesta. The investigation into the matter shows that
                                the receptions offer care for children and young people aged 0–17 with illnesses and

                                illness that requires more specialist knowledge and resources than is normally available
                                care centre, help for children and young people up to 17 years of age with mild to moderate mental illness
                                respective investigation and treatment of various sleep disorders.


                                IMY states that the concept of health must be interpreted broadly and assesses that the care which
                                given at the care facilities in question is so specific that an invitation to visit someone

                                of these receptions may be considered to provide information about the individual's physical or
                                mental health conditions.


                                Against this background, IMY assesses that the information regarding these care facilities,
                                which were fully visible at the time of dispatch, constitute information about health in the sense referred to in
                                Article 4.15 of the Data Protection Regulation. The data are therefore so-called sensitive

                                personal data covered by the protection according to Article 9.1 of the regulation.

                                The data is also protected within the health and medical care by confidentiality according to

                                25 ch. Section 1 of the Publicity and Confidentiality Act (2009:400). Because two of the concerned
                                the care facilities only provide care for people who are 17 years of age or younger
                                furthermore, it is established that in some cases the information has also referred to children, who are considered special

                                protected according to the data protection regulation. It is also a comprehensive one
                                treatment that includes approximately 2,500 mailings from several different care facilities.


                                Against this background, IMY assesses that it is a treatment that involved a
                                high risk and that strong protection was therefore required.


                                The board has not taken sufficient security measures
                                IMY states that the mailings with invitations to visits at Children's and Youth Medicine's

                                should the reception Mora, the Children and Young People's Call Reception Falun and
                                The sleep laboratory in Avesta took place in such a way that the sensitive personal data
                                have been fully visible to everyone who came into contact with the letters. The data has been

                                available to, for example, those who work with handling mail, those who share
                                household with the recipient and the person who received a letter that was delivered to the wrong address.


                                In order to achieve an appropriate level of security, the dispatches should, according to IMY's assessment, have
                                took place in such a way that the sensitive personal data was not visible. The committee

                                has thus not been able to ensure the level of security required according to Article 32.1
                                in the data protection regulation.


                                It can be stated that the board's opinion is indeed that it should not be apparent from
                                the envelope which reception a summons to a care visit refers to and that the board therefore
                                procured a service for the purpose of concealing sending reception. After IMY started supervision

                                however, the committee carried out an investigation which showed that the service in question only
                                included invitations on a maximum of five A4 sheets and that other invitations were sent in envelopes
                                which showed which clinic the visit was intended for. IMY states that it has arrived at

                                the committee as personal data controller to ensure that before the processing in question, it
                                the current add-on service fulfilled the need to keep the data hidden from others yet
                                the recipient of the letter.




                                7 See recital 38 of the data protection regulation. Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2022-695 7(8)
                                Date: 2023-01-17






                                Against this background, IMY assesses that the committee has not taken sufficient measures
                                to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk involved
                                current treatment. The board has therefore processed personal data in violation of

                                article 32.1 of the data protection regulation.


                                Choice of intervention

                                Applicable regulations

                                In the event of violations of the data protection regulation, IMY has a number of corrective powers
                                called to be available according to Article 58.2 a–j of the data protection regulation, including reprimand,
                                injunction and penalty fees.


                                Article 83.2 of the data protection regulation states that IMY must impose administrative
                                penalty fees in addition to or instead of the other measures referred to in Article 58.2

                                depending on the circumstances of the individual case. Member States may determine
                                rules for whether and to what extent administrative penalty charges can be imposed
                                public authorities. This is apparent from article 83.7 of the data protection regulation. According to
                                6 ch. Section 2 of the Data Protection Act allows IMY to collect penalty fees from authorities at

                                violations referred to in article 83.4, 83.5 and 83.6 of the data protection regulation and that
                                Article 83.1, 83.2 and 83.3 of the regulation shall then be applied.


                                In article 83.2 of the data protection regulation, the factors that must be taken into account when making a decision are stated
                                if administrative penalty fees are to be imposed and when determining the fee
                                size. If it is a question of a minor violation, IMY receives according to reason 148 more

                                data protection regulation to issue a reprimand instead of imposing a penalty fee.

                                The factors specified in Article 83.2 of the Data Protection Regulation must also be taken into account

                                the determination of the amount of the penalty fee. Each supervisory authority must ensure
                                that the imposition of administrative penalty charges is effective in each individual case,
                                proportionate and dissuasive. This is apparent from Article 83.1 of the Data Protection Ordinance.


                                A penalty fee must be imposed
                                IMY has concluded that the board has processed personal data in violation of Article

                                32.1 of the data protection regulation. IMY finds in an overall assessment of the
                                circumstances described under the heading Amount of the penalty fee that there is
                                reason to impose a penalty fee on the board and that it is therefore not a question of one

                                such a minor violation that there is reason to issue a reprimand instead.

                                The size of the penalty fee

                                For violations of, among other things, Article 32 of the Data Protection Ordinance may
                                the sanction fee for public authorities amounts to a maximum of SEK 5,000,000. The
                                appears from ch. 6. Section 2 of the Data Protection Act and Article 83.4 of the Data Protection Ordinance.


                                In the assessment of the seriousness of the violation, IMY considers in accordance with Article 83.2 g
                                in the data protection regulation that the processing has included sensitive personal data about

                                health and information about children, which are particularly worthy of protection according to data protection
                                the regulation.


                                Furthermore, IMY takes into account what has emerged about the nature and severity of the violation
                                and duration based on what is stated in article 83.2 a of the data protection regulation. Thereby
                                it can be established that the violation has been going on for a longer period of just over a year, from and

                                with May 6, 2021, when the patient who filed the underlying complaint
                                for the supervisory authority received its summons, up to and including July 6, 2022, when the board took Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten Diary number: IMY-2022-695 8(8)
                               Date: 2023-01-17






                               measures to hide the sender's receipt on the envelope when mailing. Against background
                               of the fact that the board stated that it is about 2,500 summonses per year can also
                               it is established that the violation affects a large number of registered users. Furthermore, it means

                               the fact that the violation has occurred in healthcare - i.e. a business there
                               the registered patient is in a dependent and vulnerable position i
                               relationship with the person in charge of personal data - that there is reason to look more seriously
                               the violation. However, IMY assesses that there are also factors that speak to the contrary

                               direction in the assessment of the seriousness of the infringement. First, it moves
                               if a physical handling and not a digital one which would have involved a risk of greater and
                               faster dissemination of the data. A distribution by regular mail is more

                               limited and controlled than a transfer via the open network. Furthermore, have
                               emerged that the committee identified the risk of exposing those in question
                               the personal data during mailings and therefore took certain measures in order to comply

                               the requirements and reduce the risks of the treatment.

                               IMY decides based on an overall assessment of the circumstances of the case that

                               The health care board in Region Dalarna must pay an administrative fee
                               penalty fee of SEK 200,000.




                               This decision has been taken by the general manager Lena Lindgren Schelin after a presentation
                               by the lawyer Maja Welander. In the final processing of the case has also

                               head of law David Törngren, acting head of unit Linn Sandmark and IT-
                               and information security specialist Magnus Bergström participated.

                               You can e-mail the appeal to the Privacy Protection Authority if it does not contain

                               any privacy-sensitive personal data or information that may be covered by
                               secrecy. The authority's contact details appear on the first page of the decision.
