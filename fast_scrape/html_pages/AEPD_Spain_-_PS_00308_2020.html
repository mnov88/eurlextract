<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The complainant filed a complaint before the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against Vodafone España, S.A.U. The complaint was based on the fact that a contract was concluded with Vodafone by someone impersonating the complainant. 
</p><p>The contract bills were in her name but the address and bank account were not hers. The contract with Vodafone did not have the claimant's signature. However, when the bills were left unpaid, Vodafone assigned a debt in the claimant's name. 
</p><p>Once aware of this alleged debt, the complainant notified Vodafone's Customer Service of the potential error. Vodafone was also warned by the OMIC (consumer association) that the complainant had alleged (to OMIC) that this could be a case of identity theft. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Does the creation of a contract in the complainant's name, despite it being initiated by a third party, breach Article 6(1) GDPR?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA (AEPD) referred to the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency (Article 5(1)(a)), as well as Article 6(1) on the obligation to process data with a legal basis. With these Articles in mind, the DPA held that Vodafone processed the complainant's personal data (name, surname and NIF) without taking necessary measures to ensure the legitimacy of the contract. The contract in question was not signed by the claimant. There was therefore no legal basis for the processing, in violation of Article 6(1) GDPR.
</p><p>The DPA also mentioned that Vodafone had failed to comply with its obligation to be diligent when identifying a legal basis for the processing in line with the principle of accountability (although not directly quoted by the DPA, this passage refers to Article 5(2)). 
</p><p>The Spanish DPA therefore proposed a fine of €60000 on Vodafone for infringing Article 6(1) GDPR. This was then reduced to €36000 as Vodafone accepted responsibility and made a voluntary early payment.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW
I
By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them that of " legality, loyalty and
transparency". The precept provides:
"1 . The personal data will be:
a) Treaties in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner with the interested party; "
Article 6 of the RGPD, " Legality of the treatment ", details in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:
"1. The treatment will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following
terms:
a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
pre-contractual;
(…) "
The infringement for which the claimed entity is responsible is found
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading " General conditions for
the imposition of administrative fines ”, it states:
"5 . Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:
a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading " Infractions
considered very serious ” provides:
"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
in particular, the following:
(…)
a) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "
On the one hand, it is proven that the defendant processed the personal data
of the claimant (name, surname and NIF). Thus, the claimed, when hiring did not have
the necessary precautions to prove the legitimacy of the contractor .
The documentation provided does not certify the contracting by the
claimant, is not signed and did not verify the identity of the claimant.
They also confirm the absence of legitimacy for the treatment, as
they show that there was no contract between the two.
It must be taken into account that the documentation in the file
provides evidence that the complained party violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, whenever
that processed the personal data of the claimant without legitimacy.
The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the
Obligations imposed by the regulations on the protection of personal data
It is thus obvious. A diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the treatment
third-party data requires that the person responsible for the treatment is in conditions
to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).

In accordance with the evidence available at this time
procedural, and without prejudice to what results from the instruction of the procedure, it is estimated
that the conduct of the complained party could violate article 6.1 of the RGPD
may be constitutive of the offense typified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned
Regulation 2016/679.
In this sense, Recital 40 of the RGPD states:
" (40) For the treatment to be lawful, personal data must be processed
with the consent of the interested party or on some other legitimate basis established
in accordance with Law, either in this Regulation or by virtue of another Law
of the Union or the Member States referred to in this Regulation,
including the need to comply with the legal obligation applicable to the person responsible for the
treatment or the need to perform a contract to which the interested party or
in order to take measures at the request of the interested party prior to the
conclusion of a contract. "

instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the fine sanction to
