<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish housing association stating that the defendant has installed a video surveillance system allegedly pointing, without authorization, to tenants and other individuals of the housing association; such complaint included pictures proving that the video surveillance system was installed. The defendant had already been warned by the AEPD in the past for the same fact.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>The defendant did not answer to any AEPD investigation requests (not in the past and neither now), so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure with the collaboration of the police. During its investigations, the AEPD discovered that (i) there is no information poster at the premises nor information clauses on such processing activity, that (ii) there is a total of six cameras in the premises of the defendant, one of them located outdoors and pointing to a common area from which it can obtain images from the pedestrians, and that (iii) there is no authorization from the housing association (nor any explanations to its president have been given) for the installation of such video surveillance system pointing to common areas. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>Thus, the AEPD understood that the video surveillance system has infringed the data minimisation principle and, after considering some circumstances [(i) the surveillance system is recording to a common area without authorization nor information poster, (ii) there is intentionality, as the defendant had been warned in the past for the same fact, (iii) the defendant is a small business with low knowledge on data protection matters], it decided to impose a fine of 2,000 € to the defendant. The AEPD also requires the defendant to correct the pointing of the video surveillance system. Additionally, the AEPD also reminds that, in case the defendant does not comply with these requirements, this could lead to new investigation and sanction procedures.
