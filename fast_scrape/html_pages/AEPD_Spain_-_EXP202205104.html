<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The company Fusiona Soluciones Energéticas, the controler, filed a lawsuit against the data subject due to an alleged debt. In the judgment , a Spanish Court of First Instance dismissed the claim and declared that the data subject had no debt with the controller. Although the decision was final, the controller included the data subject's data in the 'common credit information system' associating them with the alleged debt. 
</p><p>The data subject then filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA, which initiated disciplinary proceedings against the controller. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA concluded that the controller violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>According to the DPA, when notifying the credit information system about a debt that is neither 'certain, nor due or payable', as required by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2018/12/06/pdfs/BOE-A-2018-16673.pdf">Article 20(1) LOPDGDD</a>, the controller cannot rely on the presumption of legitimate interest established by this provision.
</p><p>Therefore, the DPA considered that the data processing lacked a legal basis and fined the controlle €50,000 for the violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a>.

In parallel, the LOPDGDD, in its article 20, under the rubric of "Systems of

affected by the inclusion of such data and will inform you about the possibility of exercising the
rights established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 within
of the thirty days following the notification of the debt to the system, remaining
data blocked during that period.
d) That the data is only kept in the system while the breach persists, with a maximum limit of five years from the expiration date of
the monetary, financial or credit obligation.

legislation on consumer credit contracts and real estate credit contracts.

both are resolved on the request of the affected party.
f) That, in the event that the request for the conclusion of the contract is denied, or it
will not be held, as a result of the consultation carried out, whoever has

2. The entities that maintain the system and the creditors, regarding the treatment
of the data referring to their debtors, will have the status of co-responsible for the
data processing, being applicable the provisions of article 26 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
It will correspond to the creditor to guarantee that the requirements demanded for the

II
Classification and classification of the offense
The infringement for which the party claimed in this agreement is held responsible
of initiation is typified in article 83 of the GDPR which, under the rubric
“General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines”, states:
"5. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with the
section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or, in the case of
of a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the volume of
overall annual total business of the previous financial year, opting for the one with the highest
amount:
a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9.”
The LOPDGDD, for the purposes of the prescription of the infringement, qualifies in its article 72.1.
very serious infringement, in this case the limitation period is three years, "b)
The processing of personal data without the fulfillment of any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”
The documentation in the file shows that the party
claimed violated article 6.1 of the GDPR.
The conduct of the claimed party contrary to the principle of legality has consisted of

with respect to the alleged debtor, the claimant, was not true, nor expired nor enforceable, as

existence of such legitimate interest or the legally required weighting. The treatment

***LOCATION.1 Verbal Trial XXX/2020 Judgment: 00XXX/2021 before the party
claimed, as well as a report of inclusion in the Asnef system dated March 22
of 2022 in which your personal data is registered by the entity
claimed, with discharge date June 28, 2019.

this Regulation or by virtue of another Law of the Union or of the States
Member States referred to in this Regulation, including the need to comply with the
legal obligation applicable to the data controller or the need to execute a

with respect to entities whose activity entails the continuous processing of
customer data, indicates that "...the Supreme Court has understood that
recklessness exists whenever a legal duty of care is neglected, that is
that is, when the offender does not behave with the required diligence. And in the
assessment of the degree of diligence, special consideration must be given to the
professionalism or not of the subject, and there is no doubt that, in the case now
examined, when the appellant's activity is constant and abundant
handling of personal data must insist on rigor and exquisite
Be careful to comply with the legal provisions in this regard.”
The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the GDPR, with
