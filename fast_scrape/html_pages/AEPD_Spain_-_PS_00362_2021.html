<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The Banco Bilbao provided clients with ‘Affinity Cards’, which are a credit cards that could be used only within an affiliated group of several stores and companies. In this regard, any person calling the automated information hotline provided by the bank was able to obtain details of the last transactions of a card in exchange of the card-holder's ID-number.
</p><p>In the abstinence of other security measures to confirm the identity of the client, any person could call into the automated systems to obtain financial information only by giving the ID-number without verifying that they are the real owner of the document.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD decided that the bank thereby failed to adopt security measures, violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality according to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a> and the necessity to implement technical and organizational safeguards from <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>. Accordingly, only asking for the ID-number is insufficient to appropriately authenticate the client in question.
</p><p>Considering the number of clients affected, the solvency and the high degree of responsibility of the entity, the DPA imposed a fine of €200.000 on the bank. However, the fine was finally reduced to €120.000 because of prior voluntary payment and their acknowledgment of responsibility.

Likewise, the security measures must be adequate and proportionate to the

In this case, it is stated that the claimed entity facilitates the detail of the
last movements of the Affinity Card through an attention system
automated telephone number *** TELEPHONE. 1 which only asks for

as identification data the client's DNI.



Unless proven otherwise, these facts suppose that the respondent would not adopt the

adequate security measures, since anyone using the system

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/16










Said requirement is ex gratia character, to discern on the convenience or

not to admit the procedure for processing by virtue of the answer given by the
claimed from this Agency, to avoid initiating procedures as far as possible

necessary, in accordance with article 57.1 of the RGPD.

unauthorized or illegal treatment of personal data, this Agency proceeds to

-a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the
technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the treatment.

        number of affected (art. 83.2 a)




     The respondent is a solvent entity that has the technical means to take
        adequate security measures, their lack implies negligence in their actions

        (art. 83.2 b)




     The high degree of responsibility of the claimed party, since trying to
        daily personal data of your customers as part of your business and

        adopting adequate security measures, including those of the
        regulation for the prevention of fraud in banking entities, is

        fully aware of the need to implement security measures
        appropriate to the risk in all the treatments you carry out, aggravates your

        responsibility for lack of security measures (art. 83.2 d)




     Despite previous requirements and attempts to communicate this Agency with the
        claimed entity to know the situation from the point of view of all the

        affected parties, the complained entity, has not submitted allegations to the
        prior requirement, rather than to request its stoppage alleging errors in the

        processing of a procedure not started, and without collaborating with this Agency in
        their actions, despite having knowledge of the claim filed against

        her (art. 83.2 f)
