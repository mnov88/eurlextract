<p>A court held that a direct marketing company deleted and then unlawfully re-collected a data subject’s data after an objection and erasure request. The controller should have identified the will of the data subject and should have refrained from future processing for that purpose.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A data subject brought a complaint to the DPA in April 2022. The data subject requested an address publisher and direct marketing company (the controller) to delete all their personal data and no longer process it in the future, referring to both <a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17 GDPR</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR" title="Article 21 GDPR">Article 21 GDPR</a>. The controller deleted data at the request of the data subject, however later notified them that the data had been re-collected in an response to an information request by the data subject. The data was also transferred to direct marketing companies and address publishers. 
</p><p>The DPA upheld the complaint in March 2023, and stated that the controller processed the data unlawfully by reusing it for direct marketing purposes. According to the DPA, the data subject made a clear wish of wanting to prevent their data being processed for marketing purposes, and therefore the controller had violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(a) GDPR</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">5(2) GDPR</a> in conjunction with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#2" title="Article 21 GDPR">Article 21(2) GDPR</a>. The DPA saw no need to determine whether the data subject had carried out a request for erasure or a request for erasure and objection; according to the DPA, the request clearly showed the will of the data subject. 
</p><p>The controller appealed the decision to the Federal Administrative Court in April 2023. It argued that it had complied with the data subject’s deletion request; by completely deleting the data, it also deleted the data subject’s request to delete it. Therefore, re-collecting the data was a possibility. According to the controller, if the data subject had not requested to completely delete the data, it would have simply “blocked” the data from future processing. Furthermore, the data subject’s data was re-collected due to research performed by the controller. It is important to note here that the controller did not inform the data subject of the distinction between blocking the use of data for future marketing purposes and deleting the data (and potentially re-collecting it).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Court first stated that in order for data processing to be lawful, it must comply with both <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(a) GDPR</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a>. In cases of legitimate interest (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(f) GDPR</a>) a case by case balancing of interests must be done taking into account the legitimate interest of the controller, the necessity of processing, and the fundamental rights of the data subject. The Court highlighted the importance of the reasonable expectations of the data subject; fundamental rights of the data subjects may outweigh the legitimate interest of the controller in cases where the data subject does not expect further processing. However, while direct marketing may be a legitimate interest, the Court stated that <a href="/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#3" title="Article 21 GDPR">Article 21(3) GDPR</a> applies without weighing of interests once the data subject has exercised their right to objection. In addition, the data subject has the right to erasure of their data in accordance with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1c" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17(1)(c) GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>The Court drew inspiration from private law in considering whether the request of the data subject was for deletion or objection. The true will of the data subject must be determined through interpretation and inquiry if necessary. Here, the Court noted that a request for erasure may not necessarily be interpreted as erasure within the meaning of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17 GDPR</a>; the data subject may also mean a request to cease advertising and not the erasure of all data. 
</p><p>Applied to the case, the Court stated that the controller had a legitimate interest in processing data for direct marketing purposes. However, the balancing of interests for collecting the data and processing it again favours the data subject. According to the Court, the request sent by the data subject clearly showed that they (also) did not want their data to be processed for direct marketing purposes anymore. The controller has the responsibility of identifying the will of the data subject, as well as informing them of the consequences of completely and physically deleting their data. 
</p><p>The Court concluded that re-collecting the data violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(a) GDPR</a>, and that the controller could not rely on legitimate interest to collect and process this data.

Reasons for the decision:

I. Course of proceedings: Roman one. Course of proceedings:

1. With a submission initiating the proceedings dated April 23, 2022, which was amended after orders to rectify deficiencies with submissions dated May 5, 2022, and June 4, 2022, the co-participating party filed a complaint with the Data Protection Authority (hereinafter "the authority concerned"), arguing that the complainant had violated its right to confidentiality by failing to comply with the principles for the processing of personal data pursuant to Article 6 of the GDPR. Furthermore, its right to object had been violated. In 2019, she requested the deletion of her personal data stored by the complainant. After receiving confirmation of deletion, she again requested information about her personal data in 2022. She was informed that the data had been deleted at that time but had been collected again subsequently. At the same time, the complainant provided information within the meaning of the GDPR regarding the processed data (name, address, position in the household, household size, income, type of building) and pointed out that the data in question had been transmitted to direct marketing companies and address publishers. The co-participating party attached the complainant's information dated April 21, 2022, to the complaint. With a submission initiating the proceedings dated April 23, 2022, which was improved following orders to rectify deficiencies with submissions dated May 5, 2022, and June 4, 2022, the co-participating party filed a complaint with the data protection authority (hereinafter referred to as the "competent authority"), arguing that the complainant had violated its right to confidentiality by failing to comply with the principles for the processing of personal data pursuant to Article 6 of the GDPR. Furthermore, its right to object had been violated. In 2019, it had requested the deletion of its personal data stored by the complainant. After receiving confirmation of deletion, it requested information about its personal data again in 2022, but was informed that the data had been deleted at that time but had subsequently been collected again. At the same time, the complainant had requested information within the meaning of GDPR regarding the processed data (name, address, position in the household, household size, income, building type) and pointed out that the data in question had been transmitted to direct marketing companies and address publishers. The co-participating party attached the complainant's information dated April 21, 2022, to the complaint.

2. In a written submission dated June 28, 2022, the complainant, represented by a lawyer, submitted a statement and summarized that she "had not committed the alleged violation of the right to confidentiality." She stated that in 2019, she had carried out the deletion requested by the co-participating party, deleted all existing data, and confirmed this to the co-participating party. In principle, in the case of revocations/deletions, only the data is initially blocked to ensure that the data is not collected again; however, the co-participating party wanted the data to be completely (physically) deleted. Her data was then apparently added back to the database as part of the research.

The admissibility of the data processing arises from Section 151 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) (address publishers and direct marketing companies) in conjunction with Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The admissibility of the data processing arises from Section 151 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) (address publishers and direct marketing companies) in conjunction with Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

3. In a letter dated October 3, 2022, the co-participating party submitted a statement and stated in summary that it wanted all data concerning it to be deleted and not processed in the future.

4. In a letter dated March 9, 2023, the co-participating party stated that it no longer had the request for deletion or objection from June 2019, but provided the complainant with the confirmation of deletion.

5. By the contested decision of March 13, 2023, the data protection complaint was upheld and it was determined that the complainant had violated the co-participating party's right to confidentiality by using the data subject's data for direct marketing purposes again despite the previously raised objection and by subsequently processing the data unlawfully from August 2, 2019.

In its justification, the authority concerned stated that a balance of interests had to be struck between the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject and the legitimate interests of the controller (in this specific case, the interest in conducting direct marketing measures). It could remain undecided whether the co-participating party's request was described as an (isolated) request for deletion or as a (simultaneous) request for deletion and objection, since the objective explanatory value of the letter already clearly shows the co-participating party's intention, specifically aimed at preventing the complainant from processing data for marketing purposes. The specific circumstances of the case were taken into account by the legislature in Section 151 (8) of the German Trade Code (GewO). As a result, the complainant violated the co-participating party's right to confidentiality by violating its obligations under Section 151 (8) of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) and Article 5 (1) (a) and (2) (in conjunction with Article 21 (2) GDPR, and subsequently unlawfully processing the co-participating party's data. The authority in question justified its decision by stating that a balance of interests had to be struck between the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject and the legitimate interests of the controller (in this specific case, the interest in conducting direct marketing measures). It could remain undecided whether the co-participating party's request was described as an (isolated) request for deletion or as a (simultaneously filed) request for deletion and objection, since the objective explanatory value of the letter already clearly demonstrated the co-participating party's intention, specifically aimed at preventing the complainant from processing data for marketing purposes. The specific case scenario was considered by the legislature in Section 151, Paragraph 8, of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO). As a result, the complainant violated the co-participating party's right to confidentiality by violating its obligations under Section 151, Paragraph 8, of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) and Article 5, Paragraph 1, Letter a and Paragraph 2, in conjunction with Article 21, Paragraph 2, of the GDPR, and subsequently unlawfully processing the co-participating party's data.

6. In its appeal against the decision dated April 10, 2023, the complainant essentially reiterated its previous arguments. The co-participating party's request for deletion was formulated unambiguously. A mere blocking of the data would have led to a deliberate violation of Article 17 of the GDPR and would have given rise to liability for damages. 6. In its appeal against the decision dated April 10, 2023, the complainant essentially reiterated its previous arguments. The party involved's request for deletion was formulated unambiguously. Simply blocking the data would have constituted a deliberate violation of Article 17 GDPR and would have triggered liability for damages.

7. By letter dated May 3, 2023, the respondent authority submitted the procedural file to the Federal Administrative Court for a decision, denied the appeal in its entirety, referred in its entirety to the decision, and requested that the Federal Administrative Court decide on the matter itself.

8. In its statement of September 11, 2023, the appellant essentially repeated its previous submissions.

9. By letter dated June 21, 2024, the court of first instance requested the appellant to submit the co-participating party's request for deletion dated July 17, 2019, as well as any further correspondence with the co-participating party in this matter, in particular the letter pursuant to Section 151 (8) of the Trade Regulation Act (GewO) informing about the possible consequences of physical deletion and the co-participating party's response to it. By letter dated June 21, 2024, the court requested the appellant to submit the co-participating party's request for deletion dated July 17, 2019, as well as any further correspondence with the co-participating party in this matter, in particular the letter pursuant to Section 151, Paragraph 8, of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) informing the complainant about the possible consequences of physical deletion and the co-participating party's response thereto.

10. By document submission dated July 15, 2024, the complainant submitted the co-participating party's request for deletion dated July 17, 2019, the complainant's confirmation of deletion dated August 6, 2019, the co-participating party's request for data disclosure dated April 9, 2022, the complainant's information dated April 20, 2022, and the co-participating party's letter to the respondent authority dated April 23, 2022. The submitted documents were forwarded to the respondent authority and the co-participating party for information.

II. The Federal Administrative Court considered:

1. Findings:

1.1. The complainant holds a trade license as an "address publisher and direct marketing company" pursuant to Section 151 of the Trade Regulation Act 1994 (GewO 1994). This means that, under the conditions specified in the law, it is authorized to obtain personal data from publicly available information, by interviewing data subjects, from customer and prospect file systems of third parties, or from the marketing file systems of other address publishers and direct marketing companies. 1.1. The complainant holds a trade license as an "address publisher and direct marketing company" pursuant to Section 151 of the Trade Regulation Act 1994. This means that, under the conditions specified in the law, it is authorized to obtain personal data from publicly available information, by interviewing data subjects, from customer and prospect file systems of third parties, or from the marketing file systems of other address publishers and direct marketing companies.

1.2. The complainant processed data of the co-participating party. The co-participating party addressed the following request to the complainant in a letter dated July 17, 2019, which was received by the complainant on August 2, 2019:

Subject: Request for objection and deletion pursuant to Articles 17 and 21 GDPR

Dear Sir or Madam,

[…]

Since you process my personal data for direct marketing purposes, I object to the processing. My data may therefore no longer be processed for these purposes.

In accordance with Article 17 (1) (c) GDPR, I request that you immediately delete the data you have stored about me. Furthermore, I would like to ensure that the deletion is also carried out by the entities to whom you have transmitted my data. In accordance with Article 17 (1) (c) GDPR, I request that you delete the data you have stored about me. I request that you immediately delete all data stored about me. Furthermore, I would like to ensure that the deletion is also carried out by the entities to whom you have provided my data.

I request that you accept the objection and confirm the deletion. […]"

1.3. The complainant subsequently deleted all personal data of the co-participating party (apart from the objection and deletion request dated July 17, 2019) and confirmed this as follows in a letter dated August 6, 2019:

"Dear Ms. XXXX! "Dear Ms. Römische 40!

Based on your letter dated August 2, 2019, we hereby confirm, for the sake of order, that we have completely (physically) deleted your data.

[…]"

Before deleting the data, the complainant did not inform the co-participating party that completely deleting all data (instead of blocking its use for marketing mailings) could result in this data being collected again and processed for direct marketing purposes.

1.4. After the co-participating party's personal data had been deleted, it was collected again by the complainant, stored, and transmitted to third parties.

1.5. On April 9, 2022, the co-participating party submitted a request for information to the complainant pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR, which was answered in a letter dated April 21, 2022, in part as follows (typo in the original):1.5. On April 9, 2022, the co-participating party submitted a request for information pursuant to Article 15 of the GDPR to the complainant, which was answered in part as follows by letter dated April 21, 2022 (typo in the original):

"Re: Information pursuant to Article 15 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - Your request for information dated April 9, 2022"Re: Information pursuant to Article 15 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - Your request for information dated April 9, 2022

Dear Ms. XXXX, Dear Ms. Römische 40,

Regarding your inquiry dated April 9, 2022, we will provide you with the requested information about the personal data we process about you at the time of your inquiry within the one-month period specified in the GDPR, and answer the questions posed to us as follows:

[…]

As we understand from this As you can see, your data was completely physically deleted by us due to your deletion request dated July 17, 2019, and we also informed you of this in a letter dated August 6, 2019.

Due to this complete deletion, your data, and thus your revocation of the data processing, were no longer available to us, and in the course of the current response to the information request, it had to be determined that your data had obviously been collected by us again.

To avoid this in the future, we have now blocked your data since your request, i.e., your data will no longer be transmitted, collected, or processed since the blocking. The blocking therefore prevents further collection, as the blocking of your data is permanently recorded by us.

The specified data set therefore represents the data set at the time of the blocking, and we ask you to consider this accordingly. Unfortunately, in our opinion, a complete (physical) deletion of your data is currently not possible in order to permanently ensure that we will not process your data. (as happened) will be collected or determined again, and we ask for your understanding in this regard.

However, should you wish to have your data completely (physically) deleted, please notify us accordingly. However, we must point out that in this case, a renewed collection, determination, and processing of your data cannot be ruled out, as your data, and therefore your revocation of the data processing, will no longer be available to us.

Information pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR for Ms. XXXX Information pursuant to Article 15 GDPR for Ms. Römische 40

[…]

1.6. By email dated April 23, 2022, the participating party again requested the deletion of the personal data and objected to the processing of the data.

2. Evaluation of evidence:

2.1. The findings regarding the correspondence between the co-participating party and the complainant in 2019 and 2022 are based on the undisputed submissions of both parties in this regard, as well as the documents submitted by the complainant on July 15, 2024 (OZ 7). Likewise, the complainant's trade license under Section 151 of the Trade Regulation Act (GewO) is undisputed. 2.1. The findings regarding the correspondence between the co-participating party and the complainant in 2019 and 2022 are based on the undisputed submissions of both parties in this regard, as well as the documents submitted by the complainant on July 15, 2024 (OZ 7). Likewise, the complainant's trade license under Section 151 of the Trade Regulation Act (GewO) is undisputed.

2.2. The finding that the co-participating party received no information in 2019 about the possible consequences of a complete physical deletion of the data is based on the fact that no such information emerges from the entire correspondence submitted by the complainant (OZ 7). Rather, the complainant consistently argued that the co-participating party's request was unequivocally directed at physical deletion and not at blocking use (see, in particular, the complaint, p. 4). 2.2. The finding that the co-participating party received no information in 2019 about the possible consequences of a complete physical deletion of the data is based on the fact that no such information emerges from the entire correspondence submitted by the complainant (OZ 7). Rather, the complainant consistently argued that the co-participating party's request was unequivocally directed at physical deletion and not at blocking use (see, in particular, the complaint, session 4).

2.3. The fact that the data in question were completely deleted in 2019 and subsequently collected again is evident from the data protection complaint of the co-participating party, the complainant's letter of information dated 21 April 2022 and the complainant's submissions in the proceedings before the authority concerned and before the Federal Administrative Court, and is also undisputed in this respect.

3. Legal Assessment:

The admissible appeal is unfounded.

Regarding A) Dismissal of the appeal:

3.1. Subject Matter:

The subject matter of the proceedings is the question whether the complainant violated the co-participating party's right to confidentiality by collecting and processing their personal data again after the co-participating party had filed a request for erasure and objection.

The question of whether the complainant violated the co-participating party's right to erasure or objection – insofar as the co-participating party's submission of June 4, 2022, can be understood as an assertion of a violation of these rights – is not relevant to the proceedings, especially since the authority concerned did not address this in the contested decision. If the Federal Administrative Court were to now rule on this, the decision would be unlawful due to lack of jurisdiction (VwGH January 27, 2016, Ra 2014/10/0038).

3.2. Regarding the alleged violation of the right to confidentiality:

According to Section 1 (1) of the Data Protection Act, everyone has the right to confidentiality of personal data concerning them, in particular with regard to respect for their private and family life, provided that there is a legitimate interest in doing so. The existence of such an interest is excluded if data is not accessible to a claim of confidentiality due to its general availability or its inability to trace back to the data subject. According to Section 1 (1) of the Data Protection Act, everyone has the right to confidentiality of personal data concerning them, in particular with regard to respect for their private and family life, provided that there is a legitimate interest in doing so. The existence of such an interest is excluded if data is not subject to a confidentiality claim due to its general availability or its inability to trace back to the data subject.

To the extent that the use of personal data is not in the vital interest of the data subject or with their consent, restrictions on the right to confidentiality are only permissible to protect the overriding legitimate interests of another person (Section 1 (2) of the Data Protection Act). To the extent that the use of personal data is not in the vital interest of the data subject or with their consent, restrictions on the right to confidentiality are only permissible to protect the overriding legitimate interests of another person (Section 1 (2) of the Data Protection Act).

The processing of personal data is permissible if it is carried out – in compliance with the processing principles set out in Article 5 (1) of the GDPR – on the basis of one of the legal grounds set out in Article 6 of the GDPR.

Art. 5 GDPR sets out the principles for the processing of personal data (principle of lawfulness, fairness, transparency [Art. 5 (1) (a)], purpose limitation principle [Art. 5 (1) (b)], data minimization principle [Art. 5 (1) (c)], accuracy principle [Art. 5 (1) (d)], storage limitation principle [Art. 5 (1) (e)], integrity and confidentiality principle [Art. 5 (1) (f)], accountability principle [Art. 5 (2)], cf. Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Art. 5 GDPR [as of 1 December 2020, rdb.at]). The principle of “good faith” must be applied to the entire legal system – including the Trade Code (cf. VwGH 17.05.2023, Ro 2021/13/0023). Fair processing must be within the bounds of what the data subject must expect in the light of the entire legal system and must be designed in the way the controller presents it to the outside world (cf., among others, Recital 38 of Directive 95/46/EC; and VwGH 17.05.2023, Ro 2021/13/0023). Article 5 of the GDPR sets out the principles for the processing of personal data (principle of lawfulness, fairness, transparency [Article 5(1)(a)], principle of purpose limitation [Article 5(1)(b)], principle of data minimization [Article 5(1)(c)], principle of accuracy [Article 5(1)(d)], principle of storage limitation [Article 5(1)(e)], principle of integrity and confidentiality [Article 5(1)(e)]. 5 paragraph one, letter f, ],, principle of accountability [Article 5 paragraph 2 ],, see Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Article 5, GDPR [as of December 1, 2020, rdb.at]). The principle of "good faith" must be based on the entire legal system – including the Trade Regulation Act (Gewerbeordnung) (see Administrative Court of Justice, May 17, 2023, Ro 2021/13/0023). Processing in good faith must be within the bounds of what the data subject must expect in light of the entire legal system and be structured in the way the controller presents it to the outside world (see, among others, Recital 38 of Directive 95/46/EC; and Administrative Court of Justice, May 17, 2023, Ro 2021/13/0023).

The requirements for lawful data processing are specified in Article 6 of the GDPR. According to this, the lawfulness of any processing requires that – cumulatively with the other principles regulated in Article 5 (1) – the processing must satisfy at least one of the legal grounds exhaustively defined in Article 6 (1) of the GDPR (see Heberlein in Ehmann/Selmayr, General Data Protection Regulation 3, Article 6, para. 1). The requirements for lawful data processing are specified in Article 6 of the GDPR. According to this, the lawfulness of any processing requires that – cumulatively with the other principles regulated in Article 5 (1) – the processing must satisfy at least one of the legal grounds exhaustively defined in Article 6 (1) of the GDPR (see Heberlein in Ehmann/Selmayr, General Data Protection Regulation 3, Article 6, para. 1).

Data processing is lawful on the basis of a legitimate interest (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR) if the processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data prevail. According to this provision, a case-by-case balancing of interests must generally be carried out, in which the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party in the processing must be balanced against the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data (for the comparable predecessor provision of Article 7 (f) of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, see ECJ 4 May 2017, C-13/16, Rīgas satiksme, paragraph 31). The ECJ has established a "test scheme" for the predecessor provision of Article 7(f) of the Data Protection Directive, according to which the processing of personal data is permissible under three cumulative conditions: Data processing is lawful on the basis of a legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) if the processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data, prevail. According to this provision, a case-by-case balancing of interests must generally be carried out, in which the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party in the processing must be weighed against the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require the protection of personal data (for the comparable predecessor provision of Article 7(f) of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, see ECJ 4 May 2017, C-13/16, Rīgas satiksme, para. 31). The ECJ has established a "test scheme" for the predecessor provision of Article 7(f) of the Data Protection Directive, according to which the processing of personal data is permissible under three cumulative conditions:

1. Existence of a legitimate interest pursued by the controller or by the third party(ies) to whom the data are disclosed

2. Necessity of processing the personal data to achieve that legitimate interest and

3. No override by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.

In this context, the interests of the controller and third parties (e.g., potential customers of the complainant) must be taken into account, as must the interests, rights, and expectations of the data subject, while also examining whether, at the time the personal data are collected and in the context of the collection, the data subject could reasonably foresee that processing for that purpose might take place. In particular, when personal data are processed in situations where a data subject cannot reasonably be expected to require further processing, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could override the interests of the controller (Recital 47 GDPR). The legitimate interest may arise from the entire legal system (Haidinger in Knyrim, Datenschutzrecht4, Chapter 5, para. 5.76). The processing of personal data for the purposes of direct marketing can also be regarded as processing serving a legitimate interest according to Recital 47 of the GDPR. Originally, the Commission envisaged the requirement of consent to data processing for direct marketing purposes in its proposals for the GDPR, but ultimately abandoned this idea and instead merely provided for a right of objection for the data subject, as is now also the case in Art.21 (2) GDPR. If this right of objection is exercised, it immediately triggers the legal consequences of paragraph 3, without the need to provide special reasons and without the need to balance interests (Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Art. 21 GDPR (as of December 1, 2020, rdb.at), para. 23; cf. Eckhardt, DSK Orientation Guide Direct Marketing: Everything Clarified?, Communication and Law 05/2019, 296; Guidance from the supervisory authorities on the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of February 2022; Plath/Grages, "Let's stay in touch" - Direct Marketing under the GDPR, CR 2018, 773/774). The same must apply if the data subject has not been informed, or has not been properly informed, of their right to object in accordance with Art. 21 (4) (Buchner/Petri in Kühling/Buchner, GDPR – BDSG², Art. 6, para. 176). In doing so, the interests of the controller and third parties (e.g., potential customers of the complainant) must be taken into account, as well as the interests, rights, and expectations of the data subject, while also examining whether, at the time the personal data are collected and in light of the circumstances in which they are collected, a data subject can reasonably foresee that processing for this purpose might take place. In particular, if personal data are processed in situations in which a data subject cannot reasonably expect further processing, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could outweigh the interests of the controller (Recital 47 GDPR). The legitimate interest may arise from the entire legal system (Haidinger in Knyrim, Datenschutzrecht4, Chapter 5, para. 5.76). According to Recital 47 of the GDPR, the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes can also be considered as processing based on a legitimate interest. Originally, the Commission's proposals for the GDPR still required consent to data processing for direct marketing purposes, but ultimately abandoned this requirement and instead provided only for a right of objection for the data subject, as now also stipulated in Article 21, Paragraph 2, of the GDPR. If this right of objection is exercised, it immediately triggers the legal consequences of paragraph 3, without the need to provide special reasons and without the need to weigh up interests (Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Article 21, GDPR (as of December 1, 2020, rdb.at) para. 23; compare Eckhardt, DSK Orientation Guide Direct Marketing: Everything clarified?, Communication and Law 05/2019, 296; Guidance from the supervisory authorities on the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of February 2022; Plath/Grages, “Let’s stay in touch” – Direct Marketing under the GDPR, CR 2018, 773/774). The same applies if the data subject has not been informed, or has not been properly informed, of their right to object in accordance with Article 21, paragraph 4 (Buchner/Petri in Kühling/Buchner, GDPR – BDSG², Article 6, margin no. 176).

Advertising is defined in Article 2(a) of EU Directive 2006/114/EC of December 12, 2006, concerning misleading and comparative advertising as "any statement made in the exercise of a trade, business, craft, or profession with the aim of promoting the sale of goods or the provision of services, including immovable property, rights, and obligations." The "address publishers and direct marketing companies" business falls under the category of advertising companies (Stolzlechner/Müller/Seider/Vogelgesang/Höllbacher, GewO4 (2020), Section 151 GewO, margin no. 1). Advertising measures are indispensable in a market-oriented economic system. It is therefore the legitimate purpose of every trader to collect or process data for the purpose of conducting advertising campaigns (Stolzlechner/Müller/Seider/Vogelgesang/Höllbacher, GewO4 (2020) on Section 151 GewO, margin number 1). Advertising is defined in Article 2, letter a, of EU Directive 2006/114/EC of December 12, 2006, concerning misleading and comparative advertising as "any statement made in the exercise of a trade, business, craft, or profession with the aim of promoting the sale of goods or the provision of services, including immovable property, rights, and obligations." The "address publishers and direct marketing companies" business belongs to the group of advertising companies (Stolzlechner/Müller/Seider/Vogelgesang/Höllbacher, GewO4 (2020), Paragraph 151, GewO, Rz 1). Advertising measures are indispensable in a market-oriented economic system. It is therefore part of the legitimate purpose of every trader to collect or process data for the purpose of conducting advertising campaigns (Stolzlechner/Müller/Seider/Vogelgesang/Höllbacher, GewO4 (2020) on Paragraph 151, GewO, Rz 1).

According to Art. 21 (2) GDPR, the data subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for direct marketing purposes if personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes. If the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes (Article 21 (3) GDPR). Pursuant to Article 21 (2) GDPR, the data subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for direct marketing purposes if personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes. If the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes (Article 21 (3) GDPR).

Pursuant to Article 17(1)(c) GDPR, the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller is obliged to erase personal data without undue delay if the data subject objects to processing pursuant to Article 21(2). Pursuant to Article 17(1)(c) GDPR, the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller is obliged to erase personal data without undue delay if the data subject objects to processing pursuant to Article 21(2).

Section 151, Paragraph 8, Sentence 3 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) also stipulates that deletion must take the form of blocking the use of this data for marketing mailings, provided that the data subject – after being appropriately informed about the possible consequences of physically deleting their data – does not insist on the physical deletion of their data.

Section 151, Paragraph 8, Sentence 3 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) also stipulates that deletion must take the form of blocking the use of this data for marketing mailings, provided that the data subject – after being appropriately informed about the possible consequences of physically deleting their data – does not insist on the physical deletion of their data.

To assess whether a request recognizable to the recipient as a request for deletion or a request to object exists, the request must be examined for its content, applying the same standard that also applies to unilateral declarations of intent under private law. Accordingly, the wording and understanding of the declaration must be viewed objectively, namely, as the recipient could understand it based on its wording and purpose when viewed objectively (see the case law of the Supreme Court, including the judgment of July 10, 1996, 9 Ob A2139/96s; September 15, 1999, 9 Ob A148/99a, and many others). When determining the nature of the application, it is not the applicant's designation that matters, but rather the content of the submission, i.e., the applicant's discernible and inferable objective (analogously, Administrative Court of Justice, March 19, 2013, 2012/21/0082).

In the event of an objection, the true will of the data subject must be determined through interpretation and, if necessary, inquiry. A request for erasure is not necessarily to be interpreted as erasure within the meaning of Art. 17 (Schulz in Gola/Heckmann, GDPR BDSG³ Art. 21 paras. 23 and 24, with reference to the guidance provided by the German supervisory authorities on the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as of February 2022). A data subject's declaration may also be interpreted to mean that they are not requesting the erasure of all data, but only the cessation of advertising. In this case, including the data subject's contact details in an advertising blocking file is the appropriate means of taking their wishes into account (Herbst in Kühling/Buchner, GDPR4 Art. 21 para. 32a). This procedure is also proposed in the code of conduct pursuant to Art. 40 GDPR for the practice of the business of address publishers and direct marketing companies pursuant to Section 151 of the Trade Regulation Act 1994 (approved by decision of the Data Protection Authority dated August 7, 2020, Ref. No. 2020-0.467.339). In the event of an objection, the true will of the data subject must be determined through interpretation and, if necessary, inquiry.

A data subject's declaration may also be interpreted to mean that they are not requesting the erasure of all data, but only the cessation of advertising. In this case, including the data subject's contact details in an advertising blocking file is the appropriate means of taking their wishes into account (Herbst in Kühling/Buchner, GDPR4 Article 21, para. 32a).

No. 2020-0.467.339).

The following results from this for the specific facts of the case:

It is undisputed that the complainant processed personal data of the co-participating party in this specific case and that it is to be considered the controller in this regard.

It is also undisputed that the complainant has the commercial authorization of an address publisher and direct marketing company. In view of the legal situation outlined above, data processing is only permissible if a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR is pursued and the principles of Art. 5 GDPR are observed. The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes can – as explained – be considered a legitimate interest (cf. Recital 47; Administrative Court of Justice (VwGH) February 1, 2024, Ro 2021/04/0016 with further references). It is also undisputed that the complainant has the commercial authorization of an address publisher and direct marketing company. In view of the legal situation outlined above, data processing is only permissible if a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6, paragraph 1, letter f, GDPR is pursued and the principles of Article 5, GDPR are observed. The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes can – as explained – be regarded as a legitimate interest (see Recital 47; Administrative Court of Justice of February 1, 2024, Ro 2021/04/0016 with further references).

No indications have emerged that raise concerns about the necessity of processing the data of the co-participating party to pursue this legitimate interest.

However, with regard to the renewed collection and processing of the co-participating party's data after the previous deletion, the balancing of interests tips in favor of the co-participating party for the following reasons:

In the present case, the co-participating party, after becoming aware of the initial data processing, submitted an objection to the data processing, along with a request for deletion, to the complainant. In the opinion of the court, the wording of the deletion and objection requests addressed to the complainant is by no means to be clearly interpreted as a request for deletion of all processed data. Rather, as stated, the letter (also) indicates that the complainant wishes her data to no longer be processed for direct marketing purposes. In the opinion of the court, the complainant should therefore have at least ascertained the true intention of the co-participating party, informed the co-participating party of the consequences of deletion, while simultaneously explaining the possibility of transferring the (master) data required for identification to a blocked file (e.g., while simultaneously deleting all other data (e.g., position in the household, language, income, etc.), and ascertained whether the co-participating party nevertheless insisted on complete deletion of the data. Only if the co-participating party had continued to request the deletion of all its data would complete deletion have been necessary. However, the complainant failed to inform the co-participating party of this within the meaning of Section 151 (8) of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) and, in accordance with this provision, should have merely blocked the processing of the data. The provision of Section 151 (8) of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) serves to prevent precisely such situations in which data subjects exercise their right to deletion of data concerning them, but are then affected by further data processing. Furthermore, regardless of from the provision of Section 151 (8) of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) – as explained above – with regard to the provisions of Article 21 (2) and Article 17 (1) (c) GDPR, the Court of Justice is of the opinion that a request for erasure is not necessarily to be interpreted as a request for deletion, but that the data subject's declaration may also be interpreted as meaning that the request is not for erasure, but for the cessation of advertising. In the present case, the co-participating party, after becoming aware of the initial data processing, submitted an objection to the data processing, combined with a request for erasure, to the complainant. In the opinion of the court, the wording of the request for erasure and objection addressed to the complainant is by no means to be clearly interpreted as a request for erasure of all processed data. Rather, it can be inferred from the letter – as established – that the complainant wishes that her data will no longer be processed for direct marketing purposes. In the opinion of the court, the complainant would therefore have in any case disregarded the true intention of the co-participating party. must determine, inform the co-participating party of the consequences of deletion and at the same time explain the possibility of transferring the (master) data required for identification to a blocked file (e.g. with the simultaneous deletion of all other data (e.g. position in the household, language, income, etc.) and must find out whether the co-participating party nevertheless insists on complete deletion of the data. Only if the co-participating party had continued to request the deletion of all its data would complete deletion have been necessary. However, the complainant failed to inform the co-participating party of this within the meaning of Section 151, Paragraph 8, GewO and, in accordance with this provision, should have only blocked the processing of the data. The provision of Section 151, Paragraph 8, GewO serves to prevent precisely those situations in which data subjects exercise the right to deletion of data concerning them, but are then affected by further data processing. Furthermore, regardless of the provision of Section 151, Paragraph 8, GewO – as explained above – with regard to the The provisions of Article 21, paragraph 2 and Article 17, paragraph 1, letter c, GDPR are of the opinion that a request for erasure is not necessarily to be interpreted as a request for deletion, but rather that the data subject's declaration may also be interpreted to the effect that the data subject is requesting not deletion, but rather the cessation of advertising.

It is not overlooked that the violation of information obligations generally has no impact on the lawfulness of the processing (VwGH 9 May 2023, Ro 2020/04/0037 with further references). In this specific case, however, due to the lack of information pursuant to Section 151 (8) of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) and the lack of substantiation of their true intentions, the participating party was unable to assess the disadvantages of complete deletion compared to transfer to a blocking file, which is why their decision-making process with regard to the decision between complete deletion and a blocking of use was impaired. It is not overlooked that the violation of information obligations generally has no impact on the The legality of the processing (VwGH May 9, 2023, Ro 2020/04/0037 with further references). In this specific case, however, due to the lack of information pursuant to Section 151, Paragraph 8, of the Trade Regulation Act (GewO) and the lack of substantiation of the party's true intention, the party involved was unable to assess the disadvantages of complete deletion compared to transfer to a blocking file, which is why its decision-making process with regard to the decision between complete deletion and a blocking of use was impaired.

In this context, it should be noted that the complainant was able to submit the complainant's request for deletion and objection dated July 17, 2019 – contrary to what was stated in its information dated April 21, 2022 – in the present proceedings upon the court's request and thus evidently did not delete it. The complainant therefore also had continuous information that the party involved did not wish any further processing of its data for direct marketing purposes. Conversely, the The co-participating party, based on their request, can trust that their data will not be processed again for these purposes.

3.3. Result:

The court is of the opinion that, overall, the complainant should have investigated the co-participating party's true wishes after receiving the objection and deletion request and informed them of the possible consequences of complete physical deletion in order to enable them to make an informed decision.

The co-participating party, however, was entitled to assume that their data would no longer be processed by the complainant for direct marketing purposes based on their request, in which they stated that they did not wish their data to be further processed for direct marketing purposes. This expectation must be taken into account in favor of the co-participating party when balancing the interests of the complainant in the course of the renewed collection of data.

For this reason, it can be assumed that the renewed collection and processing of the co-participating party's personal data was contrary to Art. 5 (1) (a) GDPR, and not Art. 6 (1) GDPR. lit. f GDPR and was therefore unlawful. The fact that the co-participating party continues to demand the physical deletion of the data, despite the information now provided in the course of the renewed request for deletion pursuant to Section 151 Paragraph 8 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO), is not to be taken into account when assessing the (upstream) collection and processing that is the subject of the proceedings. For this reason, it can be assumed that the renewed collection and processing of the co-participating party's personal data was contrary to Article 5 Paragraph 1 Letter a GDPR and cannot be based on Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f GDPR and was therefore unlawful. The fact that the co-participating party continues to demand the physical deletion of the data, despite the information now provided in the course of the renewed request for deletion pursuant to Section 151 Paragraph 8 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO), is not to be taken into account when assessing the (upstream) collection and processing that is the subject of the proceedings.

3.4. On the waiver of the oral hearing:

According to Section 24(1) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court must hold a public oral hearing upon request or, if it deems it necessary, ex officio. According to Section 24(1) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court must hold a public oral hearing upon request or, if it deems it necessary, ex officio.

According to Section 24(4) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court may, notwithstanding a party's request, waive a hearing if the records indicate that the oral discussion is unlikely to provide further clarification of the legal matter, and neither Article 6(1) of the ECHR nor Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights preclude waiving the hearing. Pursuant to Section 24, Paragraph 4, of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court may – unless otherwise provided by federal or state law – dispense with a hearing, notwithstanding a party's request, if the records indicate that the oral argument is unlikely to further clarify the legal matter, and if neither Article 6, Paragraph 1, of the ECHR nor Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights preclude dispensing with a hearing.

In the present case, the omission of an oral hearing could be based on the fact that the facts of the case had been clarified from the records and were not substantively contested. Therefore, holding a public oral hearing could not contribute to clarifying the facts and was therefore omitted.

Regarding B) Admissibility of an appeal on points of law:

Pursuant to Section 25a, Paragraph 1, of the Administrative Court Act (VwGG), the administrative court must state in its decision or order whether the appeal on points of law is admissible pursuant to Article 133, Paragraph 4 of the Federal Constitutional Act (B-VG). The decision must be briefly justified. Pursuant to Section 25a, Paragraph 1, of the Administrative Court Act (VwGG), the administrative court must state in its ruling or decision whether the appeal is admissible pursuant to Article 133, Paragraph 4, of the Federal Constitutional Court Act (B-VG). The ruling must be briefly justified.

The appeal is admissible pursuant to Article 133, Paragraph 4, of the Federal Constitutional Court Act (B-VG) because there is currently no supreme court jurisprudence on the relationship between Article 21, Paragraph 2, Article 17, Paragraph 1, Letter c, GDPR, and Section 151, Paragraph 8, Trade Regulation Act (GewO) (in particular, on the consequences of a failure to provide information pursuant to Section 151, Paragraph 8, Trade Regulation Act). This legal question is of fundamental importance. The appeal is admissible pursuant to Article 133, Paragraph 4, of the Federal Constitutional Law (B-VG) because no supreme court case law has yet addressed the relationship between Article 21, Paragraph 2, Article 17, Paragraph 1, Letter c, of the GDPR and Section 151, Paragraph 8, of the Trade Regulation Act (GewO) (in particular, the consequences of a failure to provide information under Section 151, Paragraph 8, of the Trade Regulation Act). This legal question is of fundamental importance.

The decision was therefore based on the ruling.
