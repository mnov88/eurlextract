<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a data subject with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) stating that, after being a guest in a hotel, they they were warned about their ID card having been found, along with their personal information, on an adults website.
</p><p>Also, the data subject addressed an access request access to the hotel, that informed them that the day the data subject checked in, the reception desk was closed and the person who scanned their ID card was an employee of the building's owners association, that managed the entry/exit of the guests outside opening hours.
</p><p>Additionally, the DPA, while verifying the controller's website, found that its cookie banner did not have a link to the cookie policy, nor sufficient information, and used unnecessary cookies before obtaining consent, as well as did not allow to reject consent only for the unwanted cookies. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD concluded that the defendant had infringed Article 28(3) of the GDPR, since the controller did not have a data processing agreement with the processor (building's owners association) to govern the processing of personal data. Consequently, the AEPD fined the controller €5000 for the infringement of Article 28(3) GDPR. 
</p><p>Besides that, AEPD fined the controller €2000 for infringing Article 22 of the Spanish Law implementing the e-Privacy Directive (LSSI), for not properly informing the users about the use of cookies and for placing unnecessary cookies without consent, without the possibility of individually rejecting them.
</p><p>In total, the AEPD fined the controller €7000, that were reduced to €4200 due to early and voluntary payment and recognizing its responsibility.
