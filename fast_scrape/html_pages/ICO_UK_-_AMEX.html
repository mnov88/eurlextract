<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>Between 1 June 2018 to 31 May 2019, a total of 4,098,841 direct marketing messages were sent to subscribers who had opted-out to receiving marketing emails by, or at the instigation, of AMEX. These messages contained direct marketing material for which subscribers had not provided adequate consent. AMEX says the emails had not been classified as "marketing emails" but "servicing" emails " feeling that Card Members would be at a disadvantage if they were not aware of these campaigns and promotional periods". They consequently argued such emails did not demand consent under the UK PECR. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The ICO was satisfied that these emails constituted "direct marketing" as defined by section 122(5) of the UK Data Protection Act 2018, because each of the emails encouraged customers to use their AMEX credit cards to make purchases. One category of emails (the AMEX app emails) also encouraged customers to download and/or use the AMEX app. Additionally, the ICO pointed out that AMEX's "International Email Policy - United Kingdom" indicates that "servicing" emails involve advertising and marketing content.   
</p><p>The ICO considered that the contravention was serious as between the 12-month period, a confirmed total of 4,098,841 direct marketing messages were sent containing direct marketing material for which subscribers had not provided adequate consent. Further, AMEX had failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the contraventions.  
</p><p>The ICO therefore fined AMEX £90,000.  
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>Despite several customers complaints, AMEX failed to review its marketing model. Customers are becoming increasingly aware of their rights. The best marketing could become respecting customers options. ICO has reacted particularly promptly to the complaints in this case.

       contract."


8.    Recital 43 of the GDPR states:

     Background to the case



16.  AMEX is a financial services company which is well-known for providing
     a range of credit card services, including premium cards with annual

     fees.It is a wholly owned subsidiary of American Express Company, its
     US-based  parent company, and was incorporated on 16 July 1984.

     AMEX's registered office is at Belgrave House, 76 Buckingham Palace

     Road, London, SWl W 9AX. There are currently 9 active officers on
     Companies House, with 55 resigned officers. AMEX has been registered

                                   5                                                             •

                                                            ICO.
                                                            Information Commissioner's Office

     with the InformationCommissioner's Office ("ICO") since 19 June
     2006 (registrationnumber Z9506659).


17.  The unsolicited marketing in question first came to the Commissioner's

     attention after she received three complaints from AMEX customers in
     April and May 2019. Each individual had continued to receive

     marketing emails from AMEX despite opting-out from receiving them.


18.  The first and second complaints concerned emails containing
     promotions which linked to AMEX webpages containing offers available

     to AMEX customers. The third complaint related to an email
     encouraging the subscriber to download the AMEX app to view their

     loyalty points balance and explore the latest products and savings

     available to them.

19.  Two of these complainants had complained directly to AMEX before

     complaining to the Commissioner. They provided AMEX's response to
     their complaints (dated 26 March 2019 and 9 May 2019 respectively).

     AMEX stated that, though the subscribers were opted-out from

     receiving marketing emails, the emails had not been classified as
     "marketing emails" (defined by AMEX as emails "providing customers

     with informationin relation to extra products or services, or to renew
     contracts that are coming to an end"). Instead, AMEX classified the

     emails as "servicing" emails and dismissed the two complaints on this

     basis. In one of its responses, AMEX stated that, "we feel that Card
     Members would be  at a disadvantage if they were not aware of these

     campaigns and  promotional periods".

20.  The Commissioner sent an initial investigatiletter to AMEX on 3 June

     2019. This letter set out the relevant provisions of PECR,the

     Commissioner's powers, details of the complaints, and the


                                   6                                                              •

                                                              ICO.
                                                              Information Commissioner's Office

      Commissioner's concerns. The letter requested that AMEX provide
      various piecesof information and evidence.


21.  AMEX requested an extension until the 4 July 2019. This was granted.


22.  Two  further complaints were made to the Commissioner in June and
     July 2019 by individuals who had opted-out of marketing emails. The

      first of these complaints concerned marketing emails received from
     AMEX between 22 February 2019 and 25 April 2019. As with previous

      complainants,the complainant had initially contacted AMEX and

      received a responsejustifyinthe emails on the basis they were
     "servicing"rather than "marketing" in nature. AMEX's response to the

      complaint stated that "we feel that Card Members would be at a

      disadvantage if they were not aware of these campaigns and
      promotional periods". The second complaint concerned marketing

      emails from AMEX between November 2018 and April 2019. Again, the
      complainant initially contacted AMEX. On 1 May 2019, they received a

      response which stated"the emails you are receiving are logged as

      benefits reinforcementrather than marketing materials.As discussed
      inour telephone call, all correspondence classed as marketing has been

      opted-out for your account".


23.  AMEX responded to the Commissioner on 5 July 2019. This letter

      stated, in summary:


           a. AMEX differentiatesitself in the marketplace by offering

              benefits and rewards;the fee level chosen dictating "the level
              of the type of included benefits and rewards". AMEX's

              research showed  that "benefits and rewards" were the key
              drivers in the selection of their products.




                                    7                                                              •

                                                             ICO.
                                                             Information Commissioner's Office

           b. Its customer terms and conditions provide that AMEX will
              contact customers with product features, benefits and

              rewards. The "servicing" emails in question were "required to
              be sent based on legal and contractual requirementsThese

              emails were "reinforcementmessages to ensure it is clear how
              such benefits work, to ensure Cardmembers to get value for

              money and avoid any disappointment  or detriment".Such

              "servicing" emails "do not promote cardmembers to buy
              additional products or services from Amex but outline[ ...] how

              to get the most of the rewards, such as -,      -or
              Membership Rewards". Each "servicing" email contained a

              footer stating that "You are being sent this service related

              email as it contains information about an integral benefit of
              your Card."


           c. In response to the Commissioner's letter, AMEX had instigated
              an independent internal review of its practices related to

              electronic communications.Whilst that review was ongoing, it

              had placed an "interim hold" on "servicing" emails sent to
              individuals who had opted-out of direct marketing emails.


24.  Attached to AMEX's response was 11 distinct terms and conditions
     contained in the credit agreementsfor the different cards that it

     provides ("Credit Agreements").   Under the heading "Contacting

     You", each of the Credit Agreements contain the following (emphasis
     added):


      "We may send you important messages and other communications

     (including alerts about certain activity on your account) about your
     account, card or card benefits in line with your preferences. This could

     be by email or SMS, on your statements or by posting them in the


                                    8                                                                •

                                                               ICO.
                                                               Information Commissioner's Office

      online account centre, for example, we may send you an alert to
      confirm that you've updated your contact information"



25.   AMEX provided its 'Cardmember Privacy Statement',  which is provided
      to UK personal cardmembers when they open an account with AMEX.

      Under the heading "Use of information",the policy states that (original
      emphasis in bold, added emphasis  underlined):



      "We use your Personal Information:    (i)where it is necessary for the
      performance of a contract or compliance with a legal obligation (e.g.,

      due diligence financial institutions are required to perform before
      approving card accounts); (ii) for our legitimate interests, such as to

      establish, exercise or defend legal claims, prevent fraud and/or

      enhance our products or services; or (iii) where we have obtained your
      consent, such as for marketing purposes. More specifically, we use

      your Personal Information   to do the following:

        •  service and manage any benefits and insurance programmes

           provided along with the products or services that you requested;

                                                              ICO.
                                                              Information Commissioner's Office

        •  present content that is personalised in accordance with your
           preferences;


        •  communicate promotions and offers to you (by mail, e-mail,

           telephone, SMS, via the internet or using other electronic means)
           in relation to products and services that may interest you or

           which are similar to your existing American Express products and

           services; ..."


26.  AMEX provided the Commissioner with its procedures for the sending of
     advertisements, financial promotions or other communications.These

      included itsInternationalEmail Policy - United Kingdom", dated

     August 2018. The Commissioner notes the following elements of this
      policy in particular:


           a. Section 1 of the policy describes the PECRand how it applies

              to email marketing, and includes the statemen that "For non­

              marketing messages, no consent is required therefore
              American Express is not required to either obtain an opt-in or

              give the opportunityto opt-out of any other type of
              messages".


           b. Section 2 is titled "Marketing Emails - General" and states

              that "Marketing emails include, but are not limited to, email

              messages with the primary purpose of acquisition, cross­
              selling, includingmmunications  provided to promote an

              American Express Product or Service". Section 2 goes on to
              state that "American Express will generally need an

              individual's consent before we can sendarketing emails".




                                    10                                                             •

                                                            ICO.
                                                             Information Commissioner's Office
           c. Section 8 is titled "Servicing and Operational Emails". It

              employs the following definitions:


              "Operational Emails are defined as:
                      • Purely factualoperational communication with no

                      content promoting products or services to recipient
                      including information promoting services and/or

                      benefits associated with American Express product
                      held by recipient - e.g. account alerts


              Servicing Emails are defined as:

              Marketing Emails are defined as:
                      • Communication promoting products and services

           d. Section 8 goes on to state that "Without exception all

              Marketing and Servicing emailsust be reviewed by the UK
              Advertising Review Team".


           e. The policy does not, at any stage, repeat the definition of

              "direct marketingfrom section 122(5) of the DPA 2018.


27.  AMEX provided a PDF titled "Prospect Journey", which included a

     screenshot of the initial marketing preferences page presented to a
     customer when they open an account with AMEX online. The consent

     wording reads as follows:

                                   11                                                              •

                                                             Information Commissioner's Office


     "Please tick this box to get the most out of your new American Express

     Card. We will keep you informed via email about promotions associated

      will also apply to other American Express cards if they use the email

     address you have provided as part of this applicatioYou can update

     your preferences later if you wish."


28.  In the 5 July 2019 response, AMEX also provided details of its internal
     training procedures, including examples of training materials. The

     "Communications  and Financial Promotions Training" for the "UK

     Advertising Review Team" materials were the only materials provided
     by AMEX which appear (at internal page 24 of the document) to refer

     to obligations relating to direct marketiHowever, this reference is
     indirect and brief, and the material is largely focused on clear, fair and

     accurate marketing and compliance with requirements regulated by the

29.  AMEX provided a spreadsheet of all complaints received regarding

     unsolicited emails between 1 June2018 and 31 May 2019. AMEX stated
     that, during this period, it had received "22 complaints resulting from

     the approximately forty-fourmillion servicing communicationsent to
     our            cardmember base"; and that, in its view, a number of

     the complaints regarded the frequency, rather than content, of the

     emails. On the Commissioner's reading, most of these complaints
     appear to concern the receipt of marketing emails by customers who

     had opted-out from receiving such emails.

             services, were drafted by the in-house AMEX legal team, with
             advice from external counsel.


           d. The "come back to-"       emails were sent to­
                               card customers who had had no spend or

             balance for three consecutive months. AMEX said that the
             emails were sent as a "reinforcememessage to ensure

             these Cardmembers are getting the most from their product".

          e. The 'Explore ...' emails were "triggered upon the first physical

             transaction in the city that the email refers to". AMEX justified
             the sending of these emails on the basis that these messages

             constituted "servicing" communications which were intended

             to "raise awareness of card coverage", noting that "our
             customers will not purchase products from American Express

             unless they find value in doing so."

63.  An end of investigation letter was sent to AMEX on 10 October 2019.






                                 23                                                              •

                                                              Information Commissioner's Office

64.   In conclusion, the Commissioner is satisfied that, between 1 June 2018
      and 31 May 2019, AMEX transmitted  4,098,841 marketing emails to

      subscribers who had opted-out to receiving marketing emails.


65.  The Commissioner has made   the above findings of fact on the
      balance of probabilities.


66.  The Commissioner has considered  whether those facts constitute

      a contraventionof Regulation 22 of PECRby AMEX and, if so, whether

      the conditions of section SSA DPA are satisfied.


     The contravention


67.  The Commissioner finds that AMEX contravened Regulation 22 of PECR.


68.  The Commissioner finds that the contravention was as follows:



69.   Between 1 June 2018 and 31 May 2019 there were 4,098,841 direct
      marketing emails received by subscribers. The Commissioner is

      satisfiedhat these emails constituted "direct marketing" as defined by
      section122(5) of the DPA 2018 because each of the emails encouraged

      customers to use their AMEX credit cards to make purchases. One

      category of emails (the AMEX app emails) also encouraged customers
     to download and/or use the AMEX app.


70.  AMEX internally classified the emails in question as "servicrather
     than "marketing". However, the fact that the emails engaged in

      advertising and marketing can be seen from their content. None of the

      emails in question were neutrally worded and purely administratiin
      nature. Instead, each email sought to encourage the customer to make

      purchases on their AMEX card (and, in the case of the AMEX app


                                    24                                                        •

emails, also to make use of this product). In relation to specific

categories of emails:


      a. The -    newsletter emails encouraged customers to book
        tickets for exclusive events, many of which were paid for.


      b. The -        offers emails encouraged customers to make

        purchases on their cards which qualified for special -
        offers.


      c. The "come back to-'         emails encouraged customers to

        make purchases on their                             cards,
        where they had not used those cards for a period of time, by

        highlightingthe-feature         of the card, as well as other
        AMEX offers and benefits.


      d. The.   card emails encouraged customers to make purchases
        on their card by highlighting the rewards and benefits

        resulting from such purchases, including the benefits of

        accruing -     points. Two of these emails sought to
        encourage customers not using the card to start making

        purchases on it.

      e. The "explore ..." emails encouraged individuals to make

        purchases on their cards when travelling abroad (rather than
        merely reminding them of their ability to use the card), in

        particular by providing a city guide of locations where the card
        could be used.



      f. The "card is welcome" emails encouraged customers to make
        purchases on their cards, not only seeking to allay doubts

        about the availability of the card, but also by highlighting the

                              25                                                              •

                                                              ICO.
                                                              Information Commissioner's Office

              benefits and rewards that would result from making such
              purchases.



           g. The "save your card details" emails encouraged customers to
              make purchases on their cards (rather than merely reminding

              them to update details which may have expired) by
              highlighting the rewards resulting from purchases.



           h. Of the 11 AMEX app emails, 3 prompted customers to
              download and/or use the app to access informationregarding

              their eligibility for rewards and offers, including personalised
              offers. Twoof these emails sought to encourage uptake of the

              app by promising rewards if customers referred family and

              friends.As well as promoting the app in its own right, these
              emails promoted the app with a view to encouraging

              customers to make purchases on their cards.


           i. The initialShop Small" emails encouraged customers to make
              purchases on their cards at select "small" retailers by

              communicating  the existence of-offers        on such
              purchases.



71.  In any event, AMEX's "InternationalEmail Policy - United Kingdom"
      indicates that "servicing" emails involve advertising and marketing

     content. The policy defines such emails as "Communicationincluding
      informationpromoting services and/or benefits associated with

     American Express product held by recipient" (emphasis added). This

      definition can be contrasted with the definition of "operatiemails:
     "Purely factual / operational communicationwith no content promoting

      products or services to recipient including informapromoting



                                    26                                                              •

                                                             ICO.
                                                             Information Commissioner's Office

      services and/or benefits associated with American Express product held
      byrecipient" (emphasis added).



72.   Furthermore, in letters responding to customer complaints, AMEX
      stated that "we feel that Card Members would be at a disadvantage if

     they were not aware of these campaigns and promotional periods".
     AMEX accepted here that "servicing" emails include advertising or

      marketing material.


73.  The Commissioner finds that AMEX transmitted or instigated the
     transmission of the direct marketing messages sent, contrary to

      Regulation 22 of PECR.


74.  AMEX, as the transmitter or instigator of the direct marketiis,
     required to ensure that it is acting in compliance with the requirements

     of Regulation 22 of PECR,and to ensure that valid consent to send
     those messages had been acquired.


75.  The  4,098,841 emails in question were sent to subscribers who had

     opted-out from receiving direct marketing communicationsby email.
     This is not disputed by AMEX.


76.  AMEX states that the emails in question were "required to be sent

      based on legal and contractualequirements" arising from its Credit
     Agreements with customers. The Commissioner has rejected this

      suggestion for the following reasons.


           a. The "legal and contractual requirementsreferred to by AMEX

              cannot override the statutory protection afforded by PECR
              Regulation 22 to explicit opt-out decisions made by

              customers.



                                   27                                                    •

                                                   ICO.
                                                   Information Commissioner's Office

b. The "legal and contractual requirements"referred to by AMEX
   are worded in a way which is sensitive to the customer's

   marketing preferences. In particular, the Credit Agreements

   statethat AMEX "may send you important messages and
   other communications  ... about your account, card or card

   benefitsin line with your preferences" (emphasis added).
   Further, AMEX's privacystatement provides that "We use your

   Personal Information ... (iii) where we have obtained your

   consent, such as for marketing purposes" (emphasis added).


c. Considered alone, the "legal and contractual requirements"
   referred to by AMEX do not satisfy the requirement for valid

   consent. In particular:


      i. Consent to receive direct marketing emails is not "freely
         given" where it is a condition of receiving AMEX's

         servicesin circumstances where such consent is not

         necessary for contractual performance by AMEX.


     ii. Nor is consent"freely given" where customers are
         unable to withdraw it in the future. The ability of

         individuals to withdraw consent is explicitly recognised

         at Regulation 22(2) of PECR,which refers to a person
        "consent[ing] for the time being" (emphasis added).


     iii. Consent isot "informed" where the "legal and

         contractualrequirements" relied on by AMEX are not set

         out prominentlyand separated from other terms and
         conditions, but are contained within overall terms and

         conditions.



                         28                                                        •

                                                       ICO.
                                                       Information Commissioner's Office
77.  The Commissioner is therefore satisfied from the evidence she has
     seen that AMEX did not have the necessary valid consent for the
     4,098,841 direct marketing messages received by subscribers.


78.  AMEX has stated that customers would be "at a disadvantage if they
     were not aware of the campaigns and promotional periods". There is no

     exemption under PECRRegulation 22 which allows organisations to
     send marketing emails they consider advantageous for subscribers
     where they have not received prior consent to do so. If there were,

     such an exemption would likely be relied on by all persons in breach of
     the PECRdirect marketing rules.


79.  The Commissioner has gone ono consider whether the conditions
     under section SSA DPA (as extended and modified by PECR)are met.



     Seriousness of the contravention


80.  The Commissioner is satisfied that the contraidentified
     above was serious. This is because, between a 12-month period from 1

     June 2018 to 31 May 2019, a confirmed total of 4,098,841 direct
     marketing messages were sent by, or at the instigation of, of AMEX.

     These messages contained direct marketing material for which
     subscribers hadot provided adequate consent.


81.  The Commissioner isherefore satisfied that condition (a) from
     section SSA(l) DPA (as extended and modified by PECR) is met.•

                                29                                                                •

                                                               ICO.
                                                               Information Commissioner's Office

82.   The Commissioner does not consider that AMEX deliberately set out to
      contravene PECRin this instance.



83.   The Commissioner has gone on to consider whether the contravention
      identified above was negligent. This consideration comprises two

      elements:


84.   First, she has considered whether AMEX knew or ought reasonably to

      have known that there was a risk that these contraventionswould
      occur. She is satisfied that this condition is met for the following

      reasons:

           a. During the period in question, AMEX sent a large number of

              direct marketing emails internally classified as "servicing"

              (7,539,684  in total)Itis clear that direct marketing
              constitutes an important part of AMEX's business. More

              generally, AMEX is one part of a large multinationacompany

              and provides services for a large number of customers
                                                                 Itshould

              therefore have sought to ensure its marketing operations
              complied  with the relevant statutory regime.



            b. AMEX had internal procedures to ensure that marketing
              communications   were sent in accordance with PECR.In

              particular, its "InternationEmail Policy - United Kingdom"
              explicitly referred to PECRand attempted to provide an

              overview of the requirements  imposed by it. AMEX also

              provided internal training for its employees on legal and
              regulatory requirements governing the sending of marketing

              communications.



                                     30                                                              •

                                                              ICO.
                                                              Information Commissioner's Office

           c. Both AMEX's definition of "servicing" emails, and its letters
              responding to customers complaints, indicate AMEX was

              aware that such emails contained advertising and marketing

              content.

           d. During the period of the contraventio(1 June 2018 and 31

              May 2019), AMEX received 22 complaints regarding its
              "servicing" communications.



           e. AMEX has been registered with the ICO since 19 June 2006.
              The Commissioner has published detailed guidance for those

              carrying out direct marketing explaining their legal obligations
              under PECR. This guidance gives clear advice regarding the

              requirements of consent for direct marketing and explains the

              circumstances under which organisations are able to carry out
              marketing over the phone, by text, by email, by post, or by

              fax.In particular it states that organisations can generally

              only send, or instigate, marketing emails to individuals if that
              person has specifically consented to receiving them; and

              highlights the difficulties of relying on indirect consent for
              email marketing. In case organisations remain unclear on

              their obligations, the ICO operates a telephone helpline. ICO

              communications  about previous enforcement action where
              businesses have not complied with PECRare also readily

              available.


85.   It is therefore reasonable to suppose that AMEX should have been
      aware of its responsibilitin this area.


86.   Secondly, the Commissioner has gone on to consider whether AMEX
      failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the contraventioAgain,

      she is satisfiedat this condition is met.

                                    31                                                             •

                                                            ICO.
                                                             Information Commissioner's Office

87.  Reasonable steps in these circumstances may, in particular, have

     included a combination of the following:


           a. Ensuring that its internal procedures were compliant with
              PECR.In particular, AMEX could have ensured that its

              "InternationaEmail Policy - United Kingdom" contained
              consideration of how "direct marketing" is defined for the

              purposes of PECRand how this applied to emails AMEX had
              internally classified at "servicing".



           b. Consulting ICO guidance and/or the ICO telephone helpline to
              ensure its marketing policy was compliant with PECR.


           c. Meaningfully reviewing its approach to marketing following the
              receipt of 22 complaints regarding internally classified

              "servicing" emails.

88.  In the circumstances, the Commissioner is satisfied that AMEX failed to

     take reasonable steps to prevent the contraventions.


89.  The Commissioner is therefore satisfied that condition (b) from section

     SSA(l) DPA (as extended and modified by PECR) is met.



     The Commissioner's   decision to issue a monetary   penalty


90.  The Commissioner has taken into account the following
     aggravating  features  of this case:



           •  As set out above, the breach was negligent.



                                   32                                                               •


                                                              ICO.
                                                               Information Commissioner's Office
           •  There has been deliberate action for financial or personal gain.
              The  emails  in question  were   all designed  to encourage

              customers  to make purchases on their cards, which would

              benefit AMEX financially.


           •  Advice  or guidance  has been ignored   or not acted upon.

              Guidance on Direct Marketing and  in particular, the sending of
              marketing  emails is available on the ICO website. The ICO

              Helpline is also availablefor organisationswho may require

              clarity in their practices.


           •  AMEX failed to review its marketing model in light of complaints
              raised by various individuals.



91.   The Commissioner has also taken into account the following mitigating
      factors:

              •  When  the Commissioner began her investigation, AMEX

                 commenced its own independent internal review and
                 stopped marketing to customers who had opt-out of

                 receiving direct marketing communications by email. AMEX

                 has notified the Commissioner that the independent
                 internal review concluded in December 2019 and that

                 AMEX has made several changes to its processes and
                 procedures to ensure compliance with PECR.AMEX has also

                 confirmed to the Commissioner that it will continue to

                 assess the changes made as a result of the internal review
                 to ensure ongoing compliance.



92.   Forthe reasons explained above, the Commissioner is satisfied that the
      conditions from section SSA(l) DPA have been met in this case. She is



                                    33                                                              •

                                                              ICO.
                                                              Information Commissioner's Office

      also satisfied that the procedural rights under section 55B have been
      complied with.


93.  The latter has included the issuing of a Notice of Intent (dated 18

      February 2021), in which the Commissioner set out her preliminary
      thinking.



94.   In reaching her final view, the Commissioner considered
      representationsreceived by AMEX on 17 March 2021.


95.   Within those representationsAMEX did not seek to challenge the

      Commissioner's intention to impose a monetary penalty of £90,000. As

      AMEX did not advance any new factors in its representationthe
      Commissioner did not alter her position as set out in the Notice of

      Intent.


96.  The Commissioner is accordingly entitled to issue a monetary penalty

      in this case.


97.  The Commissioner has considered whether, in the circumstances, she
      should exercise her discretion so as to issue a monetary penalty.


98.  The Commissioner has endeavoured to consider the likely impact of a

      monetary penalty on AMEX. In the Notice of Intent, the Commissioner

      set out her preliminary conclusion that AMEX has access to sufficient
      financial resourceso pay the proposed monetary penalty without

      causing undue financial hardship; and that this preliminary conclusion
      was unaltered bythe effects of the current Covid-19 pandemic. AMEX

      has not provided any informationin response to the Notice of Intent

      which has caused the Commissioner to alter her position.


                                    34                                                             •

                                                             ICO.
                                                             Information Commissioner's Office

99.   The Commissioner's underlying objective in imposing a monetary
      penalty notice is to promote compliance with PECR.The sending of

      unsolicited marketing emails is a matter of significant public concern. A

      monetary penalty in this case should act as a general encouragement
      towards compliance with the law, or at least as a deterrent against

      non-compliance, on the part of all persons running businesses currently
      engaging in these practices. The issuing of a monetary penalty will

      reinforcehe need for businesses to ensure that they are only

      messaging those who specifically consent to receive marketing.

100.  Overall, the Commissioner considers that a monetary penalty is a

      proportionateand appropriate response to the finding of a serious
      contraventionby AMEX.



      The amount of the penalty


101. Taking into account all of the above, the Commissioner has decided

      that a penalty in the sum of £90,00(Ninety  thousand  pounds) is
      reasonable andproportionate given the particular facts of the case and

      the underlying objective in imposing the penalty.


      Conclusion


102. The monetary   penalty must be paid to the Commissioner's  office by

      BACS transfer or cheque by 17 June 2021 at the latest. The monetary
      penalty is not kept by the Commissioner   but will be paid into the

      Consolidated Fund which is the Government'sgeneral bank account at

      the Bank of England.


103. If the Commissioner receives full payment of the monetary penalty by
      16 June 2021 the Commissioner will reduce the monetary penalty by


                                   35                                                             •

                                                            ICO.
                                                            Information Commissioner's Office
     20% to £72,000   (Seventy-two   thousand  pounds).  However, AMEX

     should be aware that the early payment discount is not available if it

     decides to exercise its right of appeal.

104. There is aright of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (InforRights)

      against:


      a)   the imposition of the monetary penalty
           and/or;


      b)   the amount of the penalty specified in the monetary penalty

           notice.

105. Any notice of appeal should be received by the Tribunal within 28 days

     of the date of this monetary penalty notice.


106. Information about appeals is set out in Annex 1.


107. The Commissioner will not take action to enforce a monetary penalty
     unless:

           • the period specified within the notice within which a monetary

             penalty must be paid has expired and all or any of the

             monetary penalty has not been paid;


           • all relevant appeals against the monetary penalty notice and
             any variation of it have either been decided or withdraand


          •  the period for appealing against the monetary penalty and any
             variation of it has expired.


108. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the monetary penalty is

     recoverable by Order of the County Court or the High Court. In

                                   36                                                       •

     Scotland, the monetary penalty can be enforced in the same manner
     as an extract registered decree arbitral bearing a warrant for execution

     issued bythe sheriff court of any sheriffdom in Scotland.
