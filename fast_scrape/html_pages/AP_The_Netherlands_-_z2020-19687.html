of possible processing. In the e-mail, the person concerned asked for his request to be fully complied with

1.4 Nuts Groep's response to the complaint
The AP has asked Nuts Groep by letter of 13 July 2021 to respond to the complaint and questions from the
AP. Nuts Groep responded by letter dated August 12, 2021.

Nuts Groep stated that Nuts Topholding is the controller for the processing of
personal data of the data subject. Nuts Groep confirmed that the responses of October 26, 2020 are not the

Article 20 of the GDPR has been applied. Nuts Groep (still) added a copy of personal data of the
data subject about consumption and preference with regard to direct marketing in her answer.

Nuts Groep disputes that it failed to provide the data subject with specific information about the
source of his personal data and provision of his personal data to third parties. This information
follows, according to Nuts Groep, from the privacy statement sent to the data subject.
Nuts Groep has a work instruction and a privacy policy regarding the facilitation of the rights of
data subjects. Nuts Groep indicates that the matter of the data subject is not in accordance with the policy and the
work instruction has been followed. Nuts Groep also indicates that it has eight requests for
received access from other parties involved. These requests for inspection are, with the exception of one case, every time
answered in accordance with Nuts Groep's own policy or work instructions.

.2.2.2 Conclusion on the right of access – access to and copy of the personal data processed
Based on the available information, the AP concludes that Nuts Topholding Article 12, paragraph 3 of the
AVG in conjunction with article 15, first paragraph and third paragraph of the AVG: violated. The data subject
has: requested access to his personal data on 27 September 2020. On October 26, 2020, the
person concerned a response. This response did not include access to consumption and direct marketing preferences
the data subject. These personal data were processed, because the personal data are on 12
August 2021 provided. The information available does not in any way indicate that there were facts and
circumstances that restrict the data subject's right of access, as referred to in Article 12, paragraph 5
of the AVG, article 15, fourth paragraph of the AVG or article 23 of the AVG or article 41 of the UAVG.

2.2.3 Conclusion on the right of access - information about the source and disclosures to third parties
In addition, the AP Nuts Topholding points out the following. It follows from the findings that Nuts Groep de
the data subject has the information as referred to in Article 15, first paragraph under a to h of the GDPR
provided by referring to the privacy statement. The privacy statement does not say what - in case
of the data subject - was the actual source of his personal data. From the privacy statement follows
nor whether the personal data of the data subject has actually been provided to third parties and which ones
specific third parties. Based on the findings, the AP cannot determine that the
personal data of the data subject have not been collected from the data subject. The AP can, based on the
findings also do not establish that the personal data of the data subject has been provided to third parties. The
AP cannot therefore determine whether Nuts Topholding has complied with Article 15, first paragraph under a to h of the
AVG has provided the information mentioned. The AP points out to Nuts Topholding that in the privacy statement
terminology such as 'we can' is used. 'it is possible that we'. The right of access must be a

check (recital 63 of the GDPR). Using language such as 'could', 'might' and 'possibly'
may undermine this purpose mentioned in recital 63 of the GDPR. 1

The AP has the power to impose a reprimand if a controller infringes on 
provisions of the AVG, as referred to in Article 58, second paragraph under b of the AVG. A reprimand
may be imposed instead of a fine if there is a minor infringement. This involves the
AP informs whether the infringement does not pose a significant risk to the rights of the data subjects and does not affect it
meets the essence of the obligation.

In view of the above, the AP Nuts Topholding will be reprimanded for the violation referred to in this decision
the GDPR. The AP considers the reprimand in question to be an appropriate measure. The AP has the following here
weighed in. There is a relatively minor infringement. Of a significant risk to the data subject
