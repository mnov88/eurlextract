<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 1 August 2023, the data subject received a phone call from the controller: a recruitment agency. On the same day, the complainant contacted the controller requesting to be deleted from their database and to not be contacted.
</p><p>On 2 August 2023, the data subject received an email from an employee of the controller about new job opportunities, to which the data subject replied requesting to not be contacted again. On 4 September 2023, the data subject received another phone call from the controller and on 5 September 2023, the data subject received an email from the employee concerned confirming that their data had been erased.
</p><p>After receiving another phone call from the controller on 15 September 2023, the data subject lodged a complaint with the Belgian DPA.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Belgian DPA reiterated that in line with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17 GDPR</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12 GDPR</a>, a controller is obliged to erase the personal data of a data subject upon request without delay. Furthermore, under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12(3) GDPR</a>, the controller should inform the data subject as soon as possible, but at least within a month, about the action taken on his request. 
</p><p>The DPA established based on the facts of the case as provided by the data subject that he had exercised his deletion request several times but was still contacted afterwards. Moreover, even if the controller did respond after the data subject's second request confirming that the personal data had been deleted, the data subject still received messages from the controller. 
</p><p>Therefore, the DPA held that the controller infringed <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12(3) GDPR</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#4" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12(4) GDPR</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17(1) GDPR</a> and ordered the controller to deal with the data subject's request within 30 days after the decision.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>As this is a 'prima facie' decision, not much information is available. The Litigation Chamber of the DPA has ruled solely based on the complaint without having a procedure. The controller could demand for a procedure within 30 days after the decision.

        Complaintsent an email to the defendant's local office with the question no longer

        be contacted and her details removed from the database “according to the

        GDPR Guidelines”. On August 2, 2023, the complainant receives an email from an employee

        from the defendant's local office regarding job opportunities. The complainant answers

        tells the employee that she no longer wants to be contacted and asks her again

II. Justification


 8. Article 17.1 GDPR provides that the data subject has the right from the controller

       has, without unreasonable delay, erased the personal data concerning him

       to acquire. The controller is obliged to process personal data without
       unreasonable delay when the personal data is no longer necessary for

       the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.


 9. In accordance with Article 12.3 GDPR, the controller provides the
       person concerned without delay and in any case within one month of receipt of the request

       pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 GDPR information about the outcome of the request

       is given. Depending on the complexity of the requests and the number of requests

       that period may be extended by a further two months if necessary. The

       the controller shall inform the data subject within one month of receipt of the

       request of such extension. If the defendant decides not to
       to comply with the complainant's request, it must do so within one month after the

       communicate receipt of the request to the data subject, in accordance with Article 12.4 GDPR


 10. The Disputes Chamber states on the basis of the documents that support the complaint, consisting of a
      screenshot of the calls received from the defendant's phone number and

      from various emails between the complainant and the defendant, it is established that the complainant is entitled to

      erasure of data has been carried out. The Disputes Chamber cannot determine on the basis of

      the file that the complainant may have received any answer about the consequences caused by this

      defendant is given the request for data erasure after the first request of
      the complainant dd. August 1, 2023. The Disputes Chamber, on the other hand, notes that the

      defendant, after the complainant's second request for data deletion dated. September 4

      2023, on 5 September 2023, she confirmed that her data had been deleted.

      However, the complainant points out that even after this confirmation she was still contacted by the

      defendant. As a result, the defendant would potentially have acted in violation of Article
      12.3 and 12.4 GDPR, as well as Article 17.1 GDPR.


 11. The above suggests to the Disputes Chamber that it should be concluded that

      the defendant may have committed an infringement of the provisions of the GDPR,

      which justifies taking a decision in this case
      pursuant to Article 95, § 1, 5° of the WOG, more specifically to order the defendant to take action

      to indicate the complainant's exercise of his right to erasure of data and this in the

      particularly in view of the documents that the complainant has provided showing that the complainant has the

      the defendant has repeatedly requested that her data be deleted,

      without appropriate action being taken by the defendant. Decision 03/2024 – 4/6


  12. This decision is a prima facie decision taken by the Disputes Chamber

       in accordance with Article 95 of the WOG on the basis of the complaint submitted by the complainant

       the context of the “procedure prior to the decision on the merits” and not a decision

       on the merits of the Disputes Chamber within the meaning of Article 100 of the WOG.


        The Disputes Chamber has thus decided, on the basis of Article 58.2 c) GDPR and

        Article 95, § 1, 5° of the WOG, to order the defendant to comply with the request

        of the data subject to exercise his rights, in particular the right to

        erasure (“right to be forgotten”) as provided for in Article 17 GDPR.


     13. The purpose of this decision is to inform the defendant of the fact that

         it has committed an infringement of the provisions of the GDPR and this is possible

         to still comply with the aforementioned provisions.


     14. However, if the defendant does not agree with the contents of this fine

         facie decision and is of the opinion that it may allow factual and/or legal arguments

         funds that could lead to a different decision can be made via the e-mail address

         litigationchamber@apd-gba.beeenrequesttohandlethesubstancesofthecase

         to the Disputes Chamber and this within the period of 30 days after notification of this

         decision. The implementation of this decision will be carried out if necessary

         suspended for the aforementioned period.


     15. In the event of a continuation of the merits of the case, the

         Dispute Chamber the parties on the basis of Articles 98, 2° and 3° in conjunction with Article 99 WOG

         invite them to submit their defenses as well as any documents they deem useful

         file to add. If necessary, the present decision will be permanently suspended.


     16. Finally, for the sake of completeness, the Disputes Chamber points out that a substantive hearing

         of the case may lead to the imposition of the measures stated in Article 100 of the WOG. 4
