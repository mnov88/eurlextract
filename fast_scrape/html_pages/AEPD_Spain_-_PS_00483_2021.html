<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA (AEPD) initiated proceedings exercising its investigation powers under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR" title="Article 58 GDPR">Article 58 GDPR</a> against Ramona Films S.L. (previously Kalandrakas Films S.L.), owner of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://www.putalocura.com">https://www.putalocura.com</a>, a website containing adult and pornographic material. The investigation was related to the possible processing of personal data and profiling of data subjects below the age of 14. In particular, the AEPD inquired the controller regarding the risk of processing activities that could take place if a minor gained unauthorised access to the website’s contents, a data protection impact assessment related to these risks, the technical and organisational measures implemented to ensure data protection, as well as its privacy policy.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>In its investigation, the AEPD determined that the page contained a warning that the website contained adult material, and to abandon the website in case of being a minor.
</p><p>However, the AEPD found that the website did not have a mechanism that permitted the rejection of non-essential cookies, or a second layer to allow the granular acceptance of specific cookies. Additionally, the AEPD also found that when accessing the website, the use of non-essential cookies took place without prior consent, and that there was insufficient information related to the nature of the cookies, and if any of them were third party cookies. The AEPD held that the website’s cookie policy violated Article 22.2 of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2002-13758">Spanish Law of Information Society Services (LSSI)</a>, which establishes that clear and complete information on the use of cookies and the purposes of the data processing must be provided to data subjects, and that where the use of a cookie entails processing that makes it possible to identify the user, data controllers must provide users with information in compliance with the provisions of the GDPR.
</p><p>Furthermore, the AEPD found that the website’s privacy policy referred to the previous data protection laws in Spain, which were derogated when the GDPR entered into force. Therefore, the AEPD held that the website did not provide users with adequate data protection information, in violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a>.
</p><p>Based on these considerations, the AEPD issued a total fine of €10,000 on the controller, €5000 for the violation of Article 22.2 LSSI and €5000 for the violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a>. However, this fine was reduced to €8000 because the controller did not object to the fine and paid it voluntarily within the period established by the AEPD to do so, although the reduction of the fee paid for by the controller did not include an express acceptance of culpability regarding the violations held by the AEPD. The AEPD also ordered the controller to modify its privacy and cookie policy in order to comply with GDPR.

II.- About the "Privacy Policy" of the website:




It has been verified that on the website: https://www.putalocura.com, you can
obtain personal data from users through the "contact" tab, such as the
name and email.




However, it has been found that the "Privacy Policy" of the website,
https://www.putalocura.com/politica-de-privacidad, does not adjust to the information that

should be provided according to article 13 of the RGPD, since all of it is referred to and
focused on the repealed Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13, on the Protection of
Personal data.


C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 6/18










Well, in accordance with the provisions of article 99 of the RGPD, the entry into

force and application of the new RGPD was: "twenty days after its publication in the
Official Journal of the European Union (05/25/16)” and would be applicable from May 25
of 2018”. Therefore, as of 05/25/18, the LO was repealed. 15/1999, (LOPD),

applying compulsorily, from that date, the current RGPD and from the
07/12/18 the new LOPDGDD.




In application of the RGPD, its article 13, establishes the information that must be
provide the interested party at the time of obtaining their personal data. This is:




“1. When personal data relating to him is obtained from an interested party, the
responsible for the treatment, at the time these are obtained, will provide: a)
the identity and contact details of the person in charge and, where appropriate, of their

representative; b) the contact details of the data protection officer, in his
case; c) the purposes of the treatment to which the personal data is destined and the basis
legal treatment; d) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1,

letter f), the legitimate interests of the person in charge or of a third party; e) the recipients or
the categories of recipients of personal data, if any; f) where appropriate, the
intention of the controller to transfer personal data to a third country or

international organization and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision
of the Commission, or, in the case of the transfers indicated in articles 46 or 47 or

Article 49, paragraph 1, second paragraph, reference to adequate guarantees or
appropriate and the means to obtain a copy of them or the fact that

2. In addition to the information mentioned in section 1, the person in charge of the
treatment will facilitate the interested party, at the moment in which the data is obtained

personal, the following information necessary to guarantee data processing
fair and transparent: a) the period during which the personal data will be kept or,
when this is not possible, the criteria used to determine this period; b) the

existence of the right to request access to data from the data controller
related to the interested party, and its rectification or deletion, or the limitation of its
treatment, or to oppose the treatment, as well as the right to the portability of the

data; c) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter a), or the
Article 9, paragraph 2, letter a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent in
any time, without affecting the legality of the treatment based on the

consent prior to its withdrawal; d) the right to file a claim with
a control authority; e) if the communication of personal data is a requirement

possible consequences of not providing such data; f) the existence of decisions
you automate, including profiling, referred to in article 22,

paragraphs 1 and 4, and, at least in such cases, significant information about the logic
applied, as well as the importance and expected consequences of said treatment
for the interested party”.




Therefore, in accordance with the evidence obtained and without prejudice to what
result of the investigation, the exposed facts could suppose the violation, for

part of the entity that owns the web page in question, of article 13 of the RGPD.



Regarding this, article 72.1.h) of the LOPDGDD, considers it very serious, for

of prescription, “the omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the treatment
of your personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the RGPD”




This infraction can be sanctioned with a maximum fine of €20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the

global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for the
of greater amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.




In accordance with the precepts indicated, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the sanction to be imposed in
the present case, it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction in accordance with the

following aggravating criteria established in article 83.2 of the RGPD:



    - The duration of the infringement, taking into account that current regulations, this

       is, the RGPD, is mandatory since 05/25/18, and that from that
       Date the LOPD was repealed, by which the website is still governed

       in question, (section a).



The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with

regarding the infraction committed, by violating the provisions of article 13 of the
RGPD, makes it possible to set an initial penalty of 5,000 euros (five thousand euros).

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 8/18








On the other hand, and in accordance with article 58.2 of the RGPD, the corrective measure
that could be imposed on the person responsible for the website in question would consist of

order you to take the necessary measures to adapt the privacy policy to
what is stipulated in the current regulations, that is, the RGPD and the LOPDGDD.

the cookie policy made on the website in question.



On the other hand, and in accordance with article 58.2 of the RGPD, the corrective measure

that could be imposed on the entity responsible for the website would consist of order-
order him to take the necessary measures on the web page of his ownership to
