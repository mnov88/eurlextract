<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subjects were members of the strike committee in a collective dispute between the company Avanza Zaragoza S.A.U (third party) and its workers. Due to this dispute, the Aragonés Union of Workers of Transport (the controller), published on social networks (Facebook, Twitter) and on its website a document in which the personal data (name, surname and ID) of the data subjects were disclosed. The publication was apparently visible to anyone for at least half an hour. Subsequently, the publication was rectified, as a result of the data subjects' complaint to the controller. 
</p><p>The data subjects also complained to the Spanish DPA about this incident, which started proceedings against the controller. The DPA notified the controller of the complaint electronically and by postal mail but received no response. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA referred to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR" title="Article 4 GDPR">Article 4(12) GDPR</a>, which broadly defines data breaches as a 'breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, <u>unauthorised disclosure</u> of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.' With this definition in mind, the DPA held that the controller violated the principle of confidentiality (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a>) by publishing on social networks the data subjects’ personal data without having a valid legal basis for it.  
</p><p>Furthermore, the DPA stated that the controller also infringed <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a> for failing to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the confidentiality of the data and to prevent the publication of the personal data on social media networks. Although <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a> does not, as such, establish a list of security measures, it obliges the controller to apply measures that are appropriate to the risk involved.  
</p><p>As a consequence, the DPA imposed a fine of €2,000 for the violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a>, taking into consideration that the data subjects could be identified by the data and that the publication could be widely shared on the internet. Moreover, the DPA imposed a fine of €1,000 for the violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>It should be noted that, in this decision, the DPA did not discuss <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a> and the possible lack of legal basis for publishing the personal data of the strike committee members on social media. Instead, the DPA treated the occurence as a confidentiality breach, that is, according to EDPB Guidelines 01/2021, 'unauthorised or accidental disclosure of, or access to, personal data.' Luca Tosoni seems to suggest, security breaches under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR" title="Article 4 GDPR">Article 4(12) GDPR</a>, including breaches of confidentiality, follow from and are directly related to the lack of appropriate technical and organisational measures under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Hence, they are usually not intentional as such.

Data Protection.


Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures

                                  previous questions


In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of article 4.1 of the GDPR, there is
the processing of personal data, since the UNION

Specific reasons for their appointment may be established by the Law of the Union or of the
Member states.

Article 4 section 12 of the RGPD defines, in a broad way, the "violations of security"
security of personal data" (hereinafter security breach) as "all
those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or alteration
Accidental or illegal transfer of personal data transmitted, stored or processed in

otherwise, or unauthorized communication or access to such data.”
In the present case, there is a personal data security breach in the

circumstances indicated above, categorized as a breach of confidentiality,
whenever the claimed party has disclosed information and data of a personal nature
to third parties, without legitimizing legal basis for it, when publishing on social networks, a
document in which the personal data (name, surname and ID) of the
members of the strike committee, with the multiplier effects that the use of the
social media may have for your visibility.


According to GT29, a "Breach of confidentiality" occurs when there is
an unauthorized or accidental disclosure of personal data, or access to it
themselves.


It should be noted that the identification of a security breach does not imply the impossibility
sanction directly by this Agency, since it is necessary to analyze the
diligence of managers and managers and security measures applied.

Within the principles of treatment provided for in article 5 of the GDPR, the
integrity and confidentiality of personal data is guaranteed in section 1.f)
of article 5 of the GDPR. For its part, the security of personal data comes
regulated in article 32 of the GDPR.

                                Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR

Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR establishes the following:

"Article 5 Principles relating to treatment:

(…)

f) processed in such a way as to guarantee adequate data security

In relation to this principle, Recital 39 of the aforementioned GDPR states that:

“[…]Personal data must be processed in a way that guarantees security and
appropriate confidentiality of personal data, including to prevent access

or unauthorized use of said data and of the equipment used in the treatment”.

The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the
claimed violated article 5.1 f) of the GDPR, principles relating to treatment.


The post exposed by the claimed party in the social networks supposes a treatment
automated system that, using the infrastructure of said networks, discloses some
facts and data that allow the claimants to be identified through the
exposed information, and said infrastructure is also a medium in which
They can multiply their effects by sharing the news with other users.


Consequently, it is considered that the accredited facts are constitutive of
infringement, attributable to the claimed party, due to violation of article 5.1.f) of the
GDPR.

                Classification of the infringement of article 5.1.f) of the GDPR


The aforementioned infringement of article 5.1.f) of the GDPR supposes the commission of the infringements
typified in article 83.5 of the GDPR that under the heading "General conditions
for the imposition of administrative fines” provides:

Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,

the highest amount:

       a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
       consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; (…)”


In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 "Infractions" establishes that
"The acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4,
5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result
contrary to this organic law”.


For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 "Infractions considered very
serious” of the LOPDGDD indicates:

"one. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which may include, among others:

       a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
       b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and

       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
       c) the ability to restore availability and access to data
       quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
       d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness
       technical and organizational measures to guarantee the safety of the

       treatment.

2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration will be given to
take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data
personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or

unauthorized access to such data.

3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct pursuant to article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the

present article.

4. The controller and the processor shall take measures to ensure that
any person acting under the authority of the controller or processor and
have access to personal data can only process such data by following

instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the Law of
the Union or of the Member States.

From the documentation in the file, there are clear indications that the
claimed has violated article 32 of the GDPR, when a security incident occurred
by publishing a document in which personal data appeared (name, last name,

ID) of the members of the strike committee, without having the technical measures
appropriate cas and organizational

It should be noted that the GDPR in the aforementioned precept does not establish a list of the
security measures that are applicable according to the data that is the object

of treatment, but it establishes that the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment
apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk involved
the treatment, taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, the
nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, probability risks
and severity for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.


In addition, security measures must be adequate and proportionate to the
detected risk, noting that the determination of the technical measures and
organizational procedures must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymization and encryption, the

In this sense, recital 83 of the GDPR states that:


       "(83) In order to maintain security and prevent processing from infringing what
provided in this Regulation, the person in charge or in charge must evaluate
the risks inherent to the treatment and apply measures to mitigate them, such as the

The responsibility of the defendant is determined by the lack of measures of
security, since it is responsible for making decisions aimed at implementing
effectively the appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a

level of security appropriate to the risk to ensure the confidentiality of the data,

entity has not only breached this obligation, but also the
adoption of measures in this regard, despite having notified him of the claim
presented.


Therefore, the accredited facts constitute an infraction, attributable to the
claimed party, for violation of article 32 GDPR.

principle of confidentiality and €1,000 for violation of article 32 of the aforementioned
GDPR, regarding the security of personal data processing.
