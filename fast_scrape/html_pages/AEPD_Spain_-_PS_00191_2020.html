It should be remembered that even in the case of a "simulated" camera the same

that this type of device can affect the privacy of third parties, who are seen to be
measured by it in the belief of being the object of permanent recording.

        On the part of private individuals, it is not possible to install devices for obtaining

images of public space, outside the cases allowed in the regulations.
