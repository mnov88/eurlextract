<p>The Spanish DPA held that it is not sufficient when a controller only sends their response to a data erasure request to the DPA after a complaint has been lodged. The response should rather be directly sent to the data subject within one month.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject exercised its right to erasure against COFIDIS S.A., SUCURSAL EN ESPAÑA, a bank focusing on consumer credits (the controller). The controller did not reply to this request. Subsequently, the data subject lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA and provided documents which proved that the right had been exercised.
</p><p>The DPA then granted the controller a hearing, so that they could present their point of view. As their response, the controller sent the DPA an answer to the request by the data subject. However, the controller still did not send a response directly to the data subject.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>First, the Spanish DPA pointed out that a controller needs to answer requests by a data subject within one month according to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12 GDPR</a>. The authority also noted that a controller must not in any case ignore requests by a data subject. The controller bears the burden of proof of compliance with these provisions.
</p><p>Second, the DPA held that it is not acceptable that the reponse to a request is only made on the occasion of an administrative procedure, like the formulation of allegations in this case.
</p><p>Hence, the DPA upheld the complaint. The authority additionally urged the controller to inform the data subject whether the right to erasure is granted or not within ten working days.

     File No.: EXP202203923

                              RESOLUTION Nº: R/00738/2022



Having regard to the claim made on March 7, 2022 before this Agency by A.A.A. (to
from now on the claiming party), against COFIDIS S.A., SUCURSAL EN ESPAÑA
(from now on the claimed party), for not having been duly attended to
request to exercise the rights established in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the

European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free
circulation of these data (hereinafter GDPR).

The procedural actions provided for in Title VIII of the Law have been carried out

Organic 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the following have been verified:


                                      FACTS


FIRST: The complaining party exercised the right of Suppression against the defendant,
without your request having received the legally established response.

The claimant provides various documentation related to the claim raised
before this Agency and on the exercise of the exercised right.


SECOND: Once the procedure provided for in article 65.4 of the LOPDGDD has been completed,
the claim was admitted for processing and the requested entity was granted processing of
hearing, so that within a period of fifteen business days he could present the allegations that
deemed convenient.


With its statement of allegations, the claimed entity has sent to this Agency the
response to the exercised right. However, it does not provide documentation proving
that the request for the exercise of rights has been duly answered to the
interested.



                           FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

FIRST: The Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of section 2 of article 56 in

relation to section 1 f) of article 57, both of the GDPR; and in article 47 of the
LOPDGDD.

SECOND: In accordance with the provisions of article 55 of the GDPR, the Agency
Española de Protección de Datos is competent to perform the functions that

are assigned to it in its article 57, among them, that of enforcing the Regulation and
promote awareness of controllers and processors
about the obligations incumbent upon them, as well as dealing with claims
presented by an interested party and investigate the reason for them.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/4









Correlatively, article 31 of the GDPR establishes the obligation of those responsible
and those in charge of the treatment to cooperate with the control authority that requests it in

the performance of their functions. In the event that they have designated a
data protection delegate, article 39 of the GDPR attributes to him the function of
cooperate with said authority.

In the same way, the internal legal system, in article 65.4 of the LOPDGDD, has
provided a mechanism prior to the admission for processing of the claims that are

formulated before the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, which consists of giving
transfer of the same to the data protection delegates designated by the
responsible or in charge of the treatment, for the purposes provided in article 37 of
the aforementioned norm, or to them when they have not designated them, so that they proceed to the
analysis of said claims and to respond to them within a month.


In accordance with this regulation, prior to the admission for processing of the
claim that gives rise to this procedure, it was transferred to the
responsible entity to proceed with its analysis, respond to this Agency
within a month and certify having provided the claimant with the due response,
in the event of exercise of the rights regulated in articles 15 to 22 of the

GDPR.

The result of said transfer did not allow us to understand satisfied the claims of the
complaining party. Consequently, on May 20, 2022, for the purposes of
