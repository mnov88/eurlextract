<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A citizen filed a complaint with the AEPD after he was disconnected from his electricity supply at Endesa Energia and had been put in the name of another person at EDP without his consent. He was re-registered at Endesa, also without his consent, 15 days later.
</p><p>EDP claimed to the AEPD that the complainant has not been their customer, so they did not have any data on him in their database.
</p><p>Endesa argued that, in accordance with the guidelines of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), the company responsible for providing consent to the change of electricity supplier is the incoming company. In this case, therefore, it would be up to EDP to prove that the customer had given its consent to the processing of data.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Is the processing of electricity supply data, without the consent of the data subject, a breach of Article 6 (1) GDPR?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA held that the processing of data relating to electricity supply consists of processing personal data, and therefore they cannot be transmitted without the consent of the person concerned, or another legal basis where appropriate.
</p><p>According to the case-law of the Spanish Supreme Court, the data called "CUPS" ("Codigo Universal de Punto de Suministro") are encrypted personal data, since the identity of the resident can be ascertained through simple checks.
</p><p>In this case, the aggravating circumstances (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2" title="Article 83 GDPR">Article 83(2) GDPR</a>) have been taken into account, namely, the fact that it was a negligent, unintentional but significant action and, furthermore, the evident link between the business activity of the person claimed and the processing of personal data of customers or third parties.
</p><p>In view of the above, the Spanish DPA imposed a penalty of €50000 on EDP ENERGY S.A.U. for infringing <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a> by processing personal data without a legal basis.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>The Spanish Supreme Court in its ruling STS 2484/2019 analyzed the obligation of supply companies to transmit data relating to supply contracts to the public authorities. 
</p><p>In this ruling, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled that the data transmitted by supply companies are personal data since they can be linked to a specific person through simple procedures. Furthermore, it denied the need to request the consent of the data subjects when these data are transmitted to the government, as it is covered by the legal basis of pursuing the general interest, namely to prevent electricity fraud and to preserve the proper functioning of the national electricity network.

The complainant states that he was the holder of a contract for the supply of electricity with the company Endesa Energía S.A.U., (hereinafter "Endesa Energía") associated with the supply point located in the street ***DIRECTION.1 from 21 February 2017 until 19 December 2018, when he was discharged due to a change of marketing company and there was also a change of title in the aforementioned contract, not knowing the name of the latter. 

Subsequently, in relation to the aforementioned point of supply, A new contract was concluded by the complainant on 3 January 2019. It provides, among others, the following documents:

 -Last invoice from Endesa Energía (from 08/11/2018 to 19/12/2018).
- Notification from Endesa Energía dated 20/12/2018, participating in the deregistration of street electricity contract ***DIRECTION.1.

03/01/2019”.


SECOND: 

In accordance with Article 65.4 of the LOPDGDD, which provides for a mechanism prior to the admission of complaints to the AEPD, consisting of transferring them to the Data Protection Delegates
appointed by the controllers or persons responsible for the processing, for the purposes in Article 37 of the said law, or to them when they have not been designated, was transfer of the claim to the entity being claimed for analysis and respond to the complainant and to this Agency within one month.

As a result of this procedure:

In its letter of 10 July 2019, Endesa Energía states that when they receive a communication from the distributor in the sense of "activation of change of marketer" with regard to one of their clients, they initiate the procedure the internal "Change of Marketing Company", proceeding to meet the request for
the distributor.

LEGAL FOUNDATIONS
I
By virtue of the powers conferred on each of the parties by Article 58(2) of the GDPR authority, and in accordance with the provisions of Articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

II
The defendant is charged with an infringement of Article 6 of the GPRS, "Lawfulness of processing", which states in paragraph 1 the cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:
 "1. Processing shall be lawful only if at least one of the following conditions is met conditions:
a) the data subject has given his consent to the processing of his data for one or more specific purposes;
(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the interested is a party to or for the application at his request of measures pre-contractual;
(…)”
The infraction is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers it as such:
“5. Infringements of the following provisions shall be sanctioned, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 20 000 000 or in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual turnover for the previous financial year, opting for the largest:

(a) The basic principles for treatment, including the conditions for consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9.  Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infringements considered to be very serious" he states:

"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and will expire after three years if constitute a substantial breach of the articles mentioned in that one and, in In particular, the following:

 (…)
b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions for the lawfulness of processing laid down in Article 6 of Regulation (EU)2016/679.

III
The documentation in the file provides evidence that the party claimed violated Article 6.1 of the RGPD.
In this sense, it is accredited that the defendant processed the personal data of the claimant without legitimizing it. It is clear that the claimant (marketer the claimant's contract with the company (the
(Endesa Energía), which is done through the number of CUPS that is associated with housing.

It should be taken into account, without prejudice to the above, that the claimed party provides the contract for the change of ownership, for the aforementioned point of supply, but it is noted that it is completed by a person as representative of the new owner. They provide the representative's ID card and the signed contract by the latter, but in no case the consent of the new owner.

And, for this purpose, Law 24/2013, of 26 December, on the electricity sector (in the "Electricity Sector Act"), establishes the consumer's right to change as a marketing company in accordance with the European directives of the internal electricity market.

To this end, the legislation sets out the general process to be followed between the new marketer or incoming marketer, the distributor, and the existing or outgoing marketing company. This change implies the registration of a new energy supply contract with the incoming marketer and the withdrawal of the existing contract with the outgoing marketer, through an agent who executes the change that is the distributor.

Likewise, Article 46 of the Electricity Sector Law establishes among the obligations of marketers, in paragraph 1(g) that of "Formalising the supply contracts with consumers in accordance with the regulations
that is applicable". The mention by the Law of the obligation to formalize the contract between the obligations of the marketers shows that it is the The marketing company is the holder of the supply contract with the consumer. Therefore, corresponds to the marketer and, in the event of a change of marketer, to the
incoming marketer, check the identity and the voluntary, correct and informed provision of consent by the consumer, who is his counterpart in the supply contract.

In this sense, the new marketer (the one claimed) will have to manage the termination of the claimant's contract with its outgoing trading company (Endesa Energía), this is done through the number of CUPS associated with the home. At definitively, it treats your personal data.

Therefore, having established that the data was processed by the respondent the claimant's personal data, who refuses to consent to the processing, and insofar as the first has not provided any evidence to disprove such evidence, it is estimated that the facts submitted for assessment by this Agency constitute a
violation of Article 6.1 of the RGPD, violation of Article 83.5 of the same Regulation 2016/679.


IV

In determining the administrative fine to be imposed, the following must be observed provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, which state "Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of the fines administrative offences under this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 9 and 6 are on a case-by-case basis effective, proportionate and dissuasive".

(j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or to mechanisms of certification approved in accordance with Article 42, and
(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits obtained or the losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement".

With respect to paragraph k) of Article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, Article 76, "Sanctions and corrective measures", it provides:

(a) the continuing nature of the infringement
(b) The link between the activity of the offender and the carrying out of the processing of personal data.

Consequently, they have been taken into account as aggravating circumstances:
In the present case we are dealing with negligent action, not intentional, but significant (Article 83.2 b GPRS).
The obvious link between the business activity of the respondent and the processing of personal data of clients or third parties art. 83.2 k) of the RGPD, in relationship with art. 76.2 of the LOPDGDD.
