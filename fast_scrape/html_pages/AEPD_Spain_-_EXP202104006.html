<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 21 August 2021 the data subject filed a complaint against Vodafone España, S.A.U., the controller, for violating their right of access.
</p><p>The data subject requested VODAFONE to provide a copy of their commercial telephone contract, since the company was, allegedly, not applying the contracted tariff. After several unsuccessful attempts to receive their contract, the controller sent an email containing contract of another customer as well as an audio recording of that customer's data. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA ('AEPD') highlighted the breach of confidentially and security by VODAFONE for sharing a commercial contract of another individual with the data subject, violating <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a>. According to the evidence presented, the data subject acquired access to name, ID number and telephone number of an unknown person without any authorization to disclose their data to third parties. 
</p><p>The AEPD, therefore, found a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a> for not implementing the appropriate technical and organization measures to prevent such incident. 
</p><p>The AEPD fined VODAFONE €50,000 for violating <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a> and €20,000 for violating <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR.</a> However, in this case, the AEPD gave two possibilities to VODAFONE to either acknowledge the liability, leading to a greater reduction in the final amount, totaling €42,000 or to pay a fine of €56,000 and renounce any form of appeal against the sanction.  
</p><p>VODAFONE opted for a voluntary payment option, paying a fine of €56,000. This payment utilized the reduction offered in the initial agreement for early payment, indicating a renunciation of any form of administrative appeal against the sanction.

     File No.: EXP202104006

       RESOLUTION OF TERMINATION OF THE PAYMENT PROCEDURE
                                    VOLUNTEER


From the procedure instructed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based
to the following

                                  BACKGROUND


FIRST: On August 10, 2022, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against VODAFONE
SPAIN, S.A.U. (hereinafter, the claimed party), through the Agreement that is
transcribes:


&lt;&lt;



File No.: EXP202104006



            AGREEMENT TO START SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

Of the actions carried out by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and in

based on the following

                                      FACTS

FIRST: A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complaining party) dated August 21, 2021

filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
claim is directed against VODAFONE ESPAÑA, S.A.U. with NIF A80907397 (in
forward, VODAFONE). The reasons on which the claim is based are the following:

Indicates that you have requested a copy of your telephone contract from VODAFONE because it is not

applying the contracted rate. That he has requested it on several occasions without being
forward (infringement of your right to access your personal data). Finally
receives an email with another client's telephone contract, violating the
secrecy of the personal data of said client.


Along with the notification, an audio file in mp3 format is provided, in which you can
listening to a recording in which two people intervene, one on behalf of
VODAFONE, and another that identifies itself as B.B.B. with DNI ***NIF.1, owner of the line
phone ***PHONE.1. The recording is dated 07/28/2020.


There is no record of the date on which the complaining party has had access to said
recording, since he has not sent the email in which he states that he had


C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/11








received. Likewise, the complaining party does not provide a document proving that it has
required VODAFONE its own contract.


SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
