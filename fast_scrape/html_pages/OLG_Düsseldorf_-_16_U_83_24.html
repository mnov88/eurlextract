<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject was a user of the controller’s France-based music streaming service since 2015.  
</p><p>The controller used an Israel-based company as a processor on the basis of an agreement pursuant to Article 28 GDPR. Their agreement foresaw that upon termination of their contractual relationship the processor must sent back all personal data it processed on behalf of the controller and then arrange the deletion of all copies retained by it or its sub-processors in 21 days.  The processor engaged a group affiliate as a sub-processor, without ensuring a proper sub-processing agreement. 
</p><p>In November 2020, the contractual agreement  between the controller and the processor was terminated.  with a deletion confirmation only being received in February 2023. 
</p><p>In November 2022, the controller became aware of a hacking incident that  exposed customer personal data, including names, birthdates, and email addresses, which were offered for sale on the darknet. The controller submitted a personal data breach notification to the DPA and informed the data subjects accordingly. 
</p><p>The data subject filed a case before the court of first instance (Regional Court Duisburg - LG Duisburg) demanding immaterial damages.
</p><p>The Regional Court Duisburg rejected the case as unfounded, citing lack of proof of damage and insufficient evidence of actual data exposure.  
</p><p>The data subject filed an appeal before the court of appeal (Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf - OLG Düsseldorf). In the meantime he was able to obtain the leaked list on the darknet and prove that the data published therein concerning him originated from the controller. He claimed that  the controller was not allowed to transfer the data to the processor at all, it did not check whether its processor had deleted the data, and there was no contractual relationship between the processor and sub-processor. The data subject requested for: 
</p><p>- Compensation for non-material damages for data protection violations in the amount of €3,000, 
</p><p>- Compensation for non-material damages for the failure to provide extrajudicial data information in accordance with the statutory requirements within the meaning of Article 15 GDPR, 
</p><p>-Compensation for for all material future damages that he has suffered and/or will suffer as a result of unauthorised access by third parties, 
</p><p>-A cease and desist order from any further access to the data archive.  
</p><p>-A declaratory judgement.   
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The data subject's appeal was partially upheld.  
</p><p>The court found that at the time of the hacking incident, the personal data of the users of the controller's streaming service were still stored by the sub-processor, although the data processing relationship between the controller and processor had already ended at that time. 
</p><p>First, the court determined that the continued storage of personal data by the sub-processor already constitutes a breach of the principle of data minimisation under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(c) GDPR</a> attributed to the controller. 
</p><p>Second, it found that the controller had not implemented adequate organisational safeguards under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR#1" title="Article 24 GDPR">Article 24(1) GDPR</a> and could not shift responsibility to the processor or sub-processor. It was the controller’s failure to ensure deletion of personal data after the termination of its contract with the processor, which enabled the subsequent data breach. It also reiterated the controller’s burden under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(2) GDPR</a> to demonstrate lawful processing and oversight, especially in relation to processor relationships governed by <a href="/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR" title="Article 28 GDPR">Article 28 GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>Third, it held that the data subject suffered non-material damage in the form of loss of control over his personal data as a result of the controller's data breach, following the judgement of the <a href="/index.php?title=BGH_-_VI_ZR_10/24" title="BGH - VI ZR 10/24">Federal Court of Justice</a>. It ruled that he was entitled to compensation in the amount of €100 for the mere loss of control under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR#1" title="Article 82 GDPR">Article 82(1) GDPR</a>, and €100 for the negative feelings associated with the loss of control, such as fears and anxieties, as well as time and effort spent in dealing with the scraping incident and protecting against future data misuse.   
</p><p>Fourth, The Court also granted the data subject’s request to a declaratory judgment, confirming the controller’s future liability for material damages arising from the breach.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>However, the Court rejected: his  €3,000 compensation request as unsubstantiated, the separate damages claim under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15 GDPR</a> due to insufficient evidence of harm from incomplete information, and the injunction request, which was dismissed as insufficiently precise.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>This judgment affirms that failure to verify data deletion by a sub-processor post-contract can trigger controller liability under Article 82(1), highlighting the importance of the controller’s governance obligations over sub-processing activities under Articles 5, 24, and 28. It also reinforces the growing line of German case law holding that loss of control over personal data is sufficient to establish immaterial damage.

<pre>Operative Part

Upon the plaintiff's appeal, the judgment of the 10th Civil Chamber of the Duisburg Regional Court (10 O 158/23), delivered on February 28, 2024, is partially amended and, while dismissing the further appeal, is entirely reformulated as follows:

The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff non-material damages in the amount of €200 as compensation for data protection violations, plus interest at a rate of 5 percentage points above the base interest rate from August 26, 2023.

It is determined that the defendant is obligated to compensate the plaintiff for all future material damages that the plaintiff will incur as a result of the unauthorized access to the data archive of the defendant or its (former) vicarious agents, which, according to the defendant, occurred in 2022.

The defendant is ordered to indemnify the plaintiff for the out-of-court legal costs incurred in the amount of €220.27.

The rest of the claim is dismissed.

The plaintiff shall bear 90% of the legal costs in both instances, and the defendant 10%.

The judgment is provisionally enforceable against the provision of security in the amount of 110% of the respective amounts to be enforced.

An appeal is denied.

Reasons

I.

The plaintiff is pursuing claims against the defendant in the appeal court – after partially withdrawing the appeal – for damages, a determination of future liability to pay compensation, an injunction against the provision of data to third parties, and an indemnity against out-of-court legal costs.

The plaintiff first used the music streaming service of the defendant, a company based in France that operates the online music streaming service "www.A..com," in 2015. Regarding the plaintiff's master data stored by the defendant in this context, which also included his email address "000000.com," reference is made to the images in the file (pp. 104-105 of the GA LG and p. 193 of the GA OLG).

As was undisputed in the appeal court, the defendant used B. Ltd., based in Israel, as an external processor on the basis of a contract concluded on December 1, 2016, and a supplementary agreement concluded on July 18, 2019 (Exhibit B2a, pp. 173-187 of the GA LG). The Addendum Agreement provided, among other things:

"9.1 Subject to Section 9.2, the Provider shall, at the Company's option, either (a) return to the Company a complete copy of all Company Personal Data by secure file transfer in a format that the Company shall reasonably notify to the Provider, and thereafter delete and procure the deletion of all other copies of the Company Personal Data processed by the Provider or the Sub-Processors within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the date of termination of the Services involving the Processing of Company Personal Data (the "Termination Date"), or (b) delete the Data within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the Termination Date and procure the deletion of all other copies of the Company Personal Data processed by the Provider or the Sub-Processors.

[...]

9.3 The Provider must confirm in writing to the Company that it and each Sub-Processor have complied with this Section 9 within twenty-one (21) calendar days after the termination date.

[...]

10.1 Subject to reasonable prior written notice, the Processor shall provide the Controller with all necessary information and permit audits, including inspections, to be conducted by the Controller or any other auditor appointed by the Controller, where reasonably necessary, and contribute to:

(i) verifying that the Processor (or any Subprocessor) complies with its obligations under Article 28 of the GDPR and the provisions of this Addendum;

According to the contractual agreement with the Defendant, B.- Ltd. was entitled to use Subprocessors. The Defendant exercised this right by engaging its affiliated company C.- Inc., although no written Subprocessing Agreement was concluded between the two companies.

The contractual relationship between the defendant and its processor ended on November 30, 2020. On the same day, C.- Inc. notified the defendant by email (Exhibit B4, pages 206-207 of the GA LG) that certain data processed on the defendant's behalf up to that point would be deleted the following day:

"I wanted to notify you that as our contract terminates today, we will be deleting your site and all the data on the site tomorrow. Please confirm receipt of this email."

C.- Inc., representing the defendant's B. Ltd., first confirmed that the data had indeed been deleted in an email dated February 22, 2023 (Exhibit B5). The background to this statement was that a hacking attack had become known in which unknown hackers had stolen data from the defendant's customers. Since November 6, 2022, the hackers had been offering this data for sale on the dark web. After becoming aware of this, the defendant submitted a notification of a personal data breach to the French data protection authority (CNIL) (Commission Nationale Informatique &amp; Libertés) on November 10, 2022. For details of the notification, reference is made to this notification (Exhibit B1a, pp. 129-153 of the GA LG). The defendant also informed the public on November 11, 2022, with an information text on its website (Exhibit B8, pp. 247-250 of the GA LG). It stated, among other things:

"The data that may have been disclosed includes basic information such as first and last name, date of birth, and email address."

Users registered with the defendant also received an email from the defendant dated January 31, 2023 (Exhibit B9), informing them of the hacker attack. According to this email, the disclosed data allegedly included information such as names, dates of birth, and email addresses.

According to the defendant, the following information could have been affected by the hacking attack: last name, first name, user name, date of birth, gender, language, country, email address, user ID, data on the use of the A. service (acquisition origin, free or paid nature of the account), and preferences (number of favorite songs, communication preferences). The stolen data dated 2019.

In an email dated April 14, 2023 (Exhibit RAS01, pages 39-48 of the GA LG), the plaintiff asserted claims against the defendant and demanded information from the defendant. The email stated the following regarding the request for information:

"Specifically, you are instructed to provide information about which of our clients' personal data could have been obtained by unauthorized persons, namely, which of our clients' data was obtained by which recipients at what time through the theft of data backups or in other unauthorized ways."

In June 2023, C.- Inc. admitted that three of its employees had transferred the defendant's data records affected by the incident – without the defendant's consent or knowledge – to a so-called non-production environment operated outside of the contractual relationship with the defendant, and that the data had not been deleted, contrary to the agreement with the defendant.

For further details of the facts and circumstances of the dispute in the first instance, as well as the motions filed there, reference is made to the findings of fact in the district court's judgment pursuant to Section 540 (1) Sentence 1 No. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, insofar as they do not contradict those of the Senate.

With the consent of the parties, the district court ordered the written procedure pursuant to Section 128 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure by order of January 18, 2024. At the pronouncement date set for February 28, 2024, it dismissed the plaintiff's action by judgment. In its justification, it essentially stated that the action was already partially inadmissible and otherwise unfounded. The plaintiff was not entitled to a claim for damages in accordance with claim 1 because he had not convincingly demonstrated non-material damage. A mere loss of control over data was not sufficient in this respect. The plaintiff had not convincingly demonstrated psychological impairments because he had lacked specific, individual evidence in this regard. This also applied because the plaintiff could not even say whether he was affected by the data leak at all. The plaintiff's declaratory action 3 was inadmissible because it lacked the probability of damage occurring necessary for pure financial loss. In the absence of impairment, the plaintiff was not entitled to an injunction against the defendant. The request for information 5 was unfounded because the defendant had fulfilled the plaintiff's right to information. The requirements for a claim for an affidavit were neither presented nor apparent. Because the right to information has been fulfilled, the plaintiff is not entitled to the claim for damages for insufficient information pursued in claim 2. Claim 6, which is dependent on the success of the principal claim, also remains unsuccessful and, moreover, is not subject to interest under any circumstances.

The plaintiff is appealing against the District Court's legal assessment, pursuing his first-instance claims with certain reformulations. The plaintiff claims that his legal representative was able to obtain the leak list traded on the darknet in the meantime. This results in a data set that proves that the data published therein concerning him originated from the defendant. He is entitled to the asserted claim for damages. The defendant is accused of several data protection violations. It was not permitted to transmit the data to the processor in the first place, it subsequently failed to check whether its processor had deleted the data, and furthermore, there is a lack of confidentiality in the relationship between B. Ltd. to C.- Inc. in an authorized subcontract processing operation. Contrary to the opinion of the Regional Court, mere loss of control is sufficient to constitute damage within the meaning of Art. 82 GDPR. A loss of control prior to the defendant's data leak does not yet consist in the defendant making his email address accessible to others to the usual extent. He states that he only uses his email address to the usual extent, does not disclose it to unknown third parties, and uses it online only within the scope of his account. He has a well-founded fear that his data will be misused in the future. This concern is also fed by the fact that the data has been included in the leak list. To the extent that the Regional Court completely denied him this concern, this is presumptuous. His failure to hold a hearing is a procedural error. His declaratory action is well-founded. It cannot be assumed that everything will go well in the future. His injunction is admissible and well-founded because it cannot be ruled out that the defendant will again make the data available to vicarious agents. The claim for damages is justified because of the inadequate information provided. The unanswered questions and the uncertainty have deepened his discomfort. Finally, the request for exemption from pre-trial legal fees is justified.

The plaintiff requests – after partially withdrawing the appeal to the extent of the previous appeal request under point 5 (request for information) – by way of amendment:

1. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff non-material damages as compensation for data protection violations, the amount of which is left to the discretion of the court, but should not be less than €3,000.00, plus interest at a rate of 5 percentage points above the respective ECB base interest rate from the date of commencement of proceedings;

2. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff further non-material damages for the failure to provide out-of-court data disclosure in accordance with the statutory requirements within the meaning of Art. 15 GDPR, the amount of which is left to the discretion of the court, but should not be less than €2,000.00, plus interest at a rate of 5 percentage points above the respective ECB base interest rate from the date of commencement of proceedings;

3. It is determined that the defendant is obligated to compensate the plaintiff for all future material damages that the plaintiff has incurred and/or will incur as a result of the unauthorized access by third parties to the data archive of the defendant or its (former) vicarious agents, which, according to the defendant, occurred in 2022;

4. The defendant is ordered to refrain from making personal data of the plaintiff, namely first and last name, date of birth, email address, and user ID, accessible to third parties without the plaintiff's consent or a legitimate interest of the defendant, on pain of a fine of up to €250,000.00 to be determined by the court for each case of violation, or alternatively, imprisonment to be enforced against its legal representative (director), or imprisonment to be enforced against its legal representative (director) for up to six months, or up to two years in the event of a repeat offense;

5. The defendant is ordered to indemnify the plaintiff for the out-of-court legal costs incurred for the legal proceedings in the amount of €887.03 plus interest at a rate of 5 percentage points above the respective ECB base interest rate from the date of commencement of proceedings.

The defendant requests that

the appeal be dismissed.

The defendant defends the district court's judgment as correct. It is of the opinion that the plaintiff cannot claim that the district court failed to hear the plaintiff's case as a procedural error. The decision in the written proceedings was made by agreement of the parties. The appeal's submission regarding the plaintiff's data found in a data set on the darknet was not properly substantiated. For this purpose, the data set had to be made available in accordance with Section 371 (1) Sentence 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The defendant is not liable to the plaintiff because both it and its processor were only required to provide, and did provide, a level of protection appropriate to the risk. It was not necessary to reliably rule out every type of hacker attack. The fact that its processor processed the data without authorization and for purposes unrelated to the contract cannot be attributed to the plaintiff as an excess of the processor. The plaintiff has not sufficiently demonstrated that he still had control over his data before the hacker attack and therefore cannot invoke a loss of control. The mere reliance on a certain emotional state without negative consequences does not constitute non-material damage within the meaning of Art. 82 (1) GDPR, nor does the purely hypothetical risk of misuse of the data.

For further details of the parties' appeal submissions, reference is made to the written submissions exchanged in the appeal court. The Senate heard the plaintiff personally for information purposes at the oral hearing on April 11, 2025. For the outcome, reference is made to the minutes of the hearing (pp. 260-264 of the GA OLG).

II.

The plaintiff's appeal is well-founded, to the extent that it is not inadmissible, to the extent apparent from the operative part. To the extent that it goes further, it is unfounded and must therefore be dismissed.

1.

The international jurisdiction of the German courts, which must also be examined ex officio in the appeal court, follows from Article 82 (6) in conjunction with Article 79 (2) sentence 2 GDPR, because the plaintiff, as the data subject, has his or her habitual residence in Germany and, according to the parties' submissions, the General Data Protection Regulation is applicable in temporal, material, and territorial terms.

The temporal scope of application of the General Data Protection Regulation, which entered into force on May 25, 2018, pursuant to Article 99 (2) GDPR, is open. It is undisputed between the parties in the appeal court that the plaintiff was affected by possible data protection violations by the defendant in 2022, and thus at the time the General Data Protection Regulation came into force.

The material scope of application of the General Data Protection Regulation is also open. According to Art. 2 (1) GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation applies, among other things, to the automated processing of personal data. The plaintiff's data in focus here, which can be found in the so-called leaked dataset or the defendant's list of the plaintiff's master data stored by it, constitutes such personal data because, according to the definition in Art. 4 (1) GDPR, it relates to an identified - data subject - person. Contrary to the defendant's argument, this is not contradicted by the fact that third parties cannot easily identify the plaintiff based on the data. The data was also processed automatically by the defendant.

Finally, the geographical scope of application of the General Data Protection Regulation is also open. According to Art. 3 (1) GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal data insofar as this takes place within the scope of the activities of an establishment of a controller in the European Union. The defendant is a company incorporated under French law with its registered office in France, thus with a branch within the European Union. Since the defendant operates its streaming service for users in the European Union, it is also the controller within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR. The fact that the accessed data was last stored at C.- Inc. in Israel is irrelevant. Pursuant to Art. 3 Para. 1 GDPR, the territorial scope of application is independent of whether the processing takes place in the European Union.

2.

The appeal is inadmissible insofar as the plaintiff continues to claim interest on the amount of the exemption application with regard to the out-of-court legal costs. In this respect, the grounds for appeal do not meet the requirements of Section 520 Para. 3 Sentence 2 Nos. 1 and 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO). Accordingly, a proper grounds for appeal must, in principle, challenge all the fundamental considerations used to justify the decision on the individual claims in the contested judgment. Such a detailed, differentiated grounds for appeal are only unnecessary if the lower court has declared all claims unfounded for a single reason common to all claims (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of September 27, 2000 - XII ZR 281/98, juris, para. 7). However, this is not the case here with regard to the interest claim associated with the indemnification claim. The Regional Court made independent statements in support of the dismissal of the interest claim, which go beyond the dismissal of the ancillary claim due to its dependence on the principal claim. The grounds for appeal do not address this at all.

3.

To the extent that the appeal is admissible, it is also partially well-founded. This is determined not only by the provisions of the GDPR, but also by German law, since this is applicable pursuant to Article 6 (1) (b) of the Rome I Regulation because the plaintiff is a consumer and the defendant, as a company, has focused its streaming services on Germany.

a)

The first claim for compensation for non-material damage is admissible and also partially well-founded. The plaintiff is entitled to damages from the defendant pursuant to Art. 82 (1) GDPR in the amount of €200 plus interest from the date of commencement of proceedings.

aa)

According to Art. 82 (1) GDPR, a claim for damages under this provision requires a breach of the General Data Protection Regulation by the controller, the occurrence of damage, and a causal connection between the breach and the damage (see also ECJ, judgments of May 4, 2023 - C-300/21, ZIP 2023, 1244, 1246, para. 32, and of January 25, 2024 - C-687/21, DB 2024, 519, 523, para. 58). In this case, the defendant not only violated the General Data Protection Regulation, but the plaintiff also suffered compensable non-material damage as a result. The plaintiff does not claim any material damage caused to him by the defendant's data protection violations.

(1)

The violation of the General Data Protection Regulation required by Article 82(1) GDPR for a claim for damages has been committed. It is irrelevant at this point whether every violation of substantive or formal provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation or only data processing in violation of the Regulation within the meaning of Article 82(2) Sentence 1 GDPR can give rise to a claim for damages under Article 82(1) GDPR. Since data was stored by a subprocessor of the defendant in violation of the Regulation, this constitutes not only a violation of the General Data Protection Regulation, but also data processing in violation of the Regulation.

(a)

According to Art. 4 No. 2 GDPR, the term "data processing" also includes any storage operation carried out with or without the aid of automated procedures. At the time of the hacking incident, the personal data of the users of the defendant's streaming service was still stored by C.- Inc., although the contract processing relationship between the defendant and B.- Ltd. had already ended at that time.

(b)

This continued storage of personal data already constitutes a violation of the General Data Protection Regulation. According to the principle of data minimization set out in Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR, data must be deleted if they are no longer required for the original processing purposes (ECJ, judgment of October 4, 2024 - C-446/21, juris, para. 56). The controller is obliged to limit the period of collection of the personal data in question to what is absolutely necessary in view of the intended purpose of the processing (ECJ, judgment of October 4, 2024 - C-446/21, juris, para. 52). According to Article 5 (1) (e) GDPR, further storage is only considered for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, in accordance with the principle of storage limitation. According to Art. 5 (2) GDPR, the controller bears the burden of proof of lawful data processing (ECJ, judgment of July 4, 2023 - C-252/21, juris, para. 95), in this case the defendant. Accordingly, the data processing was unlawful. The defendant does not provide any justification for the aforementioned data processing. In particular, it does not itself assert that storage was necessary beyond the duration of the contract processing relationship.

(c)

For the plaintiff's claim for damages under Art. 82 (1) GDPR, it is also irrelevant whether the defendant is responsible for further data protection violations beyond this data protection violation. The existence of multiple data protection violations leading to the unlawful data processing operation that caused the damage has no impact on the amount of any claim for damages (see ECJ, judgment of April 11, 2024 - C-741/21, juris, paras. 64 et seq.).

(2)

The data protection violation resulting from the continued storage at C.- Inc. is attributable to the defendant as the controller within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR, also pursuant to Art. 82 (2) Sentence 1 GDPR. The defendant has not demonstrated that the data storage that led to the damage cannot be attributed to it. It should have provided corresponding evidence (see ECJ, judgment of December 21, 2023 - C-667/21, juris, para. 103), but has not.

According to Art. 82 (3) GDPR, an exemption from liability requires the controller to prove that it is in no way responsible for the circumstance that caused the damage. For this reason, in the event of a personal data breach by a person under its authority, the controller can only benefit from this exemption if it proves that there is no causal connection between the possible breach of its data protection obligation under Art. 5, 24, and 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation and the damage caused to the data subject (see ECJ, judgment of April 11, 2024 - C-741/21, juris, para. 51). The same applies to the relationship between the controller and the processor.

This necessary proof fails here because the defendant does not meet the requirements of Art. 24 (1) sentence 1 GDPR and has not taken sufficient organizational measures to ensure that the personal data provided to B.-Ltd. Data transferred for contract processing will be deleted after the end of the contract processing relationship. The defendant – ultimately undisputed – did not adequately monitor its processors. It refers solely to an email from C.- Inc. dated November 30, 2020 (Exhibit B4). However, the announcement contained therein that all data on its side would be deleted did not even meet the contractual minimum requirements for a deletion notification in the legal relationship between the defendant and B.- Ltd. The defendant neither subsequently inquired with C.- Inc. whether the deletion had actually been carried out, nor did it request proof of this. This made the data protection violation inherent in the continued storage by C.- Inc. possible in the first place. Had the defendant fulfilled its monitoring obligations, it would have been noticed that the data had not been deleted, contrary to the announcement.

Contrary to the defendant's opinion, no excess on the part of the subcontractor precludes attribution of the data protection violation. Although, according to the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union on Art. 83 GDPR, the controller's liability for the conduct of a processor does not extend to cases in which the processor has processed personal data for its own purposes or has processed those data in a manner incompatible with the framework or modalities of processing as defined by the controller, or in a manner that cannot reasonably be assumed to have been consented to by the controller (ECJ, judgment of December 5, 2023 - C-683/21, juris, para. 85), this principle does not apply within the framework of Art. 82 GDPR, at least if the processor's data protection breach was made possible by a lack of organizational measures. If the processor only commits an excess of data due to inadequate organizational measures, for example – as in this case – due to a lack of controls, the controller remains liable (cf. Taeger/Gabel, in: ibid., GDPR - BDSG - TTDSG, 4th ed., Art. 82 GDPR, para. 24).

(3)

The defendant cannot successfully claim that the plaintiff was not affected by the data protection breach. If the defendant's customer data had been deleted from C.- Inc. upon termination of the contract processing relationship with B.-Ltd., the hackers would no longer have been able to access it in 2022. The defendant cannot deny, on the grounds of ignorance, that and which of its customers' data was still stored there at the time of the hacker attack, pursuant to Section 138 (4) of the Code of Civil Procedure. Rather, it could and should have inquired within its chain of processors to determine which data had not been deleted and was thus exposed to hacker access. Apart from this, the defendant has not challenged the plaintiff's assertion that his email address, which was part of the defendant's master data, was affected by the hacker attack according to the search results on the website "www.000000.com." However, if the resulting overall picture suggests that the plaintiff's email address was affected by the data breach, the defendant cannot generally doubt that the plaintiff's impact did not extend to other data stored by it, even though it had previously publicly admitted out of court that this data could in principle have been affected by the data breach. A qualified denial would then require further explanation of the reasons why the personal data disclosed by the plaintiff was exceptionally sparse.

(4)

The plaintiff also suffered non-material damage within the meaning of Article 82 (1) GDPR as a result of the defendant's data protection breach, which enabled the hackers to access the plaintiff's data in the first place.

(a)

In the absence of a reference to the domestic law of the Member States contained in Article 82 (1) GDPR, the concept of "non-material damage" must be defined autonomously under EU law. Accordingly, the relevant definition is the understanding of the term as developed in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. According to Recital 146, Sentence 3 GDPR, the concept of damage should be interpreted broadly, in a manner that fully complies with the objectives of the Regulation. However, according to the case law of the Court of Justice, a mere violation of the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation is not sufficient to establish a claim for damages. Rather, the occurrence of damage as a result of this violation is also required.

However, according to the case law of the Court of Justice, non-material damage giving rise to liability within the meaning of Art. 82 (1) GDPR may already arise from the loss of control over personal data – even a temporary one – without the concept of "non-material damage" requiring proof of additional appreciable negative consequences. In this respect, after re-examining the case law of the Court of Justice, the Senate agrees with the interpretation advocated by the Federal Court of Justice in this regard (see BGH, judgments of November 18, 2024 – VI ZR 10/24, juris, para. 30, and of February 11, 2025 – VI ZR 365/22, juris, para. 15). The Senate defines a loss of control as a situation in which the data subject can no longer control his or her personal data, for example because it has been disclosed to third parties unknown to him or her or without significant limitation. This is the case with scraping and the publication of data on the internet, but not yet – for example – with the disclosure of the telephone number to specific recipients or its use for two-factor authentication when using user accounts. In such a case, the data is not yet publicly published (see Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 – VI ZR 10/24, juris, para. 41).

(b)

The plaintiff's submissions meet these requirements, at least in the appeal court, insofar as he argued there that the leak list published by the hackers on the darknet also contained his data – namely his last name, country, and email address. In the grounds of appeal, the plaintiff also argued, in essence, that he had not previously publicly published this and other data stored by the defendant, but had only made it accessible to others to the usual extent.The defendant denied that the plaintiff only lost control of his data when the data was intercepted at C.- Inc., but this argument does not meet the requirements for a qualified denial required in this case. The plaintiff's alleged negative fact that he had not lost control of the data beforehand, and in particular that he had not published it publicly on the internet, would have had to be refuted by the defendant with the specific statement that a loss of control had already occurred beforehand (see, on this secondary burden of proof, Federal Court of Justice, judgments of October 11, 2007 - IX ZR 105/06, juris, para. 12, and of January 8, 2019 - II ZR 139/17, juris, para. 31; also Federal Labor Court, judgment of December 16, 2021 - 2 AZR 356/21, juris, paras. 31 et seq.). However, the defendant did not make such a plea.

(5)

The amount of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled under Article 82 (1) GDPR for the non-material damage suffered shall be determined in accordance with the principles of tort law under German law.

(a)

The General Data Protection Regulation does not contain any provision governing the assessment of the damages owed under Article 82 (1) GDPR. In particular, due to the different purposes of the provisions, the criteria set out in Article 83 GDPR cannot be applied. Rather, the assessment is based on the domestic provisions governing the extent of financial compensation, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris, para. 93). In Germany, the procedural provision of Section 287 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) applies in particular.

However, when determining the damage to be compensated under Art. 82 (1) GDPR, domestic procedural autonomy is subject to the limitations arising from the principles of equivalence and effectiveness under EU law (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris, para. 94). Given the compensatory function of the claim for damages provided for in this provision, monetary compensation based on Art. 82 (1) GDPR is to be regarded as "full and effective" within the meaning of Recital 146, Sentence 6, GDPR if it enables the full compensation for the damage actually suffered as a result of the violation of the General Data Protection Regulation. The claim under Art. 82 (1) GDPR is not intended to serve a deterrent or punitive function. Consequently, when assessing monetary compensation, neither the gravity of the violation of the General Data Protection Regulation that caused the damage in question may be taken into account, nor – as already explained – whether a controller has committed multiple violations against the same person, or whether they acted intentionally or negligently (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris, para. 96).

As a result, the compensation to be awarded should not fall short of full compensation for the damage, but it may also not be set at an amount that exceeds full compensation for the damage. If the damage is minor, only a minor amount of compensation should be awarded (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris, para. 97). This also applies considering that the non-material damage caused by a breach of personal data protection is, by its nature, no less serious than bodily harm (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris, para. 97).

(b)

When assessing the amount of compensation based on Section 287 of the Code of Civil Procedure, if damage has occurred only in the form of a loss of control over personal data because further damage has not been proven, the potential sensitivity of the specific personal data affected and its typically intended use must be taken into account when estimating the damage. Furthermore, the nature of the loss of control, the duration of the loss of control, and the possibility of regaining control, for example by removing a publication from the internet or changing the personal data, must be taken into account. In cases where regaining control is possible with reasonable effort, the hypothetical – particularly financial – effort required to regain control can also serve as a guideline for effective compensation (see the Federal Court of Justice (BGH), judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris, para. 99).

(c)

According to these criteria, the damage suffered by the plaintiff solely due to the loss of control is effectively compensated with an amount of €100. This results in an overall assessment of the relevant circumstances in the plaintiff's case.

The decisive factor for determining the amount of damages is the loss of control suffered by the plaintiff over his email address, especially since this address – easily recognizable to third parties – is already personalized insofar as it includes his last name as a component. The plaintiff's other data, which the defendant acknowledges are stored by the defendant, play only a subordinate and non-decisive role, with the exception of the language and country, even in combination with the email address, which is also subject to loss of control. The plaintiff himself clearly sees this as well, as is evident from his statement regarding the A. user ID during his informational hearing. It should also be taken into account that, according to the factual findings in the district court judgment, he last used the defendant's music streaming service in 2016 ("last logged in to "A." in 2016"). Furthermore, there is no evidence of a significant deepening of the loss of control since the data interception in 2022. While it seems unlikely that the plaintiff will regain control over his data, there is some evidence that any third-party interest in the data will diminish over time, so that the loss of control caused by the defendant's data protection breach could become less significant. Furthermore, the data only allows contact with the plaintiff. While the email address can also be used to send advertising, harassing, or even fraudulent spam emails, such spam emails do not lead to any material damage without further steps. A plaintiff who is sensitized to the danger can protect himself against these through vigilance. Furthermore, the data affected by the loss of control is not the plaintiff's highly sensitive data, such as health or similarly intimate data, the public dissemination of which could harm the plaintiff's reputation or advancement (see also Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris, para. 42). The Senate does not share the plaintiff's contrary concerns expressed during his informative hearing – also taking into account the plaintiff's professional activities. Furthermore, the email address is regularly used to contact third parties anyway and is made accessible to others for this purpose. This alone always creates the risk that an email address that was previously controlled may eventually no longer be controllable, because no one can have complete control over how third parties handle the email address. Finally, it should be considered that while the plaintiff is currently reluctant to change his email address due to his current training at the Düsseldorf Chamber of Crafts, this circumstance does not mean that a change is absolutely impossible.

Since a claim for damages in the amount stated above arises solely from the plaintiff's impact on the data being accessed by unknown hackers and the associated loss of control, it is not decisive whether the plaintiff has proven, in accordance with Section 371 (1) Sentence 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), that three of his data items were subsequently found in a specific leaked data set on the dark web.

(d)

The amount of €100 to be awarded to the plaintiff for the mere loss of control shall be increased by a further €100 for the particular concerns the plaintiff feels in connection with the loss of control.

Negative feelings associated with the loss of control, such as fears and anxieties, as well as the time and effort spent in dealing with the scraping incident and protecting against future data misuse, constitute circumstances that may deepen or aggravate non-material damage within the meaning of Art. 82 (1) GDPR that already occurred with the mere loss of control (cf. Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris, paras. 31, 35, and 45). This applies at least if they go beyond the inconveniences directly related to the loss of control that has occurred (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris, para. 101). Any psychological stress caused by spam calls and spam text messages resulting from the loss of control can also increase the non-pecuniary damage.

After an informative hearing with the plaintiff, who is a police officer, the Senate is convinced that the plaintiff is concerned about the potential professional consequences of the loss of control over his data, specifically the loss of control over his email address. This still constitutes a psychological reaction that is subject to attribution, even if this concern appears to be unfounded in the Senate's view. The attribution of damages does not, in principle, fail because they are based on a constitutive weakness of the injured party (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of April 30, 1996 - VI ZR 55/95, juris, marginal no. 17). The fact that a particular susceptibility to damage of the injured party is attributable to the tortfeasor for liability purposes also generally applies to psychological damages, which regularly arise from the affected party's particular instability (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of April 30, 1996 - VI ZR 55/95, juris, marginal no. 18). The Senate is unable to identify an extreme case in which the psychological reaction no longer bears any intelligible relationship to the damaging event (cf. Federal Court of Justice, judgment of April 30, 1996 - VI ZR 55/95, juris, marginal no. 21).

The plaintiff's psychological reaction in question justifies an increase of €100 in the amount of damages, taking into account all the circumstances of the case. However, a further increase in the amount of damages due to other consequences of the data protection violation is ruled out.

The Regional Court found no further adverse consequences of the data protection violation. It is true that the Regional Court's judgment does not indicate the standard of proof applied by the Regional Court. If the asserted claim for damages is established in principle, a substantial probability based on a secure foundation is sufficient for the judicial decision on the amount of damages pursuant to Section 287 of the Code of Civil Procedure (BGH, judgment of March 11, 2022 - V ZR 35/21, juris, para. 30). This is the case here because the Senate - in contrast to the Regional Court - considers the mere loss of control to be the damage giving rise to liability. However, even applying the reduced standard of proof under Section 287 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), the Senate cannot, in its own assessment of the statements made by the plaintiff, whom it heard for information purposes, determine any impairment of the plaintiff due to the loss of control that goes beyond the inconvenience anyone suffers from such a loss of control - with the exception of the plaintiff's psychological impairment, which it acknowledges - that the plaintiff is not affected by the loss of control beyond the inconvenience that anyone suffers from such a loss of control. The plaintiff has indeed expressed considerable annoyance by spam emails. However, given the conceivable diversity of causes for spam emails, the Senate cannot be convinced that the spam burden described by the plaintiff is precisely due to the defendant's data protection violation. From its own experience, the Senate is aware that spam emails can also occur when A.'s music streaming service is not used. To the extent that the plaintiff stated during his informational hearing that he also receives spam emails addressed to his name, this does not give the Senate any reason to make a different assessment. Since the causality of the data protection incident cannot be established, it is also irrelevant whether the mere receipt of spam emails without further consequences can constitute non-material damage or exacerbate it.

(e)

The plaintiff's claim for damages should also not be reduced due to contributory negligence arising from the plaintiff's failure to change his email address to date. The fact that the plaintiff has not yet changed his email address, but could in principle do so, has already been taken into account by the Senate when assessing the amount of damages.

bb)

The plaintiff's claim for interest on the amount of the principal claim from the time the action was pending, which he also pursued in claim 1, arises, in terms of its merits and amount, from Section 291 in conjunction with Section 288 (1) Sentence 2 of the German Civil Code (BGB). The claim for interest thus arises from the day following service of the statement of claim, August 26, 2023.

c)

However, the plaintiff's claim for damages under Art. 15 GDPR, which he further pursued in the appeal, for allegedly inadequate out-of-court information provided by the defendant, is not available to the plaintiff under Art. 82 (1) GDPR. Even after hearing the plaintiff's evidence, the Senate cannot establish that he suffered non-material damage in connection with the defendant's out-of-court information.

d)

The declaratory action pursued by the plaintiff in the appeal is admissible and well-founded in the version most recently submitted for decision.

aa)

As the Senate has already ruled in the past, the mere possibility of future material damage occurring is the standard for assuming the interest in a declaratory judgment required under Section 256 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure. A further probability of damage is not required. The possibility of future damages is sufficient in the present case because it is not a matter of purely financial losses, but rather of damages resulting from the plaintiff's alleged violation of his right to informational self-determination pursuant to Article 2 (1) in conjunction with Article 1 (1) of the Basic Law, and thus of his general personality rights as another absolutely protected legal interest within the meaning of Section 823 (1) of the German Civil Code (BGB). The provision of Article 82 (1) GDPR, which is primarily relied upon here, also contains a violation of the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, insofar as – as here – unlawful data processing is also alleged. The possibility of compensable future damages can be readily affirmed if an absolute legal interest protected by tort law has been violated and damage has already occurred as a result (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris, para. 48).

As the Federal Court of Justice ruled following the district court's judgment, the possibility of future damages occurring in a case such as the present one can be readily affirmed. The defendant's violation of the General Data Protection Regulation has in any event violated the plaintiff's right to the protection of personal data pursuant to Article 8 of the Charter. With the continued loss of control resulting from the publication of the data on the internet, the risk of misuse, particularly fraudulent use of this data, resulting in material damage, continues to this day.

bb)

The declaratory judgment also exists on the merits. If the plaintiff were to suffer future material damages as a result of the defendant's established data protection violation, the conditions for the defendant's liability under Article 82 (1) GDPR would be met, according to the foregoing. This applies, for example, to a future impairment of his professional career as a result of the loss of control over his email address.

e)

The injunction application pursued with the fourth appeal is inadmissible. The application does not meet the specificity requirements of Section 253 (2) No. 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

aa)

A claim is sufficiently specific within the meaning of Section 253 (2) No. 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure if it specifically identifies the claim raised, thereby defining the scope of the court's decision-making authority, reveals the content and extent of the substantive legal force of the requested decision, does not shift the risk of the plaintiff losing the case to the defendant through avoidable inaccuracies, and allows for the expectation of compulsory enforcement of the judgment without a continuation of the dispute in the enforcement proceedings. An injunction application must not be so vaguely worded that the decision as to what the defendant is prohibited from doing is ultimately left to the enforcement proceedings (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris, para. 52).

bb)

Measured against this, the injunction application, with which the plaintiff requests that the defendant refrain from making his personal data accessible to third parties without his consent or a legitimate interest on the part of the defendant, is not sufficiently specific. Even considering the plaintiff's allegations, it cannot be interpreted in such a way that the plaintiff is seeking a sufficiently specific refrain. In particular, the term "third party" is vague (cf. Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris, para. 56).

f)

Finally, the plaintiff is entitled to indemnification against the defendant for pre-trial legal fees pursuant to Art. 82 (1) GDPR in conjunction with Section 257 of the German Civil Code (BGB) as a result of the data protection violation committed by the defendant. This claim is based on Art. 82 (1) GDPR in conjunction with Section 257 of the German Civil Code (BGB).

aa)

The costs of legal proceedings and therefore also the costs of a lawyer involved in the case, insofar as they were necessary and expedient for the protection of the rights, are generally part of the damages to be compensated for due to a tort. The decisive factor in this regard is how the likely settlement of the damage case appears from the perspective of the injured party. If the responsibility for the damage and thus the liability are so clear from the outset in terms of reason and amount that, from the perspective of the injured party, there can be no reasonable doubt that the injuring party will readily fulfill their obligation to pay compensation, it will generally not be necessary to involve a lawyer for the initial assertion of damages against the injuring party. In such simple cases, the injured party can generally assert the damages themselves, so that the immediate involvement of a lawyer may only prove necessary under special circumstances (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24, juris, para. 79).

bb)

According to these standards, the plaintiff must be reimbursed for the legal fees incurred in the out-of-court assertion of the justified amount of damages of €200, the request for recognition of future liability to pay compensation, which is to be assessed at a value of €500, and the request for information further formulated in the pre-trial letter from the attorney - to which the Senate also assigns a value of €500.

Under the circumstances, particularly due to the confusing legal situation and for reasons of factual context, the plaintiff was entitled to consider the appointment of his legal representative due to the defendant's data protection violation necessary and expedient, even to the extent of the request for information based on Art. 15 GDPR, which was still justified at the time because the information had not yet been provided.

Further out-of-court applications, however, are not to be taken into account when calculating the 1.3% business fee pursuant to No. 2300 VV RVG. The legal fees associated with the injunction formulated in the pre-trial letter are not reimbursable. The injunction was also unsuccessful in the court proceedings.

cc)

To the extent that the plaintiff also pursues a claim for lis pendens interest on the indemnity amount with the appeal, his appeal is – as already explained at the outset – already inadmissible. However, the plaintiff would not be entitled to a corresponding claim on the merits either, because the indemnification claim is not a monetary debt within the meaning of Section 291 of the German Civil Code (BGB).

III.

The decision regarding the costs of the legal dispute follows from Section 92 (1) Sentence 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) and corresponds to the parties' share of the winning or losing case.

The decision regarding provisional enforceability is based on Section 709 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO).

There is no reason to allow an appeal on points of law. The requirements of Section 543 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure are not met. According to the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice of November 18, 2024 - VI ZR 10/24 - the case is neither of fundamental importance nor does the development of the law or the safeguarding of uniform case law require a decision by the appeal court.

The value in dispute is set at €7,250 for both instances - also with recourse to Section 63 (3) Sentence 1 No. 2 GKG - (cf. BGH, decision of December 10, 2024 - VI ZR 7/24, juris).
