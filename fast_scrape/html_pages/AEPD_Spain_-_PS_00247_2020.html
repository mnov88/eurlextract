<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The Territorial Delegation of the Department of Health and Families of the Regional Government of Andalusia filed a complaint with the AEPD against ORGANIC AND NATUR 03 S.L. on the issue of a membership contract that incorporates pre-determined clauses regarding data protection, thus preventing effective negotiation and the express consent of the signatory client.
</p><p>In the aforementioned contract it was indicated that the client authorised the transfer of all his/her data for the purpose of managing the credit, as well as, to send him/her commercial offers. 
</p><p>The fact that different data processing purposes were being accepted in the same clause without express consent for each one could mean a breach of the duty to inform the customer of the purposes of data processing.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Are the failure to update the privacy policy and the failure to collect consent for each of the purposes of data processing infringements of Articles 13 GDPR and 7 GDPR respectively?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>To determine the amount of the penalty, the AEPD took into account three criteria in Article 83(2) GDPR: unintentional negligence (paragraph b); the categories of personal data affected by the infringement (paragraph g); and the way in which the AEPD became aware of the infringement, which was reported by the complainant (paragraph h). 
</p><p>Account has also been taken of Article 76 (2) (b) LOPDGDD concerning the link between the activity of the offender and the processing of personal data.
</p><p>In view of the above, a penalty of € 4000 was set for the infringement of Article 13 GDPR and a warning sanction for the infringement of Article 7 GDPR.

by the COUNCIL OF HEALTH AND FAMILIES OF THE ANDALUSIAN GOVERNMENT
-TERRITORIAL DELEGATION IN *** LOCALIDAD.1, (hereinafter, “the body

claimant ”), and based on the following:

                                  BACKGROUND

FIRST: On 11/28/29, you have an entry in this Agency, complaint filed

by the complaining body in which it indicated, among others, the following:

"In this Consumer Service the corresponding reference file is processed
to the claims filed against the company ORGANlC AND NATUR 03 S.L.
After examining the documentation provided by the claimant, it is verified that in
the sales contract includes the general conditions No. 8 and No. 9, which

may contravene the provisions of articles 5 and 6 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights.
It is an adhesion contract in which the consumer, when he lends his
consent to be bound, accept each and every one of the clauses
predisposed by the professional without the possibility of any negotiation. The

stipulations state:

8.- For knowing the scope and content of Organic Law 15/99 for the protection of
personal data, the buyer gives his informed consent for the
personal data provided under this contract, and those derived from this

relationship can be incorporated into the computerized files or not of ORGANIC
AND NATUR 03 SL. Regardless of the foregoing, the buyer declares to have been
informed and gives your consent so that:

A) Within the credit and equity solvency studies of ORGANIC AND
NATUR 03 SL., Or third parties acting on their behalf or to whom they have assigned the credit

derived from the sale, can carry out the necessary investigations for the
formalization of this contract and scoring procedures may be used.

B) ORGANIC AND NATUR 03 SL, you can send all the information you have for
convenient, provided that it bears reference to the corporate purpose of ORGANIC AND

NATUR 03 SL, for the exercise of the rights recognized by the law of protection of

commercial offers from said financial institution that may be of interest to you. Yes
you do not want it or if you wish to access, rectify or cancel your personal data, please
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/8








Address ORGANIC AND NATUR 03 SL at the address listed on the front of this
document.


We believe that it is not possible for all consumers who purchase
products outside the commercial establishment of the company ORGANlC AND NATUR
03 SL. previously know the scope and content of Organic Law 3/2018 ”.
Likewise, it is at all times unlikely that the company's sales representatives, in addition

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/8








reference to the repealed Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13, on the Protection of
Personal data.


2º.- Regarding the consent given by the user, which is referred to in the
Article 9 of the "General Conditions", of the adhesion contract between the entity
claimed and the user, it states that: "In addition, the buyer authorizes
expressly ORGANIC AND NATUR 03 SL. to which you can transfer your data
personal data to the financial entity to which this credit is assigned, if applicable,
purpose of managing the same, as well as, to send you commercial offers of said

financial entity that may be of interest to you (…) ”.

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                            I

The Director of the Spanish Agency is competent to resolve this procedure
of Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of art. 58.2 of the GDPR in
the art. 47 of LOPDGDD.
                                            II
Regarding article 8 of the "General Conditions", of the adhesion contract between
the claimed entity and the user, it is verified that the same is still done

reference to the repealed Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13, on the Protection of
Personal data.

According to article 99 of the RGPD, the entry into force and application of the new RGPD was,
"Twenty days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union (05/25/16)"

and it would be applicable as of May 25, 2018 ”. Therefore, as of 05/25/18,
the LO was repealed. 15/1999, (LOPD), applying obligatorily, from that date
date, the current RGPD and as of 12/07/18 the new LOPDGDD.

For its part, article 13 of the RGPD establishes the information that must be

provide the interested party at the time of collection of their personal data.
Information that does not appear in the "privacy policy" of the website at
question.

Therefore, the known facts are constitutive of an infraction, attributable to the
claimed, for violation of article 13 of the RGPD, which establishes the information that

must be provided to the interested party at the time of collection of their data
personal.

For its part, article 72.1.h) of the LOPDGDD, considers very serious, for the purposes of
prescription, “the omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the treatment of

your personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the RGPD "

This offense can be sanctioned with a fine of € 20,000,000 maximum or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the

of greater amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/8








In accordance with the indicated precepts and for the purpose of setting the amount of the penalty to
impose in the present case, it is considered that the sanction to be imposed should be adjusted
in accordance with the following criteria established in article 83.2 of the RGPD:


    - The intentionality or negligence in the infraction. In the present case we are
        in the event of unintentional negligent action, (section b).

    - The categories of personal data affected by the infringement.
        (section g).


    - The way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement. The
        The way in which this AEPD has learned has been by filing
        the complaint by the complaining body, (section h).


In accordance with the indicated precepts and for the purpose of setting the amount of the penalty to
impose in the present case, it is considered that the sanction to be imposed should be adjusted
in accordance with the following criteria established in article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD:

    - The linking of the offender's activity with the performance of treatment of
        personal data, (section b).


The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with
Regarding the offense committed by violating the provisions of Article 13 of the
RGPD, allows setting a penalty of 4,000 euros, (four thousand euros).


                                              III
Regarding the consent given by the user, which is referred to in the
Article 9 of the "General Conditions", of the adhesion contract between the entity
claimed and the user, it states that: "In addition, the buyer authorizes
expressly ORGANIC AND NATUR 03 SL. to which you can transfer your data

personal data to the financial entity to which this credit is assigned, if applicable,
purpose of managing the same, as well as, to send you commercial offers of said
financial entity that may be of interest to you (…) ”.

Well, article 6.1. of the RGPD, establishes that the treatment will only be lawful if
meets at least one of the conditions indicated therein, including

finds, in its section b), if the treatment is “necessary for the execution of a
contract in which the interested party is a party or for the application at his request of
pre-contractual measures ”, in which case, the sending of communications that keep
intimate relationship with the end of the signed contract, would be ruled by this precept.


However, for any other type of communication with the client, as in this
case, to "send you commercial offers from the entity (...)", without specifying a
specific purpose, and where, therefore, any type of commercial communication would fit
whether or not related to the ultimate purpose of the signed contract, the
provided in section a) of article 6.1 of the RGPD, where it is specified that, “the

Treatment will only be lawful if the interested party gave their consent for the treatment
of your personal data for one or more specific purposes ”.



C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/8








For its part, article 7 of the RGPD establishes, on consent, that: “1.
When the treatment is based on the consent of the interested party, the person in charge
must be able to demonstrate that he consented to the processing of his data

personal. 2. If the consent of the interested party is given in the context of a
written statement that also refers to other matters, the request for
Consent will be presented in such a way that it is clearly distinguishable from others
matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible way and using clear and simple language.
Any part of the declaration that constitutes an infringement of the
these Regulations. 3. The interested party will have the right to withdraw their consent in

any moment. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the legality of the
treatment based on consent prior to withdrawal. Before giving your
consent, the interested party will be informed of it. It will be so easy to remove the
consent how to give it. 4. When evaluating whether consent has been freely given,
account shall be taken to the greatest extent possible of whether, among other things, the

performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is subject to the
consent to the processing of personal data that are not necessary for the
execution of said contract ”.

In relation to these two cited articles, the recital should be taken into account
(32) of the RGPD, as it indicates that: “Consent must be given through an act

clear affirmative that reflects a manifestation of free will, specific, informed,
and unequivocal of the interested party to accept the processing of personal data
that concern you ... Therefore, silence, already ticked boxes or inaction does not
they must constitute consent. Consent must be given for all
processing activities carried out for the same or the same purposes. When the

treatment has several purposes, consent must be given for all of them ... "

Likewise, article 6.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes, on the treatment based on
the consent of the affected party, that: “When it is intended to establish the treatment of
data in the consent of the affected person for a plurality of purposes will be

It must be specifically and unequivocally stated that said consent is
grants for all of them ”.

Well, in accordance with everything previously expressed, the data processing
requires the existence of a legal basis that legitimizes it, as in this case, if it is
necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party is a party, in which

case the sending of correspondence, including commercial, that was linked to the
execution of the contract would be subject to this precept. Not so, when sending
commercial correspondence does not have the same purpose as that included in the contract,
in which case, the valid consent of the interested party is necessary.


This consent must be given for each of the purposes outside the contract
signed by the client. Therefore, a generic acceptance is not valid, such as “sending
of commercial correspondence of the entity ”, without giving the option to give consent
individualized for each of them and above all, if they are unrelated to the purpose of the
contract.


Thus, the known facts could constitute an infraction,
attributable to the defendant, for violation of article 7 of the aforementioned RGPD, to


C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/8








carry out the collection of consent through a generic action for all
purposes of data processing.


For its part, article 72.1.c) of the LOPDGDD, considers very serious, for the purposes of
prescription, "Failure to comply with the requirements of article 7 of the RGPD".

This offense can be sanctioned with a fine of € 20,000,000 maximum or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the

of greater amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

However, Article 58.2) of the RGPD provides that: “Each control authority
have all of the following corrective powers listed below: b)
sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with warning when

the treatment operations have infringed the provisions of this
Regulation; (…); i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83,
in addition to or instead of the measures mentioned in this section, depending on the
circumstances of each particular case, therefore, the sanction that could
Corresponding would be a warning, without prejudice to what results from the instruction
of this file, since in this case, it has not been verified that the entity

claimed has sent commercial correspondence unrelated to the ultimate purpose of
the conditions of the contract.

Based on these criteria, it is considered appropriate to impose a sanction on the defendant
of "APERCIBIMIENTO", for the violation of article 7 of the RGPD.


Therefore, based on the foregoing, by the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection,
                                       RESOLVES


FIRST: IMPOSE the entity, the entity ORGANIC AND NATUR 03, S.L., with

        regarding its policy of treatment of the personal data of the clients.

        the processing of your personal data.
