<p>The Regional Court Essen held that an insurance company can reject an access request as excessive if the request's purpose is not to be aware of or verify the lawfulness of the processing but to verify the validity of increases to insurance premiums.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The controller is a private health insurance company. The data subject is a customer of the controller. The parties are in dispute about the validity of several increases to the insurance premiums. The data subject requested refund of overpaid premiums as well as information on all adjustments to the premiums in the form of notification letters sent to the data subject and supplements to the insurance policy to verify the lawfulness of the increases. The controller rejected both claims. Consequently, the data subject filed a lawsuit against the controller with the Regional Court of Essen (Landgericht Essen - LG Essen).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Regional Court of Essen rejected the data subject's claim entirely. 
</p><p>Regarding the notification letters, the court concluded that the data subject has no right to access under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15 GDPR</a> , because the notification letters are standardised letters sent to every policy holder and, therefore, not personal data under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#1" title="Article 4 GDPR">Article 4(1) GDPR</a>. Moreover the court found that the controller can refuse to act on the request according to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#5b" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12(5)(b) GDPR</a>, because the request is excessive. The court held that the "repetitive character" of a request is just an example under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#5" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12(5) GDPR</a> and that an access request can also be considered excessive if the request does not serve the purpose of verifying the lawfulness of the processing as stated in Recital 63. The court then established that the data subject's request does not serve this purpose but solely aims at verifying the validity of the premium increases. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>The decision is in line with many other decisions by German Courts (see <a href="/index.php?title=OLG_Dresden_-_4_U_1905/21" title="OLG Dresden - 4 U 1905/21">OLG Dresden - 4 U 1905/21</a>; <a href="/index.php?title=OLG_N%C3%BCrnberg_-_8_U_2907/21" title="OLG Nürnberg - 8 U 2907/21">OLG Nürnberg - 8 U 2907/21</a>; <a href="/index.php?title=LG_Krefeld_-_2_O_448/20" title="LG Krefeld - 2 O 448/20">LG Krefeld - 2 O 448/20</a>); however, there is also a recent decision by the <a href="/index.php?title=OLG_K%C3%B6ln_-_20_U_295/21" title="OLG Köln - 20 U 295/21">OLG Köln - 20 U 295/21</a> which convincingly demonstrates that the right to access under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15 GDPR</a> is not and should not be limited by the purpose pursued with the request. As stated by the OLG Köln, and opposed to the LG Essens' view, the notification letters sent to a data subject constitute personal data under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#1" title="Article 4 GDPR">Article 4(1) GDPR</a> because they show the content and conditions of the insurance cover provided to the particular data subject by the controller. The LG Essen missed the fact that, even if the notification letters are standardised, they are still addressed to one specific person and have an effect on this person. The OLG Köln further established that the overall purpose of the GDPR is to protect all rights and freedoms of the individual against harm and risks arising from the processing of personal data, and not only the rights and freedoms enshrined in data protection law. Therefore, the court concluded that a data subject pursues a recognizable, legitimate interest when using <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15(3) GDPR</a> to reduce an asymmetric level of information between himself and the controller in order to protect his or her rights. Moreover, the OLG Köln found that there is no way to verify that a data subject is indeed only interested in the copy of his data to check the validity of the premium increases and is not also concerned about the protection of his or her data.
