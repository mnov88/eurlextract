<p>The data subject was a minor represented by a mother who was trying to obtain information regarding her child's bank account.  
</p><p>However, Caixabank, the controller, informed that it could not process the requests because the e-mail address from which she was writing was not registered in the bank's database. The mother insisted and finally the controller told her that the information on her daughter's bank account was blocked. The controller also told her that they would contact her again to provide more information. 
</p><p>That same day, the controller called her and, without any identity verification, provided information related the bank account of her <u>other</u> daughter, about which she had not asked anything. After clarifying the mistake, the controller told the mother that the bank account about which she had initially requested information had been cancelled and that she would have to go to a physical branch to learn why. 
</p><p>Finally, the mother managed to get the information she wanted. After that, she filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA for the lack of response to her request and the for lack of appropriate security measures in relation to the verification of the identity of the holder of the bank account.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>While recognizing that the complainant had to insist several times to obtain information about her daughter's bank account, the DPA concluded that the controller provided the requested information, including the transcript of two telephone calls. Therefore, it did not find any breach of the right of access.
</p><p>However, the DPA did hold that the controller failed to comply with its obligation to have adequate technical and organisational measures in place, since it provided information about the second daughter's bank account without first carrying out any the identity authentication. 
</p><p>The DPA rejected the controller's arguments in the sense that it was a mere human error and that the information was only disclosed to the actual mother of the child. In the DPA's view, the controller's protocol did fail, allowing access to the data of third parties.
</p><p>Therefore, the DPA imposed a fine of €25,000 for a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32(1) GDPR</a>.

    This daughter's bank account was blocked, so the customer service agent

    could not access the data of this account. The agent indicates that he will forward the
    incidence to "coordination" by email and that you would receive a

    call with the information they can provide.
  - Call of 02/25/2021 at 12:38 p.m.: In the second recording, the claimant

Regarding the association of his other daughter with the claimant according to the call received
Customer Service on 02/25/2021 (after your first call), and that the

claimant finds it incomprehensible, it has not been possible to determine the cause of the
identification error that the claimed party attributes to an inadvertent error on the part of

in the previous paragraph, is that once the contractual relationship with the party

(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the

administrative procedures."


                                           II
       The denounced facts materialize in the absence of a response to the
request for access to the data and account information of the minor daughter requested
by his mother, with breach of the security measures to determine the
owner of the requested data (since the data of his other daughter's account is provided),
which could violate data protection regulations.

       While, in the LOPDGDD, regarding the right of access, in its article
13 provides that:

       "1. The right of access of the affected party will be exercised in accordance with the

established in article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
       When the controller processes a large amount of data relating to the data subject and

                                           II
       1. In the first place, it alleges the claimed defenselessness derived from the setting of the
amount of the sanction in the initiation agreement since the sanctioning body proceeds to ab

initio to set the amounts of the imputed sanctions, considering that this implies
reprehensible behavior for affecting the exercise of their rights.

       It should be noted that the National Court in the Judgment of 09/12/2022,
How well should the defendant know for being the appellant of the litigation-
administrative procedure raised and which was dismissed, ruled on these and other

issues such as the incompetence of the person signing the resolution:

sanctioning resolution. In addition, there is a contamination of the performance

to prejudge the case in the initiation agreement, with the consequent bankruptcy of the
rights of the defendant in the procedure.
       Regarding the determination of the sanction ab initio, the start agreement of 7

sanction to be imposed outside of the fine, he may acknowledge his responsibility within the
term granted for the formulation of allegations to the present initiation agreement; it
which will entail a reduction of 20% of the sanction that should be imposed in
this procedure (...) In the same way, you can at any time before
to the resolution of this procedure, carry out the voluntary payment of the

proposed sanction, in accordance with the provisions of article 85.2 of the
LPACAP, which will mean a reduction of 20% of its amount (...). The reduction
of the voluntary payment of the sanction is cumulative to the one that corresponds to apply for the
acknowledgment of responsibility, provided that this acknowledgment of responsibility
responsibility is revealed within the period granted to formulate

allegations at the opening of the procedure".
       Well, the aforementioned article 64, establishes in its section 2. that the agreement of
initiation into procedures of a sanctioning nature must contain, "at
less", so here we are interested:
       "b) The facts that motivate the initiation of the procedure, its possible
rating and sanctions that may correspond, without prejudice to what is

of the instruction (...)".
       d) Competent body for the resolution of the procedure (...), indicating the
possibility that the alleged perpetrator can voluntarily acknowledge his
responsibility, with the effects provided for in article 85".
       That is to say, the record in the initiation agreement of, at least, the
facts, their possible classification and the possible sanctions to be imposed, as well as

inform, from the start, of the possibility of applying the reductions allowed by the
Article 85 of the LPACAP, which presupposes an initial provisional determination of the
sanctions that may correspond, without prejudice to what results from the instruction.
       Indication referred to in section d) of the aforementioned article 64.2, which is not
contemplated in the initiation agreement regulated in article 13 of the Royal Decree
1398/1993, of August 4, which approves the Rules of Procedure

for the Exercise of the Sanctioning Power, repealed by the repealing Provision
sole of Law 39/2015.
       For its part, Article 85 LPACAP determines:
       1. Initiated a disciplinary procedure, if the offender acknowledges his
responsibility, the procedure may be resolved with the imposition of the sanction
which proceeds

       2. When the sanction is solely pecuniary in nature or fits
impose a pecuniary penalty and another of a non-pecuniary nature but it has been justified
the inadmissibility of the second, the voluntary payment by the presumed perpetrator, in
any moment prior to the resolution, will imply the termination of the procedure,
except in relation to the replacement of the altered situation or the determination of the

compensation for damages caused by the commission of the offence.
       3. In both cases, when the sanction is solely pecuniary,
the body competent to resolve the procedure will apply reductions of, at least
least 20% of the amount of the proposed sanction, these being cumulative
each other. The aforementioned reductions must be determined in the notification of

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/23








initiation of the procedure and its effectiveness will be conditioned to the withdrawal or
resignation of any action or appeal in administrative proceedings against the sanction".
       Thus, in view of the aforementioned precepts and following the criteria of the
SAN, Sec. 3, of June 19, 2019 (Rec. 447/2018) in a case similar to that
present: "There is therefore no legal impediment for the agreement of

initiation contains an initial and provisional specification of the sanction(s) that may
match the facts investigated within those provided by law, which does not
implies a reduction in the rights of the filer, since this is done "without prejudice to what
results from the instruction (...) and, this initial and provisional realization, for the sake of the
speed and efficiency in administrative work, comes to allow voluntary payment
from the very moment of the beginning (...). There is no legal basis for understanding that

the concretion of the sanction and the game of the voluntary payment cannot take place until
the proposed resolution after the corresponding instruction".
       That is, the competence to determine the agreement to start the procedure
sanctioner determines the obligation that said agreement must contain all
of the circumstances provided for by the applicable regulations, including the determination

provisional sanction that may correspond, which will be without prejudice to what
results from the instruction of the procedure. Instruction of the procedure whose
competence corresponds to the instructor and the secretary, who were designated in the
device 2 of the aforementioned agreement, indicating that any of them may be challenged,
where appropriate, in accordance with the provisions of articles 23 and 24 of Law 40/2015, of 1
October, of the Legal Regime of the Public Sector (LRJSP).

       It is therefore up to the interested party, in view of the sanctioning agreement,
request the evidence that you deem appropriate, make allegations, etc., without being able to
assess the existence of defenselessness and assess the alleged violation; Besides, the
plaintiff has at no time shown its willingness to recognize the
responsibility for the penalized offense and benefit from the effects provided for in the
Article 85 of the LPACAP.”


       2. Secondly, regarding the possible controversy raised in relation to
with the cancellation of the account of the minor exercised by the father without the assistance of
the mother, who enjoyed his guardianship and custody, is a matter that exceeds the
competencies of this management center.


       3. The GDPR allows it to be exercised before the data controller
the rights of access, rectification, opposition, deletion (“right to be forgotten”),
limitation of treatment, portability and not being subject to decisions
individualized.

       If the person in charge does not process the request, he must inform of the reasons for

their non-action and the possibility of claiming before a Control Authority, if they have not
got answer.

       In the present case, although the claimant had to address numerous
occasions to the defendant so that the right of access to information could be processed

related to the account of his youngest daughter B.B.B., it can be considered
considered in the light of the proven facts in which the response offered to the
claimant on 03/03/2021:



C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/23








       "That in response to the request of the claimant in which she requests us
information about current and/or canceled bank accounts of your daughter B.B.B.… at
our entity and having consulted the records held by this branch, we

He reported that:
       There is only one registered Child Savings Book open in the
Entity Banco Mare Nostrum dated October 19, 2017 with account code
client nº ***CONTRACT.2 being the owner B.B.B. ..., with ID ... and as representatives
legal D.C.C.C. with DNI... and the claimant, with DNI...
       Said account was canceled while already in Bankia with an account number

***CONTRACT.1, dated January 28, 2020 by the legal representative D.C.C.C..
That the balance resulting from the cancellation amounted to €480.00, an amount that was transferred
to a checking account opened in this entity whose ownership corresponds to D.C.C.C.”.

       And also that "The Child Savings Booklet contract No.

***CONTRACT.2 where the minor B.B.B. and as representatives
parents, signed in ***LOCATION.1 on 10/19/2017”.

       On the other hand, as already happened with the bank information related to the minor,
the recordings of the two calls made to the SAC by the claimant had to
be requested both on 03/01/2021, by the legal representation, and on 03/11/2021

by the claimant, not obtaining a response until 04/09/2021 in writing in the
that he was told that the transcription of the same was made available to him:

       "(...)
       In the file of this claim there is a transcript of

calls that the office ***OFFICE.2 can be delivered, if desired.
       (…)”

       Therefore, it has been established that the defendant sent the claimant the
information requested in connection with banking information relating to your minor daughter

B.B.B. and, regarding the recordings containing the conversations held
with the SAC operator, the transcription of the same was made available,
Therefore, the exercise of the aforementioned right is considered fulfilled.

       From the foregoing it can be deduced that the defendant has not violated the article
15 of the GDPR, infringement typified in article 83.5 a) of the GDPR.


                                          IV.
       Secondly, article 32 of the GDPR "Security of treatment",
states that:


       "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,

which may include, among others:

       a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;


C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 15/23








       b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
       c) the ability to restore availability and access to data

       quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
       d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness
       technical and organizational measures to guarantee the safety of the
       treatment.

       2. When evaluating the adequacy of the level of security, particular attention should be paid to

take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data
personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or
unauthorized access to such data.


       3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct pursuant to article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the
present article.

       4. The person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to

ensure that any person acting under the authority of the controller or the
manager and has access to personal data can only process such data
following the instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the
Law of the Union or of the Member States”.



                                            V
       The violation of article 32 of the GDPR is typified in article
83.4.a) of the aforementioned GDPR in the following terms:


       "4. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, according to
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 10,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:


       a) the obligations of the person in charge and the person in charge according to articles 8,
       11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43.
       (…)”

       For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 73, for prescription purposes, qualifies

of "Infringements considered serious":

       "Based on what is established in article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
are considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the

following:

       (…)


C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 16/23








       g) The breach, as a consequence of the lack of due diligence,
       of the technical and organizational measures that have been implemented in accordance with
       to what is required by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.
       (…)”


       1. The GDPR defines personal data breaches as
all those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or
accidental or illegal alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or processed
otherwise, or unauthorized disclosure of or access to such data.”

       From the documentation in the file, there are clear indications of

that the defendant has violated article 32 of the GDPR, when an incident of
security when providing the account details of a third party (daughter of the claimant),
by telephone without first verifying the identity of the person to whom
provided the data


       It should be noted that the GDPR in the aforementioned precept does not establish a list of
the security measures that are applicable according to the data that is
object of treatment, but it establishes that the person in charge and the person in charge of the
treatment will apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk
that entails the treatment, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of
application, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, the risks of

probability and seriousness for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.

       In addition, security measures must be adequate and
proportionate to the risk detected, noting that the determination of the measures
technical and organizational procedures must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymization and
encryption, the ability to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability and

resiliency, the ability to restore availability and access to data after a
incident, verification process (not audit), evaluation and assessment of the
effectiveness of the measures.

       In any case, when evaluating the adequacy of the security level,
particular account of the risks presented by data processing, such as

consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data
personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data and that could cause damages
physical, material or immaterial.

       In this sense, recital 83 of the GDPR states that:


       "(83) In order to maintain security and prevent processing from infringing what
provided in this Regulation, the person in charge or in charge must evaluate
the risks inherent to the treatment and apply measures to mitigate them, such as the
encryption. These measures must ensure an adequate level of security, including the

confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of its application
regarding the risks and nature of the personal data to be
protect yourself. When assessing risk in relation to data security, considerations should be
take into account the risks arising from the processing of personal data,
such as the destruction, loss or accidental or unlawful alteration of personal data

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 17/23








transmitted, stored or processed in another way, or communication or access not
authorized to said data, susceptible in particular to cause damages
physical, material or immaterial.


       2. As indicated in previous foundations of the manifestations of the
claimant and the documentation provided to the file, it can be deduced that after
request access to your daughter's data without being answered, on 02/25/2021 call
by telephone to the customer service of the defendant reiterating his request for
information, being informed by the acting operator that the account was

cancelled, sending an e-mail to the coordination department so that they can contact
with the claimant and offer her information in this regard and, that same day, the
claimant receives a call from the director of an office other than the one he had
assigned the account to provide him with information about another of his daughters, without
request any proof of your identity.


       The infringed precept establishes how the security of the
treatment in relation to the specific security measures that must be
implement, in such a way that taking into account the state of the art, the costs
of application, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as
as risks of variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of

natural persons, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply measures
appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security that is
appropriate to the risk and that includes, among other issues, guaranteeing that requested
data relating to a person, access to them coincide and are those relating to the
same of those that are the owner and not those corresponding to a third person, although

This is also the daughter of the claimant and with an account opened in the same entity.

       The same claimed in writing of 07/29/2021 acknowledges the infringement committed
stating that: "In relation to your request we reiterate the content of the
response made by the Customer Service Department on April 9,

2021, which responds to your request. In the part related to data and their interest in
know if there had been a "possible data protection crime", as stated
indicated to you by the aforementioned Customer Service, no
type of crime, since you are the mother of both minors in your condition as
legal representative has the right to know the information of both, being an error
involuntary on the part of the operator who attended you, by providing the notice so that you

contacted, to the office where the account of his daughter D.D.D. and not to the
office of her other daughter B.B.B., in which she was interested.”

       And in the recordings that were finally sent at the request of the inspector
plaintiff does not record, in light of hearing them, that the claimant requested

nor will he provide any information about his daughter D.D.D. since the information for which I was
interested had to do with the account of his other daughter, of whom he had his custody and
custody B.B.B.; information that had been requested both in previous and
later writings.


       The defendant has argued that a human error cannot be converted into a
security breach since the claimant accessed data that she had
legitimate right to access, although they were not what he had requested.


C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 18/23








       However, it is not about turning a bug into a security incident,
rather, the protocol, procedure, system or measures established by the defendant
have failed, allowing access to third-party data that had not been

requested by the claimant.

       3. The liability of the defendant is determined by the bankruptcy of
security manifested by the claimant, since he is responsible for taking
decisions aimed at effectively implementing the technical and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk

to ensure the confidentiality of the data, restoring its availability and preventing
access to them in the event of a physical or technical incident.

       4. In a brief of allegations to the Proposal, the defendant insists that the
has infringed article 32.1 of the GDPR and that it has not occurred in any case

filtration or improper access to the data and that in this sense the sentence of the T.S. of
02/15/2022 clearly establishes that the obligation imposed by article 32 of
adopt technical and organizational measures aimed at guaranteeing confidentiality
it is an obligation of means and not of results.

       However, the defendant himself in his brief maintains that there was an error in

management by giving the claimant documentation different from that requested.

       On the other hand, it is true that T.S. In its judgment it states that: "The obligation
to adopt the necessary measures to guarantee the security of the data
cannot be considered an obligation of result, which implies that

produced a leak of personal data to a third party there is responsibility with
independence of the measures adopted and the activity carried out by the
responsible for the file or treatment.
       In the obligations of result there is a commitment consisting of the
fulfillment of a certain objective, ensuring the achievement or proposed result,

In this case, guarantee the security of personal data and the absence of
security leaks or breaches.
       In obligations of means, the commitment acquired is to adopt
technical and organizational means, as well as deploy diligent activity in its
implantation and use that tends to achieve the expected result with
that can reasonably be classified as suitable and sufficient for its achievement,

for this reason they are called obligations "of diligence" or "of behavior".
       The difference lies in the responsibility in both cases, because while
that the obligation of result responds to a harmful result due to the failure of the
security system, whatever its cause and the diligence used. In the
obligation of means is enough to establish technically appropriate measures and

implement and use them with reasonable care.
       In the latter, the sufficiency of the security measures that the
responsible has to establish has to be related to the state of technology
at all times and the level of protection required in relation to the data
treated, but a result is not guaranteed.”


       But it is also true that the Court confirms that the design is not enough
of the necessary technical and organizational means, since it is also
Its correct implementation and proper use are necessary.

       Therefore, in accordance with the foregoing, it is estimated that the defendant
would be responsible for the infringement of article 32.1 of the GDPR, an infringement typified in

its article 83.4.a).

                                            SAW
       In order to establish the administrative fine that should be imposed, the
observe the provisions contained in articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR, which
point out:


       "1. Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
administrative proceedings under this article for violations of this
Regulations indicated in sections 4, 5 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.


       2. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances
of each individual case, as an addition to or substitute for the measures contemplated
in article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case shall be duly taken into account:


       a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
       nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
       as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and
       damages they have suffered;
       b) intentionality or negligence in the infraction;

       c) any measure taken by the controller or processor
       to alleviate the damages and losses suffered by the interested parties;
       d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or the person in charge of the
       processing, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have
       applied under articles 25 and 32;

       e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or in charge of the
       treatment;
       f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put
       remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach;
       g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
       h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in

       particularly if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such a case,
       what extent;
       i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
       previously ordered against the person in charge or in charge in question
       in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;

       k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
       case, such as the financial benefits obtained or the losses avoided, direct
       or indirectly, through the infringement.


       In relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the GDPR, the LOPDGDD, in its
Article 76, "Sanctions and corrective measures", establishes that:

       "2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 may also be taken into account:


       a) The continuing nature of the offence.
       b) Linking the activity of the offender with the performance of processing
       of personal data.
       c) The benefits obtained as a consequence of the commission of the infraction.
       d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have led to the

       h) The submission by the person in charge or in charge, with character
       voluntary, alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those
       cases in which there are controversies between them and any
       interested."

       - In accordance with the precepts transcribed, for the purpose of setting the amount of the

sanction to be imposed in the present case for the infringement of article 32.1 of the GDPR,
typified in article 83.4.a) of the GDPR for which the defendant is held responsible, in
an initial assessment, the following factors are considered concurrent as
aggravating circumstances:


       The nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement: the facts disclosed
manifestly seriously affect a fundamental issue in terms of protection of
data such as the establishment of necessary technical and organizational measures and
adequate and whose violation is classified as serious; It is obvious that the measures of
technical and organizational nature implemented affect the security of the treatment,

because data related to a person, a minor, is requested and ends up providing
and allowing access to data from a different one, sister of the previous one, of which it does not
any information was requested.

       As previously indicated, the data of minors has been affected.
(article 83.2, g) of the GDPR).


       The activity of the allegedly infringing entity is linked to the
data processing of both clients and third parties. In the activity of the entity
claimed, the processing of personal data is essential, therefore,
Given the company's volume of business, the significance of the conduct that is the object of the

This claim is undeniable (article 76.2.b) of the LOPDGDD in relation to the
article 83.2.k).

       The intentionality or negligence in the infraction; since the defendant has acted
with serious lack of diligence in their actions by allowing access to data that was not

they had requested. Connected with the degree of diligence that the person in charge of the
treatment is obliged to deploy in compliance with the obligations that
imposed by the data protection regulations, the SAN of 10/17/2007 can be cited. Yeah
Although it was issued before the GDPR entered into force, its pronouncement is perfectly

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 21/23








extrapolated to the assumption that we analyse. The ruling, after alluding to the fact that the
entities in which the development of their activity entails a continuous treatment of
data of clients and third parties must observe an adequate level of diligence,

specified that "(...) the Supreme Court has been understanding that there is imprudence
whenever a legal duty of care is neglected, that is, when the offender does not
behaves with the required diligence. And in assessing the degree of diligence must
especially the professionalism or not of the subject should be considered, and there is no doubt that,
in the case now examined, when the appellant's activity is constant and
copious handling of personal data must insist on rigor and

exquisite care to comply with the legal provisions in this regard” (article 83.2,
b) of the GDPR).

       Volume of business or activity of the entity, since it is one of the three
leading financial entities in the national market with a net profit during the

financial years of 2021 and 2022 of 4,801 and 3,145 million euros respectively
(article 83.2, k) of the GDPR).






       As extenuating circumstances:

        - The existence of a merger process by absorption after the commission
of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity. On 03/25/2021

Granted deed of merger by absorption of Bankia (absorbed entity) and Caixabank
(absorbing entity) with extinction of the first and block transfer by succession
universality of all its assets, liabilities, rights and obligations.

       In accordance with these factors, it is deemed appropriate to impose on the defendant a

penalty of 25,000 euros.

                                          IX
       The corrective powers that the GDPR attributes to the AEPD as authority of
control are listed in article 58.2, sections a) to j).


       Article 83.5 of the GDPR establishes a sanction of an administrative fine (article
58.2.i) for the conducts that are typified therein, without prejudice to the fact that, as provided in the
article 83.2 of the GDPR, administrative fines can be imposed together with
other corrective measures provided for in article 58.2 of the GDPR.


       Having confirmed the infringement, it is appropriate to impose on the person responsible the
adoption of appropriate measures to adjust its performance to the aforementioned regulations
in this act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2 d) of the GDPR,
according to which each control authority may “d) order the person in charge or in charge
of the processing that the processing operations comply with the provisions of the

this Regulation, where appropriate, in a certain way and within a certain
specified period”.

       In the present case, the defendant is required so that within a period of one month
from the notification of this resolution:


       - Accredit the adoption of adequate measures to avoid that in the future
