<p>The CNIL has adopted two new reference methodologies to enable public bodies (MR-007) to process data from the main database of the National Health Data System(SNDS), beyond the Medicalization of Information Systems Program (PMSI). The MR-007 reference methodology governs access by organizations acting within the framework of their public interest mission to data from the main database of the National Health Data System.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The scope of the National Health Data System has been expanded, both by the Law on the organization and transformation of the health system and by modifying its Implementing Decree. These developments, coupled with a growing interest in this information among stakeholders, have led the CNIL to adopt new reference frameworks allowing access to all the data in the main database of the National Health Data System.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The data controller undertakes to only process data that is relevant, adequate and limited to what is necessary for the purposes pursued. The duration of access or retention of data in the controlled environment must be limited to the duration necessary for the implementation of the processing.In any case, this duration cannot exceed five years from the last effective provision of the data.Under certain conditions, this duration may exceptionally be extended.Only people authorized by the data controller or, where applicable, by the person responsible for implementing the processing, can access the data. The implementation of data processing takes place under the responsibility of the data controller, including when it is carried out by third parties acting on its behalf, in compliance with the general data protection regulations.MR-007 legal basis concerns organizations for which the implementation of research, study or evaluation in the field of health is necessary for the performance of a mission in the public interest or is in the exercise of official authority vested in them.
</p><p>MR-007 sets out the purposes of the processing and adds the targeting of centres and/or carrying out feasibility studies for the performance of research involving or not involving the human person.The purposes listed, presumed to be in the public interest, are identical to those mentioned in the reference framework for the provision of the National Health Data System
</p><p>Due to the large volume of data available and the complexity of the available databases, MR-007 require that the project has been the subject of an expressly favourable opinion from the Ethical and Scientific Committee for Research, Studies and Evaluations in the Field of Health (CESREES).
</p><p>In addition, in the event of a favourable opinion with recommendations, the data controller must undertake to take them into account and to modify its file accordingly, prior to the implementation of the processing.
</p><p>In order to facilitate the work of making data available MR-007 provides that the data controller must attach to its protocol an expression of needs, i.e. a document indicating:
</p><p>· &#160; &#160; &#160;the components of the main database of the NSDS concerned by the access request;
</p><p>· &#160; &#160; &#160;the target population;
</p><p>· &#160; &#160; &#160;the targeting period;
</p><p>· &#160; &#160; &#160;the data or categories of data required;
</p><p>· &#160; &#160; &#160;the historical depth of the data, up to a maximum of nine years in addition to the current year;
</p><p>· &#160; &#160; &#160;the requested access period, which may not exceed five years from the last effective provision of the data.
</p><p>In the context of MR-007 the data processed must come exclusively and directly from the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM).
</p><p>Every three years, organizations implementing processing operations on the basis of MR-007 will have to send the CNIL a report on their practices and use of MR concerning all their processing.The CNIL will thus benefit from feedback from stakeholders, which will be useful for updating its reference frameworks.

<pre>Deliberation No. 2023-082 of July 20, 2023 approving a reference methodology relating to the processing of data from the main database of the National Health Data System implemented for research, study or evaluation purposes in the field of health by organizations acting within the framework of their public interest mission (MR-007)

The National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties,

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing the Directive 95/46/EC;

Reference methodology relating to the processing of data from the main database of the National Health Data System implemented for the purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health by organizations acting within the framework of their public interest mission (MR-007)

Regulation (EU) No. 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (the GDPR) provides, in particular in Article 5, point 2, that the data controller must be able to demonstrate that the principles of the regulation are respected.

Article 9(4) of the GDPR specifies that Member States may maintain or introduce additional conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data or data concerning health.

Thus, in application of Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 as amended (“Informatics and Freedoms” Law), the processing of personal data for the purposes of research, study or evaluation in the field of health may be implemented provided that the data controller has made a declaration of conformity with a reference methodology. In the absence of compliance with a reference methodology, the processing must be the subject of an authorization request from the National Commission for Information Technology and Liberties (the CNIL).

The CNIL may approve and publish reference methodologies, under the standards mentioned in II of Article 66 of the “Informatique et Libertés” law, established in consultation with the Health Data Platform (PDS), as well as with public and private organizations representing the stakeholders concerned.

Given their public interest missions, a large number of organizations carry out research, studies and evaluations in the field of health, which are part of a set of specific purposes corresponding to their missions (for example: evaluation of health pathway or quality of care, medico-economic assessments, responses to requests from public authorities, actions aimed at the general public, advice to members, etc.).

In addition to that relating to data processing requiring access by health establishments and federations to data from the medicalization of information systems program (PMSI), made available on the secure platform of the Technical Agency of the information on hospitalization (ATIH), the Commission adopts a reference methodology relating to certain data processing of the National Health Data System (SNDS) implemented by data controllers acting within the framework of their mission of public interest.

Data controllers who send a declaration of conformity to this reference methodology are authorized to implement their treatments, as long as they meet the conditions provided for by the methodology and have obtained a favorable opinion from the Ethical and Scientific Committee. for research, studies and evaluations in the field of health (CESREES).
