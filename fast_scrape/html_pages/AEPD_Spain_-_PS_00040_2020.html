<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A data subject requested the City hall of Gata to get access to his personal data used to calculate a local tax for water use and asked about the origin and the recipients of that data back in 2018. At the time, the City hall of Gata partly fulfilled the request by giving access to some of the data related to one of the elements of the local tax that is managed by the City hall and pointed that the rest of the data was processed not by the City hall but by the administration of the Autonomous Community. 
The data subject requested access to his data again in 2019 to the City hall of Gata and to the administration of the Autonomous Community. The Autonomous Community replied but the City hall considered that it didn't need to reply to the data subject request as the Autonomous Community had already done it.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Can the controller consider that the right to access of a data subject is satisfied when another controller satisfies an access request related to same personal data?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA held that even though the personal data of the data subject were the same for the City hall and for the Autonomous Community, the City hall had the obligation to satisfy the access request too independently of whether the Autonomous Community had already replied to the data subject. The City hall facilitated the access to his data by the data subject in the course of the investigation process of the Spanish DPA and therefore the Spanish DPA decided to only issue a warning to the City hall. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>The main issue debated here is that the two administrative entities (City hall and Autonomous Community) used the same data to calculate the taxes to be paid by the citizen. The taxes referred to in this dispute are two, one that is due to the City hall and another one that is due to the Autonomous Community, i.e. a local tax and a provincial tax. However, the data use to calculate both taxes is the same (water consumption) and they are collected by the City hall than then shares the data with the Autonomous Community. 
The City hall considered that it didn't need to reply to the data subject request as the Autonomous Community had already done it. However, the Spanish DPA decided that both entities needed to reply to the request.

                              FOUNDATIONS OF LAW


                                              I

       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this procedure.



                                              II

       It defines the RGPD in its article 4:

  "Controller" or "controller": the natural or legal person, authority

public, service or other body that, alone or together with others, determines the ends and means
of the treatment; if the law of the Union or of the Member States determines the purposes and

28001 - Madrid 6 sedeagpd.gob.es 8/13








means of treatment, the person responsible for the treatment or the specific criteria for their
appointment may be established by the law of the Union or of the Member States; "


This procedure is limited to the claim derived from the non-response to the exercise
of access to the data of the water supply rate of the claimant that are the subject of
requested treatment. Accessory aspects related to the sanitation fee are excluded
of the GOBEX that are reflected and previously mentioned because they can be related to the

all rate.

Law 2/2012, of 06/28, on urgent measures in tax, financial and gaming matters
the Autonomous Community of Extremadura (B.O.E. no. 166, dated 07/12/2012 and D.O.E.
no. 125, dated 06/29/2012, and Decree 157/2012, of 08/03, which approves the Regulation
of the Sanitation Canon of the Autonomous Community of Extremadura (Official Gazette of
Extremadura no. 151, dated 08/06/2012) are the rules related to the canon of
sanitation as a tribute of the CCAA of Extremadura. The sanitation fee is

an indirect tax, of a real nature, which is levied on the availability and
use of water Its purpose is to enable the financing of infrastructures
Hydraulic supported by the Autonomous Community of any nature
corresponding to the integral water cycle (art 33 of the Law). They should also be cited from the
Law:



"Article 36. Taxpayers

  1. They are taxpayers, as taxpayers, natural or legal persons, and the
entities referred to in article 35.4 of Law 58/2003, of December 17 (RCL 2003,

2945), holders of the contract for the provision of the water supply service, both for the
simple fact that connected homes, offices or premises can have such
service and the use they make of said supply.

  In this case, they will be considered taxpayers, as substitutes for the
taxpayer, the supplying entities.

  Article 46. Impact

  1. In the event of supply by supplying entity, it must have repercussions
the entire amount of the canon on the taxpayer, who is obliged to bear it.

  4. The procedure for the collection of the sanitation fee in the voluntary period will be

unit with the one followed for the collection of the rights that the supplying entity
correspond to the water supply service. The act of approval of the
document that authorizes the collection of rights derived from the service of
water supply and the notice of collection will also refer to the canon of
sanitation.



  Article 47. Self-assessment

  1. The taxpayer's substitutes will be obliged to present a self-assessment in the
form and terms that are determined by regulation. Models will be approved by

order of the competent Ministry in finance matters.
Article 51. Compatibility with other tax figures

28001 - Madrid 6 sedeagpd.gob.es 9/13








        The sanitation fee regulated in this provision is compatible with any
another tribute related to the use of water. In particular their compatibility is declared
with the tax figures contemplated in the state water legislation and with the taxes

in this matter that may be required by local entities. "


Taxpayer as taxpayer is the subject who performs the taxable event, that is, the person
that performs the action that is subject to some tax, which in this case indicates that it would be
the claimant, and substitutes for the taxpayer, the taxpayers who, due to the imposition of the

law and instead of the taxpayer, they are obliged to fulfill the main tax obligation,
as well as the inherent formal obligations. Unless the law indicates otherwise, the substitute
may demand from the taxpayer the amount of the tax obligations satisfied (article
36 of the General Tax Law).

Therefore, different legal positions are presented regarding the management of the supply rate.
nistro of water, responsibility of the supplying entities, generally the City Council
or concessionaire of the same, against the sanitation fee, which is a tribute to the

Junta de Extremadura, although the City Council intervenes in its management as indicated in
Regulatory Law and development regulations.

Thus, it is appreciated that the canon and rate of water supply are different tax objects,
with different purposes and data controllers from different public administrations,
Although there are internal relations between both administrations with the objective of
canon tion. It has a specific regulation by the CCAA of Extremadura, which by relapsing
in the supply of water, requires collaboration in the management of data processing.

The City Council collects the data for the management of its water supply rate and from
of this collection, carries out treatment operations related to the purpose with which the

itself, including those specified in the law regulating the canon and development standards,
which include collaboration in the management of the canon. This implies, among other aspects,
At the same rate of water supply, the part of the sanitation fee and the self-regulation
tax clearance. The City Council, when it is a supplying entity, is responsible
state in a differentiated way on the invoice or receipt: the tax base, the rates and per-

centages as well as the tax quota of the canon. It does not seem appropriate to determine that in
treatment operations carried out by the claimed data are differentiated and separated by
the tasks to which they are destined, but rather, they form a chain of treatments with
a single purpose, destined to the management and collection of the sanitation fee in its different
These aspects, which are understood by legal provision in the same invoice as the rate

water supply. This is how both concepts appear on the receipt given the intimate connection
That is clear from its management and for configuring it in this way the applicable regulations. It not
means that the defendant uses some data for the water supply rate and others
for the canon, but at the level of treatment operations, they correspond to the same
purpose that is foreseen in the regulations for the establishment and development of the canon, and is the
Purpose of the data processing of the claimed person.



                                                 III


Recital 61 of the GDPR indicates:

  "Information on the processing of their data must be provided to interested parties

a reasonable time, depending on the circumstances of the case. If personal data
can be legitimately communicated to another recipient, the interested party must be informed
at the time they are communicated to the recipient for the first time. "

The facts presented are constitutive by the defendant of a violation of the
Article 15 of the RGPD that establishes:

  1. The interested party will have the right to obtain from the data controller confirmation of
whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed and, in this case, the right to
access to personal data and the following information:

on the applied logic, as well as the importance and expected consequences of said

treatment for the interested party. "

  Article 12.2.3 and .4 of the RGPD indicates:

  "2.The data controller will facilitate the interested party to exercise their rights in
under Articles 15 to 22. "


  "3. The data controller will provide the interested party with information regarding their
proceedings on the basis of a request pursuant to Articles 15 to 22, and, in
In any case, within one month of receipt of the request. Said term
it may be extended for another two months if necessary, taking into account the complexity and

control authority and to exercise legal actions. "


This right of access is independent of the right of access to documentation in a
administrative procedure when the condition of interested party is held, regulated by the
LPACAP, and this is derived from the wording of article 13 of the aforementioned Law, and the mention in the
Article 53 of the rights of the interested parties.


The defendant did not answer the claimant about the data of which the defendant holds the
responsibility, clearly expressed by its definition, and also by its exclusion.

Within the right of access to data, you must not only offer information on the origin, but also
also to whom has yielded them.

amount:


  b) the rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22; "

       Article 83.7 of the RGPD indicates:


       “Without prejudice to the corrective powers of the control authorities by virtue of the
Article 58 (2), each Member State may lay down rules on whether it can, and
to what extent, impose administrative fines on public authorities and bodies
established in said Member State "


Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following: “Each supervisory authority will have
all of the following corrective powers listed below:

Regulation;

       d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment are in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,

in a certain way and within a specified time;

In this sense, the defendant has accredited the measure consisting of giving access to the
claimant, who as responsible for the treatment should have complied in his day, being the
request for the concrete and specific request, without prior execution of that

specific and concrete access to what is requested by said person in charge.

  Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation,
