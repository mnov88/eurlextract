<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject purchased a mobile phone from the telephone company Orange over the internet. For its part, Orange (the controller) outsourced the delivery of the product to the company General Logistics Systems Spain (the processor), determining by contract that a photo of the front and back of the consumer's identity document be taken for verification purposes. After receiving the product and having the photo of their document taken by the employee of General Logistics, the data subject filed a complaint with the AEPD against the controller. In response, Orange claimed that the photo was necessary for the performance of the contract subscribed by the data subject and provided an e-mail in which it informed them that the photo of the document would be requested at the time of the delivery for security reasons.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA considered General Logistics to be the data processor and Orange to be the controller, as the latter contracted the former to deliver mobile phones and take photos of its customers' IDs, determining the purposes for which and the means by which personal data was processed. It recognized the need to guarantee that the recipient of the product is the same person who bought it. It also stated that the fight against fraud is a legitimate interest, particularly with regard to online transactions. However, the DPA recalled that the GDPR requires that any interference with the fundamental right to data protection be adequate, necessary, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the achievement of the purpose for which personal data were collected. 
</p><p>In the case at hand, taking a photo of the front and back of the ID reveals not only the name and surname of the recipient, but also their signature, address, place and date of birth, photograph, the document's date of issue and validity and its alphanumeric code. According to the DPA, these data are neither adequate nor relevant to the purpose of the delivery of the goods. Furthermore, there are less invasive means to ensure that the product is being delivered to the right person. The DPA distinguished the moment of the delivery of the product from the moment of the conclusion of the contract where the controller must be able to accredit the identity of the person who is contracting. From their point of view, if the transaction is correctly done, there should be no difficulty in proving that the recipient of the product is the same that concluded the contract.
</p><p>Therefore, the DPA held that the method of photographing the front and back of the ID at the time of delivery is inappropriate and intrusive to the privacy of individuals, violating the data minimization principle. On this basis, it fined the company 100.000 euros  for infringing <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(c) GDPR</a>.

     File No.: PS/00413/2021

                - RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE


Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on
to the following

                                  BACKGROUND


FIRST: The CIVIL GUARD - POST OF TOTANA sends, on date
06/18/2020, Minutes-Complaint-Inspection and Request for procedure for infringement of the
regulations on data protection, noting that on 04/22/2020 they appear in person at the

dependencies of the body D. A.A.A. (hereinafter the complaining party) together with a
third, delivery person for the company General Logistics Systems Spain, S.A. (in
successive GLS) The reasons on which the claim is based are the following: that the

employee of the company intended to give him a mobile phone sent by the
company ORANGE ESPAGNE S.A.U. (hereinafter the defendant), and that the company

mentioned to deliver the packages to their recipients, is imposing
as a necessary condition to take a photograph of the front and back of your ID. He
company employee takes it with his mobile terminal at the time of delivery.

Subsequently, the image obtained is transferred to the company that sent the package.

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in

hereafter LOPDGDD), with reference number E/05859/2020, transfer of
said claim to the defendant and to other entities with which the claim was related.
delivery of the package, so that they proceed to its analysis and inform this Agency

within a month, of the actions carried out to adapt to the requirements
provided for in the data protection regulations.

GLS, whose delivery person was to deliver the mobile phone, alleges the following:


Despite not having the essential data to identify the shipments, they believe
have identified the reported delivery service, which they go on to explain. HE
called IdentService, and has its origin in the requirement of its clients so that

the identity documents of the recipients are photographed, thus providing a
greater security that the package has actually been delivered to the addressee and
not to any person who could live in the same address as this.


The procedure was implemented in September 2018 to comply with the
requirements of your ICP client. In addition to the corresponding manager contract,
signs a special addendum in which GLS assumes the role of representative under the

orders of the principal for the collection of the photographs of the documents of
identity. The contract is provided as the addendum, signed with ICP.




C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/21








Customers who decide to require this photograph record it in the system that
provides GLS in the form of a special attribute associated with the delivery of the shipment that

wish. The necessary information travels to the device of the delivery person who performs the
delivery (full name of the recipient and ID. At the time of delivery, if
name or ID do not match what is indicated, the delivery cannot be made. Yeah

match, the delivery application allows you to take a photo of the front and back of the
DNI, so that it can be delivered. The collected data is transmitted by channel
encryption to the GLS system (they are not saved on the driver's delivery device,

with which he cannot consult the images) and they remain stored on a server
internal property of GLS, separated from the rest of the images (signatures and stamp photos).

Only a maintenance technician has access to that server. through the

       The facts denounced are specified in that the company claimed, when making
delivery of packages to their recipients through courier companies,

imposes as a necessary condition for the reception the taking of a photograph to the
front and back of your ID. The company employee takes it with his terminal
mobile at the time of delivery. Subsequently, the image obtained is transferred to the
company that sent the package.

       Article 5 of the GDPR refers to the general principles for the treatment
of data. In its section c) reference is made to the principle of data minimization,

indicating that the data must be “adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary
in relation to the purposes for which they are processed”.

       From the norm we can deduce that only personal data can be collected
that are going to be treated, that is, those that are strictly necessary
for the treatment; that they can only be collected when they are going to be treated and that
They may only be used for the purpose for which they were collected, but not with
no other goal.

       In this same sense, Recital 39 states that:

To this we must add the fight against fraud in this type of product and its appearance

reasonable diligence on the part of this type of company at the time of the

       In this sense, Recital 47 pronounces itself when it states that "The treatment

       However, the procedure used by the respondent is relevant to

       Previously, the Constitutional Court jurisprudence has established

       On the other hand, said limitation to what is necessary must be evaluated both from a
quantitative point of view (volume of data processed) and qualitative (category of

that “…This requires, in particular, guaranteeing that their plan is limited to a strict minimum.

       However, such an allegation cannot be accepted, since access to the image

       It should be noted that the DNI contains not only the name and surname, its number

       That diligence that the defendant preaches must be deployed at the moment
contracting, adopting the necessary precautions and guarantees to identify
unequivocally certify the contracting party.

       Therefore, if the recruitment is done correctly there can be no difficulty
any to provide proof that the recipient of the product is really the one who
entered into the contract and to whom the product is delivered.

        3. The defendant alleges that the AEPD intends to qualify as constituting in-
fraction a treatment whose absence has been previously sanctioned by the AEPD.

       However, such a statement is neither acceptable nor admissible; the claimed
must require at the time of contracting the product, the identification of the user,

As on the other hand, it has been established by the sentences and in the procedure
disciplinary measure to which he alludes in his writing.
       Of course, it has nothing to do with the matter that the reference to the

Recital 64 of the GDPR to which the defendant refers, like those other
subsequent references to the right of access of the interested party regulated in article 15
of the legal text.

       It is at the time of signing the contract that the treatment of the document
The identification of the interested party is considered necessary so that the defendant can
certify that the person with whom they contract is who they really say they are and, therefore,
therefore, which would accredit an adequate level of diligence.

       And this moment should not be confused with the delivery of the product to your
addressee transferring that required diligence to prove that the personality
of the contracting party was who they claimed to be by providing the documentation

opportunely to a later moment, that of the delivery of the product to its addressee.
       This has been indicated by the AEPD itself, in its resolution of 06/23/2020, in the PS /

00452/2019, where the affected party claims the processing of their data in contracting
of telephone lines without any reason that legitimizes their treatment (article 6.1 of the
GDPR), stating: "The defendant has not provided any document or evidence
any evidence that the entity, in such a situation, would have deployed the diligence

I'm going to show off."
       And that subsequently the National Court, in a Judgment of 05/05/2021, Rec.
437/2020 established that: "Regarding the face-to-face contracting of the XXXXX-

       Therefore, in view of the circumstances set forth, it cannot be appreciated that the
recurring operator to perform due diligence to verify the identity of
the person who associated the controversial telephone lines in their records, therefore

that the subjective element of guilt concurs. On the other hand, regarding the fact
I am aware that we are dealing with a third party fraud, as we said in the SAN of
October 3, 2013 (Rec. 54/2012) -: "Precisely for this reason, it is necessary to ensure
ensure that the person you hire is who they really say they are, and appropriate
appropriate preventive measures to verify the identity of a person whose
personal data will be processed...".

       And, in the same sense, in its Judgment of 03/08/2018, Rec 926/2016: “Considering
For this reason, this Chamber, as the Administration understands, that the minimum diligence

required, required TME to verify, through the pertinent documentation
the identity of the person providing the data, by showing the original document
identification document and attaching a copy of it to the declaration of will
that he wants to assert."

       The AEPD itself has also ruled, likewise, in its resolution,
06/23/2020, in PS/00452/2019, where the affected party claims the treatment of their data.
in the contracting of telephone lines without any cause that legitimizes their treatment.
(Article 6.1 of the GDPR): "The defendant has not provided a document or element

any evidence that shows that the entity, in such a situation, would have displayed
the minimum required diligence to verify that indeed your interlocutor was the
which he claimed to hold.

       However, the aforementioned cases do not bear any similarity with
which we are examining, no matter how much the defendant is interested in proposing it, since it
it deals with fraudulent contracts, due to infringement of the principle of legitimation (article
6.1 of the GDPR) in the first case and the principle of consent (article 6.1 of the
LOPD) in the second and that the defendant should be well aware of the position in the procedure.

The sanctioning party was sanctioned by the AEPD and was a recurring party in the dispute
which gave rise to the first of the sentences, dismissing the appeal filed and
sanctioned with 80,000 euros.

       Therefore, the treatment of the image of the DNI at the time of delivery of a
product contracted at a distance not only is it not considered lawful but it is considered
inappropriate not relevant or limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are processed, since it must not be forgotten that the DNI contains data that exceeds and

It has nothing to do with the purpose pursued.
       The AEPD in the current case not only is not in contradiction with the resolutions
dictated, but it is consistent and consistent with the interpretation that has been making

the National Court itself in its sentences.
       That is why the allegation of the defendant reiterating that the AEPD sanctioned her

Naba for his lack of diligence in not keeping proof of identity verification
of the interested party and in the opening of the current procedure in which he is blamed for
quite the contrary, keeping proof of identity verification of the interested party is not

conflicts between themselves or affect legal certainty, nor generate uncertainty and defenselessness.

       Therefore, it is considered that there is a violation of the principle of minimization of
the data being the defendant responsible for the violation of article 5.1.c) of the
GDPR, infringement typified in article 83.5.a).

       4. Finally, the defendant invoked the violation of the principle of proportionality
purpose by requesting a reduction in the amount of the penalty by reducing it.

       In this regard, it should be noted that taking into account that it is a
offense classified as very serious and that in accordance with article 83 of the
GDPR can be sanctioned, "with administrative fines of €20,000,000 maximum
or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the

total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the one with the highest value”. an important reduction of the same is already applied, in addition to
take into account the circumstances and evaluation criteria concurrent in it.
The STS, Chamber 3, of December 16, 2003 (Rec. 4996/98) already indicated that the main
principle of proportionality of the sanctions requires that "the discretion granted

to the Administration for the application of the sanction is developed weighing in all
case the concurrent circumstances, in order to achieve due proportionality
between the facts charged and the responsibility demanded". Principle of proportionality
that it has not been violated, considering the sanction proposed to the entity
based on the proven facts and once the circumstances and criteria that
concur.

       For the rest, the specific circumstances that have been taken into account for the
graduation of the amount of the sanction are detailed in Fundament VII of this resolution.

       The defendant has alleged his disagreement with the content of the fundamentals
expressed in the Proposal for the procedure ratifying what has already been stated in this
previous crits.

       It alleges that it is intended to penalize for displaying an excessive level of diligence
in the identification of its clients by requiring a copy of the DNI, the only document that

in accordance with Organic Law 4/2015, of March 30, Protection of Security
Citizenship that allows to prove the identity and personal data of its owner.

       It is true that article 8.1 of the LOPSC establishes that the DNI "is the only document
document with sufficient value on its own for the accreditation, for all purposes, of the
identity and personal data of its owner" and that verification by the re-
claimed the identity of the interested party at the time of delivery of the product to your
domicile is considered lawful both to execute the object of the contract and can be

what is in doubt is that the method, protocol, procedure or system carried out

people, unless it is due to other reasons, such as hiring

corresponding documents, what need does the defendant have to photograph said
document if it is already in your possession?

       It has also alleged that the treatment of the images of the DNI of the interested party
It is not only considered necessary to prove that the product has been delivered to the
person who appears as contracting party, but this criterion has been collected by the
Agency not only in specific resolutions and is also described by the Agency in the

       In relation to the Ex officio Inspection Plan on Distance Contracting

specifically established in the section 'Accreditation of the identity of the Contractor

       It is true that the treatment of the images of the DNI in contracting at dis-

       In this sense, he recommended a series of measures:

       - Maximize the guarantees of identification of the contracting party prior to the
execution of the contract,

       - The use in systems with additional guarantees of the style of what is defined
in the PSD2 regulations,

       -Biometric data.

       Well, none of these recommendations included or referred to
to the system or procedure implemented by the claimant for the delivery of products
hired, consisting of photographing the ID using the apps that the delivery man has
installed in your mobile terminal.

       However, the Agency itself has considered that this is a question
complex, having to attend to the specific case, to the techniques used in the treatment
ment, interference in the right to data protection, and must, as long as
as long as the European Committee for Data Protection does not pronounce on it or

courts, adopt in case of doubt, the interpretation that is most
favorable for the protection of the rights of those affected.

       - The nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement: the facts considered
