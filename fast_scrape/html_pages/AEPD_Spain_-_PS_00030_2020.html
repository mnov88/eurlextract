Article 22 section 4 LOPDGDD (LO 3/2018, December 5) provides the following:

“The duty of information provided for in article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 will be understood to have been fulfilled by placing an information device in a sufficiently visible place identifying, at least, the existence of the treatment, the identity of the person in charge and the possibility of exercise the rights provided for in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

A connection code or internet address to this information may also be included in the information device. In any case, the data controller must keep the information referred to in the aforementioned regulation at the disposal of those affected ”.

The events described above may affect the content of article 12 RGPD, since it does not inform the clients of the establishment that runs the purpose (s) of the treatment, nor the person responsible for it or the way to exercise the rights recognized in the articles 15-22 GDPR.

“The person responsible for the treatment will take the appropriate measures to provide the interested party with all the information indicated in articles 13 and 14, as well as any communication in accordance with articles 15 to 22 and 34 regarding the treatment, in a concise, transparent, intelligible way and easily accessible, with clear and simple language or, in particular, any information directed specifically to a child.

III

In accordance with the evidence available in this sanctioning procedure, it is considered that the complainant has a video surveillance system, which lacks the mandatory information poster indicating the person responsible for the treatment for the appropriate legal purposes.

Contrary to what was stated by the defendant, the installed system obtains “images”, that is, it is in a position to process personal data of third parties, both with the external cameras and those installed inside the establishment that it runs.

Therefore, the defendant must foresee that obtaining images of the cameras

Outdoor maras must be proportionate to the intended purpose, as well as have an informative poster (s) assuming responsibility as the person responsible for the treatment of the images, an aspect whose responsibility is made clear by the contract provided.

“From the treatment of images and / or sounds (such as personal data) indicated in point 15.C, responsibilities and obligations towards the

CLIENT as responsible for the treatment in accordance with the provisions of the Organic Law

Data Protection Regulation and its Development Regulations, as well as Instruction 1/2006 on video surveillance. The following obligations should be listed (…) ”.

The known facts are constitutive of an infringement, attributable to the complainant, for violation of the content of article 12 of the RGPD, by failing to inform the duty of information, lacking the establishment that runs the mandatory posters informing that it is a video-monitored area.

Furthermore, you must have an information form (s) available to customers who may require it, informing them of all their rights within the framework of the protection of personal data.

The art. 83.5 RGPD provides the following: "Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with section 2, with administrative fines of 20

EUR 000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for the higher amount:

b) the rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22; In the present case, the following is taken into account when motivating the sanction:

-the nature of the infraction, as there is no informational poster informing the person responsible for the treatment (art. 83.2 a) RGPD).

- the way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement, when the facts were transferred by the acting force (art. 83.2 h) RGPD).

The foregoing justifies the imposition of a penalty in the amount of 1,000

€, a sanction located on the lowest scale for this type of infraction, as it lacks the mandatory informational poster for the video-monitored area, and the accused is responsible for the legal purposes of the "treatment" thereof.

All or without prejudice to accredit before this body, the change in the informational poster, indicating the person responsible for the treatment, as well as the way in which clients can exercise their rights within the framework of articles 15 to 22 RGPD.
