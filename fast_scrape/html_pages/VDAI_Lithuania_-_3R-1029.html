<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>In September 2024 the border police (the controller) stopped and fined an individual (the data subject) for driving a non-registered vehicle. Two officers uploaded a description of the data subject’s administrative offence on the border police’s Signal group along with the subject’s identity card and driver’s license. A third officer from the Signal group then forwarded the data to an unauthorized third party via Messenger.
</p><p>The controller later investigated the incident and sanctioned the officer responsible for the disclosure. The controller also considered that the breach was unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and, therefore, that it was not necessary to notify it to the DPA or the data subject.
</p><p>In the meantime, the data subject learned about the breach and filed a complaint with the DPA.
</p><p>The DPA investigated the complaint and found that controller’s data policies allowed and regulated the use of Signal for internal communications but did not allow the use of Messenger.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA clarified that leaks of identification documents are generally considered to be high-risk situations because the data could enable identity theft or other illegal actions data subjects. For this reason, the DPA held that the controller should have notified the data breach to both the DPA and the data subject.
</p><p>The DPA reprimanded the controller for having breached Articles <a href="/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR" title="Article 33 GDPR">33(1)</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_34_GDPR" title="Article 34 GDPR">34(1)</a> GDPR.

Article 4(12) of the GDPR provides that a personal data breach (hereinafter referred to as a Personal data breach (PDB) – a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. The actions of the data controller following a PDB are set out in Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR. In accordance with Article 33(5) of the GDPR, the data controller shall document all PDBs, including the facts relating to the PDB, its impact and the corrective actions taken. Article 4(1) of the GDPR states that personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data and an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Taking into account the established circumstances, the Inspectorate decides that in the case under consideration there has been ADSP (as defined in Article 4(12) of the GDPR), during which the Applicant's personal data were disclosed to a Third Party by sending them via the messaging app "Messenger". Given that ADSP has occurred, the GDPR provisions governing the management of ADSP apply. In accordance with Article 33(1) of the GDPR, in the case of an ADSP, the controller shall notify the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, no later than 72 hours after having become aware of the ADSP, unless the ADSP is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. If the ADSP is not notified to the supervisory authority within 72 hours, the notification shall include: reasons for the delay are attached. Article 34 of the GDPR provides that where the processing of personal data is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the processing of personal data to the data subject without undue delay. Article 34(3) of the GDPR provides that the notification referred to in paragraph 1 to the data subject shall not be required if any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met: (a) the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures and those measures have been applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular measures ensuring that the personal data are unintelligible to a person not authorised to have access to the personal data, such as encryption measures; (b) the controller has subsequently taken measures ensuring that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to arise; (c) this would involve a disproportionate effort. In such a case, a public notice shall be made instead or a similar measure shall be used to inform data subjects in an equally effective manner. Point 85 of the GDPR preamble further states that the data controller is not obliged to inform the supervisory authority about the occurrence of an ADSP if the data controller can demonstrate, on the basis of the principle of accountability, that the ADSP is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Paragraph 75 of the GDPR preamble states that risks of varying likelihood and seriousness to the rights and freedoms of natural persons may arise from the processing of personal data, which could result in material or non-material damage , in particular where the processing may lead to discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, . The Complainant claims that, taking into account the nature and severity of the breach identified, the ADSP should not pose a risk to the rights and freedoms of the Applicant. It should be noted that, according to Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR, the data controller must assess the impact of the ADSP on the rights and freedoms of data subjects, based on objective criteria, including the nature, scope, quantity of the personal data breached, the presence of special categories of data, the possibility of identifying the data subject and the possible consequences. In the case at hand, the Complainant indicated only a subjective assessment that the breach should not pose a risk to the data subject, but did not provide arguments substantiating his claims and evidence that would allow the conclusion that the ADSP that occurred could not or will not be able to occur in the future. pose a risk to the rights and freedoms of the Applicant. Therefore, it must be concluded that the assessment submitted by the complainant is of a declarative nature and does not prove that the risk of ADSP to the rights and freedoms of the Applicant was objectively and comprehensively assessed. It should be noted that both copies of the identity card and the driver's license sending to a third party may pose a serious risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject, since these documents contain personal data such as name, surname, personal identification number, date of birth, photo, document number, expiration date, date of issue, citizenship, signature and other information related to the data subject. Personal documents containing the aforementioned personal data, which are considered high-risk identity verification tools, used to commit a relevant illegal act, for example, identity theft or other illegal actions against the data subject, therefore it should be assessed that the ADSP that occurred may undoubtedly pose a significant risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Thus, the Complainant had to comply with the obligation provided for in Article 33(1) of the GDPR, i.e. to inform the Inspectorate without undue delay about the ADSP, and also, based on Article 34(1) of the GDPR, to notify the data subject about the ADSP that occurred, but did not do so. It should be noted that the circumstance indicated by the Complainant that the Inspectorate was informed about the ADSP that occurred by the Applicant himself does not exempt the data controller from the obligations provided for in Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR. It should also be noted that Article 34(3) of the GDPR establishes conditions under which (at least one of them) notification to the data subject is not required, however, in the case under consideration, the Complainant did not prove (did not prove) the existence of at least one of these circumstances. Taking into account the above, the Inspectorate decides that the Complainant has improperly implemented the provisions of Article 33(1) and Article 34(1) of the GDPR, therefore the Applicant's complaint is recognized as justified. In accordance with Article 31(2)(1) of the GDPR, if the complaint or part thereof is recognized as justified, the Inspectorate shall provide the data controller and/or data processor with reasoned instructions, recommendations and/or apply other measures specified in Article 58(2) of the GDPR, Article 33 of the GDPR and other laws regulating the protection of personal data and/or privacy . When deciding on the application of enforcement measures, point 129 of the GDPR preamble shall be considered relevant, which states that each measure should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate to ensure compliance with the GDPR. When deciding on imposing sanctions on the Complainant, the Inspectorate takes into account that the violation is a one-time offense (the Inspectorate has no information that the Complainant has committed more personal data security violations of a similar nature and their seriousness). was not properly assessed), i.e. the violation is not systemic. Taking into account the above, a reprimand is issued to the Complainant in accordance with Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR. The application of other sanctions, in the opinion of the Inspectorate, would not be proportionate in the case under consideration. The Inspectorate, in accordance with Article 31(1)(1) and (2)(1) of the Act on the Protection of Personal Data, GDPR Article 58(2)(b) and having regard to the above, n u s p r e n d ž i a: 1. To declare the applicant's complaint well-founded. 2. The person complained about for violation of Article 33(1) and Article 34(1) of the GDPR to issue a reprimand. 3. To inform the Applicant and the Respondent about the decision made. This decision may be appealed to the Regional Administrative Court (address: Žygimantÿ g. 2, Vilnius) within one month from the date of its delivery, in accordance with the procedure established by the Law on Administrative Procedure of the Republic of Lithuania. Director Dijana Šinkÿnienÿ
