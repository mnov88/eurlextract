<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 23/05/2019 it was published in the newspaper "Segre" that the Medical Association of Lleida is investigating a possible breach of ethics for the use of medical data to send advertising of a political party in an election campaign. 
</p><p>On 26/06/2019 the claimant filed a complaint denouncing that he had received advertising from the political party "PARTIT DELS SOCIALISTES DE CATALUNYA (PSC-PSOE)" addressed to a ceased relative and who was a patient of a doctor related to the denounced political party.
</p><p>The political party states that the doctor, who had run in the municipal elections and was a counselor at the Town Hall, brought boxes with sealed envelopes. The administrative staff of the Political Party proceeded to send them.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Is it a violation of Article 5 GDPR to send election advertising to citizens using data arising from the doctor-patient relationship?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD considered that the conduct of the defendant's employees - the sending of electoral publicity using personal data from a patient-doctor relationship - infringes Article 5.1 b) of the RGPD, an infringement punishable under Article 83 (4) (a) GDPR.
</p><p>Assessing the circumstances that modify the responsibility contemplated in Article 83 (2) GDPR, in this case, the aggravating circumstances for being a non-intentional but significant negligent action (Article 83 (2) (b) GDPR), and for being data known as basic personal identifiers such as name and address (83 (2) (g) GDPR).
</p><p>The AEPD set the amount of the administrative fine at €5000 (five thousand euros). 
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>The decision was notified on 14 August to the respondent, who lodged an appeal for reconsideration on 15 September 2020. The AEPD refused to admit the appeal due to its late presentation, justifying its action in the case law of the Audiencia Nacional and the Supreme Court. 
</p><p>This jurisprudence established that when the deadline is from month to month, the period begins on the day after the notification and ends on the same day of the notification of the following month.

<pre>Procedure No.: PS/00449/2019
RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE
From the procedure instructed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and
on the basis of the following
BACKGROUND
FIRST: A.A.A. (hereinafter referred to as the complainant)
 dated 26 June 2019
filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The claim is directed against PARTIT DELS SOCIALISTES DE CATALUNYA (PSCPSOE), with NIF G08564379 (hereinafter the claimed)
The grounds for the complaint are the receipt of a letter addressed to a family member of the claimant asking for political support for the Socialist Party candidate.
This letter was headed by B.B.B., a specialist in general and digestive surgery.
The only link between the recipient of the letter and the aforementioned doctor was patient/professional, and in no case had the express consent to receive this type of political communication.
SECOND: The aim is to inform the PARTIT DELS SOCIALISTES DE CATALONIA (PSC-PSOE), this complaint on 29 August 2019, requiring them to submit to this Agency, within one month, information on the response given to the complainant on the alleged facts, as well as the causes that have led to the occurrence and the measures taken to remedy it in accordance with Article 5(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the Parliament Council of 27 April 2016 (GPRD).
On 19 September 2019 the PSC responded to the above-mentioned request by the EAPD, said that the respondent ran in the municipal elections, forming part of the electoral coalition Candidatura del Progres (CP) as it had served as Councillor of the Town Council of Lleida.
During the election campaign, the person in question went to the headquarters of the PSC federation carrying a box of sealed envelopes (without letterhead, logo or sender) by directly instructing the Federation's personnel who will process the shipment. The said personnel proceeded to send it in view of the fact that the applicant was a prominent candidate on the electoral list.
The respondent does not know the origin of the data, although it could be deduced that it came from the personal diary of B.B.B., a prominent local doctor.
Although he was proclaimed elected, he resigned from his post as councilor, because currently, nothing is binding on the PSC.

In relation to the above-mentioned doctor, it is known that the notification sent on 29 August 2019, has not been delivered as it was not delivered, because which this Agency decides to repeat that request for information on 23 September of 2019, this second time being unknown.
THIRD: On 24 February 2020, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection agreed to initiate sanctioning procedures against the respondent, by the alleged violation of Article 5.1(b) of the GDPR, as set out in Article 83.5 of the GDPR.
FOURTH: On June 9, 2020, the instructor of the procedure agreed on the opening of a trial period, with the incorporation of the preliminary investigation proceedings, E/07792/2019, as well as documents
provided by the respondent.
FIFTH: A motion for resolution was formulated on 22 June 2020, proposing that PARTIT DELS SOCIALISTES DE CATALUNYA (PSCPSOE), with NIF G08564379, be sanctioned for an infringement of article 5.1.b) of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, a fine of 5000 euros (five thousand euros).

Article 4.2) of the RGPD defines "processing" as "any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or sets of personal data, whether by automated procedures or not, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, preservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, dissemination or any other form of enabling access, matching or interconnection, limitation, deletion or destruction".
In this way, personal data are considered to be processed from when personal data is communicated or disseminated.
Article 6.1 of the RGPD states that "in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.11 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, consent of the affected party is understood as any free, specific, informed and unequivocal expression of will by the that he accepts, either by a declaration or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data concerning him".
For its part, Article 5 of the RGPD establishes that the personal data will be

(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not treated subsequently in a manner incompatible with those purposes; in accordance with Article 89, paragraph 1, further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, for scientific and historical research or for statistical purposes shall not be considered incompatible with the original purposes ("purpose limitation");
(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for those who are processed ("data minimization");
