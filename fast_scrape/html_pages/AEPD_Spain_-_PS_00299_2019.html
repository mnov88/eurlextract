<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that Twitter (i) provides inadequate information about the cookies it uses, and that affects users and non-users of the social network, that (ii) does not clearly identify all uses and partners of Twitter that could use information obtained from the cookies, and (iii) uses cookies that are directly loaded without action any by the person accessing the home page.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>The defendant did not answer to any AEPD investigation requests, so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure. During its investigations, the AEPD discovered that (i) the Twitter website loads cookies on the browser automatically, and without any kind of action by the user, that (ii) the cookies banner only refers that "as long as you use Twitter, you accept our cookies policy", but it does not include any kind of link to a second layer of information in order to avoid cookies nor in order to customize the cookies settings, and that (iii) although there is link at the bottom of the home page (but outside the banner) with the title "Cookies" that redirects to the cookies policy, and that it includes some methods in order to control or refuse cookies through the different browsers, there is no possibility to do it granularly. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>Thus, the AEPD understood that Twitter has infringed its information duties in relation to cookies as per Article 22(2) LSSI, according to which, digital services providers may use data storage and retrieval devices on computers terminals of the recipients, provided that such recipients have given their consent after they have been provided with clear and complete information on their use and, in particular, on the purposes of data processing according to the data protection laws. Consequently, after considering some aggravating circumstances [(i) the existence of intentionality, (ii) the period of time Twitter has been infringing its duties taking into account that the claim is dated May 2018, (iii) nature and volume of damages caused as more than four millions of users are registered in Spain, (iv) the advantages obtained by Twitter with such infringement, and (v) the sales volume of Twitter], the AEPD decided to impose a fine of €30,000 to Twitter.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>3 July 2020 - After the holding above, the claimant submitted an internal administrative appeal ("recurso de reposición") stating that, prior to this claim, he/she had also submitted another claim against the defendant (dated 5 July 2017) reporting that the privacy policy of Twitter had some weaknesses, but such "primary" claim was filed because the resolution period by the AEPD expired. This <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/reposicion-ps-00299-2019.pdf">internal administrative appeal was denied for formal reasons in 31 July 2020</a>: the AEPD understood that the appellant is not discussing the substance of this case (PS/00299/2019), but requiring the AEPD to solve another claim he/she had previously submitted.
