<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A client of the defendant provided the Guardia Civil (Spanish Police) with a notebook that the defendant had forgotten in his home when he was there for repairs.
</p><p>The document-agenda contained a large number of notes from clients with their name, surname, personal identification number, divided by parish and containing in many cases the address and telephone number.
</p><p>The client also presented an invoice for the services provided by the company of the respondent, which did not inform the interested parties about the data protection regulations and their rights as data subjects.
</p><p>The defendant did not make any allegations at any time during the sanctioning procedure.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Is it a violation of Article 6 GDPR to collect non-automated personal data without the prior consent of the data subjects?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD held it has been proven that the complainant violated Article 6 of the GDPR, as he had illegally processed the personal data of the persons concerned, and there was no legitimate basis for the processing of personal data.
</p><p>The facts claimed also provide evidence of the violation of the Article 13 of the GDPR, by not informing about the processing of personal data with the requirements and pronouncements established in the mentioned article, materialized in the emission of the invoice to its clients not informing in the previous sense.
</p><p>Among the factors that the AEPD took into account when setting the amount of the penalty, the following stand out:
</p><p>-The purely local scope of the treatment carried out by the defendant.
-Many people have been affected by the offending behavior.
-There is no evidence that the defendant has taken steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, as he did not respond to the request for information.
-Although there is no evidence that he acted fraudulently, his actions reveal a lack of diligence.
-The accused has not been sanctioned previously.
-The accused is a natural person, autonomous. A high penalty could therefore cause him excessive damage to his small business accounts.

In the application of the above precept and taking into account that no the agreement to open the proceedings should be terminated initiated.

III 
The facts complained of are specified in the processing of the data of character without consent or any other cause that legitimizes such processing by the in its agenda-document called Dietario Perpetuo (Perpetual Diary), the personal data of the inhabitants of several parishes and, moreover, without informing them of
their rights under Article 13 of the GDPR.

Article 58 of the GDPR, Powers, states:
"Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers corrective measures indicated below:
(…)
b) sanction any person responsible for or in charge of the processing with warning where processing operations have infringed the provisions of this Regulation;
(…)
(i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with Article 83, in addition to or in addition to place of the measures mentioned in this paragraph, according to the circumstances of each individual case;
(…)”

IV
Infringement of Article 6.1.a) of the GDPR 
Article 5, Principles relating to processing, of the RGPD states:
"1. Personal data shall be:
(a) processed in a lawful, fair, and transparent manner in relation to the data subject ("legality, loyalty and transparency");

Furthermore, Article 6, Lawfulness of processing, of the GDPR provides that "Processing shall be lawful only if at least one of the following conditions is met conditions:
a) the data subject has given his consent to the processing of his data for one or more specific purposes;
 (…)”
Article 4(11) of the GDPR, Definitions, states that 
"(11) "Consent of the data subject" means any expression of free will specific, informed and unequivocal by which the data subject accepts, either by a statement or clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that concern him".

Also Article 6, Treatment based on the consent of the person concerned, of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 December, on Data Protection Personal and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), states
that:
"In accordance with Article 4.11 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the consent of the person concerned is understood as any expression of will specific, informed and unequivocal reason why he accepts, either by a
statement or clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that you concern.

2. When it is intended to base the processing of data on the consent of the person concerned for a variety of purposes will need to be recorded in as the Commission has also stated specifically and unambiguously that such consent is given for all of them.

3. The execution of the contract may not be subordinated to the consent of the person concerned to
processing of personal data for purposes unrelated to the maintenance, development, or control of the contractual relationship".

V
The documentation in the file proves that the claimant violated Article 6 of the GDPR, since it has unlawfully processed the data of personal nature of the persons concerned since there is no legitimate reason for the
processing of personal data, as set out in the list containing the name, surname and ID card of many people, grouped by parish, all this is set out and contained in the Perpetual Diary document belonging to the
claimed.
It should be noted that respect for the principle of the lawfulness of data requires it is established that there is a legitimate reason for the processing of the data and to display reasonable diligence, which is essential to prove this. If not to do so would empty the principle of legality of its substance.

VI
Article 83.5(a) of the GPRS considers that the infringement of "the principles for treatment, including conditions for consent under the of Articles 5, 6, 7 and 9" is punishable, in accordance with Article
mentioned in Article 83 of that Regulation, "with administrative fines of 20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, an equivalent amount to a maximum of 4% of the total annual turnover for the financial year
The previous one, opting for the one with the highest amount".

On the other hand, the LOPDGDD for the purposes of prescription states in Article 72:
"Infringements considered very serious:
1. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83(5) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations for infringements that constitute a substantial breach of the articles mentioned in that one and, in particular, the following:
(…)

b) The processing of personal data without any of the conditions for the lawfulness of processing laid down in Article 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
(…)”

VII
In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed the provisions of Articles 83(1) and 83(2) of the GPRS, which they point out:
"Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of fines administrative offences under this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 are on a case-by-case basis
effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or instead of the measures envisaged in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j) In deciding to impose a fine and its amount in each individual case will be duly taken into account:

(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation concerned as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and damages they have suffered;
(b) the intentionality or negligence of the infringement;
(c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damages suffered by those concerned;
(d) the degree of responsibility of the person responsible for or in charge of treatment, taking into account any technical or organisational measures that have applied under Articles 25 and 32;

(j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or to mechanisms of certification approved in accordance with Article 42, and
(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits obtained or the losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.

In relation to Article 83.2(k) of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, in its Article 76, "Sanctions and remedial measures", provides that 
"In accordance with Article 83(2)(k) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 may also be taken into account:
(a) the continuing nature of the infringement 
(b) The link between the activity of the offender and the carrying out of the processing of personal data.
(c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the infringement.

f) Affecting the rights of minors.
g) Having, when not compulsory, a delegate for the protection of data.
h) The submission by the person responsible or in charge, with a to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, in those cases where there are disputes between them and any interested."

In accordance with the above provisions, and without prejudice to the investigation of the proceedings, for the purpose of setting the amount of the penalty to be imposed at the present case for the infringement defined in article 83.5.a) of the GDPR of which the claimant is held responsible, in an initial assessment, the
following factors:
The purely local scope of the treatment carried out by the respondent.
Many people have been affected by the infringing behaviour.
The complainant has not been shown to have adopted measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future since he did not respond to the request for information.
Although there is no evidence that he acted fraudulently, his actions reveal a lack of diligence.
The defendant has not been previously sanctioned.
The defendant is a natural person, autonomous.
Therefore, a sanction is imposed for violation of Article 6.1.a) of the GDPR of 3,000 euros.

VIII

Article 72 of the LOPDGDD states: "Infringements considered very serious:
