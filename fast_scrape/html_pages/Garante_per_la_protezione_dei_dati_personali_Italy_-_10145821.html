<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The Municipality of San Francesco al Campo (the controller) published a city council resolution on its institutional website. The resolution concerned the controller's legal defence in an ongoing case before the administrative court. The resolution included five attachments. Due to improper redaction, some of these attachments included the personal details and social security numbers of ten individuals (the data subjects) who brought the legal action against the controller. The resolution was available on two different pages of the controller's website: the official notice board (<i>"albo pretorio"</i>) and the "administrative transparency" page.
</p><p>The data subjects reached out to the controller and requested the removal of their data from its website. In response, the controller removed the data from the notice board but not from the "transparency" page. Following this partial removal, the data subjects filed a complaint. The controller removed the remaining data after the complaint was filed.
</p><p>In their complaint the data subjects claimed that the controller had no legal basis to publish personal data. The controller, on the other hand, claimed that it was under a legal obligation to publish the data in its "transparency" page<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> (but conceded that it erroneously published personal data on the notice board).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA held that the controller had no legal basis for publishing the data both on the notice board and the "transparency" page of its website. Overall, the DPA found the following violations:
</p>
<ul><li>the controller violated Articles 5(1)(a), 6(1)(c)(e), 6(2), and 6(3) GDPR, as well as 2-<i>ter</i> (1) and (2) d. lgs. 196/2003 by unlawfully processing personal data;</li>
<li>the controller violated Article 5(1)(c) by failing to ensure the minimisation of personal data;</li>
<li>finally, and with regards to the publication of personal data on the notice board specifically, the controller violated Art. 124(1) d. lgs. 267/2000 by exceeding the maximum publication time allowed under the Article<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>.</li></ul>
<p><br />
On these grounds the DPA issued a €1,200 fine.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>This case is a reminder that national transparency laws can’t be used as an excuse to ignore GDPR rules. Even small public bodies acting in good faith still need to think carefully before putting personal information online, and make sure it’s really necessary and allowed under the GDPR.
</p><p>In particular, the DPA has long required administrations<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> to carefully consider whether administrative law actually requires the publication of documents containing personal data, and whether documents can be redacted without compromising the purpose of the publication.

This Authority has received a complaint from Attorney XX, in the name and on behalf of its clients (XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, and XX, hereinafter "complainants"), alleging a violation of the personal data protection regulations by the Municipality of San Francesco al Campo by disseminating their personal data online.

The complaint contests the dissemination of personal data resulting from the publication on the institutional website of an appeal to the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) against certain ordinances of the aforementioned Municipality and the related powers of attorney granted to Attorney XX. These documents were attached to Municipal Council Resolution No. XX of XX, concerning "Appeal before the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) Mr. A.A. and others - authorization to resist and legal appointment," published online.

The same complaint highlights that a formal notice and formal notice had already been sent to the administration with a note dated XX, which responded on XX that it had removed the documents.

In this regard, however, the preliminary investigation conducted by the Office revealed that some personal data and information were still being disseminated online. Specifically, it was found that in the "Transparent Administration" section on the homepage of the Municipality's institutional website, in the "Measures"/"Measures of Political Bodies" area, by completing the appropriate search form, it was possible to view and download the text of the aforementioned City Council Resolution No. XX with four attachments.

Specifically, the files identified by the following names and URLs were downloadable:

I. "Text of the document", available at URL: XX

II. "Accounting Opinion" available at URL: XX

III. "Technical Opinion" available at URL: XX;

IV. "San Francesco al Campo Municipal Proposal - Appeal tar_signed" regarding the compensation of the Municipality's lawyer, available at URL: XX

See "Notification Report by Certified Email - Signed" available at URL: XX

These documents related to the Municipality's appearance in court in proceedings initiated before the Regional Administrative Court (TAR). Some of them contained only the initials of one appellant (the reference is to the files containing the minutes of City Council Resolution No. XX, the accounting opinion, and the technical opinion referred to in Nos. 1-3 above), while others also contained the plain text of the first and last names (the reference is to the file containing the proposal for the Municipality's lawyer's compensation, referred to in No. 4 above), as well as the date of birth, residential address, and tax code of all the appellants (the reference is to the file containing the notification report, referred to in No. 5 above).

2. Preliminary assessments by the Office of the processing of personal data

Following the investigations conducted based on the information acquired and the facts emerging from the preliminary investigation, as well as subsequent assessments, the Office, with note prot. no. XX of XX, determined that the Municipality of San Francesco al Campo—by disseminating the personal data and information described above—had engaged in conduct that did not comply with the relevant provisions on the protection of personal data contained in the GDPR. Therefore, with the same note, the violations were notified to the Municipality (pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 5, of the Code), communicating the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of the measures referred to in Article 58, paragraph 1, of the GDPR. 2 of the GDPR and inviting the aforementioned administration to submit written defenses or documents to the Guarantor and, if necessary, to request a hearing by this Authority, within 30 days (Article 166, paragraphs 6 and 7, of the Code; as well as Article 18, paragraph 1, of Law No. 689 of 24/11/1981).

3. Defense briefs

The Municipality of San Francesco al Campo, with note prot. No. XX of XX, sent the Guarantor its defense briefs in relation to the notified violations.

In this regard, it is recalled that, unless the act constitutes a more serious crime, anyone who, in proceedings before the Guarantor, falsely declares or certifies information or circumstances or produces false documents or records is liable pursuant to Article 166 of the GDPR. 168 of the Code, entitled "False declarations to the Guarantor and interruption of the performance of the duties or exercise of the powers of the Guarantor."

Specifically, regarding the conduct, the administration highlighted, among other things, that:

- "The Municipality of San Francesco al Campo is a small municipality of just under 5,000 inhabitants that operates, like many other small local authorities, severely understaffed, with a Municipal Secretary, at the time of the events, in agreement with five other municipalities and with severely limited funds."

- "Having assessed all appropriate corrective actions to be taken to eliminate the identified critical issues, it was deemed appropriate to suspend, with immediate effect, the publication of documents No. 4 (compensation proposal for the Municipality's lawyer) and No. 5 (notification report), which contain the greatest amount of personal data, effectively making it impossible to further identify any of the appellants represented by Attorney XX."

- "The Institution – in compliance with a publication obligation pursuant to Legislative Decree 33/2013 – republished only the subject matter of the other documents, obscuring the initials A.A. contained therein, which, however, in light of the aforementioned deletion of documents 4 and 5, did not appear in any way to be attributable to any natural person."

- "The Institution – in addition to promptly deleting documents 4 and 5 from the institutional website and obscuring documents 1, 2, and 3 – also immediately submitted to the Company [identified in the documents] a request to de-index the links relating to documents 4 and 5, which, as of today, are therefore no longer accessible or viewable by anyone."

- "The publication of the declaration in question occurred based on a legal obligation imposed on the Data Controller. In particular, the publication of the aforementioned document on the Institution's digital noticeboard (first) and in the "Transparent Administration – Provisions subsection" section of the institutional website […] finds its legal basis in the following provisions: Legislative Decree 267/2000 art. 124 paragraph 1 […]; Law 69/2009 art. 32 paragraph 1 […]; Legislative Decree 33/2013 art. 23 paragraphs 1 and 2 […]»;

- «the documents subject to the dispute do not in any way contain personal data pursuant to Articles 9 and 10 of the GDPR»;

- «it was evidently not the Institution's intention, with such publication, to cause any harm to the applicant's rights and freedoms, but simply to fulfill an obligation of transparency; the "unauthorized" and absolutely involuntary nature of such disclosure is evident from the table»;

- in relation to the contested "Dissemination of personal data in violation of art. 124, paragraph 1, of Legislative Decree no. 267/2000 […] since the data was in any case kept online beyond the fifteen-day deadline for publication on the public notice board and, therefore, in the absence of suitable regulatory requirements", the "fifteen-day deadline for publishing the disputed documents on the municipal public notice board" was not violated, since "following the first report by Attorney XX, this Body immediately removed (on XX) the aforementioned documents from the online public notice board. The documents were therefore published online for exactly fifteen days." For purely defensive purposes, the Authority argues that—precisely to avoid violating the provisions of Legislative Decree 267/2000—it has long been established by design that all documents published on the online Notice Board will be automatically removed after the 15-day period required by law. Therefore, regardless of the intervention of Attorney XX, the disputed documents would no longer be viewable upon the expiration of the aforementioned deadline.

- "The above documents, […] at the date the investigation began, were not published on the Notice Board but rather in the Authority's separate "Transparent Administration" Section, which, however, has different purposes and publication obligations than those set forth in Legislative Decree 267/2000. The publication of documents 1-5, although in violation of the principle of minimization as already admitted under I), was carried out by the Municipality pursuant to the provisions of Article 23 of Legislative Decree. 33/2013, which requires all public administrations to maintain online access to all politically-directed measures (such as, in particular, City Council Resolution No. XX of 2013, which appointed a lawyer to defend the decision in court) for a period of five years, starting from January 1 of the year following the year in which the publication obligation begins, and in any case until the published documents take effect (Article 8, paragraph 3, Legislative Decree 33/2013);

- "For the sole purpose of preventing further violations, the Authority has already planned to implement additional technical and organizational measures pursuant to Articles 25 and 32 of the Regulation [described in the documents], prioritizing consolidated staff awareness."

With a subsequent email dated 20th, the Municipality communicated the permanent removal from the web by the software company that provides the municipality's management software of the "links subject to a complaint regarding the publication of City Council Resolution No. XX and its annexes."

4. Legislation on the protection of personal data

Pursuant to the relevant legislation, "personal data" is "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject')" and "an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person" (Article 4, paragraph 1, no. 1, of the GDPR).

Public bodies, such as the Municipality, may disseminate "personal data" in compliance with the regulations on the protection of personal data (Article 2-ter, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Code) and – in any case – the principle of "minimization," according to which personal data must be "adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed" (Article 5, paragraph 1, letter c, of the GDPR).

State legislation in this sector, also cited by the Municipality in its defense briefs, provides that "All municipal and provincial resolutions are published on the public notice board, at the institution's headquarters, for fifteen consecutive days, unless otherwise provided by law" (Article 124, paragraph 1, Legislative Decree No. 267 of August 18, 2000) and that "Public administrations publish and update every six months, in separate sections of the "Transparent Administration" section, the lists of measures adopted by political bodies and managers, with particular reference to the final measures of the procedures for: […] b) selection of the contractor for the awarding of works, supplies, and services, also with reference to the selection method chosen pursuant to the Public Contracts Code, relating to works, services, and supplies, pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 50 of April 18, 2016, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 9-bis; […] d) agreements entered into by the administration with private entities or other public administrations, pursuant to Articles 11 and 15 of Law No. 241 of 7 August 1990 (Article 23 of Legislative Decree No. 33/2013).

It should be noted that, since 2014, the Guarantor has provided specific guidance to administrations on the precautions to be taken for the dissemination of personal data online with General Provision No. 243 of 15/5/2014, containing the "Guidelines on the processing of personal data, including those contained in administrative deeds and documents, carried out for advertising and transparency purposes on the web by public entities and other obligated bodies," published in the Official Journal No. 134 of 12/6/2014 and on www.gpdp.it, web doc. No. 3134436 (currently being updated, but still relevant in its substance).

5. Assessments by the Guarantor

The issue at issue in the case submitted to the Guarantor concerns the dissemination of personal data and information contained in documents attached to a municipal council resolution published online, concerning the institution's appearance in court and the appointment of its legal counsel. These attachments contained, in some cases, only the initials, while in others, they also contained the names of the applicants who took action against the Municipality, including their date of birth, residential address, and tax code.

Regarding the legal basis for publishing the aforementioned personal data and the exceeding of the fifteen-day deadline for maintaining the data in the online public notice board, as provided for by Article 124 of Legislative Decree No. 267/2000, the Municipality argued that publication of the disputed documents is mandatory pursuant to the transparency regulations, as required by Article 23 of Legislative Decree No. 33/2013.

In this regard, it should be noted that the aforementioned article expressly provides that public administrations must publish in the Transparent Administration section of their institutional website only the "lists of measures adopted by political bodies," with particular reference to the final decisions of the proceedings indicated therein. Consequently, the provisions contained therein cannot be invoked as a suitable legal basis pursuant to Article 2-ter of the Code for the dissemination of complainants' personal data contained in the attachments to the council resolution, for which—pursuant to the aforementioned Article 23 of Legislative Decree No. 33/2013—there is no obligation to publish online.

Furthermore, as this Authority has indicated since 2014, even if there had been a publication obligation on the institutional website, it would have been "necessary to select the personal data to be included in such records and documents, verifying, on a case-by-case basis, whether the conditions for the blackout of certain information were met," as no automatic mechanism for the online dissemination of personal data and information is acceptable (see Part One, Section 2; Part Two, Sections 1 and 3.2).

Precisely with particular reference to the municipal council resolutions authorising the institution to appear in court and appoint legal counsel, this Authority has repeatedly indicated that, for the purposes of publication on the institutional website, it is «completely irrelevant, and therefore disproportionate, to also disseminate the names of the parties involved on the Internet […]», it being sufficient, in compliance with the principle of adequate motivation, to indicate the essential elements of the case or «even just the general case number» (see provisions no. 65 of 2/3/2023, in www.gpdp.it, web doc. no. 9874480; no. 212 of 9/6/2022, ibid., web doc. no. 9789037; no. 213 of 9/6/2022, ibid., web doc. no. 9789488; no. 149 of 28/4/2022, (ibid., web doc. no. 9777127). In this case, moreover, in addition to the names, additional data was disclosed, such as the date of birth, residential address, and tax code of all the appellants.

For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that, just as the online dissemination of the names of the appellants against the Municipality does not comply with personal data protection regulations, neither does the dissemination—as emerged in some cases—of their initials.

This is because, as clarified in the aforementioned Guidelines of the Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante per la Garanzia di Transparenza), "the practice followed by some administrations of replacing the data subject's first and last name with initials alone is in itself insufficient to anonymize the personal data contained in the records and documents published online. Furthermore, the risk of identifying the data subject is all the more likely when, among other things, additional contextual information remains alongside the initials of the first and last name that still makes the data subject identifiable [...]" (see Part One, Section 3). In this regard, it is noted that in many cases and in specific contexts, "the online publication of even just some data [...] is sufficient to uniquely identify the individual to whom they refer and, therefore, to make that individual identifiable through the connection with other information that may also be available to third parties or obtainable from other sources" (ibid.). As this Authority has repeatedly reiterated, "to effectively 'anonymize' the data published online, it is therefore necessary to completely obscure the name and other information relating to the data subject that may allow for their identification, even retrospectively" (ibid.). Moreover, «by identification we mean not only the possibility of recovering the name and/or address of a person, but also the potential identifiability through identification, correlation and deduction» (Art. 29 Working Group, Opinion 05/2014 on anonymization techniques, WP216; on the identifying nature of initials see also provision no. 65 of 2/3/2023, in www.gpdp.it, web doc. no. 9874480; provision no. 68 of 25/2/2021, ibid., web doc. no. 9567429; provision no. 119 of 2/7/2020, ibid., web doc. no. 9440042; no. 118 of 2/7/2020, ibid., web doc. no. 9440025).

6. Outcome of the investigation into the complaint filed

The circumstances highlighted in the Municipality's defense briefs, examined as a whole, while certainly worthy of consideration for the purposes of assessing the conduct, are not sufficient to allow the dismissal of this proceeding. This is because, in the case at hand, none of the hypotheses envisaged in Article 11 of the Guarantor Regulation No. 1/2019 apply.

In this context, the Office's preliminary assessments are confirmed in note no. XX of XX and it is noted – in accordance with the relevant precedents of this Authority (provision no. 65/2023, cited, no. 212/2022, cited; no. 213/2022, cited; no. 149/2022, cited) – that the processing of personal data carried out by the Municipality of San Francesco al Campo does not comply with the relevant legislation on the protection of personal data, as the disclosure of the personal data contained in the documents cited above in paragraph 1, nos. I-V occurred:

- in violation of the principle of "data minimization," which is not "limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed," as provided for by Article 5, paragraph 1, letter c), of the GDPR. This applies to the names and initials of the individuals who filed complaints with the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) listed in the text and subject line of Council Resolution no. XX of XX and in the related attachments, as well as the date of birth, residential address, and tax code reported only in the document containing the notification report;

- in violation of Article 124, paragraph 1, of Legislative Decree no. 267/2000; Article 2-ter, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Code; as well as the basic principles of processing contained in Articles 5, paragraph 1, letters a) and c); 6, paragraph 1, letters c) and e), paragraph 2, and paragraph 3, letter b), of the GDPR, as the data were in any case kept online beyond the fifteen-day deadline required for publication in the public notice board and, therefore, in the absence of suitable regulatory requirements.

Considering, however, that the conduct has exhausted its effects, as the data controller has declared that it has removed the personal data contested by the Office from the institutional website, without prejudice to the following discussion regarding the application of the administrative pecuniary sanction, the conditions for the adoption of further corrective measures pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, of the GDPR are not met.

7. Adoption of the injunction order for the application of the administrative pecuniary sanction (Articles 58, paragraph 2, letter i; 83 of the GDPR)

The Municipality of San Francesco al Campo appears to have violated Articles 5, paragraph 1, letters a) and c); 6, paragraph 1, letters c) and e); 2 and 3, letter b) of the GDPR, as well as Articles 2-ter, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Code (see also Articles 7-bis, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree No. 33/2013).

In this regard, Article 83, paragraph 3, of the GDPR provides that "If, in relation to the same or linked processing operations, a controller or processor intentionally or negligently infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement."

In this case, the violation of the aforementioned provisions – also considering the reference contained in Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Code – is subject to the application of the same administrative fine provided for by Article 83, paragraph 5, letter a), of the GDPR, which therefore applies to the case at hand.

The Garante, pursuant to Articles 58, paragraph 2, letter c), i) and 83 of the GDPR, as well as Art. 166 of the Code, has the corrective power to "impose a pecuniary administrative sanction pursuant to Article 83, in addition to the [other] [corrective] measures referred to in this paragraph, or in place of such measures, depending on the circumstances of each individual case." In this context, "the [Garante] Panel shall adopt the injunction order, by which it shall also order the application of the additional administrative sanction, its publication, in full or in extract, on the Garante's website pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code" (Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Garante's Regulation No. 1/2019).

The aforementioned pecuniary administrative sanction, imposed depending on the circumstances of each individual case, must be determined in amount, taking due account of the factors set out in Art. 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR.

In this regard, it is important to note that the contested conduct involved the unlawful online dissemination of personal data that did not belong to special categories or to criminal convictions or offenses (Articles 9 and 10 of the GDPR). The data referred to ten individuals who filed an appeal against the institution, and were kept on the institution's website for several months (at least until the Municipality sent its defense briefs to XX). In any case, according to the Municipality, this conduct stems from the belief that it was necessary to publish the contested documents pursuant to transparency regulations (according to a broad interpretation of the principle of transparency) and is therefore clearly negligent.

It is therefore considered that, in this case, the severity of the data controller's conduct is medium (see European Data Protection Board, "Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR" of 23/5/2023, point 60).

Given the above, in addition to taking into account the fact that the Municipality of San Francesco al Campo is a small entity with fewer than five thousand inhabitants, the following mitigating circumstances are also taken into consideration:

- the data controller, following the Office's request, acted promptly, cooperating with the Authority during the investigation of this proceeding to remedy the violations and mitigate their possible negative effects. To this end, the data controller declared that the conduct had ceased after the data had been removed from the institutional website;

- the response to the Data Protection Authority also described various technical and organizational measures implemented pursuant to Articles 25-32 of the GDPR.

- there are no previous relevant violations of the GDPR committed by the entity.

Given the above factors, assessed as a whole, it is deemed necessary to determine, pursuant to Article 83, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the GDPR, the amount of the pecuniary sanction provided for by Art. 83, paragraph 5, letter a), of the GDPR, in the amount of €1,200.00 (one thousand two hundred) for the violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letters a) and c); 6, paragraph 1, letters c) and e), paragraph 2, and paragraph 3, letter b); of the GDPR; as well as Art. 2-ter, paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Code (see also Art. 7-bis, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree No. 33/2013), as an administrative pecuniary sanction deemed effective, proportionate, and dissuasive pursuant to Art. 83, paragraph 1, of the same GDPR.

In relation to the specific circumstances of this case, concerning the dissemination of personal data online without an appropriate regulatory basis and in violation of the principle of data minimization (Article 2-ter, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Code; Article 5, paragraph 1, letter c, of the GDPR), it is believed that the additional sanction of publishing this provision on the Garante's website, provided for by Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Garante's Regulation No. 1/2019, should also be applied.

Finally, it is believed that the conditions set forth in Article 17 of the Garante's Regulation No. 1/2019 are met.

NOW, THEREFORE, THE GUARANTOR

having found the processing carried out by the Municipality of San Francesco al Campo unlawful, regarding the dissemination of personal data online without an appropriate regulatory basis and in violation of the principle of data minimization (Article 2-ter, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Code; Article 5, paragraph 1, letter c, of the GDPR) within the time limits indicated in the reasons for the decision, pursuant to Articles 58, paragraph 2, letter i), and 83 of the GDPR.

ORDERS

the Municipality of San Francesco al Campo, represented by its legal representative pro tempore, with registered office at Via Roma no. 54 - 10070 San Francesco al Campo (TO) – Fiscal Code 83002830012, to pay the sum of €1,200.00 (one thousand two hundred) as an administrative fine for the violations set out in the reasons for the decision;

ORDER

that the Municipality pay the sum of €1,200.00 (one thousand two hundred), according to the methods indicated in the attachment, within 30 days of notification of this order, under penalty of the adoption of the subsequent enforcement proceedings pursuant to Article 27 of Law No. 689/1981.

It is recalled that the offender retains the right to settle the dispute by paying—again according to the methods indicated in the attachment—an amount equal to half the fine imposed, within the deadline set forth in Article 10, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree No. 150 of September 1, 2011, for filing an appeal as indicated below (Article 166, paragraph 8, of the Code).

ORDERS

WHEREAS

1. Introduction

This Authority has received a complaint, filed by Attorney XX, on behalf of his clients (XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, XX, and XX, hereinafter "complainants"), alleging a violation of the personal data protection regulations by the Municipality of San Francesco al Campo by disseminating their personal data online.

The complaint contests the dissemination of personal data resulting from the publication on the institutional website of an appeal to the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) against certain ordinances of the aforementioned Municipality and the related powers of attorney granted to Attorney XX. These documents were attached to City Council Resolution No. XX of XX, concerning "Appeal before the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) Mr. A.A. and others - authorization to resist and legal appointment," published online.

The same complaint highlights that a formal notice had already been sent to the administration with a note dated XX, which responded on XX that it had removed the documents.

In this regard, however, the Office's preliminary investigation revealed that some personal data and information were still being disseminated online. Specifically, it was found that in the "Transparent Administration" section on the homepage of the Municipality's institutional website, in the "Measures"/"Measures of Political Bodies" area, by completing the appropriate search form, it was possible to view and download the text of the aforementioned City Council Resolution No. XX with four attachments.

Specifically, the files identified by the following names and URLs were downloadable:

I. "Text of the document", available at URL: XX

II. "Accounting Opinion" available at URL: XX

III. "Technical Opinion" available at URL: XX;

IV. "San Francesco al Campo Municipal Proposal - Appeal - signed" regarding the compensation of the Municipality's lawyer, available at URL: XX

V. "Notification report by certified email - signed" available at URL: XX

These documents related to the Municipality's appearance in court in proceedings initiated before the Regional Administrative Court (TAR). Some of them contained only the initials of one appellant (the reference is to the files containing the minutes of City Council Resolution No. XX, the accounting opinion, and the technical opinion referred to in Nos. 1-3 above), while others also contained the plain text of the first and last names (the reference is to the file containing the proposal for the Municipality's lawyer's compensation, referred to in No. 4 above), as well as the date of birth, residential address, and tax code of all the appellants (the reference is to the file containing the notification report, referred to in No. 5 above).

2. Preliminary assessments by the Office of the processing of personal data

Following the investigations conducted based on the information acquired and the facts emerging from the preliminary investigation, as well as subsequent assessments, the Office, with note prot. no. XX of XX, determined that the Municipality of San Francesco al Campo—by disseminating the personal data and information described above—had engaged in conduct that did not comply with the relevant provisions on the protection of personal data contained in the GDPR. Therefore, with the same note, the violations were notified to the Municipality (pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 5, of the Code), communicating the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of the measures referred to in Article 58, paragraph 1, of the GDPR. 2 of the GDPR and inviting the aforementioned administration to submit written defenses or documents to the Guarantor and, if necessary, to request a hearing by this Authority, within 30 days (Article 166, paragraphs 6 and 7, of the Code; as well as Article 18, paragraph 1, of Law No. 689 of 24/11/1981).

3. Defense briefs

The Municipality of San Francesco al Campo, with note prot. No. XX of XX, sent the Guarantor its defense briefs in relation to the notified violations.

In this regard, it is recalled that, unless the act constitutes a more serious crime, anyone who, in proceedings before the Guarantor, falsely declares or certifies information or circumstances or produces false documents or records is liable pursuant to Article 166 of the GDPR. 168 of the Code, entitled "False declarations to the Guarantor and interruption of the performance of the duties or exercise of the powers of the Guarantor."

Specifically, regarding the conduct, the administration highlighted, among other things, that:

- "The Municipality of San Francesco al Campo is a small municipality of just under 5,000 inhabitants that operates, like many other small local authorities, severely understaffed, with a Municipal Secretary, at the time of the events, in agreement with five other municipalities and with severely limited funds."

- "Having assessed all appropriate corrective actions to be taken to eliminate the identified critical issues, it was deemed appropriate to suspend, with immediate effect, the publication of documents No. 4 (compensation proposal for the Municipality's lawyer) and No. 5 (notification report), which contain the greatest amount of personal data, effectively making it impossible to further identify any of the appellants represented by Attorney XX."

- "The Institution – in compliance with a publication obligation pursuant to Legislative Decree 33/2013 – republished only the subject matter of the other documents, obscuring the initials A.A. contained therein, which, however, in light of the aforementioned deletion of documents 4 and 5, did not appear in any way to be attributable to any natural person."

- "The Institution – in addition to promptly deleting documents 4 and 5 from the institutional website and obscuring documents 1, 2, and 3 – also immediately submitted to the Company [identified in the documents] a request to de-index the links relating to documents 4 and 5, which, as of today, are therefore no longer accessible or viewable by anyone."

- "The publication of the declaration in question occurred based on a legal obligation imposed on the Data Controller. In particular, the publication of the aforementioned document on the Institution's digital noticeboard (first) and in the "Transparent Administration – Provisions subsection" section of the institutional website […] finds its legal basis in the following provisions: Legislative Decree 267/2000 art. 124 paragraph 1 […]; Law 69/2009 art. 32 paragraph 1 […]; Legislative Decree 33/2013 art. 23 paragraphs 1 and 2 […]»;

- «the documents subject to the dispute do not in any way contain personal data pursuant to Articles 9 and 10 of the GDPR»;

- «it was evidently not the Institution's intention, with such publication, to cause any harm to the applicant's rights and freedoms, but simply to fulfill an obligation of transparency; the "unauthorized" and absolutely involuntary nature of such disclosure is evident from the table»;

- in relation to the contested "Dissemination of personal data in violation of art. 124, paragraph 1, of Legislative Decree no. 267/2000 […] since the data was in any case kept online beyond the fifteen-day deadline for publication on the public notice board and, therefore, in the absence of suitable regulatory requirements", the "fifteen-day deadline for publishing the disputed documents on the municipal public notice board" was not violated, since "following the first report by Attorney XX, this Body immediately removed (on XX) the aforementioned documents from the online public notice board. The documents were therefore published online for exactly fifteen days." For purely defensive purposes, the Authority argues that—precisely to avoid violating the provisions of Legislative Decree 267/2000—it has long been established by design that all documents published on the online Notice Board will be automatically removed after the 15-day period required by law. Therefore, regardless of the intervention of Attorney XX, the disputed documents would no longer be viewable upon the expiration of the aforementioned deadline.

- "The above documents, […] at the date the investigation began, were not published on the Notice Board but rather in the Authority's separate "Transparent Administration" Section, which, however, has different purposes and publication obligations than those set forth in Legislative Decree 267/2000. The publication of documents 1-5, although in violation of the principle of minimization as already admitted under I), was carried out by the Municipality pursuant to the provisions of Article 23 of Legislative Decree. 33/2013, which requires all public administrations to maintain online access to all politically-directed measures (such as, in particular, City Council Resolution No. XX of 2013, which appointed a lawyer to defend the proceedings) for a period of five years, starting from January 1 of the year following the year in which the publication obligation begins, and in any case until the published documents take effect (Article 8, paragraph 3, Legislative Decree 33/2013);

- "For the sole purpose of preventing further violations, the Authority has already planned to implement additional technical and organizational measures pursuant to Articles 25 and 32 of the Regulation [described in the documents], prioritizing consolidated staff awareness."

In a subsequent email dated XX, the Municipality communicated the permanent removal from the web by the software company that provides the municipality's management software of the "links subject to complaint regarding the publication of City Council Resolution No. XX and its annexes."

4. Legislation on the protection of personal data

Pursuant to the relevant legislation, "personal data" is "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject')" and "an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person" (Article 4, paragraph 1, no. 1, of the GDPR).

Public bodies, such as the Municipality, may disseminate "personal data" in compliance with the regulations on the protection of personal data (Article 2-ter, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Code) and – in any case – the principle of "minimization," according to which personal data must be "adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed" (Article 5, paragraph 1, letter c, of the GDPR).

State legislation in this sector, also cited by the Municipality in its defense briefs, provides that "All municipal and provincial resolutions are published on the public notice board, at the institution's headquarters, for fifteen consecutive days, unless otherwise provided by law" (Article 124, paragraph 1, Legislative Decree No. 267 of August 18, 2000) and that "Public administrations publish and update every six months, in separate sections of the "Transparent Administration" section, the lists of measures adopted by political bodies and managers, with particular reference to the final measures of the procedures for: […] b) selection of the contractor for the awarding of works, supplies, and services, also with reference to the selection method chosen pursuant to the Public Contracts Code, relating to works, services, and supplies, pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 50 of April 18, 2016, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 9-bis; […] d) agreements entered into by the administration with private entities or other public administrations, pursuant to Articles 11 and 15 of Law No. 241 of 7 August 1990 (Article 23 of Legislative Decree No. 33/2013).

It should be noted that, since 2014, the Guarantor has provided specific guidance to administrations on the precautions to be taken for the dissemination of personal data online with General Provision No. 243 of 15/5/2014, containing the "Guidelines on the processing of personal data, including those contained in administrative deeds and documents, carried out for advertising and transparency purposes on the web by public entities and other obligated bodies," published in the Official Journal No. 134 of 12/6/2014 and on www.gpdp.it, web doc. No. 3134436 (currently being updated, but still relevant in its substance).

5. Assessments by the Guarantor

The issue at issue in the case submitted to the Guarantor concerns the dissemination of personal data and information contained in documents attached to a municipal council resolution published online, concerning the institution's appearance in court and the appointment of its legal counsel. These attachments contained, in some cases, only the initials, while in others, they also contained the names of the applicants who took action against the Municipality, including their date of birth, residential address, and tax code.

Regarding the legal basis for publishing the aforementioned personal data and the exceeding of the fifteen-day deadline for maintaining the data in the online public notice board, as provided for by Article 124 of Legislative Decree No. 267/2000, the Municipality argued that publication of the disputed documents is mandatory pursuant to the transparency regulations, as required by Article 23 of Legislative Decree No. 33/2013.

In this regard, it should be noted that the aforementioned article expressly provides that public administrations must publish in the Transparent Administration section of their institutional website only the "lists of measures adopted by political bodies," with particular reference to the final decisions of the proceedings indicated therein. Consequently, the provisions contained therein cannot be invoked as a suitable legal basis pursuant to Article 2-ter of the Code for the dissemination of complainants' personal data contained in the attachments to the council resolution, for which—pursuant to the aforementioned Article 23 of Legislative Decree No. 33/2013—there is no obligation to publish online.

Furthermore, as this Authority has indicated since 2014, even if there had been a publication obligation on the institutional website, it would have been "necessary to select the personal data to be included in such records and documents, verifying, on a case-by-case basis, whether the conditions for the blackout of certain information were met," as no automatic mechanism for the online dissemination of personal data and information is acceptable (see Part One, Section 2; Part Two, Sections 1 and 3.2).

Precisely with particular reference to the municipal council resolutions authorising the institution to appear in court and appoint legal counsel, this Authority has repeatedly indicated that, for the purposes of publication on the institutional website, it is «completely irrelevant, and therefore disproportionate, to also disseminate the names of the parties involved on the Internet […]», it being sufficient, in compliance with the principle of adequate motivation, to indicate the essential elements of the case or «even just the general case number» (see provisions no. 65 of 2/3/2023, in www.gpdp.it, web doc. no. 9874480; no. 212 of 9/6/2022, ibid., web doc. no. 9789037; no. 213 of 9/6/2022, ibid., web doc. no. 9789488; no. 149 of 28/4/2022, (ibid., web doc. no. 9777127). In this case, moreover, in addition to the names, additional data was disclosed, such as the date of birth, residential address, and tax code of all the appellants.

For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that, just as the online dissemination of the names of the appellants against the Municipality does not comply with personal data protection regulations, neither does the dissemination—as emerged in some cases—of their initials.

This is because, as clarified in the aforementioned Guidelines of the Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante per la Garanzia di Transparenza), "the practice followed by some administrations of replacing the data subject's first and last name with initials alone is in itself insufficient to anonymize the personal data contained in the records and documents published online. Furthermore, the risk of identifying the data subject is all the more likely when, among other things, additional contextual information remains alongside the initials of the first and last name that still makes the data subject identifiable [...]" (see Part One, Section 3). In this regard, it is noted that in many cases and in specific contexts, "the online publication of even just some data [...] is sufficient to uniquely identify the individual to whom they refer and, therefore, to make that individual identifiable through the connection with other information that may also be available to third parties or obtainable from other sources" (ibid.). As this Authority has repeatedly reiterated, "to effectively 'anonymize' the data published online, it is therefore necessary to completely obscure the name and other information relating to the data subject that may allow for their identification, even retrospectively" (ibid.). Moreover, «by identification we mean not only the possibility of recovering the name and/or address of a person, but also the potential identifiability through identification, correlation and deduction» (Art. 29 Working Group, Opinion 05/2014 on anonymization techniques, WP216; on the identifying nature of initials see also provision no. 65 of 2/3/2023, in www.gpdp.it, web doc. no. 9874480; provision no. 68 of 25/2/2021, ibid., web doc. no. 9567429; provision no. 119 of 2/7/2020, ibid., web doc. no. 9440042; no. 118 of 2/7/2020, ibid., web doc. no. 9440025).

6. Outcome of the investigation into the complaint filed

The circumstances highlighted in the Municipality's defense briefs, examined as a whole, while certainly worthy of consideration for the purposes of assessing the conduct, are not sufficient to allow the dismissal of this proceeding. This is because, in the case at hand, none of the hypotheses envisaged in Article 11 of the Guarantor Regulation No. 1/2019 apply.

In this context, the Office's preliminary assessments are confirmed in note no. XX of XX and it is noted – in accordance with the relevant precedents of this Authority (provision no. 65/2023, cited, no. 212/2022, cited; no. 213/2022, cited; no. 149/2022, cited) – that the processing of personal data carried out by the Municipality of San Francesco al Campo does not comply with the relevant legislation on the protection of personal data, as the disclosure of the personal data contained in the documents cited above in paragraph 1, nos. I-V occurred:

- in violation of the principle of "data minimization," which is not "limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed," as provided for by Article 5, paragraph 1, letter c), of the GDPR. This applies to the names and initials of the individuals who filed complaints with the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) listed in the text and subject line of Council Resolution no. XX of XX and in the related attachments, as well as the date of birth, residential address, and tax code reported only in the document containing the notification report;

- in violation of Article 124, paragraph 1, of Legislative Decree no. 267/2000; Article 2-ter, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Code; as well as the basic principles of processing contained in Articles 5, paragraph 1, letters a) and c); 6, paragraph 1, letters c) and e), paragraph 2, and paragraph 3, letter b), of the GDPR, as the data were in any case kept online beyond the fifteen-day deadline required for publication in the public notice board and, therefore, in the absence of suitable regulatory requirements.

However, given that the conduct has exhausted its effects, as the data controller has declared that it has removed the personal data contested by the Office from the institutional website, without prejudice to the provisions of the following regarding the application of the administrative pecuniary sanction, the conditions for the adoption of further corrective measures pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, of the GDPR are not met.

7. Adoption of the injunction order for the application of the administrative pecuniary sanction (Articles 58, paragraph 2, letter i; 83 of the GDPR)

The Municipality of San Francesco al Campo appears to have violated Articles 5, paragraph 1, letters a) and c); 6, paragraph 1, letters c) and e); 2 and 3, letter b) of the GDPR, as well as Articles 2-ter, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Code (see also Articles 7-bis, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree No. 33/2013).

In this regard, Article 83, paragraph 3, of the GDPR provides that "If, in relation to the same or linked processing operations, a controller or processor intentionally or negligently infringes several provisions of this Regulation, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed the amount specified for the gravest infringement."

In this case, the violation of the aforementioned provisions – also considering the reference contained in Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Code – is subject to the application of the same administrative fine provided for by Article 83, paragraph 5, letter a), of the GDPR, which therefore applies to the case at hand.

The Garante, pursuant to Articles 58, paragraph 2, letter c), i) and 83 of the GDPR, as well as Art. 166 of the Code, has the corrective power to "impose a pecuniary administrative sanction pursuant to Article 83, in addition to the [other] [corrective] measures referred to in this paragraph, or in place of such measures, depending on the circumstances of each individual case." In this context, "the [Garante] Panel shall adopt the injunction order, by which it shall also order the application of the additional administrative sanction, its publication, in full or in extract, on the Garante's website pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code" (Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Garante's Regulation No. 1/2019).

The aforementioned pecuniary administrative sanction, imposed depending on the circumstances of each individual case, must be determined in amount, taking due account of the factors set out in Art. 83, paragraph 2, of the GDPR.

In this regard, it is important to note that the contested conduct involved the unlawful online dissemination of personal data that did not belong to special categories or to criminal convictions or offenses (Articles 9 and 10 of the GDPR). The data referred to ten individuals who filed an appeal against the institution, and were kept on the institution's website for several months (at least until the Municipality sent its defense briefs to XX). In any case, according to the Municipality, this conduct stems from the belief that it was obligatory to publish the contested documents pursuant to transparency regulations (according to a broad interpretation of the principle of transparency) and is therefore clearly negligent.

It is therefore considered that, in this case, the severity of the data controller's conduct is medium (see European Data Protection Board, "Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR" of 23/5/2023, point 60).

That said, in addition to taking into account the fact that the Municipality of San Francesco al Campo is a small entity with fewer than five thousand inhabitants, the following mitigating circumstances are also taken into consideration:

- the data controller, following the Office's request, acted promptly, cooperating with the Authority during the investigation of this proceeding to remedy the violations and mitigate their possible negative effects. To this end, the data controller declared that the conduct had ceased after the data had been removed from the institutional website;

- the response to the Data Protection Authority also described various technical and organizational measures implemented pursuant to Articles 25-32 of the GDPR.

- there are no previous relevant GDPR violations committed by the entity.

Given the above factors, assessed as a whole, it is deemed necessary to determine, pursuant to Article 83, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the GDPR, the amount of the pecuniary sanction provided for by Art. 83, paragraph 5, letter a), of the GDPR, in the amount of €1,200.00 (one thousand two hundred) for the violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letters a) and c); 6, paragraph 1, letters c) and e), paragraph 2, and paragraph 3, letter b); of the GDPR; as well as Art. 2-ter, paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Code (see also Art. 7-bis, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree No. 33/2013), as an administrative pecuniary sanction deemed effective, proportionate, and dissuasive pursuant to Art. 83, paragraph 1, of the same GDPR.

In relation to the specific circumstances of this case, concerning the dissemination of personal data online without an appropriate regulatory basis and in violation of the principle of data minimization (Article 2-ter, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Code; Article 5, paragraph 1, letter c, of the GDPR), it is believed that the additional sanction of publishing this provision on the Garante's website, provided for by Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Garante's Regulation No. 1/2019, should also be applied.

Finally, it is believed that the conditions set forth in Article 17 of the Garante's Regulation No. 1/2019 are met.

NOW, THEREFORE, THE GUARANTOR

having found the processing carried out by the Municipality of San Francesco al Campo unlawful, regarding the dissemination of personal data online without an appropriate regulatory basis and in violation of the principle of data minimization (Article 2-ter, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Code; Article 5, paragraph 1, letter c, of the GDPR) within the time limits indicated in the reasons for the decision, pursuant to Articles 58, paragraph 2, letter i), and 83 of the GDPR.

ORDERS

the Municipality of San Francesco al Campo, represented by its legal representative pro tempore, with registered office at Via Roma no. 54 - 10070 San Francesco al Campo (TO) – Fiscal Code 83002830012, to pay the sum of €1,200.00 (one thousand two hundred) as an administrative fine for the violations set out in the reasons for the decision;

ORDER

that the Municipality pay the sum of €1,200.00 (one thousand two hundred), according to the methods indicated in the attachment, within 30 days of notification of this order, under penalty of the adoption of the subsequent enforcement proceedings pursuant to Article 27 of Law No. 689/1981.

It is recalled that the offender retains the right to settle the dispute by paying—again according to the methods indicated in the attachment—an amount equal to half the fine imposed, within the deadline set forth in Article 10, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree No. 150 of September 1, 2011, for filing an appeal as indicated below (Article 166, paragraph 8, of the Code).

ORDERS

- the publication of this order on the website of the Guarantor pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Italian Data Protection Authority Regulation No. 1/2019;

- recording in the Authority's internal register of violations and measures adopted pursuant to Art. 58, paragraph 2, of the GDPR with this provision, as required by Art. 17 of the Italian Data Protection Authority Regulation No. 1/2019.

Pursuant to Art. 78 of the GDPR, Articles 152 of the Code, and Article 10 of Legislative Decree No. 150/2011, an appeal against this provision may be lodged before the ordinary judicial authority, under penalty of inadmissibility, within thirty days of the date of notification of the provision itself, or within sixty days if the appellant resides abroad.
