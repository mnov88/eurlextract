        of a company that is not newly created and should have
        procedures established for the fulfillment of the obligations that
        contemplates the data protection regulations, among them, to respond to

        the requirements of the supervisory authority.



        - Art. 83.2 k) RGPD: any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the

        circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits obtained or the
        losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement. The
        claim refers to the particular case of a person, but the

        data processing to which it refers, can potentially affect a
        very high number of clients of the responsible entity or users of the

        service provided by the responsible entity.
