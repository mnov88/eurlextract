<p>In a case regarding the processing of sexual images by a sex webcam website, the Spanish DPA concluded that by ticking a box attesting that they agreed with the controller's terms and conditions, the data subject had handed over the rights to their image to the controller, which thus had a legal basis for processing.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A data subject addressed the Spanish DPA (AEPD) to request the removal of sexual images of themselves from several websites and from Twitter, where someone had created an account with a fake profile of the complainant where videos and pics were posted. 
</p><p>The DPA sent requests to Twitter and the mentioned websites to take down the content, with limited success. 
</p><p>With regards to the original images, they had been uploaded by the data subject to a sex webcam website. This site, as the respondent, alleged that the complainant had accepted their terms and conditions, that included a box that provided:
</p><p><i>"Check this box to attest you have read and agree with the Terms of Use of Cam4 and you acknowledge you have licensed your images to Cam4 and that you will keep all documents."</i>
</p><p>The DPA could verify that the box had been ticked by the complainant.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD concluded that, given that the complainant had ticked the mentioned box and therefore had handed their rights over their images to the controller, the controller had a legitimate basis for the processing.
</p><p>Hence, the AEPD archived the case.
