"1. Personal data shall be:
(a) processed in a lawful, fair and transparent manner in connection with
interested (&lt;&lt;lawfulness, loyalty and transparency&gt;&gt;);"
Article 6 of the RGPD, "Lawfulness of processing", details in its paragraph 1 the

The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
Article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it dealt with the
personal data of the claimant without her consent. The personal data of the
were incorporated into the company's information systems, without
has provided evidence that it had his consent to the collection and processing
of your personal data.
The Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the National Court, in cases
like the one here, has considered that when the data owner denies
the burden of proof is on the person claiming its existence
the data controller of third parties must collect and keep the
documentation necessary to prove the consent of the owner. We quote, for
All, SAN of 31/05/2006 (Rec. 539/2004), Fundamento de Derecho Cuarto.
The complainant's personal data were recorded in the files of the
claimed and were treated for the issuance of invoices for services associated with the
complainant. Consequently, it has carried out a processing of the data
personal without proof of consent
for treatment, not to mention legal authorization.
However, and this is the essential point, the claimed does not prove the legitimacy to
the processing of the claimant's data.
In short, the respondent has not provided any document or evidence
any evidence that the entity, in such a situation, would have deployed the
minimum diligence required to verify that your interlocutor was indeed the one

he claimed to hold.
Respect for the principle of legality which is at the heart of the fundamental right
of personal data protection requires proof that the
The controller took the necessary steps to prove that the
extreme. If this is not done - and if it is not demanded by this Agency, which is responsible for ensuring
for the compliance with the regulations of the data protection law of
personal nature - the result would be to empty the principle of legality of its content.
