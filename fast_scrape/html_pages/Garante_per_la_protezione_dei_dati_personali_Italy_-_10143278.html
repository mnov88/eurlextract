<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>Noi Compriamo Auto.it S.r.l. (the controller) is a company that controls many car retailers across Italy.
</p><p>A data subject received numerous unwanted marketing communications from different email addresses. All emails promoted the controller's website (www.noicompriamoauto.it). The data subject exercised his rights<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> and received no response at first. The controller only responded after the data subject reached out again via certified email. In this regard, the controller claimed that the data subject’s first email was accidentally flagged as spam and was not seen by the DPO.
</p><p>After exercising his rights, the data subject still received marketing communications from third parties (the processors) on behalf of the controller. The data subject filed a complaint with the DPA, claiming that he never consented to the controller’s direct marketing and that the controller ignored his requests.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA fined the controller €45,000 for violating Articles <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">5(2)</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">6(1)(a)</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR" title="Article 12 GDPR">12(2),</a> <a href="/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR" title="Article 24 GDPR">24</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR" title="Article 28 GDPR">28</a> GDPR as well as Art. 130(2) of Italy’s “privacy code” (d. lgs. 196/2003).
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="On_controllership_and_processorship">On controllership and processorship</span></h4>
<p>During the investigation, Noi Compriamo Auto claimed that it was not a controller for the direct marketing. In its view, the third parties were sole controllers of personal data and they were responsible for any GDPR violation they might have committed.
</p><p>On the contrary, the DPA held that Noi Compriamo Auto was the controller for all marketing operations, including those carried out by third parties. The DPA also clarified that in general, businesses are controllers for all direct marketing activities carried out on their behalf<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>. Furthermore, the DPA held that the third parties involved in marketing acted as data processors.
</p><p>The DPA also found that the controller concluded contractual agreements with the processors and that that such agreements did not meet the GDPR's requirements for proper data processing agreements. For this reason, the DPA held that the controller violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR" title="Article 28 GDPR">Article 28 GDPR</a>.
</p><p>Finally, the DPA held that the controller did not exercise care in choosing its processors and did not vigilate upon their activities, in violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR" title="Article 24 GDPR">Article 24 GDPR</a>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="On_lawfulness">On lawfulness</span></h4>
<p>During the investigation the controller provided the DPA with logs documenting the data subject’s IP and his visits to several websites. The controller claimed that the data subject consented to direct marketing during such visits.
</p><p>The DPA reject the argument and held that the logs alone were not sufficient proof of consent. In this regard, the DPA pointed to its own guidance and case law and clarified that in a direct marketing context, “double opt-ins”<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> are essential for documenting a data subject’s consent.
</p>

THE GUARANTOR FOR THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA
IN today's meeting, attended by Prof. Pasquale Stanzione, president, Prof. Ginevra Cerrina Feroni, vice-president, Dr. Agostino Ghiglia and the lawyer Guido Scorza, members, and Dr. Claudio Filippi, acting secretary general;
HAVING SEEN Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter “Regulation”);
HAVING SEEN the Personal Data Protection Code (Legislative Decree no. 196 of 30 June 2003), as amended by Legislative Decree no. 101 of 10 August 2018, containing provisions for the adaptation of national legislation to the aforementioned Regulation (hereinafter “Code”);
HAVING SEEN the documentation in the files;
HAVING SEEN the observations formulated by the Secretary General pursuant to art. 15 of the Regulation of the Guarantor no. 1/2000;
RAPPORTEUR Prof. Ginevra Cerrina Feroni;
WHEREAS
1. THE INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITY CARRIED OUT
With a complaint dated 7 November 2023, regularised on 16 February 2024, Mr. XX complained of having received numerous unwanted emails, received starting from 21 June 2023 and concerning the promotion of services of the website noicompriamoauto.it, belonging to Noi Compriamo Auto.it S.r.l. (hereinafter NCA or the Company). The complainant specified that he had never given consent to receive such messages, which always came from different email addresses. He also added that he had forwarded a request to exercise his rights to the NCA, receiving a late response only after a reminder via certified email. At that time, the Company allegedly disavowed its role as data controller by stating that the consent would have been given by the interested party to a partner company, XX, through the portal www.yoursavingfiesta.com.
In this regard, the complainant also stated that he did not know the entity to which the said site would refer (Yoursavingsfiesta LLC, based in Florida, United States) and did not recognize the IP address indicated as referring to him in the registration log produced by the Company.
Furthermore, the complainant added that he continued to receive unwanted emails on behalf of NCA from another third party (XX) unknown to him. Having forwarded a request to exercise his rights to the latter as well, he received a response from the Spanish company XX, which stated that it had acquired Mr. XX's data and the related consent to receive promotional messages, following registration on the portal https://streamail.pro. In this case too, the complainant stated that he did not know the website and did not recognize the IP address indicated in the registration log.
All the parties involved stated that they had deleted Mr. XX's data.
In response to the Office's request for information, NCA, with certified email dated 13 May 2024, confirmed what was stated in the response to the complainant.
In particular, with regard to the untimely response to the request to exercise rights, it noted that the interested party's initial request had been sent to the DPO's mailbox but had not been received because it was blocked by the anti-spam filter; therefore, it was able to learn of the request only upon receipt of the same via certified email.
With regard to the emails sent, the Company specified that it had immediately blacklisted the complainant as soon as it received his request, charging the subsequent communications received to its partners who would have acted as independent data controllers. More generally, with regard to the methods of carrying out promotional activities by NCA, it declared that it makes use of partnerships with third parties, such as XX and XX, who carry out promotional activities on behalf of NCA and are committed to complying with the rules on personal data protection. In this regard, the Company attached contracts signed with the two partners, adding that, based on what emerged following the complaint, these contractual relationships had been concluded.
2. DISPUTE OF VIOLATIONS
With a note dated 26 August 2024 (prot. no. 100828/24), the Company was informed of the initiation of the procedure, pursuant to art. 166, paragraph 5, of the Code, for the adoption of any measures pursuant to art. 58, paragraph 2, of the Regulation, recognizing NCA's responsibility for the alleged violation of the following provisions:
- art. 28 of the Regulation for not having correctly regulated the relationships with the data controllers;
- arts. 5, paragraph 2 and 24 of the Regulation due to the poor control by NCA in the processing aimed at carrying out promotional campaigns with consequent inability to comply with the obligation to prove compliance with the rules (accountability of the owner);
- art.6, par. 1, letter a) of the Regulation and art. 130, paragraph 2 of the Code, for sending promotional communications without consent;
- art. 12, par. 2 of the Regulation, for not having facilitated the exercise of the rights by the complainant.
3. THE COMPANY'S DEFENSE
The Company presented its own defensive briefs on 25 September 2024 with which, in addition to what has already been declared, it represented that:
a) the Company had ongoing discussions with partners to formalize joint ownership agreements but, following the intervention of the Guarantor's proceedings and taking note of the objections raised, it decided to terminate the contractual relationships with XX and XX and also to discontinue the use of email marketing through third parties;
b) based on the contractual agreements, the partners had to ensure that they processed the data in compliance with the rules;
c) with regard to the consents collected from the partners, the Company considered that they were compliant with the rules and observed that the double opt-in mechanism suggested by the Authority, although more protective for the interested party, "is not formally included among the conditions of lawfulness of consent pursuant to the Privacy Code and the GDPR";
d) NCA demonstrated that it had correctly verified the partners' actions since, after the complaint, it was able to "reconstruct the flows of personal data" by obtaining the registration logs from the partners and immediately registering the opposition and communicating it to its suppliers;
e) with regard to the failure to respond to the right of access, the Company represented that the first request of Mr. XX was not processed because it ended up in the spam box but the second request, received a month later, was processed. The Company has however reviewed the procedures and technical and organizational measures in use to avoid the repetition of what happened, specifying that, in any case, the failure to deal with the complainant's request was due to an exceptional and isolated event;
f) the Company has provided specific training hours to all employees involved in the processing of personal data.
4. LEGAL ASSESSMENTS
Based on the factual profiles highlighted above and the statements made during the response, for which the declarant is responsible pursuant to art. 168 of the Code, it is believed that the violations detected in the above-mentioned notice of dispute can be confirmed.
NCA must first of all qualify as the data controller with all the related responsibilities in order to select and control the subjects who operate on its behalf. This is because the promotional content undoubtedly referred to NCA and the links in the emails led to the latter's landing page.
In this regard, the definition of controller and processor pursuant to art. 4 of the Regulation, where the “controller” is the natural or legal person who, individually or together with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing, while the “data processor” is the person who processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
As better clarified in the EDPB Guidelines 7/2020(1), regardless of the contractual qualification of the roles, the controller is the person who determines the purposes (why) and the means, i.e. the methods (how), of the processing; instead, the person who acts on behalf of the controller, carrying out the instructions even with a certain degree of autonomy without however being able to exercise any power in order to choose the purposes of the processing, is to be considered responsible.
Moreover, if the creation of a promotional campaign can (hopefully) bring benefits in terms of increased sales, this can also lead, if not correctly carried out, to an infringement of the rights of individuals as well as damage to the very corporate image that was intended to be promoted. It is therefore understandable that a client has an interest in exercising those selection and supervision activities, typical of those who operate as data controllers, which constitute an obligation for them (as provided for by art. 28 of the Regulation) but at the same time also an important opportunity to verify the correct execution of the order.
In this specific case, on the basis of what has been acquired in the documents, emails were sent with the clear intent of promoting NCA services, although this activity was materially carried out by third parties to whom the Company would have relied.
It is also necessary to recall what was clarified by the Guarantor with the provision of 15 June 2011 (in www.garanteprivacy.it, web doc. n. 1821257) with specific regard to the fact that "... promotional contacts are carried out in the name, or in any case on behalf of and in the interest of the principal company; with the effect that a legitimate expectation is generated in the interested parties, since they perceive themselves to be recipients of advertising initiatives conducted directly by the company on whose behalf the proposal for the sale of products or services is formulated". In these terms, the principal, being the subject who determines the promotional purpose of the processing and the means for its implementation, in addition to being the subject in whose interest the processing is carried out, is configured as the data controller.
Instead, the person who actually carries out the service on his behalf may be, depending on the specific roles between the parties, a joint controller or a data controller, as clarified by the Guarantor in the Guidelines on promotional activities and the fight against spam of 4 July 2013 (web doc. no. 2542348) and in the provision of 26 October 2017 (web doc. no. 7320903) as well as, more recently, in the provisions of 25 November 2021 (web doc. no. 9736961 and web doc. no. 9737185), in the provisions of 2 December 2021 (web doc. no. 9731664, in the provision of 2 December 2021 (web doc. no. 9731682), in the provision of 5 August 2022 (web doc. 9827135), provision of 20 October 2022 (web doc. no. 9827153).
This reconstruction was not contested by the Company which, in its defense brief, took note of this clear orientation of the Guarantor.
From the documentation produced by NCA, it is clear that the relationships between the parties were not regulated with regard to the processing of personal data since the contracts with the partners were signed by parties other than NCA (XX and XX); furthermore, even if it were demonstrated that these acts could be traced back to NCA, it should be noted that the contract signed with XX only regulates the economic relationships between the parties with regard to generic digital advertising activities and does not contain suitable instructions from the data controller. The contract signed with XX, however, only contains an indemnity clause with which the supplier undertakes to guarantee compliance with the data protection regulations, processing only the email addresses of parties who have given appropriate consent.
Similarly, it does not appear that NCA has carried out any verification activities of partners, both during the selection phase and subsequently with the performance of the commissioned activities. However, the processing carried out by the partners presents several profiles of possible unlawfulness; first of all, XX declared that it acquired the data by virtue of a consent that the complainant would have given by accessing the portal www.yoursavingfiesta.com which is headed by a subject other than XX itself and is based in the United States. The privacy information present in the aforementioned portal does not indicate either an establishment in the European Union, nor the appointment of a representative pursuant to art. 27 of the Regulation. Similarly, XX would have acquired the data from yet another subject, XX, based in Spain, following an alleged registration on the streamail.pro portal. With regard to the documentation of consents via registration log, the Guarantor has repeatedly clarified that this is not sufficient to document the actual will of the interested party, since sending a confirmation email to the registered address (double opt-in) is more protective. The documentation produced by the partners to Mr. XX, however, cannot be consider it suitable to document anything since XX merely indicated an IP address with the date and time of acquisition and NCA did the same in transmitting XX's feedback. This information, purely descriptive, does not specify whether this registration concerns the mere registration for the service or expresses a specific consent; consent whose purpose (marketing, communication to third parties) is equally not clarified since there is no connection with the forms allegedly signed by the complainant in 2021 and with the related information.
In this regard, the NCA's alleged ability to "reconstruct the flows of personal data" after receiving the request for opposition from the interested party cannot be considered sufficient; it would have been serious not to have done so or not to have been able to do so but this prerogative certainly cannot be considered as a supplier control procedure.
Furthermore, with regard to the lack of an express regulatory obligation with respect to the qualification of consent with double opt-in modality, it is noted that - contrary to what the NCA claims - between the requirements for the lawfulness of consent under art. 7 of the Regulation, the obligation for the data controller to demonstrate that the data subject has given his or her consent is envisaged. Such demonstration, although it is now known in the state of the art, cannot be considered sufficiently provided through the presentation of stamps - qualified as log files - containing data often unknown to the data subjects, lacking the IT requirements of unchangeability and concerning lists formed by subjects, often located outside the EU, who do not offer adequate guarantees. In this context, it must first be taken into account that the Regulation does not expressly provide specific regulatory obligations for individual cases but imposes compliance with general principles to be adapted to the context, potential risks and expectations of the data subjects. Starting from this assumption, the Guarantor has repeatedly provided guidelines on specific cases, recalling that the documentation of consent in double opt-in mode is a form of documentation of consent that offers greater guarantees and can be considered, in the state of the art, a minimum measure of protection for the data subject but also for the data controller himself, taking into account the fact that the data subject has given consent in the form of a consent documentation ... subject, taking into account the fact that the data subject has given consent in the form of a consent documentation that offers greater guarantees and can be considered, in the state of the art, a minimum measure of protection for the data subject but also for the data controller himself, taking into account the fact that the data subject has given consent in the form of a consent documentation that offers greater guarantees to prove the lawfulness of the processing (see, for example, in www.garanteprivacy.it, provision of 15 December 2022, web doc 9852290, provision of 26 October 2017, web doc no. 7320903 and provision of 25 November 2021, web doc no. 9737185); similar methods of documenting consent are also indicated in the code of conduct on telemarketing and teleselling (provision of 7 March 2024, web doc no. 9993808). Therefore, this measure (or any other that can offer an equal level of guarantee) falls perfectly within the regulatory framework, by virtue of the combined provisions of art. 7, par. 1 and art. 24, par. 1 of the Regulation since the controller, taking into account the context and potential risks, must implement adequate technical and organizational measures to guarantee, and be able to demonstrate that the processing is carried out in accordance with the Regulation and that the data subject has given his or her consent.
Even the presence of indemnity clauses in contracts signed with partners, or the alleged guarantees of conformity offered by them by agreement, cannot be considered sufficient measures to justify the lack of preliminary and subsequent control by the data controller; in fact, these aspects only have value with respect to any contractual responsibilities of the parties but are not relevant for the purposes of the guarantees required by the regulatory framework for the protection of personal data.
Furthermore, even if the acquisition of the complainant's data and his or her consent to receiving promotional messages were considered lawful, his or her consent to the communication of such data to third parties is not equally demonstrated and, in any case, such consent could only authorize communication to a single subject, since it cannot be accepted that such an act of will automatically gives rise to the possibility of transferring the data to further third parties in an infinite chain of which the data subject would no longer have any trace (see provision of the Guarantor of 23 February 2023, doc. web n. 9870014).
5. CONCLUSIONS
The failure to qualify the roles in relation to the processing of personal data has nullified the opposition expressed by the interested party directly to NCA since the inclusion in the black list declaredly carried out by the latter has not produced any result given that the partners have been able to continue to send promotional communications on behalf of NCA by virtue of a consent allegedly acquired autonomously.
Having said this, the violation of art. 28 of the Regulation is confirmed since the relationships with the data controllers have not been correctly regulated.
Furthermore, it must be remembered that the data controller is required to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to guarantee, and be able to demonstrate, that the processing is carried out in compliance with the Regulation. In this case, however, it does not appear that NCA has adopted particular precautions in entrusting the promotional service to the partners, both with regard to the liability in eligendo and with regard to subsequent interventions in vigilando, demonstrating poor control in the processing aimed at carrying out the promotional campaigns with consequent inability to comply with the obligation to demonstrate compliance with the rules (owner's accountability).
Therefore, the violation of Articles 5, paragraph 2 and 24 of the Regulation is confirmed.
Furthermore, as a result of the framework described, it must be concluded that the promotional communications sent to Mr. XX were not supported by an appropriate consent for promotional processing, as such consent was not correctly documented at the origin and could not be invoked after the complainant had objected to NCA.
For these reasons, the violation of Article 6, paragraph 1, letter a) of the Regulation and Article 130, paragraph 2 of the Code is confirmed.
Finally, it is noted that the complainant had exercised his rights by writing to the DPO's email address on 21 June 2023; although he had not received any error message from the email service, no response to his request was received. Mr. XX would have therefore renewed the sending, on 24 July 2023, writing both to the DPO address and to the addresses protezionedati@noicompriamoauto.it and info@noicompriamoauto.it, receiving, for all three addresses, a message of non-delivery due to blocking by the anti-spam filter. Thus, on the same date, he would have forwarded his requests to the certified email address, finally receiving a response (see reply from Mr. XX of 5 September 2023 attached to the complaint). It follows that the interested party was not allowed to easily exercise his rights and that this right would have been completely precluded if he had not been able to use the certified email. The violation of art. 12, par. 2 of the Regulation is therefore confirmed.
It should be noted, however, that the Company has acknowledged what was contested by the Authority with the act of initiation of the proceeding and has interrupted both the existing contractual relationships and the promotional activity conveyed via email through third parties. 
Therefore, having ascertained the unlawfulness of NCA's conduct with reference to the treatments under examination, taking into account that the non-compliant conduct appears to have been interrupted, there are no grounds for adopting corrective measures against the owner; with regard to the violations that have occurred, it is instead necessary to adopt an injunction order, pursuant to articles 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and 18 of law no. 689/1981, for the application against NCA of the administrative pecuniary sanction provided for by art. 58, paragraph 2, letter i) and 83 of the Regulation. 
In light of the provisions of art. 154-bis, paragraph 3 of the Code, this provision is published on the Authority's website (see also art. 37 of the internal regulation of the Guarantor no. 1/2019).
It is also noted that the conditions set out in art. 17 of the Regulation of the Guarantor no. 1/2019 concerning internal procedures with external relevance, aimed at carrying out the tasks and exercising the powers delegated to the Guarantor, for the annotation of the violations detected here in the internal register of the Authority, provided for by art. 57, paragraph 1, letter u) of the Regulation, are met.
6. INJUNCTION ORDER FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE PECUNIARY ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTION
Based on the above, the various provisions of the Regulation and the Code described above have been violated in relation to connected treatments carried out by NCA, for which reason art. 83, paragraph 3, of the Regulation, according to which, if, in relation to the same processing or to connected processing, a data controller violates, with intent or negligence, several provisions of the Regulation, the total amount of the administrative pecuniary sanction does not exceed the amount specified for the most serious violation, with consequent application of only the sanction provided for by art. 83, par. 5, of the Regulation.
For the purposes of quantifying the administrative sanction, the aforementioned art. 83, par. 5, in setting the maximum amount set by law at 20 million euros or, for companies, at 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year, if higher, specifies the methods of quantifying the aforementioned sanction which must "in any case [be] effective, proportionate and dissuasive" (art. 83, par. 1, of the Regulation), identifying, to this end, a series of elements, listed in par. 2, to be assessed when quantifying the relative amount.
In compliance with this provision, assuming, on the basis of the information found in the latest balance sheet (recorded on 31 December 2023), the occurrence of the first hypothesis provided for by the aforementioned art. 83, par. 5 and therefore quantified at 20 million euros as the maximum applicable fine, the following aggravating circumstances must be considered:
1. the seriousness of the violations since the owner commissioned the promotional activity to third parties without ensuring that they offered suitable guarantees of lawfulness for the processing of personal data (art. 83, par. 2, letter a), of the Regulation);
2. the negligent nature of the violation, since the Company demonstrated serious negligence by disregarding every aspect connected to the protection of the interested parties, entirely delegated to third parties (art. 83, par. 2, letter b), of the Regulation);
As mitigating factors, it is believed that the following can be taken into account:
1. the measures adopted by the data controller to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects, given that NCA has terminated the contracts with the partners and has stopped the promotional activity via email (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter e of the Regulation);
2. the absence of previous proceedings initiated against the Company (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter e of the Regulation);
3. the degree of cooperation with the Supervisory Authority and the measures promptly implemented to put an end to the violations (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter f of the Regulation);
4. the nature of the data processed, consisting of common personal and contact data (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter g of the Regulation).
In an overall perspective of necessary balance between the rights of the data subjects and freedom of enterprise, it is necessary to prudently evaluate the aforementioned criteria, also in order to limit the economic impact of the sanction.
Therefore, it is believed that - based on the set of elements indicated above - the administrative sanction of the payment of a sum of €45,000.00.00 (forty-five thousand/00) equal to 0.23% of the maximum statutory sanction of €20 million should be applied to NCA.
In the case in question, it is believed that the accessory sanction of the publication on the website of the Guarantor of this chapter containing the injunction order, provided for by art. 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and art. 16 of the Guarantor Regulation no. 1/2019, should also be applied.
In implementation of the principles set out in art. 83 of the Regulation, the imposition of this accessory sanction appears proportionate in relation to the seriousness and the particular disvalue of the conduct subject to censure, taking into account the elements of risk for the rights and freedoms of the interested parties (potentially all the interested parties who are recipients of the promotional activity described above).
NOW CONSIDERING ALL THE ABOVE, THE GUARANTOR

pursuant to art. 57, par. 1, letter f), of the Regulation, declares the processing described in the terms of the reasons carried out by Noi Compriamo Auto S.r.l., with registered office in via Perin Del Vaga, 2, Milan, VAT number 08406540966, to be unlawful; consequently

ORDERS
a) pursuant to arts. 154-bis of the Code and 37 of Regulation no. 1/2019, the publication of the injunction order as well as, pursuant to art. 166, paragraph 7, of the Code, the publication of this injunction order on the website of the Guarantor;
b) pursuant to art. 17 of the Guarantor Regulation no. 1/2019, provides for the annotation in the internal register of the Authority, provided for by art. 57, paragraph 1, letter u) of the Regulation, of the violations and the measures adopted.
Pursuant to art. 78 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as arts. 152 of the Code and 10 of Legislative Decree no. 1 September 2011. 150, an appeal against this provision may be lodged with the ordinary judicial authority, with an appeal filed with the ordinary court of the place where the data controller is resident, or, alternatively, with the court of the place of residence of the interested party, within thirty days from the date of communication of the provision itself, or sixty days if the appellant resides abroad.
