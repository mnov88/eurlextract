<p>The Greek DPA held that genealogical research on a family surname did not fall within the scope of Article 15 GDPR, as <i>"personal data concerning [the data subject],"</i> because the data subject requested access to the Directorate's entire database (containing other data subject's personal data), not access to data <i>directly</i> relating to him.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 5 August 2022, the data subject filed a complaint against the Directorate of Primary Education. 
</p><p>The data subject wanted to conduct a genealogical investigation on his family surname. He sent an email to the Directorate of Primary Education (the controller), requesting access to their pupil registration database to search the entries of his surname therein.  In addition, the data subject requested in his complaint that the Authority order the Directorate of Primary Education to allow him immediate research access to the books of the closed/abolished Primary School's curriculum, to research the surname entries in them. The controller replied that they were only able to provide him with numerical data (number of pupils per year) and not the names, as this would be an unlawful disclosure of personal data. 
</p><p>The Authority dismissed the complaint, holding that there was no violation of the data subject's rights and that access requests for research purposes was not within the competence of the Authority to order. In particular, the Authority considered that his request to the controller (Directorate Primary Education) did not constitute an exercise of the right of access to personal data concerning him/her under Article 15 GDPR, but a request to carry out scientific research. 
</p><p>On 26 October 2022, the data subject lodged an objection to the decision and a request for a review of his case, in which he alleged that his request was <i>"not a request to carry out scientific research, but a personal genealogical research, which is far from scientific research and the data in the requested search concern him and thus fall under Article 15 GDPR."</i> 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA rejected the request for review. Genealogical research on a family surname did not fall within the scope of Article 15 GDPR, as <i>"personal data concerning [the data subject]."</i> The data subject's request was not an access request for the purposes of Article 15 GDPR. He requested access to the Directorate's entire database (containing other data subject's personal data), not access to data <i>directly</i> relating to him.

of the filing act, since it has been pointed out that, with regard to personal data

noted that with regard to the processing of personal data of living persons, as it has

to issue an authorisation to the controller in order to provide data
to a researcher or to collect primary sensitive data for historical or
scientific purposes.
Subsequently, the complainant (and already applicant) submitted the present case number
Protocol C/EIS/11343/26-10-2022 objection-request for a review of the case
which has the status of a request for treatment, in which he briefly alleges,
inter alia, the following:
- his application to the complainant is not a request for a scientific
but rather a personal genealogical research, which is far from scientific, and which is not a request for scientific research.
It is not a scientific inquiry.
- the data of the requested search concern him and constitute his right
to access his family's historical past, and he requests a review of the data
and requests its reconsideration.
The Authority, after examining the evidence in the file and after hearing the rapporteur
and the clarifications of the Assistant Rapporteur, who was present without the right to vote,
after a thorough discussion,
HAS CONCLUDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW
1. Because Article 2 para. 8 of Law 3051/2002 on 'Constitutionally

2. Because the above provisions of Article 24 of the Code establish a right

3. As is clear from the content of the application under consideration, the applicant
complains about the legal correctness of the filing act and reiterates
the allegations of his complaint as set out in the background of this
but which have been examined and assessed in the context of the adoption of the
the contested filing act. In any event, the applicant does not plead
or adduce new and substantial evidence in support of his claims, since
the assessment of which could, under the conditions laid down by law, give rise to
a different assessment.
4. In particular, with regard to what is stated in the present application
(treatment) on the jurisdiction of the Authority, the GDPR provides, in principle, for a presumption of
The presumption of compatibility for the processing of personal data for scientific
or historical research (as further processing of data for the purposes of
such purposes is not considered incompatible with the original purposes for which
data were collected) but the controller must, on the basis of the principle

to allow someone to have access to his or her records or to collect
primary data for research or statistical purposes, where the Authority has not

to provide data to a researcher or to primarily collect sensitive data for
historical or scientific purposes. In order for the applicant to have access to
access to specific documents containing his or her personal data, he or she should as
data subject should address the controller by exercising his or her right to access documents by
in an appropriate manner the right of access to personal data concerning him or her
data relating to him or her in accordance with Article 15 of the GDPR.
5. Therefore, the Authority maintains the filing act of 25-10-2022 that
the Authority maintains its decision to terminate the filing order of 25-25-2022 sent to the existing applicant by letter No C/EX/2714/26-10-2022,
the reasons for which are set out below.
