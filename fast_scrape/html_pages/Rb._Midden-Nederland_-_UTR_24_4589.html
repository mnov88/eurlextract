<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 24 January 2023, the data subject made a rectification request to the State Secretary for Justice and Security (controller), regarding a report drafted by the Dutch Child Protection Board (Raad voor de Kinderbescherming, RvdK). The report contained the results of a professional assessment of the data subject’s parenting capacity,  contributing to the subsequent placement of the child under the supervision of child protection services and out of the data subject’s custody.
</p><p>The data subject argued that the report contained factual inaccuracies, misleading terminology (such as “psychiatric issues”, “substance use”), and painted an incorrect picture of her due to the absence of important events in the timeline of the report. 
</p><p>In 16 November 2023, the controller rejected the rectification request. It claimed that the contested data did not qualify as personal data under the GDPR because they were impressions and opinions that had been received in connection with the RvdK's investigation.  
</p><p>The data subject made an objection to the decision of the controller. After the reassessment of the request, some terms were adjusted, e.g. “psychiatric issues” was replaced with “psychological issues”. However, the controller rejected the request in part, maintaining that much of the content reflected professional impressions or third-party statements, mainly the opinion of the father of the child, not subject to rectification under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_16_GDPR" title="Article 16 GDPR">Article 16 GDPR</a>.
</p><p>The data subject filed an appeal before the court of first instance (District Court of Midden-Nederland) against the controller regarding the partial rejection of his request. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The court found that the disputed data did not meet the threshold for rectification.  It held that, from settled case law by the highest administrative court, it follows that not all inaccuracies are eligible for correction under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_16_GDPR" title="Article 16 GDPR">Article 16 GDPR</a>. The inaccuracies must be easy and objective to determine to qualify for rectification. 
</p><p>The court held that the controller was not obliged to amend the report to include certain events mentioned by the data subject or make adjustments to the timeline of the report, because part of the data did not constitute personal data (whether letters/emails have been sent) or others were personal data of third parties (the father's). For the rest, the court found that the desired adjustments regarded impressions, opinions, research results and conclusions of the father, the RvdK and other professionals, which are not eligible for rectification under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_16_GDPR" title="Article 16 GDPR">Article 16 GDPR</a>. The court also found that the term “substance use” is not incorrect, even though the data subject claimed that it was a one-time use and there has been no addiction at this time, because the inaccuracy of this third-party statement is not easy and objective to determine.
</p><p>The court dismissed the appeal as unfounded and found the controller’s refusal to correct other parts of the report lawful, under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_16_GDPR" title="Article 16 GDPR">Article 16 GDPR</a>. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>The District Court's interpretation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_16_GDPR" title="Article 16 GDPR">Article 16 GDPR</a> draws a principled line between verifiable inaccuracies and professional discretion. By limiting rectification to objectively incorrect facts, the Court safeguards the functional autonomy of youth care professionals, whose evaluative judgments, third-party impressions, and contextual assessments are integral to effective intervention. This approach avoids retrospective litigation over subjective observations while maintaining the integrity of social care records.
</p><p>While the Court’s approach protects institutional functionality, it risks reducing data subjects’ agency in challenging recorded narratives that carry legal weight. A balanced application of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_16_GDPR" title="Article 16 GDPR">Article 16 GDPR</a> should neither undermine professional autonomy nor insulate evaluative data from accountability where it materially affects individuals.

CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT
Location: Utrecht
Administrative Law
Case number: UTR 24/4589

Judgment of the single-judge chamber of May 13, 2025, in the case between

[claimant], from [place], claimant
and
the State Secretary for Justice and Security (formerly: the Minister for Legal Protection),
(represented by: Mr. K. Nabibaks and Mr. L.A. van Bergeijk).
Introduction
This judgment concerns the request submitted by the claimant to the Child Protection Council (RvdK) on January 24, 2023, to amend several sections of the RvdK report of October 31, 2022. This report is the outcome of an investigation initiated by the RvdK following a report from the Municipality of Hilversum concerning the claimant's daughter. The State Secretary interpreted the claimant's request as a request for rectification of data as referred to in Article 16, paragraph 1, of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and rejected this request in the decision of November 16, 2023, because the points raised by the claimant do not qualify as personal data as defined in the GDPR. According to the State Secretary, these concerns impressions and opinions received by the Council for the Protection of Personal Data (RvdK) before or during the investigation.
In the contested decision of May 27, 2024, the State Secretary dismissed the claimant's objection, because, in response to her objection, a supplementary note was drawn up by council staff on May 13, 2024, and adjustments were made to the report/timeline. The State Secretary subsequently reassessed the request for rectification in light of this supplementary note. The State Secretary concludes that the timeline now sufficiently demonstrates who provided the information, that it primarily concerns the daughter's father's opinion with which the claimant disagrees, and that the right to rectify the situation is not intended to correct or remove someone else's opinion. Furthermore, the State Secretary—again in response to the claimant's objection—amended the report to remove the term "psychiatric problems." The supplementary note explained that in some places in the report, the term "psychiatric problems" or entire sentences containing that term had been removed or replaced with "mental problems."
The claimant filed an appeal against the contested decision. The State Secretary responded to the appeal with a statement of defense.
The court heard the appeal on April 1, 2025. The claimant, accompanied by her parents: [A] and [B], and the State Secretary's representatives, participated. Court's Assessment
1. The court assesses whether the State Secretary was permitted to reject the plaintiff's request for rectification. It does so based on the plaintiff's grounds for appeal. In these proceedings, the court does not assess whether the daughter's supervision order and out-of-home placement should have been placed based on the report. Nor does the court assess the actions of the guardians/council investigators involved. Furthermore, the court is not required to assess whether the report was prepared correctly.

2. The court dismisses the appeal. The court explains below how it reached this assessment and the consequences of this assessment.

Plaintiff's Position
3. The plaintiff argues – in short – that the report paints an inaccurate picture of her. This is partly because important dates and events are missing from the report's timeline. For example, she states that her daughter's father refused to have contact with their daughter for a long time, while the plaintiff always wanted to involve him. She also refers to an incident she claims occurred in which the father threatened to take her daughter away if she demanded financial support. Furthermore, the claimant disagrees with the report's description of the parenting situation/context regarding her daughter. She lacks the source references and supporting evidence. The report primarily relies on the father's timeline, which outlines his perspective. The dates and events cited by the claimant are missing, even though she has provided or can provide evidence of these. The claimant also disagrees with the terms used in the report, such as psychiatric and/or psychological problems and (drug) addiction and substance use. While the claimant did have an eating disorder for which she was hospitalized, this problem was no longer present at the time of the investigation (and the report). Furthermore, there is no evidence of drug addiction and/or substance use, as evidenced by her general practitioner's statement. Therefore, these and similar terms should be removed from the report. Because there is no evidence of mental health problems or addiction, her daughter is not a KOPP child (children of a parent with mental health problems). This term is therefore being used incorrectly. According to the plaintiff, this has resulted in an unbalanced report, with a negative image of the plaintiff. The consequences of this incorrect report are significant. Her daughter was first placed under supervision at the end of 2022 and then placed out of home in mid-2023. The plaintiff's daughter now lives entirely with her father and no longer has any contact with the plaintiff.

Judgment of the Court
4. The court finds that the GDPR does not provide grounds to correct the points raised by the plaintiff. This is due to the following.

5. Pursuant to Article 16 of the GDPR, a data subject has the right to rectification. This means that the data subject (in this case, the plaintiff) can ask the controller (in this case, the State Secretary) to rectify (amend) personal data if it is inaccurate or incomplete. The data subject can then ask the controller to amend or supplement the data.

6. To be eligible for correction under the GDPR, it is first necessary that the data in question is personal data. Article 4 of the GDPR stipulates that the term "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, and that an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

7. Established case law of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State, the highest administrative court, shows that not all inaccuracies are eligible for correction under the GDPR. Inaccuracies must be easily and objectively identifiable to be eligible for correction. Furthermore, the right to rectification, as stipulated in Article 16 of the GDPR, is not intended to correct or erase impressions, opinions, research results, and conclusions with which the data subject disagrees.1

8. Below, the court addresses the main issues raised by the claimant and discussed at the hearing.

The timeline in the report
9. At the hearing, it was discussed that the timeline included in the report primarily shows the father's timeline and the claimant's response to it. The court notes that the claimant responded extensively to the draft report and the timeline contained therein at the time, and also mentioned various dates and events in addition to it. These dates and events were not supplemented in the timeline of the final report of the Council for the Protection of Children (RvdK). The claimant's response is only included as an appendix to the report. The timeline is revised in the contested decision, but primarily because the information included in the timeline was not processed in accordance with the RvdK's methodology. A large number of the events mentioned by the claimant were not included, despite her regularly referring to these events and explaining why she believes they are important for understanding the context and history. At the hearing, it did not become clear why the decision was made not to add these events to the timeline. This was also not explained otherwise. The court understands that this course of events gives the claimant the impression that an unequal picture is being painted.

10. However, this does not mean that the State Secretary was required to make the requested amendments and additions to the report pursuant to Article 16 of the GDPR. Some of the requested amendments do not concern personal data. For example, whether letters/emails with content cited by the claimant were sent. Other requested amendments do not concern the claimant's personal data, but those of others, such as the father. Otherwise, the court notes that the requested amendments primarily relate to the impressions, opinions, research results, and conclusions of the father, the Council for the Protection of Children (RvdK), or informants consulted during the investigation. For example, the court points to the statement that the daughter allegedly found the accrual at her mother's home excessive, or the plaintiff's assertion that it is incorrectly stated that the daughter lived with her grandparents, because it was only supposed to have been overnight stays. This information does not contain any inaccuracies that can be easily and objectively determined.

The term substance use
11. The court finds that when the report refers to substance use/drug use by the claimant, this constitutes personal data within the meaning of the GDPR. However, the court concludes that these terms are not used incorrectly. The claimant claims to have used drugs (ketamine) on one occasion. In that respect, the use of the terms substance use or drug use in relation to the claimant is not incorrect. The court notes that the revised timeline also includes the claimant's report that the use occurred on a single occasion. At another point in the timeline, the claimant also stated that the use involved medication.

12. Insofar as the report states that Ms. [C] stated that the claimant used ketamine several times in the summer of 2021, rather than once, this is not subject to correction because the inaccuracy of this third-party statement cannot be easily and objectively established. The court further notes that the report also states that Ms. [C] stated that the plaintiff used this as self-medication and that there was no current or past history of addiction, and that this therefore played no role in her actions. Elsewhere in the report, it is also stated that the plaintiff does not have an addiction.

The terms psychiatric and/or psychological problems
13. The court notes that several adjustments were made to the report with the supplementary statement. In several places in the report, the term "psychiatric problems" was replaced by "psychological problems," or the relevant sentences were deleted entirely. At the hearing, the State Secretary acknowledged that this correction occurred during the objection phase and that the plaintiff's objection was wrongly dismissed in that respect. While this does indicate a flaw in the contested decision, the court sees reason to disregard this flaw. Pursuant to Article 6:22 of the General Administrative Law Act (Awb), an appealed decision may be upheld by the court, despite a violation of a written or unwritten legal rule or general principle, if it is plausible that the interested party has not been disadvantaged as a result. In this case, the court only concerns the final judgment of the contested decision. The (substantive) content of the contested decision remains the same, and no legal costs were incurred during the objection phase. The court therefore finds that the claimant's interests have not been harmed by the incorrect final judgment.

14. The court upholds the State Secretary's judgment that a further rectification is not necessary. It is not incorrect that the report and the supplementary statement still refer to psychological problems because this concerns the claimant's eating disorder (in remission). It is also undisputed that she suffered from this eating disorder.

15. The foregoing means that the deficiency does not lead to the conclusion that the appeal is well-founded. The contested decision is upheld.

Conclusion and consequences
The appeal is unfounded. This means that the State Secretary is not required to rectify the report (further). Given the deficiency identified, the court finds grounds to order the State Secretary to reimburse the plaintiff for the court fees. No eligible legal costs have been identified.
Decision
The court:
-
declares the appeal unfounded;
-
orders the State Secretary to reimburse the plaintiff for the court fees of €187.

This decision was rendered by Mr. P.J. Blok, judge, in the presence of Mr. K.E. Pruntel, court clerk.
Pronounced in open court on May 13, 2025.
