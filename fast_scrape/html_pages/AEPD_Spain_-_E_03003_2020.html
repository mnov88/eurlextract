       Responsible for Security and the rest of the accounts of
       administrator on all systems.

       It is verified that there has been no encryption, but a process is detected
       weird running on some servers so they stop
       immediately its execution.

       It is detected that one of the servers has a fraudulent active connection due to
       which proceeds to turn it off and closes the Internet connection in the
       Firewall as a precautionary measure.

       Throughout the week, a forensic analysis of the
       intrusion and compromised machines are recovered.

       Admin passwords are changed twice again
       consecutive as an additional precautionary measure.

       No anomalous accesses or generation of fraudulent users are detected.

        password.
     On Wednesday, February 12, they proceed to notify the AEPD of the gap in

        security due to the type of information found on the servers
        affected, although there is no evidence that data has been compromised
        personal, for this reason they decide not to communicate the gap to possible
        affected.

       It is decided to report the facts to the Ertzaintza (annex 19).

     This Firewall allowed the attempt to connect via remote desktop with a
        administrator password that was detected to be weak and that the hack was

        he must have used a password cracking technique and later be able to
        connect to the rest of the computers.
