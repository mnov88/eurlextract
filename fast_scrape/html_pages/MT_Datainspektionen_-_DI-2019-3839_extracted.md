Okay, let's start by going through the provided content step by step to extract the required information. The user wants exactly 22 lines of answers based on specific questions about a GDPR case handled by Datainspektionen in Sweden.

First, I need to identify the country of the DPA. The authority is mentioned as "Datainspektionen (Sweden)", so the answer for question 1 should be "SE".

Next, the full name of the deciding authority is clearly stated as "Datainspektionen" in the case information section.

The date of the decision is given as "02.12.2020", which needs to be converted into YYYY-MM-DD format, so that's "2020-12-02".

For question 4, it asks if this case is an appeal of a prior decision. The content mentions "Appeal: Not appealed", so the answer here is "N".

The relevant GDPR articles are listed in the case information as Articles 5(1)(f), 5(2), 32(1), and 32(2) GDPR. These should be listed in the answer separated by commas.

The violation was found, so question 7 would list the same articles since they were deemed violated.

There's no explicit finding of no infringement mentioned, so answer 8 is "N".

For sanctions, a fine of 4,000,000 SEK was imposed. The type is "Fine", and the amount is 4000000 with currency code "SEK".

The number of defendants is one: "Styrelsen för Karolinska Universitetssjukhuset". Their role is "controller" as they are the data controller in this case.

For SNA, the defendant's institutional identity isn't explicitly mentioned, but since it's a university hospital, I might need to infer or note that it's not provided. However, looking back, the content doesn't specify an SNA code, so maybe "N_A" or leave it as unknown. Wait, the user instructions say for question 15 and 16, if must be inferred. But in this case, there's no mention of SNA or ISIC codes, so perhaps answer with "UNKNOWN".

The economic sector is healthcare, which under ISIC Rev.4 would be code 86 (Health and social work). The description might be "Health and social work" at level 2.

For the top-level category of the primary defendant, since it's a university hospital, that falls under "BUSINESS".

Now, compiling all these into the required format with exactly 17 lines. Wait, the user mentioned 22 lines but in the example there are 17 questions. Let me check again.

Wait, looking back at the initial instructions, the user provided 17 questions (from Q1 to Q17), so the answer should be 17 lines. The user might have made a typo saying 22 lines, but according to the format given in the example, it's 17 lines. So I need to make sure each of the 17 answers is correctly filled out based on the content.
