<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 9 August 2019, the data subject lodged a complaint with the police regarding the theft of their wallet. On 20 August 2019, someone purchased a vehicle with the data subject's ID. On 20 January 2020, the vehicle was reported for driving without the compulsory insurance. As a consequence, Dirección General de Tráfico (national traffic department, also known as DGT) (the controller) notified the previous owner the start of the sanctioning procedure. On 31 January 2020, the new owner (with the documentation of the data subject) filed for the change of ownership with the controller. In August 2020, the data subject received a traffic ticket related to the lack of compulsory insurance. On 13 August 2020, the data subject lodged a new complaint with the police, stating that someone had tried to register a car under their name and that they had received notification of a traffic offence.
</p><p>The data subject submitted a complaint to the Spanish DPA stating that the controller did not carry out any checks to validate the change of ownership, allowing the change despite the existence of an outstanding debt on the vehicle. They also alleged that the controller processed their data without a legitimate basis.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA held that there was a legal basis to process the data: the documentation was required under the General Vehicle Regulation for the notification of the sale of the vehicle (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(c) GDPR</a>), and, the entry in the vehicle register was made in the performance of a contract to which the data subject was a party (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article (6)(1)(b) GDPR</a>).
</p><p>The DPA also found no lack of diligence on part of the controller in verifying the identity of the data subject, since the General Vehicle Regulation did not require verification or comparison of signatures, and the traffic official did not have the capacity or possibility to verify them.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>The fact that the processing of the controller relied on <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article (6)(1)(b) GDPR</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(c) GDPR</a> as legal basis affects the holding of the DPA since in <a href="/index.php?title=AEPD_(Spain)_-_PS/00126/2021" title="AEPD (Spain) - PS/00126/2021">PS/00126/2021</a> the Spanish DPA held: "<i>if there is a fraudulent contracting of a product and the consent to perfect such contract has been given by a person other than the data subject (impersonation), we cannot understand that there is contractual consent on the part of the latter, who is harmed. In legal terms, we can consider that in this situation of fraud the legal business would not have been perfected, which would determine the inexistence of legitimacy to process the personal data of the data subject. This is because, once the contract has been signed, the legal basis for the processing that legitimizes the contractor as data controller to process the personal data of the data subject in a product contract would be the one provided for in art. 6.1.b) of the GDPR.</i>"

there is contractual consent on the part of the latter who is harmed. (...)
in this situation of fraud the legal business would not have been perfected, which
would determine the lack of legitimacy to process the personal data of the
interested."

LOPDGDD, the claim presented by the claimant party was admitted for processing.



                            FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

                                            Yo

investigation actions the Director of the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data.


Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures

in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with character

subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

                                            II

Article 6 of the GDPR, Lawfulness of the treatment, establishes in point 1 that:


       "1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following is fulfilled
       conditions:
       a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his data
       personal for one or more specific purposes;

       pursued by the data controller or by a third party, provided that

       such interests are not overridden by the interests or the rights and freedoms
       of the interested party that require the protection of personal data,
       in particular when the interested party is a child.

       The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the

       processing carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their
       functions.”

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/10








 On the other hand, article 4 of the GDPR, Definitions, in its sections 1, 2 and 11,
notes that:


       “1) “personal data” means any information about an identified natural person
       or identifiable ("the data subject"); Any identifiable natural person shall be considered
       person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in
       by means of an identifier, such as a name, a number
       identification, location data, an online identifier, or one or more
       elements of physical, physiological, genetic, psychological,

       economic, cultural or social of said person; “

       2) "processing": any operation or set of operations carried out
       about personal data or sets of personal data, either by
       automated procedures or not, such as the collection, registration, organization,

       structuring, conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation,
       use, communication by transmission, diffusion or any other form of
       authorization of access, comparison or interconnection, limitation, deletion or
       destruction; “

       specific, informed and unequivocal for which the interested party accepts, either
       by means of a declaration or a clear affirmative action, the processing of data
       personal matters that concern you."

In the present case, the DGT, as data controller, processed

the personal data of the claiming party, by registering their name in the Registry
General de Vehículos a vehicle, although it cannot be affirmed that said treatment is
carried out without legitimacy for it, as claimed by the claimant, since,
as established by Royal Decree 2822/1998, of December 23, by which
approves the General Regulation of Vehicles in its article 32:

       "1. Any natural or legal person who owns a vehicle registered

       Vehicle Registration.

       Traffic Department to the purchaser (...)


For its part, Annex XIV of the aforementioned Regulation establishes:

Likewise, and in terms of documents referring to identity and representation,

       photocopies of the same that the interested parties or their representatives must
       provide at the time of submitting your application, provided they are
       duly collated by the records of the bodies in which the
       submitted the corresponding application, in accordance with the provisions of the

       Article 38.4 a) and b) of Law 30/1992, of November 26, on the
       Legal of Public Administrations and Administrative Procedure
       Common, without prejudice to the possibility of exercising this function by

       Municipal, will be signed by the Head of the Agency or Entity to which
       belongs to the vehicle or person to whom it delegates, accompanied by the
       required documentation."

Bearing in mind that the Provincial Traffic Headquarters of Valencia presented
a request for notification of sale of the vehicle, which was accompanied by the

documentation required in the General Vehicle Regulations to carry out said
procedure, including a sales contract where the seller is identified
and the buyer, it cannot be affirmed that the DGT has incurred in an illegitimate treatment
of data of the claimant, since the registration in the Vehicle Registry
is carried out in compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the person responsible for the
treatment, and, likewise, based on the execution of a contract in which the

interested is part.

                                          II

The complaining party adds that the DGT did not act with due diligence as it had not
verified if the identification of the complaining party was correctly carried out.
However, having analyzed in the previous section the articles of the Regulation of

Vehicles applicable to the notification of sale, it must be concluded that, in the notification
of sale, the aforementioned legal text does not require verification and collation of signatures, given
also note that it is not necessary for the buyer and the seller to meet
at the same time at the Traffic Headquarters, since according to Annex XIV of the
aforementioned Regulation, with regard to the figure of the acquirer:


       "B) Obligations of the purchaser:
       In accordance with the provisions of article 32, section 3 of this Regulation,
       the purchaser of a vehicle must, within thirty days from the date

       of its acquisition, request from the Traffic Department the renewal of the permit or
       driving license, presenting the following documents:
       1st Application in official model form that will be provided by the Traffic Headquarters,

       in which the identity and address of the transferor and acquirer is stated.
       2nd Rate or rates for the legally established amount.
       3rd The documents that on the identity and representation are specified in
       section A, numbers 1 and 3 of annex XIII, on registration.
       4th technical inspection card or certificate of characteristics, with
       valid recognition.

       5th Original of the self-assessment of the Transfer Tax
       Patrimonial and Documented Legal Acts, or proof of the exemption or
       not subject to it, and photocopy.
       6th Self-assessment of the Special Tax on Certain Means of
       Transportation or justification of non-subjection or exemption in cases of

       transmission of a vehicle before four years have elapsed since its
       first definitive registration with exemption or non-subjection.
       7th Form of registration in the Tax on Mechanical Traction Vehicles.
       8th Original and photocopy of proof of payment or exemption from Tax on
       Mechanical Traction Vehicles, in the event that the transferor has not

       section 1 of this Regulation.
       9th Document proving the acquisition, except in the case that the seller
       and the buyer submit their applications jointly.”

Therefore, lack of diligence cannot be imputed, beyond the verification that

Provide all the documentation required in the Vehicle Regulations to carry out the
corresponding procedure. If the documentation presented is fraudulent, you do not have the
acting official capacity or possibility of verifying it.

                                           IV.


Therefore, based on what is indicated in the previous paragraphs, no
Evidence proving the existence of an infringement in the area of competence of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency.
