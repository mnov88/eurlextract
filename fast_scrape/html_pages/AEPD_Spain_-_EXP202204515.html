<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject received non-consensual correspondence in the form of calls, which were presumed to be from Xfera Móviles S.A., also known as YOIGO (the controller), a telecommunications provider that the data subject was a customer of. 
</p><p>The data subject contacted the Data Protection Officer of the company via email, and informed them that he did not wish to receive such correspondence. The data subject was informed that not all the calls originated from the controller or its agencies, and that, relating to the one call that was, his number would be placed on the controller's opt-out marketing list to prevent any further correspondence. 
</p><p>Commercial text messages from the controller were then sent to the data subject, leading to the data subject once again emailing and being reassured that he would be placed on the opt-out list, only for him to receive more text messages, and resulting in another email being sent to the controller by the data subject.
</p><p>The data subject submitted a complaint to the Spanish DPA, providing copies of the text messages as evidence. 
</p><p>The controller responded to the complaint, stating that the data subject had been included in the opt-out databases; however, it was in the opt-out database for non-customers, not for customers. They also confirmed that the call he had received had been from the controller's customer phone line. Finally, the controller stated that it updated the customer database to reflect the data subject’s preference.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA held that although there was a contractual relationship between the data subject and the controller, the data subject had continued to receive marketing correspondence even after his request for it to cease. The DPA referred to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.global-regulation.com/translation/spain/1450967/law-34-2002%252c-of-11-july%252c-services-of-the-society-of-information-and-electronic-commerce.html">Article 21 LSSI</a>, the national law on information society services. This provision prohibits the sending of advertising or promotional communications by e-mail or other equivalent electronic means of communication that has not previously been requested or expressly authorized by the recipients. 
</p><p>Therefore, the DPA fined the controller €5,000, which, due to their voluntary payment rather than engaging in litigation, was reduced to €3,000.
