<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject was a judge working at the Austrian Federal Administrative Court. An internal judicial body – the controller – opened a disciplinary investigation concerning the data subject’s performance at work, including the latter’s mental health. The disciplinary body concluded the investigation with a final report and an evaluation of the data subject, which were subsequently notified to them.
</p><p>The data subject brought action against the controller for violation of Articles 5(1)(a) to (c), 6 and 9 GDPR. According to the data subject, the investigation would have been hampered by many inadequacies and investigative mistakes in the processing of their personal data. In particular, the controller would have picked and chosen pieces of evidence, deliberately ignoring fundamental elements.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Austrian Federal Administrative Court dismissed the data subject’s claim. According to the judges, data protection law cannot override the rules delimiting jurisdictions. A review of the investigation methods by the Federal Administrative Court would encroach upon the competence of the disciplinary body, which is a judicial body as well. In other words, a data subject cannot use data protection law to limit the investigative powers of a judicial body whose jurisdiction is subject to.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>This judgement suggests that data protection principles cannot be used as an additional or alternative system of appeal of judicial decisions. However, the court's decision is not uncontroversial, as judicial bodies are not excluded from the scope of application of the GDPR.

Reasons for decision:

I. Procedure: Roman one. Procedure:

1. In his complaint initiating the proceedings pursuant to Art. 130 Para. 2a B-VG of March 9th, 2022 to the Federal Administrative Court, XXXX (complainant) alleged a violation of the fundamental right to secrecy pursuant to Section 1 Para Data in accordance with Art. 5 GDPR and against the legality of the processing in accordance with Art. 6 and 9 GDPR based on the data processing in connection with or in the decision of the Personnel Senate of the Federal Administrative Court (respondent) of March 3rd, 2021 regarding the determination of the overall assessment, issued by the notification pursuant to Section 55 (1) RStDG on March 8th, 2021, Zl. 2021-0.010.0014, which was sent to him on March 12th, 2021. 1. In his complaint initiating the proceedings in accordance with Article 130, paragraph 2 a, B-VG of March 9th, 2022 to the Federal Administrative Court, roman XXXX (complainant) alleged a violation of the fundamental right to secrecy in accordance with paragraph one, paragraph one, DSG, against the principles for the processing of personal data in accordance with Article 5 GDPR and against the lawfulness of the processing in accordance with Articles 6 and 9 GDPR due to the data processing in connection with or in the decision of the Personnel Senate of the Federal Administrative Court (respondent) of March 3rd, 2021 regarding the determination of the overall assessment, issued by the notification pursuant to paragraph 55, paragraph one, RStDG on March 8th, 2021, Zl. 2021-0.010.0014, which was sent to him on March 12th, 2021.

In justification, the complainant stated (summarized as far as relevant to the procedure) that he was a judge at the Federal Administrative Court and that the respondent had again carried out a service description for the year 2020, whereby this (qualified) breach of data protection obligations and thereby violated his right to secrecy. The respondent is the person responsible within the meaning of Art. 4 Z 7 GDPR for the data processing measures complained of, which would have led to the complainant's service description for 2020. Even the initiation resolution lacks legal conformity, on the one hand because both the President and the Vice President are members of the staff senate, and on the other hand because there is a lack of a legal basis. In particular, the President of the Federal Administrative Court had ordered unlawful, covert investigative measures (search of his office) for disciplinary proceedings directed against the complainant. In particular, it emerged that the data processing measures ordered were not commissioned within a constitutional process, but by a political leader. A hearing of the Complainant before the Respondent was also decisively incorrectly recorded. It also follows from this that the investigative proceedings were selective and one-sided, several documents provided by the complainant, as well as a statement to be obtained from the disciplinary lawyer in the parallel disciplinary proceedings, were ignored. The Respondent had made statements about the (mental) state of health of the Complainant which he could easily have refuted and he would have been willing to submit an expert opinion he had obtained privately as evidence to the contrary. In addition, the Respondent failed to make a cross-comparison, which would have been necessary. On March 3rd, 2021, the Human Resources Senate finally determined an overall assessment and sent this to the complainant with a notification dated March 8th. 2021 (GZ: 2021-0.010.0014). The complainant explained (summarized as far as relevant to the procedure) that he was a judge of the Federal Administrative Court and that the respondent had again carried out a service description for the year 2020, whereby this (qualified) against violated data protection obligations and thereby violated his right to secrecy. The respondent is the person responsible within the meaning of Article 4, Paragraph 7, GDPR for the data processing measures complained of, which would have led to the complainant's service description for 2020. Even the initiation resolution lacks legal conformity, on the one hand because both the President and the Vice President are members of the staff senate, and on the other hand because there is a lack of a legal basis. In particular, the President of the Federal Administrative Court had ordered unlawful, covert investigative measures (search of his office) for disciplinary proceedings directed against the complainant. In particular, it turned out that the ordered data processing measures had not been commissioned within a constitutional procedure, but by a political leader. A hearing of the Complainant before the Respondent was also decisively incorrectly recorded. It also follows from this that the investigative proceedings were selective and one-sided, several documents provided by the complainant, as well as a statement to be obtained from the disciplinary lawyer in the parallel disciplinary proceedings, were ignored. The Respondent had made statements about the (mental) state of health of the Complainant which he could easily have refuted and he would have been willing to submit an expert opinion he had obtained privately as evidence to the contrary. In addition, the Respondent failed to make a cross-comparison, which would have been necessary. On March 3rd, 2021, the Human Resources Senate finally determined an overall assessment and sent this to the complainant with a notification dated March 8th. 2021 (GZ: 2021-0.010.0014) brought to the attention.

The complainant listed a number of alleged investigative errors in connection with statements made by the respondent in the service description for 2020 and stated that evidence had not been taken into account, although this would have been obligatory (procedurally). As a violation of his fundamental right to data protection, the complainant complained in particular that the respondent acted arbitrarily and had not taken up offers of evidence without justification, had used other evidence, had unilaterally investigated selectively and had misjudged his mental health.

For these reasons, the complainant applied for a violation to be determined in accordance with Section 1 (1) DSG, since the data processing would violate the principles of Article 5 (1) lit. a, lit. b and lit. c GDPR and therefore not from a justification according to Art. 6 and 9 DSGVO would be borne and to conduct an oral hearing. For these reasons, the complainant applied for a violation to be determined in accordance with paragraph one, paragraph one, DSG, since the data processing would violate the principles of Article 5, paragraph one, litera, litera b and litera c, GDPR and therefore not from a justification would be borne according to Articles 6 and 9 GDPR and to conduct an oral hearing.

Attached to the complaint were two disciplinary notices, a list of the basis for the decision ("source material") for the job description, an occupational medical report by the complainant and a statement by the expert.

2. At the request of the Federal Administrative Court, the Respondent commented and essentially stated that the alleged unlawful search of the complainant's office had not taken place, which had also been established. Irrespective of the fact that the content of the presentation of the facts is disputed, the Respondent did not collect any health data on the complainant. In addition, data protection proceedings regarding the disciplinary proceedings against the complainant had not been decided or the alleged illegality had not been established. Furthermore, the complainant's complaint turned out to be time-limited, since he complained about data processing of which he was aware more than a year before the complaint was lodged.

3. In the hearing granted to the parties, the complainant contradicted the defense of the time limit and stated that the respondent conceded to processing the complainant's health data when he said that statements from the service description were based on direct perceptions by members of the respondent. In any case, a closer look shows that the data processing based on the disciplinary complaint is not independent of the investigative activity of the respondent. Furthermore, the complainant requested, to prove that the respondent would not have been competent to carry out a new job description, to obtain the corresponding application from the President of the Federal Administrative Court.

4. With the order of January 27, 2023, the file was transferred to the now responsible court department W298.

4. At the request of the President of the Federal Administrative Court, a procedure for the complainant's renewed job description for 2020 was initiated.

5. On March 3, 2021, a hearing was held before the meeting of the respondent's members. At this point in time at the latest, the complainant was aware that the respondent was using the following data or sources in this decision-making process:

6. With the decision of the respondent to Zl.: 2021-0.10.0014 of March 8th, 2021, the complainant's new job description for the year 2020 was made with the overall assessment according to § 54 Para. 3 RStDG "Very good".6. With the decision of the respondent to Zl.: 2021-0.10.0014 of March 8th, 2021, the complainant's new job description for the year 2020 was made with the overall assessment according to paragraph 54, paragraph 3, RStDG "Very good".

The notification of the overall assessment was sent to the complainant on March 12, 2021.

7. On March 9, 2022, the complainant lodged the complaint at issue with the Federal Administrative Court.

III. Evaluation of evidence: Roman III. Evidence assessment:

The determination of the date of delivery of the new job description for 2020 to the complainant results from the return receipt in the file.

4) Process Requirements

4.1. jurisdiction

The Respondent is a legally established collegial body consisting of the President, the Vice-President and five members elected by the General Assembly of the members of the Federal Administrative Court. The Respondent decides as a collegial body on the tasks assigned to him under Section V of the RStDG. (cf. § 48 Para. 1 RStDG) The creation of a job description according to §§ 51 ff. RStDG for a judge of the Federal Administrative Court is a statutory task of the Personnel Senate. The Respondent is a legally established collegial body consisting of the President, the Vice-President and five members elected by the General Assembly of the members of the Federal Administrative Court. The Respondent decides in the five according to him. Section of the RStDG assigned tasks as a collegial body. compare paragraph 48, paragraph one, RStDG) The creation of a job description according to paragraphs 51, ff. RStDG for a judge of the Federal Administrative Court is a statutory task of the personnel senate.

In its decision of October 28, 2021, Ro 2021/09/0007, with reference to the previous case law of the Constitutional Court of March 1, 2012, B 743/11, VfSlg. 19.618, as well as VwGH 14.06.1995, 95/12/0051 pronounced that a service description according to the RStDG is to be qualified as a decision of the respondent against which the appeal of the revision to the Administrative Court is available. The more recent case law of the courts of public law also shows that an appeal is (in principle) permissible against a decision made by the respondent as in the present case (cf. VwGH 28.11.2022, Ro 2021/09/0014 and VfGH 07.03.2023 , G 282/83/2022, Rn 35). In its decision of October 28, 2021, Ro 2021/09/0007, with reference to the previous case law of the Constitutional Court of March 01, 2012, B 743/11, VfSlg. 19.618, as well as VwGH 14.06.1995, 95/12/0051 pronounced that a service description according to the RStDG is to be qualified as a decision of the respondent against which the appeal of the revision to the Administrative Court is available. The more recent case law of the courts of public law also shows that an appeal is (in principle) permissible against a decision made by the respondent as in the present case, compare VwGH 28.11.2022, Ro 2021/09/0014 and VfGH 07.03.2023, G 282/83/2022, para. 35).

It follows that the Federal Administrative Court has jurisdiction within the meaning of Art. 130 Para. 2a B-VG with regard to the present complaint, which is directed against a court decision 130, paragraph 2 a, B-VG with regard to the present complaint, which is directed against a court decision.

4.2. timeliness of the complaint

Pursuant to Art. 130 Para. 2a B-VG in conjunction with Section 85 Para has become aware of the decision or the process, is to be submitted to the competent court. According to article 130, paragraph 2 a, B-VG in conjunction with paragraph 85, paragraph 4, GOG, a data protection complaint about an alleged infringement by an organ of an administrative court in the exercise of judicial independence must be lodged within one year from the day on which the person concerned has become aware of the decision or the process is to be submitted to the competent court.

In the complaint that is the subject of the proceedings, the complainant complains of unlawful data processing by the respondent in the course of the procedure for the service description for the year 2020. Since the respondent's decision regarding the complainant's service description (by sending the notification of the overall assessment in accordance with Section 55 (1) RStDG) became known on March 12, 2021, the complaint lodged against it (within the one-year preclusion period on March 9, 2022) has proven to be timely. In the complaint that is the subject of the proceedings, the complainant complains of unlawful data processing by the respondent in the course of the procedure for the service description for the year 2020. Since the respondent's decision regarding the complainant's service description (by sending the notification of the overall assessment in accordance with paragraph 55, paragraph one, RStDG ) became known on March 12, 2021, the complaint against it (within the one-year preclusion period on March 9, 2022) has proven to be timely.

5) In the matter

The complaint is unfounded:

According to the RStDG, the respondent is responsible for carrying out job descriptions for judges of the Federal Administrative Court. In the case at hand, he also acted within the scope of his legal authorization or obligation when he carried out a new job description for the calendar year 2020 in the case of the complainant.

On this basis, the complainant's complaint does not reveal what a data protection violation should be based on.

The complaint is directed against the activities of the Personnel Senate of the Federal Administrative Court as the competent judicial body.

The complainant believes that the decision of the respondent violates his fundamental right to data protection in accordance with Section 1 (1) DSG due to unlawful data acquisition or data processing, since the principles of data processing in accordance with Section 4 (1) DSG in conjunction with Article 5 (1) 1 lit. b) GDPR had not been complied with Paragraph 4, paragraph one, DSG in connection with Article 5, paragraph one, litera b,) GDPR have not been complied with.

However, it must be countered that if it is conceivable that the type and content of the data determined by a judicial body is suitable for determining the relevant facts, the determination is permissible from a data protection point of view. Claiming a more in-depth assessment of the suitability of the chosen investigative steps would interfere with the factual competence of the body actually responsible for the content. As a result, this would lead to the fact that the (fine) data protection control in the preliminary proceedings is inadmissibly in breach of the right to a procedure before the statutory judge, which can be derived from the principle of precise delimitation of responsibility according to objective criteria (VfSlg. 3156, 8349), in exact (VfSlg. 9937, 10.311) and clearly (VfSlg. 11.288, 13.029, 13.816).

But nothing else is the aim of the complainant:

The complainant would like to know that the Personnel Senate of the Federal Administrative Court is restricted in the exercise of the statutory tasks assigned to it due to data protection barriers in such a way that the Senate of the Federal Administrative Court that recognizes this prohibits the Personnel Senate of the Federal Administrative Court from certain investigative steps and data processing. However, there is no room for this, especially with regard to the guarantees of Art. 6 ECHR and the associated risk that legal matters would be unduly withdrawn from the competent judicial body. Because in the present case, contrary to the statutory order, the judging senate would take the place of the personnel senate of the Federal Administrative Court if it were only to declare certain investigative activities permissible. As a result, the data protection complaint in question aims inadmissibly to influence, correct or control the (main) judicial proceedings regarding the complainant's service description. However, a complaint pursuant to Sections 84 and 85 GOG does not serve this purpose (see Fellner/Nogratnig, RStDG, GOG and StAG II5.01 Section 84 GOG [as of February 1, 2022, rdb.at], RZ 5, with reference to OGH February 23 .2016, 6 Ob 225/15d). The complainant would like to know that the Personnel Senate of the Federal Administrative Court is restricted in the exercise of the statutory tasks assigned to it due to data protection barriers in such a way that the Senate of the Federal Administrative Court recognizing here instructs the Personnel Senate of the Federal Administrative Court to carry out certain investigative steps and Data processing prohibited. However, there is no room for this, especially with regard to the guarantees of Article 6, ECHR and the associated risk that legal matters would be inadmissibly withdrawn from the competent judicial body. Because in the present case, contrary to the statutory order, the judging senate would take the place of the personnel senate of the Federal Administrative Court if it were only to declare certain investigative activities permissible. As a result, the data protection complaint in question aims inadmissibly to influence, correct or control the (main) judicial proceedings regarding the complainant's service description. However, a complaint pursuant to Sections 84 and 85 GOG does not serve this purpose (see Fellner/Nogratnig, RStDG, GOG and StAG II5.01 Section 84, GOG [status 02/01/2022, rdb.at], RZ 5, with reference to OGH 02/23 .2016, 6 Ob 225/15d).

The Respondent has used data that are suitable in terms of their type and content for determining the relevant facts, in concrete terms for creating a service description, in accordance with the procedural laws, which is why the use of the data from a data protection point of view is not objectionable - is permissible. The complaint did not give any other indication that the respondent violated any mandatory data processing principles.

Against this background, the present complaint cannot succeed.

6) Carrying out an oral hearing:

Pursuant to Section 24 (1) VwGVG, the administrative court shall hold a public oral hearing upon application or, if it deems it necessary, ex officio reserves the right to hold a public oral hearing ex officio.

Pursuant to Section 24 (4) VwGVG, the administrative court can - insofar as nothing else is determined by federal or state law - refrain from a hearing, regardless of a party's application, if the files indicate that the oral discussion does not give reason to expect any further clarification of the legal matter, and neither Art. 6 Para. 1 ECHR nor Art. 47 GRC stand in the way of the omission of the hearing. According to paragraph 24, paragraph 4, VwGVG - unless otherwise provided by federal or state law - the administrative court can refrain from a hearing regardless of a party's application, if the files indicate that further clarification of the case cannot be expected from the oral discussion, and if neither Article 6, paragraph 1, ECHR nor Article 47 CFR preclude the omission of the hearing.

In the present case, the omission of an oral hearing could be based on the fact that the facts had been clarified from the file situation. The use of further evidence was not necessary to clarify the facts.

It was therefore not necessary to conduct an oral hearing.

to B)

Pursuant to § 25a Para. 1 VwGG, the administrative court has to pronounce in its ruling or decision whether the revision is admissible according to Art. 133 Para. 4 B-VG. The verdict must be briefly reasoned. According to paragraph 25 a, paragraph one, VwGG, the administrative court has to pronounce in its ruling or decision whether the revision is permissible according to Article 133, paragraph 4, B-VG. The statement must be briefly justified.

According to Art. 133 para. 4 B-VG, the revision is not permitted because the decision does not depend on the solution of a legal question that is of fundamental importance. The present decision neither deviates from the previous case law of the Administrative Court, nor is there any case law; Furthermore, the case law of the Administrative Court is not to be judged as inconsistent. There are also no other indications of a fundamental importance of the legal question to be solved. The revision is not permitted according to Article 133, paragraph 4, B-VG because the decision does not depend on the solution of a legal question that is of fundamental importance. The present decision neither deviates from the previous case law of the Administrative Court, nor is there any case law; Furthermore, the case law of the Administrative Court is not to be judged as inconsistent. There are also no other indications of a fundamental importance of the legal question to be solved.
