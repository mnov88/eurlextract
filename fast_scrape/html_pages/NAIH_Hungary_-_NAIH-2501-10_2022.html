<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The controller is a limited liability company in Hungary and also part of the Samlerhuset Group, an international group of companies based in Amsterdam. It sold different versions of commemorative and historical coins, with a specific focus on Hungarian history. The controller acquired the data of its customers as follows: they can place an order by filling in a form, received as part of advertising materials via postal mail. This data includes name, address, phone number, e-mail address.
</p><p>Since July 2020, the DPA received several complaints from data subjects concerning the processing of their data by the controller and objecting to its data processing practices. In most cases, the controller created a user account (profile) with the personal data provided during the purchase or ordering process. However, it only informed the data subjects afterwards about the processing. The DPA therefore carried out a test registration on the controller's website and analysed the privacy notices on the website and from the postal mail. Based on its findings, the DPA suspected an infringement of GDPR and launched an investigation.
</p><p>During the DPA’s investigation, the controller provided the following information on its data processing: potential new customers received a promotional mailing by post. In the controller's view, this did not constitute direct marketing under the Hungarian Act CXIX of 1995 on the processing of name and address data for research and direct marketing. The controller argued that the promotional material was sent to the data subjects together with a newspaper, to which they were subscribed pursuant to a contract with another separate company. Thus, the controller did not contact data subjects directly by itself. The data subjects could then contact the controller online, by phone or by post, in case they would like to order coins.
</p><p>In the online shopping process, the information on data processing is linked at the end of the order. The controller emphasized that the online registration did not involve the processing of any more personal data than a purchase without registration. It was also possible to order products by phone or by post, without registering an online account. The data subjects gave their consent by signing the order form in writing for postal orders, verbally for phone orders and by ticking a specific checkbox for online orders.
</p><p>The controller also informed the DPA that for the purpose of targeted advertising on Facebook and Google social media platforms, the controller manually selected – without automated decision-making – a group of its customers with an e-mail address for whom the given advertisement may be relevant. This list of addresses was hashed and uploaded to the Facebook and Google advertising systems for the display of the advertisement to data subjects whose email address hash matched an element of the uploaded hash list.
</p><p>The controller further stressed that it found data protection highly important, and it employed a dedicated data protection officer (DPO) as well.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA found that, on the form sent out by the controller, the information was provided in very small print, so barely legible. When requesting consent for direct marketing, only the identity of the controller was indicated, with a very general purpose to send “further favourable offers.” The information also stated that the processing was unlimited in time and scope, until consent would be withdrawn. The DPA noted that a more specific purpose limitation and other information as required under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a>, as well as the fact of data transfer abroad, were completely missing. The DPA stated that <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a> only provides the bare minimum content. Additional, case-specific information would be necessary for transparency and informed choice. On the forms of the controller, the mandatory data were distinguished from the non-mandatory data with a tiny asterisk. Thus, the DPA found that the average data subject was not given clear and easily accessible information. It was not possible to indicate that you only wanted to provide your data to receive updates on an order, and not for direct marketing. Individual purposes and individual contact methods were not separated on the postal form.
</p><p>Over the phone – if the data subjects shared that they did not have an internet connection – a list of data processors was read out to them. In this case, it was not possible either to choose whether the data subject wished to consent to be contacted only by certain means, e.g. by post only, by phone only, by e-mail only, or by any combination of these. As in the case of postal communications, no information was provided about other forms of processing, such as Google and Facebook targeted advertising.
</p><p>For online orders, the data subject could easily access the privacy notice, which contained information on data processing related to direct marketing. However, the DPA found that it was not possible to give specific, separate consent for receiving emails and targeted advertising through Google and Facebook. The DPA noted that the absence of any meaningful information on the use of these complex services in itself raised a serious validity issue in relation to consent.
</p><p>With regard to the legal basis for consent, the DPA stressed that consent was not intended to be a general authorization for the controller to process any personal data without restriction, at any time and for any reason, irrespective of other legal conditions. It was only valid when requested for specific, separately identifiable purposes, and preceded by appropriate information that puts the data subject in a position to make an informed decision. <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12(1) GDPR</a> explicitly requires the controller to be result-oriented, i.e. to provide the data subject with the assistance necessary to enable him or her to exercise all his or her data subject rights in an informed manner. The DPA deemed it not the responsibility of the data subject to obtain the information from another source. It should be readily and reasonably available to them at the time of the request for consent. The DPA concluded a data subject would most likely not look online for information on data processing before placing an order by post or phone. This is also not expected by GDPR. The DPA held that the controller had an active obligation to provide the information to the data subject, appropriate for the communication channel used.
</p><p>The DPA further stated that there was currently no DPO under the name of the controller in the designated database operated by the DPA (accessible for everyone). The controller also did not prove otherwise that it had in fact appointed a DPO. DPA noted that, if there was a technical reason beyond the control of the controller for which the entry was not made, it could have been detected and corrected by the controller in the last 4 years since the introduction of the GDPR, if it really considers data protection to be of high importance. 
</p><p>In short, the DPA found that the processing was explicitly for profit, using small print and without easily accessible information, implementing a poor business practice that was, and is problematic, even before the GDPR. The lack of adequate information put the data subjects in a position where they were not aware of their rights and how to exercise them. Therefore, the DPA fined the controller €73,500. The DPA further instructed the controller to modify its data processing practices in relation to direct marketing in order to properly separate specific purposes, obtaining the consent of data subjects, and providing them with adequate prior information appropriately. Also, to delete contact personal data where there was no valid consent.

can prohibit without. In the event of a ban, direct advertising to the person concerned
can no longer be sent through business acquisition.



III. Decision

1. The data controller and data processors

1.1. According to the established facts, the Customer brought the examined direct himself
decisions related to data management for the purpose of acquiring business, it was not determined by others

purpose and means of data management.

1.2. No evidence has emerged that the Customer is other than its data processors
would have forwarded it to a third party through data management for the purpose of direct business acquisition
processed personal data in connection with, no other data controller could be identified.


1.3. Based on the above, in the case of all data processing examined in this case, it is
the obligee of all data management obligations related to data management is general
Based on Article 4, Point 7 of the Data Protection Regulation, the Customer.

2. Provided in connection with personal data related to direct business acquisition

information for each connection method

2.1. Since the source of personal data is new customers, the Authority is primarily new customers
investigated the acquisition of his data, as the legality of this and the then determined
conditions also determine subsequent data management. Already in progress for existing customers
during data processing, the validity of the data subject's consent prior to the consent

information is also basically defined. Illegally obtained personal data
in the future, its handling will not be by itself with subsequent information and references
behavior is legal if the information is not followed by active, specifically consent
an act aimed at granting. Article 4 Article 11 and Article 7 of the General Data Protection Regulation
(2) and the European Data Protection Board 5/2020 regarding consent
Based on paragraph 81 of its guidelines, consent cannot be obtained with the same a

with an act, such as consent to a contract (in this case, signing the order

25/2020 Guidelines on consent pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, date of adoption: May 4, 2020, (hereinafter:
5/2020 Guidelines), availability: https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_202005_consent_hu.pdf 14






by existing customers). Because of all this, the Authority investigated in more detail that a
how personal data was obtained for new customers. For existing customers
apart from the order, there was no other stakeholder declaration, so the validity of the consent is the new one
developed in the same way as customers.


2.2. Information provided in case of mail order

2.2.1. By mail, on many occasions, a significant number of people who cannot be precisely determined are involved

receive advertising materials in addition to your newspaper subscription arising from other legal relationships, and on this
The Customer can place an order by filling in the form received as part of the advertising materials
to its products.

2.2.2. The information on the Customer's form is in extremely small letters, barely legible
                                                                                      3
is happening. When requesting consent, the information is provided exclusively to the person of the data controller, the
very general purpose for the Customer to send "favorable offers" to the concerned subject and
the legal basis of the consent, the revocability of the consent and
indicates its management until withdrawal and the availability of further information online. THE

more specific goal determination, and others according to Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation
provision of information with sufficient specificity and data management
a foreigner is fundamentally necessary for its transparency, but not obvious to those involved
the fact of data transmission is also completely absent.


2.2.3. Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation only defines minimum content, i.e
in the case of individual data management, it is necessary to provide all information that is
necessary for transparency and a considered decision. Mandatory and non-mandatory
Mandatory data in connection with the order, not marketing

they were indicated in the section on data management and with a small star that almost
it is illegible, so the average person concerned is not clear and easily accessible
information when requesting consent. It is not possible to indicate if the affected phone number is
and e-mail address data for the purpose of direct inquiry, and only a

for easier tracking of the order, would you enter these, each goal and each
contact methods are not separated on the postal form.

2.3. Information provided when ordering by phone


2.3.1. By telephone, the above III.2.2. problems explained in subsection arise with the
with the addition that if the person concerned does not have an internet connection, their statement
according to, then the list of data processors will also be read to them (general data protection
Regulation Article 13 (1) point (e)), and in relation to marketing data management a

goal definition is more specific than the postal text, not so meaningless ("contributes
in order for [the Customer] to use the provided contact information also because it is unique
with its offers and news through direct business acquisition by mail, telephone or electronic means
search for it”).


2.3.2. However, even in the case of telephone consent, it is not possible to choose, if only one
the interested party wishes to contribute to the inquiry in the following ways, e.g. you are only by post, only by phone
by e-mail only or by indicating any combination of these.




Article 13, paragraph (1) point (a) of the 3rd General Data Protection Regulation
4 General Data Protection Regulation Article 13 (1) point (c).
Article 13 (2) point (c) of the General Data Protection Regulation
General Data Protection Regulation Article 13 (1) (b), (e), (2) (b), (d), (e), (f) 15





2.3.3. As with postal information, it is not the same in the case of telephone information
providing information to the data subject about other data management methods apart from the above, for example
Google and Facebook targeted advertising using the e-mail address, but not an e-mail message
through targeted website advertising.


2.4. Information provided when ordering online

2.4.1. In the case of an online order, unlike the above, the phone number and e-mail address are mandatory
data to be provided, but consent can be given separately for each inquiry method
give.

2.4.2. However, the wording "electronically" is too broad a term, it is by e-mail

in addition to the request, any other - not visible to the affected person in advance, even future - relational
it may also include a form to which the person concerned may not necessarily wish to do so
contribute in any form chosen by the Customer.

2.4.3. There is no option to send an e-mail message or be targeted online by Google and Facebook
to separately consent to the processing of data related to advertisements, even though they are very different and
data processing affecting the privacy of the affected person to a significantly different extent. Google, Facebook

and the transparency and data protection issues of similar mass automated advertising systems
it is not investigated by the Authority, but by the competent data protection authorities of foreign Member States, that is
not the subject of this proceeding. However, the above is still dubious and difficult to understand
the lack of any meaningful information about the use of services is serious in itself
raises a validity problem with the consent requested by the Client from the data subjects
in connection.


2.4.4. In the case of online ordering, unlike the above, the person concerned can easily access a
www.eremkibocsato.hu/adatkezeles for online information, which is for direct marketing
contains information related to related data management.

2.4.5. The Authority provides online information only for data processing related to direct marketing
closely related to the subject of the present proceedings, not everything there
with regard to listed data management. Given that apart from online orders it is

stakeholders cannot simply access this information through the channel
on which the non-online order is made, therefore the content of the online information is the present decision
was largely irrelevant.


3. Obligation to provide appropriate information


3.1. According to Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Customer is considered independent
the obligation of the data controller to take appropriate measures to ensure that
concerning the processing of personal data for those concerned, referred to in Articles 13 and 14
all information and 15-22. and each information according to Article 34 is concise,
in a transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible form, in a clear and understandable way
provide it formulated.


3.2. The system of appropriate information in the general data protection regulation serves to
so that the data subject can be aware of which personal data, which data controller and
for which purpose, how you will handle it. This is essential to be in a position to
to be able to meaningfully exercise its stakeholder rights. 16





3.3. There is a significant risk involved in the extensive and large number of contributors
by processing the personal data of data subject no
in context. For this reason, there is an increased expectation of information. Adequate information
in its absence, by definition, the data subject is not in a position to properly exercise his rights
practice and make a real contribution to something you are not fully aware of. The

Recital (74) of the General Data Protection Regulation and Article 24 (1).
and on the basis of Article 25 (1), the data controller is responsible for the rights of data subjects
must meet expectations commensurate with its reported risk.

3.4. Data management based on point a) of Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
based on Article 4, point 11 of the General Data Protection Regulation, not only the data management
beginning, but before obtaining consent, the data controller is obliged to

to provide information on the basis of which informed consent can be given.

3.5. In relation to the legal basis of data subject consent according to the General Data Protection Regulation
it is important to emphasize that it does not mean that the data controller is subject to other legal obligations
applies as a general authority regardless of conditions that at any time and
can handle any personal data without limits for any reason. For data management
stakeholder consent can only be valid if it is for specific purpose(s) - per purpose

can be specified separately - they ask, and before that they provide adequate information, which in such a situation
brings the data subject to be able to make an appropriate decision about giving consent, and
complies with all other validity conditions prescribed in the General Data Protection Regulation
requirement. Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation specifically
imposes a performance obligation on the data controller, i.e. the data subject needs such help
provide, so that all stakeholders can exercise their rights in an informed manner.


3.6. As explained above, the obligation to provide information is not a mere "paperwork"
is an obligation in the General Data Protection Regulation. Everything contained in the preamble,
all the articles of the General Data Protection Regulation require the data manager to achieve results
in determining its obligations, not just a specified minimum effort
confirmation by the data controller. The purpose of the information is to put you in such a situation
data subject to be in the appropriate decision-making position by exercising the data subject's rights
in connection.




4. Lack of adequate information

4.1. Based on Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, it is not enough if it is
data controller signs with the data subject a statement that from another source, the data controller

became familiar with the data management before knowing its existence and intention to enter into a contract
related information. It is not the responsibility of the data subject to provide information from other sources
acquisition, it can be easily and reasonably expected during the given consent request
should be available. It is rare to be affected by mail or telephone orders
you seek online data management information beforehand, and this is not your obligation. The client
acknowledged in his statements regarding the telephone script, there may be a number of stakeholders who
does not have internet access or is not easily able to post or telephone

to search for information on the Internet during or before ordering. Because this cannot be known
which exists for data subjects, based on Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
The customer has an active obligation to make the information available to the data subject in such a way
which is adapted to the currently used communication channel. 5/2020
Paragraph 62 of the guidelines also states that if the data controller does not provide access
information, the user's control over the data becomes apparent, and the 17





consent becomes an invalid basis for data management. Ease of access is essential
its requirement is also confirmed by paragraphs 66 and 67 of Directive 5/2020. 5/2020
Based on paragraph 69 of the guidelines, it is possible in the case of information provided electronically
typically use multi-level information. This option is basically not available for the postal route
its nature can be interpreted, access to additional information is a disproportionate time investment

would cause and it is impractical to base the information on this.

4.2. Because the Customer creates the form and quantity of his choice
out and send it attached to a newspaper, or read it over the phone to your new customers, that is
basic information from the point of view of data management (for example, in the case of a postal route, the more specific,
destination indicated on the phone) and the separate consent per destination and connection method
ensuring the possibility not only during online data management, but on all channels

possible and expected from the Customer. Other provisions of the general data protection regulation
in relation to the legal basis of consent, Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
point a) of paragraph also highlights the possibility of contributing by specific purpose
necessity. This does not preclude the provision of an option by means of which all
it is possible to contribute to a specified goal at the same time, but there must be an option in addition to this
to give separate consent for certain purposes.


4.3. Article 4, point 11, Article 7, paragraph 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation, and 5/2020
Paragraph 90 of the guidelines also confirms that the data subject's consent is a legal basis
in the case of its application, the consent of the data subject must always be obtained before that
the data controller would start the personal data management for which you have consented
need. 5/2020 Guideline regarding information regarding consent
Paragraph 63 also highlights that it concerns consent based on information
the consequence of not complying with the requirements is that the consent

will be invalid and the controller may violate Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

4.4. Based on paragraph 64 of Directive 5/2020, in order for the consent to be informed
be based on, the person concerned must be informed of certain things that are crucial for decision-making
about elements. Therefore, the European Data Protection Board considers that valid consent
at least the following information is required:


 (i) the identity of the data controller - this has been fulfilled;

 (ii) the purpose of each data processing operation for which consent is requested - this is a
       not suitable as above;

 (iii) what type of data is collected and used - this was not fulfilled, a
       on the management of shopping habits data for marketing purposes and profiling based on this

       no information is sent by post or telephone;

 (iv) the existence of the right to withdraw consent - this has been fulfilled;

 (v) where applicable, to use the data for automated decision-making
       relevant information in accordance with point c) of Article 22 (2) - this is present
       is not applicable in this case, although there is no information by mail or telephone that this is the case

       does not happen, and manual sorting is done based on shopping habits;

 (vi) the compliance decision for data transmissions and described in Article 46
       possible risks arising from the lack of adequate guarantees - this is not the case in this case
       guide, no information about this has arisen. 18





4.5. The above list also explicitly indicates that it is based on Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation
only a minimum requirement, but in addition it is necessary to provide all information,
which may be important in the decision of a typical person concerned, for example to go abroad (also within the European Union)
large-scale and regular transmission of data, or for targeted advertisements
use (with the possibility of a separate contribution). These elements were also missing the postal and

from telephone information.

4.6. Based on what was explained above, the Customer did not fulfill the legal requirements in a significant part
expectations for personal data collected in connection with postal and telephone orders
during processing for the purpose of obtaining direct business, and in the case of online orders a
for the concreteness of consent, the term "electronically" needs to be clarified, which is not
meets the requirement of adequate information. In addition, it is outside the e-mail address provided

other way, e.g. Targeted direct advertising on the Google and Facebook advertising systems
a separate consent would be required to request personal data in any way
during its collection.

4.7. Based on any of the legal grounds of Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
in the case of data management, the General Data Protection Regulation is also required for all carriers
comply with its provision, in this case with special regard, but not exclusively to the general

obligations according to Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation.

4.8. The exception according to Article 13 (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation does not apply a
in this case, a general contractual conditional statement in fine print is not enough
write it down to the data controller in order to be relieved of all responsibility, instead of writing it down
you should provide substantial evidence that the new customer is affected by mail and telephone
in case of ordering by road, they will at least receive information about the essential elements.



5. Purpose-bound data management

5.1. The data subject is based on Article 6 (1) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation
you can give informed consent to the processing of your personal data for specific purposes.
However, for this to be valid, the consent must comply with general data protection

other generally applicable rules of the regulation, such as the general data protection regulation
Data management principles according to Article 5 (1) and (2) and the concept according to Article 4, point 11
conditions indicated in the definition, as well as Article 7 of the General Data Protection Regulation
restrictions according to

5.2. The principles in Article 5 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation are not limited to that
they serve to make theoretical findings with the implementation of data management

in connection. These principles cover specific obligations that can be held accountable
in specific cases on the data controllers.

5.3. According to Article 5 (1) point b) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the personal
data may only be collected for specific, clear and legitimate purposes, and not
may be treated in a manner inconsistent with these goals. For this reason, data management
also indicating the sufficiently specific goal during planning and informing the stakeholders

a prerequisite for legal data management. This interpretation is reinforced, among other things, by the general
Article 6(1)(a) and Article 7(2) of the data protection regulation, since based on these
a declaration of consent by the data subject that is not sufficiently specific and
contributes to known data management to an adequate extent in such a way that it can be separated
you can consent separately to data management. It's obviously completely unrelated

and the existence of another legal basis cannot be established based on the facts.

5.4. The Customer's obligation to determine the above specific goal - the disclosed facts
and III.2.-III.4 above. taking into account the points explained - he did not fulfill it. The relational
the purpose of processing data cannot be an intangible and limitless goal such as
"receiving further favorable offers". Direct business acquisition is an umbrella term that
it is necessary to mark its specific implementation as a goal, e.g. own or third party

sending advertisements about products on a given channel or specific channels. Separately
important things that are different from the usual and not reasonably expected by the stakeholders should be highlighted

No. NAIH/2018/795/V, and the Customer did not fulfill the
in full the notice of the Authority with case file number NAIH/2018/795/4/V, therefore repeated
notice became necessary with file number NAIH/2019/2181/2. The test is repeated
notice was terminated after execution by the Customer, as only this, or
it is possible to initiate a data protection official procedure at the end of the investigation, and by the Customer

after fulfillment, it was not justified to initiate the data protection official procedure on that individual
in case of cancellation. This cannot be evaluated in favor of the Customer in this procedure and is general
data management before the data protection decree came into effect is not relevant anyway. Also not relevant
from the point of view of the present procedure, that the Authority during a separate data protection incident procedure that
determined that the Customer had taken appropriate measures to deal with the incident, since
it cannot be evaluated in favor of the Customer, only the Customer's failure to do so would be evaluated
at his expense according to judicial practice. The fact that a data protection incident occurred at the Customer is the reason
