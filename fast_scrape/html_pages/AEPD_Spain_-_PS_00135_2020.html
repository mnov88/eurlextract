<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The gym center had already been required by the Spanish DPA to make the necessary adjustments in its contracts to respect the GDPR requirements. One year and 5 months after the Madrid City Council's Health Services Bureau required the entity, twice, to modify the abusive clauses contrary to data protection regulations and 8 months after this Agency first requested their modification, the entity started to proceed to modify the contracts. Some old clauses in breach of the GDPR were still active.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA imposed a fine of EUR 5000 on the gym for the omission of the duty to inform the affected person about the treatment of their personal data in accordance with Article 13 GDPR. The center paid EUR 3000; the reduction was given because of voluntary payment and acknowledging the facts (after waiving a further appeal against the DPA's decision).

We can say that part of the process of implementing the new conditions has been to hold meetings with people from that Department of Consumption in the Chamartin district, who have helped us to specify much better the

It should be noted that on November 5, 2019, we held a meeting with

In the present case, it should be noted that, prior to the opening
of the present sanctioning file (PS/135/2020), had been previously processed
an investigative file for the same facts, in this Agency,
(E/0065/2019), during which time the entity in question was transferred for analysis and response. It was also requested to inform
of the measures they would take to avoid similar situations in the future.
The process of all the proceedings in the two cases has been as follows:
1.- On 16/04/18 and 09/05/18, the Technical Services for Quality and Consumption of the
The Madrid City Council made inspection visits to the complained entity, detecting a series of irregularities in the clauses of the contract that they were making with the clients and that were in breach of data protection regulations.

3.- On 09/01/19, this Agency requested the entity in question
information on the reported events.
4.- On 22/02/19, the entity complained of affirms that they had already modified the
Unfair terms in the contract with customers, in particular terms that have been denounced for not being adapted to the new RGPD (the ninth, twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth).
5.- On 01/03/19, this Agency closed the preliminary investigation proceedings (E/0065/2019), considering that the request had been correctly dealt with.
On 26 September 19, this Agency received a new complaint from
of the Technical Services for Quality and Consumption of the Madrid City Council, indicating that in the last inspections carried out on the issued company, there had been

7.- On 24/10/19, this fact was transferred to the entity in question so that

On 26/11/19, this Agency received a written statement of allegations, submitted
by the entity in question, claiming that:
- In relation to the old contracts, already existing until February
2019, the clauses denounced were eliminated and a new
writing them. But its adaptation had not been completed in its entirety, since, as it was carried out in person, and due to the large number of members distributed among the 20 gyms that the entity has in the Community of Madrid, many of whom do not attend the centers regularly, this process was taking a long time.
In the contracts signed from February 2019 to October 2019, the entity claims that "they did not meet the requirements because the
operating software installed on the entity's computer network has not been

receipt of the second request by this Agency.
- For contracts signed from November 2019 onwards, the following is provided

It is noted that the complained entity became aware of the irregularities in its contracts with customers in April/May 2018, through the minutes of
The inspection was carried out by the Madrid City Council's Health Services Department, which was also required to remedy the deficiencies and adapt the
terms that are abusive to current data protection regulations.
Later, in February 2019, this Agency required him to remedy
the irregularities detected. On that occasion, the claimed entity stated that,
He responded to the injunction and proceeded to eliminate the unfair terms reported and to
to draft new ones in accordance with the RGPD, but it is not until November
2019, after having received the second request from this Agency, (the
24/10/19), when, according to the entity, the new contracts are definitively implemented.
Consequently, one year and 5 months after the Madrid City Council's Health Services Department required the entity, twice, to modify the abusive clauses contrary to data protection regulations and 8 months
After this Agency first requested their modification, the entity complained of, proceeds to modify the contracts. If we add to this the fact that many of the old contracts, made before November 2019, with the old clauses are still active, the facts denounced are clearly contrary to those stipulated in the RGPD.

In accordance with the above-mentioned precepts, and without prejudice to the
instruction of the procedure, for the purpose of fixing the amount of the penalty to be imposed in
in this case, it is considered that the penalty to be imposed should be graduated in accordance with
with the following criteria established by Article 83.2 of the RGPD:
a).- As aggravating criteria:
- The nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, taking into account the
nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation concerned,
as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and
damages they have suffered. In our case, the claimed entity was aware
from May 2018, through the City Council inspections
the existence of abusive terms in the contract he signed with
customers (section a).
- Intentionality or negligence in the infringement. In the present case we are
in the event of negligent action, since it is not until the second requirement of this
Agency, when the entity complained of modifies the clauses contrary to the
new RGPD, (paragraph b).
- The categories of personal data affected by the infringement.
The data processed are of a markedly personal nature and therefore
person identifiers, (section g).
- The manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement. The
The way in which this AEPD has been made aware of has been through the communication
of the infringement by the Madrid City Council, (section h).
(b) As mitigating criteria:
- Measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate
the damages suffered by the parties concerned, since it has been found that
modified the contract adapting it to the current RGPD, (section c).
The non-existence of a previous infringement committed by the person responsible or the person in charge
of the processing, for the same facts, (paragraph e).
- The degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy
to the infringement and to mitigate any adverse effects, (paragraph f).
The balance of the circumstances referred to in Article 83(2) of the RGPD, with
with regard to the infringement committed in breach of the provisions of Article 13 thereof allows
set a penalty of 5,000 euros, (five thousand euros).
