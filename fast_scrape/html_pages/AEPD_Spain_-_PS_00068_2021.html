<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A complaint was filed against URBAN PLANET (a trampoline park) for asking a disproportionate amount of data in order to access its premises. Specifically, the user must fill in a registration form with: name and surname, ID number, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth and photograph. URBAN PLANET explained that the identity verification was put in place as a cost effective way to verify the identity of the visitors. The Spanish DPA (AEPD) assessed whether the criteria of data minimisation as per <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(c) GDPR</a> was met in the case. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD recalled that the necessity test for any limitation of data protection rights should be strict, and processing should be carried out only where strictly necessary. Any data processing operation (such as collection, storage, use, disclosure of data) provided for by law limits the right to the protection of personal data, irrespective of whether such a limitation may be justified or not. The AEPD considered that the purpose underlying the taking of photographs for visitor's access to the park in this case was neither covered by the processing purposes, nor was it necessary or proportionate. The AEPD stated that the photos requested to access the park and to confirm knowledge of the park's rules of use are not adequate, pertinent and relevant data according to these purposes. Therefor, the AEPD held that <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(c) GDPR</a> was infringed, and issued a reprimand to URBAN PLANET as per <a href="/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2b" title="Article 58 GDPR">Article 58(2)(b) GDPR</a>.

"We do not consider the amount of data excessive", since the purpose is to identify with
accuracy to who accesses the leisure centers. Identity verification is to avoid

objective and identify them, and it is not very onerous.

                                FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                                  I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of

control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the
Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.


                                                 II


The defendant is accused of violating article 5.1.c) of the RGPD, which provides:

"The personal data will be:


b) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
are processed ("data minimization");

The "Practical guide to risk analysis in the processing of personal data subject to the
RGPD ”published by the AEPD in its section 3,“ Data Protection from the design and

risk management what should be the route to follow? Section: "definition and design of activities
des of treatment ”, reproduces, on the treatment activity:















C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/16








“Defining a treatment activity is a fundamental step that requires having
clear what are the purposes of the processing of personal data. It corresponds to each
organization, in accordance with the principle of proactive responsibility (accountability), decide the

level of aggregation or segregation to prepare the record of treatment activities and
must assess to what extent that aggregation or segregation corresponds to purposes,
legal bases and different groups of individuals. Likewise, it is necessary to weigh, as
did before when defining files, the optimization of the management of the
data protection within your organization so that it is useful, agile, effective and
allows to achieve the objectives that the legislation seeks: that the individuals whose data are

object of treatment may have, where appropriate, an effective knowledge of the
treatments that the organization performs on them.

Once all those activities have been incorporated into the entity's treatment registry
that correspond to the work or functions that it performs on the character data

staff of the groups of people he manages, he should pay attention to the new
obligations that the RGPD describes about the person responsible for the treatment and the person in charge of
treatment. Do these new obligations entail the generation of new business activities?
treatment that should be described and incorporated into the activity register? The GDPR
establishes in article 5 the following principles regarding data processing
personal you need to consider


Data minimization: Data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what
necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.

Additionally, article 5 of the RPGD establishes that the person responsible for the treatment must

ensure compliance with the principles relating to treatment, as well as the figure
responsible for proving it. Therefore, it is essential to adequately define the
treatment activities and document the analyzes carried out, as well as leave traceability
of the same and the conclusions that support them in order to guarantee the
proactive responsibility. "


Regarding the principle of the need to process personal data, it should be said that
Any data processing implies per se and from the start, the restriction of the right
fundamental, when the collection and disposal of the same by the
responsible who will operate with them. According to jurisprudence, due to the affectation that the
processing of personal data involves a series of fundamental rights, the

limitation of the fundamental right to the protection of personal data should be the
strictly necessary. This implies that if the achievement of the intended purposes can
carried out without processing of personal data, this route will be preferable and will assume that it is not
necessary to carry out any data processing, which will mean that such right, with
the limitations that it entails, it would not be at stake, as there is no data. The collection,

storage and use constitutes per se a limitation of the right to data protection
which must comply with the regulations. This therefore requires first of all analyzing and ensuring
that the data collection is necessary for the established or intended purpose and that it is
proportional.







C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/16








This need must be justified in the compliance documentation that the
responsible must dispose of in accordance with article 5.2. of the GDPR. The need must

determine whether personal data is processed on the basis of objective evidence, according to the
purposes has to determine, if such personal data is unavoidably required or if the purpose
can be fulfilled without processing that personal data. Also that the
request for the data that you already have.


The achievement of the legitimate objective pursued does not offer more advantages if data is used
personal data that if not used, and the data processing implies risks with the
themselves, and ultimately an unjustified intrusion compared to the other option. The
proof of the need for treatment for any limitation of the exercise of rights to
Protection of personal data must be strict, and they must be treated only in the

strictly necessary cases, since in principle, any data processing operation
data (such as the collection, storage, use, disclosure of data) established by
the legislation limits the right to the protection of personal data, regardless of
that such limitation may be justified.


On the one hand, the record of treatment activity expressly includes the collection of the
image, photograph, for two different treatment operations, although connected. A,
materializes on each occasion that each leisure park is visited, trying to verify
with the photo and the data that are given, your identity, to avoid requests for damages by
people who pose as them, (although it does not explain the degree of importance or

evidence of the alleged incidence that motivates this type of collection to be essential). From

not be the end user of the activity, and that no reference to data from

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/16









On the other hand, since the transfer of the claim, it is recognized that even if the taking
of photography, in fact in many cases it is not collected.


Finally, after the initial agreement, it was decided not to use the photo.

All this, in addition, having the taking of images that is done with the camera
Indoor video surveillance, destined, during the recording period, to the games area, to the
eventual events related to incidents that may imply responsibility in the

installation use.

The collection of the image of the people who accessed the parks on each occasion, to
Through photography, which was also stored, it was done mainly by the
issue of damage claims and insurance, only then does the idea of avoiding

impersonations or identify who really intends to access, for assurance of
eventual accidents in order to avoid possible impersonations, as can be deduced.

This seems relevant, in terms of the relationship with the intended purpose, and that it is not
made explicit specifically in the activity register, since the control of the identity of
The person would be credited with the data given and, where appropriate, the display of the DNI, not the

mere repetition of the number, and the taking of the photo is not appropriate, also including the
interior recording of images.

When the same end can be achieved with other means or with those already available,
it does not seem necessary to accumulate more data. Limited to what is necessary, the

taking the photo for insurance reasons or proof of what happened, since it has been
identified before the accessing identity bearer or can be identified, and there are
already enough data that is considered adequate and is already relevant to identify the
person who agrees.


The adequacy, relevance and limitation of the data is related as indicated,
with the purpose that according to the RGPD article 5.1.b) indicates, that they must be “
collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes ”.

Thus, for example, the treatment of acceptance of use of facilities: "with the purpose of
report the correct use of the facilities and video recording for security purposes.

Being the type of data collected: Name and surname; Image; Firm. "Being a mere
information, one might wonder if a specific treatment has to be carried out for this,
differentiated or if data are to be used for it. It could consist of a box mark
in the same section that is contained in the access record.


On the other hand, video recording has an information system with an informational poster in the
establishment and its purpose and basis of legitimation is not similar to that of access control
or acceptance of mandatory standards.

data for access to the enjoyment of the parks, registration of photography for identification of the
Username. Being the type of data collected: Name and surname; Nif / DNI. / Nie;

Phones; Direction; Image / voice; Email; Password; Passport number; Age.
The access relationship is not specified, enjoy the park with the need to provide
the rest of the data, being too brief and generic in terms of the explicit purpose
and the purpose of the treatment cannot be classified as a specific purpose.
Obviously the non-collection of the photo must be contained in the record of activities of
treatment so that it is updated, with the assessment of the reason documented in its

case leading to such a conclusion. The covert purpose behind the making of
photographs for access are not contemplated in the purpose of the treatments, nor is it
necessary or proportional.

It is accredited that the implementation of the need to provide photos at the entrances to the

park, each time they are visited and accessed, and the taking of photos to prove
the knowledge of the rules of use is not adequate, pertinent and relevant data in
this assumption, proving the infringement related to the processing of data in the
cited context.

under the terms of articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; "


Article 58.2 b) of the RGPD provides the possibility of sanctioning with warning, in
in relation to what is stated in Considering 148:


"In the event of a minor offense, or if the fine that is likely to be imposed constitutes a
disproportionate burden for a natural person, instead of a fine can be
impose a warning. However, special attention must be paid to nature,
severity and duration of the offense, to its intentional nature, to the measures taken to
mitigate the damages suffered, to the degree of responsibility or any infraction

relevant above, to the way in which the supervisory authority has had knowledge of the
infringement, to the fulfillment of measures ordered against the person in charge or in charge, to the
adherence to codes of conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance. "

In this case, considering the context in which the data is collected, a

leisure activity, the absence of damages to the claimant, and that it has been chosen not to
request or collect said photo, the penalty of warning, as stated
agreed in the start-up agreement.
