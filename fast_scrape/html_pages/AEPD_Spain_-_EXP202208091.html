<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>In one visit to a police station, the data subject saw notepads on the main counter. These contained personal data of both citizens who went to the police station and police officers who worked in that police station. The personal data in these notepads included, among other categories of data, name, surname, ID number, dates and more. These notepads also included some papers with the logo of the Ministry of home affairs. It later turned out that these notepads were made out of recycled sheets of paper.
</p><p>On 22 June 2022, the data subject submitted a complaint against the General Directorate of Police (DGP, in Spanish) (controller). The data subject provided photos of these notepads to the Spanish DPA, which started an investigation. Once the controller was also notified, its DPO provided a report in which it claimed (among other things) that the pages were only recycled after their official use since they only contained notes on one side. In the specific case, there was no evidence that the disclosed data was leaked from any of the Police databases. 
</p><p>According to the DPO, there was also no record of a similar incident. Also, additional measures were put in place after this incident, such as providing instructions and internal communication to employees about the standard procedure for the destruction of documents. Finally, the DPO stated that the situation was an isolated event as a result of the intention to recycle paper.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA considered that these facts constituted a data breach. However, the DPA also reiterated that such a breach did not mean that the DPA would automatically impose a sanction. The DPA determined that it was necessary to analyse both controller's diligence and the measures that were supposed to prevent the breach from occurring.   
</p><p><i>First</i>, with regard to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Articles 5(1)(f)</a> GDPR, it was proven that the personal data in the recycled notepads was illegitimately disclosed to third parties since the notepads were visible for both employees and police officers from that police station.
</p><p><i>Second</i>, with regard to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>, the DPA considers that the controller did not have adequate measures in place when the breach occurred. Despite the fact that the controller had several measures in place, such as 4 paper shredders and  internal procedures to delete police documents, these were apparently still not sufficient, since the documents containing personal were not destroyed but were instead used as recycled notepads. 
</p><p><i>Finally</i>, the DPA determined violations of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Articles 5(1)(f)</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>. Even though these GDPR violations were considered serious by the DPA, the DPA also recalled that national law stated that public entities could not be sanctioned with fines. Therefore, the DPA merely reprimanded the controller.

       As a result of said request and in order to verify the veracity of the
       statements contained in the claim and clarify the circumstances in
       which these events could have occurred, the DAO proceeds to evacuate the

       opportune consultation to the XXXXXXXXXXXX, answering the same in the following
       terms detailed below.

       Allegations contained in the requested report. Answer of the
       XXXXXXXXX in its report dated August 2, 2022.


       “- The photographs provided by the SR, A.A.A.. seem to correspond to the
       (…).
       - The documents related to the complaint are two quarters of
       folios: in one of them appear the names and surnames of Police officers assigned to
       (...), all of them belong or have belonged to the (...), one of them being

       deceased, event occurred on April 22 of the current year. The list
       corresponds to (...) an undetermined day, since no date appears;
       and in the other quarter of a page the name of a citizen appears, and
       corresponds to the official form to report the loss or theft of a
       document, (…). This time the date ***DATE.1 appears.


       - The source of the pages is the office of (...) of the Provincial Police Station of
       ***LOCATION.1, in both cases, in the case of sheets written by a single
       expensive and discarded after official use.

       - To establish how these documents have arrived at XXXXXXXXX, it has been

       interviewed, on the one hand, (...) and on the other, the Inspector, Head of Section
       Technique responsible for, (...).
       Ms. (...) stated that in order to take advantage of "recycled paper, since it is about
       sheets that are only printed on 1 side", he once asked the
       offices (...), as well as (...), that when there was paper to recycle if it was

       could facilitate, having given him some wads of paper (cut sheets
       in 4 parts), which he used to make notes, but he does not remember that the
       papers have been in view of the public that comes to XXXXXXXXX.
       Currently, he no longer uses these papers because in XXXXXXXXX they take the
       notes on loose papers that are not written and has also acquired
       (…).


       The Inspector (...), asked why these documents appear
       in some photographs that have been taken at the XXXXXXXXX counter,
       agrees with what the person in charge of XXXXXXXXX states, and
       it also says that (...), or (...), labor personnel of this XXXXXXXXX) will

       were in charge of recycling some papers and making something like small
       agendas for notes and that they provided them to XXXXXXXXX.

       - On the part of this Headquarters, there was no knowledge of the denounced fact
       by Mr. A.A.A., nor had the existence been observed in XXXXXXXXX of

       those leaves.

       - The sheets are made at source to establish the work shifts of
       the different members of the Unit, not coming from any

       database. In the case of communication by (...) it is a model
       provided by the General Police Station in which the data provided is reflected
       by the appearing party, which are subsequently verified (...).

       - From the knowledge of the complaint, it has been verified the non-existence of

       similar events, direct instructions have been issued to those responsible for
       the different services and a circular has been drawn up to remind everyone
       officials the way to proceed with the documents that are discarded,
       all this while waiting to know the development of the AEPD file in case
       there would be disciplinary action.


       - In short, this is an incident that, without wishing to minimize the facts,
       has been solely due to wanting to recycle paper, and all this within
       police facilities where the public does not access except in cases of
       some direct friendship of the officials and duly accompanied”.


       Analysis report of the claim submitted by the AEPD.
       After analyzing the documentation sent by the AEPD and the DAO, this
       Data Protection Officer makes the following assessments:

       First. The elimination of documents in the field of the General Directorate
       of the Police (DGP) is regulated by the following regulations:


       - The "Law 16/1985, of June 25, of Spanish Historical Heritage", which
       establishes that the elimination of documentary heritage must be authorized
       by the competent Administration.
       - The "Royal Decree 1164/2002, of November 8, which regulates the
       conservation of documentary heritage with historical value, control of the

       elimination of other documents of the General State Administration and
       their public bodies and the preservation of administrative documents in
       support other than the original”, which develops the previous Law and determines the
       corresponding procedure for deletion of documents,
       requiring the prior agreement of the Document Qualifying Commission
       Administrative of the department and the mandatory opinion of the Commission

       Superior Qualifier of Administrative Documents.
       - The "Order INT/2528/2002, of October 2, which regulates the System
       Archives of the Ministry of the Interior", which refers to the elimination of
       documents.
       - The "Instruction of the General Technical Secretariat, of July 10, 2007,
       on the elimination of documents in the Ministry of the Interior”, which

       supplements the above Order.
       - The "Resolution of the General Technical Secretariat, of October 20, 2014,
       by which instructions are issued on the removal of documents in the
       Ministry of the Interior", which, with respect to the previous Resolution, updates the
       normative and organic references, improves the wording and corrects

       certain inaccuracies, all with the aim of favoring clarity
       of the text and reinforce legal certainty.
       It can be observed that the DGP has a wide normative regulation and
       trajectory in terms of destruction of documentation in our
       files and dependencies.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/13









       Second. The "Resolution of the General Technical Secretariat, of October 20
       of 2014, by which instructions are issued on the deletion of documents

       in the Ministry of the Interior” defines deletion of documents as “the
       physical destruction of units or fractions of documentary series in
       any support in accordance with what was determined in the previous process of
       documentary evaluation”. Likewise, it establishes: a general prohibition of
       unauthorized deletions; some conditions to eliminate documents; a
       removal procedure; as well as an archive of records of

       elimination.

       Third. The documents that appear in the photographs incorporated into the
       claim correspond to internal documentation of the operation
       dependency (the list corresponding to officials (...) a

       day not determined) and an official form to communicate (...). In both
       cases, its origin is in (...) *** LOCATION.1 and it is leaves
       written on one side only, cut into four parts and discarded after
       official use.
       Likewise, there is no evidence that the personal data collected in
       said documents originate from one of the databases

       belonging to the DGP.

       Quarter. Said documentation was reused in XXXXXXXXX with a
       willingness to recycle paper, given that it is sheets that were only
       printed on one side, used to make notes and not

       were, in principle, in view of the people who come to XXXXXXXXX from
       in accordance with what was stated in the report of the Higher Headquarters of the Country
       Basque.

       Fifth. It is noteworthy that, after verifying the non-existence of similar facts,

       Direct instructions have been given to those responsible for the different
       services so that they are not repeated and a circular has been drawn up
       to remind all officials of the removal procedure
       Documents held at police stations.

       Conclusion. In the opinion of this Data Protection Officer, custody,

       confidentiality and proper destruction of police documents
       (especially those that contain personal data) are
       priority objectives for the DGP. This commitment can be seen in the
       drafting of regulations, their distribution and the reiteration of the need for their
       knowledge, the training of officials and the purification of

       disciplinary and criminal responsibilities in those cases of greater
       seriousness through the procedures established for this purpose. In relation
       with the case at hand, it would be an isolated event that has already been
       remedied and for which appropriate measures have already been taken
       stated previously.

security of personal data" (hereinafter security breach) as "all
those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or alteration

accidental or unlawful personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed
form, or unauthorized communication or access to said data.”

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/13








It should be noted that the identification of a security breach does not imply the
imposition of a sanction directly by this Agency, since it is necessary

Article 32 "Security of treatment" of the GDPR establishes:


"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals

appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,

which may include, among others:
       a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
       b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
       c) the ability to restore availability and access to data

       treatment.


2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration will be given to
take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data
personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or
unauthorized access to such data.


3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct pursuant to article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the

any person acting under the authority of the controller or processor and
have access to personal data can only process such data by following
instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the Law of
the Union or of the Member States.


In the present case, at the time of the breach, it cannot be affirmed that
the DGP will have the appropriate measures, since, although in their response they have
indicated that the Commissioner has 4 paper shredding machines, and the Delegate

of Data Protection in his letter adds that the custody, confidentiality and
correct destruction of police documents (especially those that
contain personal data) are priority objectives for the DGP and that their

commitment can be seen in the development of regulations, their distribution and the
reiteration of the need for its knowledge, the training of officials and the
purification of disciplinary and criminal responsibilities in those cases of
more seriousness through the procedures established for this purpose, the truth is that
Some of the documents containing personal data were not
destroyed, being delivered to XXXXXXXXX for its use.
