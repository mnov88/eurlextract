<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>In September 2019, the data subject submitted an access request to the controller, the German Tax Authority (Finanzamt – FA), under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15(1) GDPR</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15(3) GDPR</a>. The controller responded by providing him with his personal data. The data subject deemed the information incomplete and repeated the request asking&#160;for copies of enforcement measures. 
</p><p>In December 2019, the controller rejected the request for copies of enforcement related data with a formal decision, which did not include any information on legal remedies. 
</p><p>On 25 February 2021, the data subject filed an action against the decision of the controller with the Fiscal Court (Finanzgericht Nürnberg), requesting that the controller be ordered to provide information on his personal data within the meaning of Article 15(1) and 15(3) GDPR and claiming that restrictions under national procedural rules conflicted with EU law. 
</p><p>The Fiscal Court dismissed the action as inadmissible for exceeding the statutory time limit.
</p><p>The data subject appealed to the Federal Fiscal Court (Bundesfinanzhof – BFH), claiming that the GDPR does not set a deadline for bringing an action and could be brought at any time as in civil proceedings. He further claimed that no prior administrative proceedings were required since it is an action for performance. In any case the action for the provision of information pursuant to Article 15 GDPR may not be restricted by the requirements for bringing an action in the Fiscal Court Code (FGO).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the lower court’s finding that the claim was time-barred and procedurally inadmissible. 
</p><p>It held that the response of a public body to an access request under Article 15 GDPR constitutes an administrative act. Therefore the action to compel a public body to provide a response is subject to the FGO. According to the FGO, when a data subject receives a negative decision from an administrative body with no legal remedy instruction provided, such as the rejection letter issued by the controller in December 2019, they have one year to contest it. In this case, the data subject had exceeded the one-year deadline. 
</p><p>The Court further held that the principles of effectiveness and equivalence under EU law do not preclude the application of reasonable national procedural limits. It stated that the GDPR must respect the procedural autonomy of each Member State and affirmed that the national procedural rules determine how the legal remedies provided for by the GDPR are to be implemented.   
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>This decision confirms that under German law, a response to a GDPR access request qualifies as an administrative act, triggering standard procedural rules such as filing deadlines. Although <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15 GDPR</a> does not impose its own time limit, national rules on time-bound actions still apply.
</p><p>The Court clarified that <a href="/index.php?title=Article_79_GDPR" title="Article 79 GDPR">Article 79 GDPR</a> does not override these procedural requirements, as long as they do not make the exercise of EU rights impossible or excessively difficult. The judgment aligns with recent CJEU guidance on procedural autonomy, including in Budapesti Elektromos Művek (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=de&amp;jur=C,T,F&amp;num=C-132/21">C-132/21</a>)

</p>
<pre>1. Permissible action for the judicial assertion of the claim against a tax authority under Art. 15 para. 1 and para. 3 sentence 1 in conjunction with Art. 12 para. 5 sentence 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the obligation action according to § 40 para. 1 Alternative 2 of the Financial Court Regulations --FGO-- (connection to the judgment of the Federal Administrative Court of 30.11.2022 - 6 C 10.21, BVerwGE 177, 211, Rz 14).

2. The principles of equivalence and effectiveness of EU law do not require an action for obligation to be brought, which provides for a right to information pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR, detached from the provisions of § 47 para. 1 FGO or in § 55 Abs. 2 sentence 1 FGO regulated period (i.e. "at any time").

Tenor

The plaintiff's appeal against the judgment of the Nuremberg Finance Court of 23.11.2022 - 5 K 246/21 is rejected as unfounded.

The costs of the appeal proceedings must be borne by the plaintiff.

Facts

I.

In the merits, the parties dispute about claims under Art. 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

On 25.09.2019, the plaintiff and appellant (plaintiff) requested information from the defendant and appellant (Finanzamt --FA--) in accordance with Art. 15 para. 1 GDPR and sending corresponding copies in accordance with Art. 15 para. As a result, the FA sent overviews of basic data, notification data and eDaten as well as a tabular list of stored data on enforcement and seizure attempts. The plaintiff was of the opinion that the claim under Art. 15 GDPR had not been fulfilled thereby, and repeated his request. By letter dated 04.12.2019, the FA rejected the application for copies of enforcement measures. A legal remedy instruction was not attached to the letter.

With a lawsuit received by the Tax Court (FG) on 25.02.2021, the plaintiff requested that the FA be sentenced to provide information about personal data and information within the meaning of Art. 15 (1) and (3) GDPR. The plaintiff referred to the fact that "a first request" had already been made to the FA on 25.09.2019. The General Data Protection Regulation does not give rise to a time limit for filing a lawsuit. The entitled party can assert his right to information at any time and repeatedly.

With a judgment published in decisions of the tax courts 2023, 891, the FG rejected the action as inadmissible.

The plaintiff opposes this with his appeal and asserts that the FG had wrongly assessed the action as inadmissible. The action is not bound to any time limit. No prior administrative procedure is necessary. It is a claim for performance, since actual action "with effect for the (respective) present" is required and not a positive decision of the authority in the form of an administrative act. In the alternative, the "refusal of recognition of the claim" by the FA is to be seen as the negative administrative act. In any case, as in a civil case, a lawsuit could be brought at any time. The information action according to Art. 15 GDPR may not be restricted by conditions that would be imposed on the filing of an action in the Financial Court Code (FGO). Art. 23 GDPR does not contain an authorization basis for this.

The plaintiff requests,

to overtee the judgment of the Federal Court Nuremberg of 23.11.2022 - 5 K 246/21 and to order the FA to provide him - the plaintiff with information about the personal data and information in accordance with Art. 15 para. 1 and 3 GDPR.

The FA requests,

to reject the audit.

Reasons

II.

The appeal is unfounded and therefore according to § 126 Abs. 2 FGO to be rejected.

The FG rightly dismissed the action as inadmissible. It may be said whether the plaintiff is against the letter of the FA dated 04.12.2019 (under 1.) or a new request for information in accordance with Art. 15 para. 1 and 3 GDPR (under 2.).

1. Insofar as the plaintiff objects to the rejection made by letter of the FA dated 04.12.2019, he, in accordance with Art. 15 para. 1 and 3 GDPR copies for enforcement measures, the action is in accordance with § 55 para. 2 sentence 1 FGO in conjunction with § 47 Abs. 1 sentence 2 FGO timed and therefore inadmissible.

a) Permissible action for the judicial assertion of the claim against an authority under Art. 15 para. 1 and para. 3 sentence 1 in conjunction with Art. 12 para. 5 sentence 1 GDPR on the provision of a copy of the processed personal data - as the plaintiff asserts it against the FA - the obligation action is in accordance with § 40 para. 1 Alternative 2 FGO.

aa) According to § 40 Abs. 1 Alternative 2 FGO, the conviction to the enactment of a rejected or omitted administrative act (action for obligation) may be sought by an action. Administrative act is any order, decision or other sovereign measure taken by an authority to regulate an individual case in the field of public law and which is aimed at direct legal effect on the outside world (§ 118 sentence 1 of the Tax Code --AO--).

bb) Measured here, the information according to Art. 15 GDPR as an administrative act (cf. e.g. for appeal information according to § 15 para. 4 of the Fifth Asset Formation Act judgment of the Federal Finance Court --BFH- of 05.06.2014 - VI R 90/13,BFHE 246, 383, BStBl II 2015, 48, Rz 10; for binding information according to § 89 para. 2 AO BFH judgment of 30.04.2009 - VI R 54/07,BFHE 225, 50, BStBl II 2020, 996; judgment of the Federal Administrative Court --BVerwG-- of 25.09.2024 - 6 A 3.22, intended for official publication, Rz 18 on the right to information from § 9 of the Act on the Federal Intelligence Service in conjunction with § 15 of the Federal Constitutional Protection Act). In particular, the (sought-after) information goes beyond a mere declaration of knowledge and has a regulatory character, since the authority has the claim on the basis of a statutory audit program, which in particular concerns possible exclusion or restriction facts - e.g. 15 para. 4, Art. 12 para. 5 sentence 2 or art. 23 GDPR or § 32c AO--, has to decide (cf. BVerwG judgments of 30.11.2022 - 6 C 10.21, BVerwGE 177, 211, Rz 14 and of 16.09.2020 - 6 C 10.19, Rz 12; previously left open in Senate judgments of 12.03.2024 - IX R 35/21, BFHE 283, 266, BStBl II 2024, 682, Rz 12 and of 12.11.2024 - IX R 20/22, intended for official publication, Rz 20).

aaa) The BFH judgment of 05.10.2006 - VII R 24/03 (BFHE 215, 32, BStBl II 2007, 243, under II.1.), which accepted a performance action for the request for information there as a permissible action, does not prevent this. This judgment concerned the non-regulated by simple law, based on the principle of the rule of law in conjunction with the fundamental right of professional freedom of Art. 12 (1) of the Basic Law (GG) as well as the fundamental procedural right of Art. 19 para. 4 GG derived claim of a taxpayer to information about the taxation of a competitor. This claim is not subject to the right to information under Art. 15 GDPR. The legal examination associated with the provision of information, whether personal data and, if applicable, grounds for exclusion (such as those regulated in § 32c AO) are present, and the associated regulatory content of the (positive or negative) information goes beyond the content of the notification of the state of knowledge regarding the actual taxation of a competitor.

bbb) The same applies to the BVerwG judgment of 20.08.2003 - 8 C 13.02 (juris). In the underlying proceedings, the plaintiff sought an obligation of an authority to provide him with information by answering certain questions. These were in connection with a civil law proceeding against the former legal representative of the plaintiff there for culpable failure to meet the filing deadline in accordance with § 30a of the Assets Act. They referred to when a request for a transfer of return under property law submitted in accordance with duty on behalf of the plaintiff by the former legal representative would have been decided. The information about a hypothetical time frame of an application procedure is not to be in accordance with information provided by the controller about the personal data processed by him within the meaning of Art. 15 GDPR, which - as stated - requires a comprehensive legal review program.

b) However, the commitment action is time-limited.

aa) If the application for the adoption of an administrative act has been rejected, the time limit for filing the action for obligations pursuant to § 47 para. 1 sentence 2 in conjunction with Set 1 FGO one month. Since according to § 32i Abs. 9 sentence 1 AO for proceedings concerning the General Data Protection Regulation there is no out-of-court appeal procedure, the period begins with notification of the rejection.

However, the course of the period does not begin if - as in the case of a dispute - the requirements of the period pursuant to § 55 para. 1 FGO has omitted the prescribed instruction on the legal remedy. In this case, the deadline for filing the action for obligations results from § 55 para. 2 sentence 1 FGO. According to this, the filing of the appeal is only possible within one year of notification within the meaning of § 54 para. 1 FGO is permissible, unless the filing was impossible before the expiry of the one-year period due to force majeure or a written or electronic instruction has been made that a legal remedy has not been given.

bb) Nothing different results from the General Data Protection Regulation. According to the settled case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), according to the principle of procedural autonomy, which also applies within the framework of the General Data Protection Regulation (cf. e.g. ECJ judgment Budapesti Elektromos Művek of 12.01.2023 - C-132/21, EU:C:2023:2, Rz 46; Senate judgment of 12.11.2024 - IX R 20/22, intended for official publication, Rz 27), the procedural modalities of the legal system of the remedies intended to protect the rights of citizens, must be determined. However, the prerequisite is that these modalities are not more unfavourable in the case of matters covered by EU law than those governing similar matters governed by domestic law (equivalence principle) and that they do not make the exercise of the rights conferred by EU law practically impossible or excessively difficult (effectiveness principle) (see, for example, the judgment of the ECJ Patērētāju tiesību aizsardzības centrs of 04.10.2024 - C-507/23, EU:C:2024:854, Rz 31, m.w.N.). With rest to the principle of effectiveness, the ECJ has also ruled that the establishment of appropriate periods of exclusion for prosecution is compatible with Community law in the interests of legal certainty. Such time limits are not capable of making the exercise of the rights conferred by the Community legal system practically impossible or excessively difficult (see ECJ judgment in Danske Slagterier of 24.03.2009 - C-445/06, EU:C:2009:178, Rz 32, m.w.N.).

cc) In the righte-terms of the principles, the Federal Court rightly accepted the limitation of the action. The action is only on 25.02.2021 and thus - which the plaintiff does not dispute - outside the annual period of § 55 para. 2 sentence 1 FGO at the FG.

This time limit for action is also not to be disregarded in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Justice for reasons of Union law. The rights of the plaintiff, a right to information according to Art. 15 GDPR, are governed by the requirements in § 55 Abs. 2 sentence 1 FGO neither made practically impossible nor excessively difficult. In addition to the generously dimensioned one-year period in the event of an omitted or incorrectly granted legal remedy instruction, it must be taken into account in particular that the person who - like the plaintiff - has a claim to information in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR, can repeat this after a rejection by the data controller.

2. Insofar as the plaintiff does not base his claim on the rejection notice of 04.12.2019, but wants to recognize a rejection notice in the "refusal of recognition of the claim", a prior request for information is missing, so that the action is based on § 40 para. 2 FGO is inadmissible.

a) The taxpayer must, in accordance with § 40 para. 2 FGO, to be violated in his rights by an administrative act or by the refusal or omission of an administrative act or another performance. The in § 40 Abs. 2 FGO designated rejection by the authority necessarily presupposes that the enactment of an administrative act or the specific act of the authority has been requested in advance (cf. Senate judgment of 12.11.2024 - IX R 20/22, intended for official publication, Rz 23 f., m.w.N.). That's what's missing here.

b) The Senate has already decided that the requirements of § 40 Abs. 2 FGO also for claims for information in accordance with Art. 15 para. 1 and 3 GDPR apply. In particular, the regulation of Art. 79 GDPR, according to which the right to judicial remedies exists without prejudice to an available administrative or extrajudicial legal remedy (same view Tormöhlen in Hübschmann/Hepp/Spitaler, § 32i AO Rz 29). This means that the judicial remedy may not be limited by other legal remedies. Art. 79 GDPR speaks of an available administrative or extrajudicial remedy, i.e. of a preliminary procedure. The assertion of the right to information does not constitute preliminary proceedings (cf. Senate judgment of 12.11.2024 - IX R 20/22, intended for official publication, Rz 27 ff., m.w.N.).

The plaintiff did not present new far-reaching arguments that would justify a different legal assessment.

c) Although, according to the case law of the BVerwG, it may be advisable for procedural reasons to waive the requirement of the previous application to the authority if the insistence on a preliminary referral to the administration appears to be mere formality, because the authority has clearly and unambiguously indicated that it will definitely reject such an application (cf. BVerwG judgment of 02.03.2022 - 6 C 7.20, BVerwGE 175, 76, Rz 58; s.a. Senate judgment of 12.11.2024 - IX R 20/22, intended for official publication, Rz 26).

However, that is lacking here. There is no concrete evidence for a corresponding attitude of the FA. Admittedly, the FA rejected a previously submitted application with a decision of 04.12.2019. However, this decision was already more than a year ago when the lawsuit was filed. In view of this period of time, which offers scope for possible changes to the factual and legal situation relevant to the decision, the preliminary referral of the administration is not presented as mere formality.

3. A referral to the ECJ under Art. 267(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is not required in the present procedure. The legal situation is clear ("acte clair"; decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court --BVerfG-- of 19.07.2011 - 1 BvR 1916/09, BVerfGE 129, 78, under C.I.2.e and of 04.03.2021 - 2 BvR 1161/19, Rz 55; ECJ judgment Srl CILFIT and Lanificio di Gavardo SpA against Ministero della Sanità of 06.10.1982 - C-283/81, EU:C:1982:335, Rz 16) or already clarified by the case law of the CJEU in a way that leaves no reasonable doubt open ("acte éclairé"; BVerfG decision of 04.03.20221 - 2 BvR 1161/19, Rz 55 as well as ECJ judgment Srl CILFIT and Lanificio di Gavardo SpA against Ministero della Sanità of 06.10.1982 - C-283/81, EU:C:1982:335 In particular, the ECJ has clarified that the national procedural rules determine how the remedies provided for by the General Data Protection Regulation are to be carried out (see the ECJ's judgment in Budapesti Elektromos Művek of 12.01.2023 - C-132/21, EU:C:2023:2, Rz 46).

4. The decision on costs is based on § 135 para. 2 FGO.
