<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>Stichting onderzoek Marktinformatie (SOMI), Stichting Take Back Your Privacy (STBYP) and Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument (SMC) are three Dutch Foundations focused on class actions. The Foundations all separately sued the TikTok group (the controller). TikTok is a social media platform where users can post, view, like and share videos. SOMI summoned TikTok Ireland, while STBYP and SMC started class actions against multiple TikTok entities. As the cases were similar, they were considered together in this preliminary ruling. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Submissions_of_the_foundations">Submissions of the foundations</span></h4>
<p>The foundations claimed that the controller violated the fundamental rights of children (all foundations) and adults (SMC). In particular, the way that the controller processed personal data violated the GDPR, the Telecommunications Act and the Media Act. In addition, the controller violated provisions of mandatory consumer and media law. The foundations stated that the controller shared personal data of users with third parties without a legal basis. 
</p><p>The foundations each requested the Court to designate it as the exclusive representative within the meaning of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0001827&amp;boek=Derde&amp;titeldeel=14&amp;artikel=1018&amp;z=2022-10-01&amp;g=2022-10-01">Article 1018(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure</a> (<i>Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering-</i> <i>Rv</i>) for the data subjects as described in their summons. This concerned minors for SOMI and STBYP and minors and adults for SMC. 
</p><p>Regarding the jurisdiction, the foundations stated that the Dutch Court had jurisdiction under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_79_GDPR#2" title="Article 79 GDPR">Article 79(2)</a> to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_80_GDPR" title="Article 80 GDPR">80 GDPR</a>, as well as under <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:351:0001:0032:en:PDF">the Brussels I Regulation</a> (Brussels I) and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0001827&amp;z=2021-01-01&amp;g=2021-01-01">Code of Civil Procedure</a>.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Submissions_of_the_controller">Submissions of the controller</span></h4>
<p>The controller requested that the Court declared itself incompetent to take note of any claims that fell within the scope of the GDPR. According to the controller, the right to bring proceedings before the Court of data subjects' habitual residence was a 'privilege of jurisdiction' that only applied to individual data subjects. As the data subjects were represented by the foundations, jurisdiction could in this case not be derived from their place of residence. Since none of the controller's entities were established in the Netherlands, the Dutch Court did not have jurisdiction pursuant to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_79_GDPR" title="Article 79 GDPR">Article 79 GDPR</a>. The controller further argued that jurisdiction rules under the GDPR - as a <i>lex specialis</i> to Brussels I - were exclusive in nature and took precedence over those under the Brussels I. Therefore, no jurisdiction could be derived from Brussels I either. 
</p><p>In addition, the controller requested that preliminary questions be referred to the CJEU on (i) how the rules on jurisdiction under the GDPR and the Brussels I relate to each other and (ii) whether a representative can rely on the ground of jurisdiction following from <a href="/index.php?title=Article_79_GDPR#2" title="Article 79 GDPR">Article 79(2) GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>It further requested that these proceedings be stayed pending a final decision of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) in two investigations into TikTok, and pending the preliminary ruling of the CJEU in case <a href="/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C-132/21_-_Nemzeti_Adatv%C3%A9delmi_%C3%A9s_Inform%C3%A1ci%C3%B3szabads%C3%A1g_Hat%C3%B3s%C3%A1g" title="CJEU - C-132/21 - Nemzeti Adatvédelmi és Információszabadság Hatóság">C-132/21</a>. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Court noted that the underlying legal questions were (i) whether the Court has jurisdiction under the GDPR and (ii) how the jurisdiction regime of the GDPR compares with that of Brussels I.  
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="TikTok_Ireland:_jurisdiction_under_the_GDPR">TikTok Ireland: jurisdiction under the GDPR</span></h4>
<p>The Court stated that most of the foundations' claims related to alleged breaches of the GDPR, concerning data subject's residing in the Netherlands. The Court held that the foundations conducted the litigation on the basis of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0005291&amp;boek=3&amp;titeldeel=11&amp;artikel=305a&amp;z=2017-09-01&amp;g=2017-09-01">Article 3:305a of the Dutch Civil Code</a> (<i>Burgerlijk wetboek - BW</i>)<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>. Thus, they qualified as representatives within the meaning of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_80_GDPR" title="Article 80 GDPR">Article 80 GDPR</a>. Subsequently, jurisdiction could be based on <a href="/index.php?title=Article_79_GDPR#2" title="Article 79 GDPR">Article 79(2) GDPR</a> regarding the foundations' claims against the controller's establishment in Ireland. 
</p><p>The Court added that the controller's argument that the right to bring proceedings before the Court of the data subject's place of residence (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_79_GDPR#2" title="Article 79 GDPR">Article 79(2) GDPR</a>) was to be regarded as a 'privilege of jurisdiction' for only the data subject itself did not stand up. Contrary to what the controller argued, the ground for jurisdiction was not an exception to a main rule. Neither from <a href="/index.php?title=Article_79_GDPR#2" title="Article 79 GDPR">Article 79(2)</a>, nor from Recital 145 GDPR, did it follow that there was any ranking in the grounds of jurisdiction.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="TikTok_Ireland:_Jurisdiction_under_Brussels_I">TikTok Ireland: Jurisdiction under Brussels I</span></h4>
<p>Next, the Court assessed whether it had jurisdiction under Brussels I to the extent that these violations also qualify as unlawful acts and for the other non-GDPR related claims. The Court first looked at the general rule pursuant to Article 4(1) Brussels I: those established in the territory of a Member State shall be sued in the courts of that Member State. As TikTok Ireland was established in Ireland, jurisdiction could not be assumed under the general rule. 
</p><p>Second, the Court assessed whether jurisdiction could be based on Article 7 Brussels I. More precise, whether the foundations' claims were based on a <i>contractual obligation</i> pursuant to Article 7(1) or a <i>tort</i> pursuant to Article 7(2) Brussels I. The court assumed, for the purpose of assessing its jurisdiction at this stage, that the legal questions to be answered in a later stage of the proceedings would not require an interpretation of the agreements between the controller and the data subjects. Therefore, it held that Article 7(2) Brussels I was applicable. The Court noted that Article 7(2) Brussels I assigns jurisdiction based on the 'Handlungsort' (the place where the event causing the damage occurred) and the 'Erfolgsort' (the place where the damage occurred). It found that the data subjects had the centre of their interests in the Netherlands, meaning that the damage occurred in the Netherlands (the Erfolgsort). Therefore, the Court held that it could derive jurisdiction from Article 7(2) Brussels I concerning the claims against TikTok Ireland. 
</p><p>Regarding the controller's argument that the GPDR takes precedence over the Brussels I, the Court stated that the GDPR complements the general rules of jurisdiction set out in Brussels I, these regimes coexist. There was no indication from the text of the GDPR, as well as the recitals that Article 79(2) GDPR would be an exclusive rule, setting aside the rules of Brussels I. The Court did note that pursuant to Article 67(1) Brussels I, the latter shall not affect the application of provisions governing jurisdiction in particular matters that are contained in acts of the Union. The provisions of Brussels I should thus not prejudice the application of Article 79(2) GDPR. However, this just meant that where both Brussels I and the GDPR apply, Brussels I cannot take away any competence designated by the GDPR. But the GDPR would not be a <i>lex specialis</i> to Brussels I.
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_other_TikTok_entities:_Jurisdiction_under_the_Code_of_Civil_Procedure">The other TikTok entities: Jurisdiction under the Code of Civil Procedure</span></h4>
<p>The assessment of the jurisdiction regarding the controller's other entities is only relevant for the claims from STBYP and SMC. The Court noted that since no treaty on the jurisdiction between the Netherlands and the countries in which the controller's other entities were established, the matter must be assessed by national law: the Code of Civil Procedure (Rv). It followed that pursuant to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0001827&amp;boek=Eerste&amp;titeldeel=Eerste&amp;afdeling=Eerste&amp;artikel=7&amp;z=2021-01-01&amp;g=2021-01-01">Article 7(1) Rv</a>, the Dutch Court had jurisdiction if (i) the cases were so intertwined that they justify a joint hearing for reasons of efficiency, and (ii) it already had jurisdiction for one of the defendants (in this case: TikTok Ireland).    
</p><p>The Court found the bases of the claims brought by STBYP and SMC against all the controller's entities were the same. This fact was not concretely disputed by the controller. In addition, while the controller argued that TikTok Ireland was the sole processor of personal data, it did not dispute that its other entities were also involved in the provision of its service. In that regard, the Court found that the claims related not only to the obligations of the controller or processor, but also to other aspects of the provision of its service. Therefore, the Court held that given the complexity of facts and the legal intertwining of the claims, it was justified for reasons of efficiency that the claims would be dealt with together. 
</p><p>Following the above, the Court held that it had jurisdiction over the foundations' claims. 
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Prejudicial_questions_and_suspension">Prejudicial questions and suspension</span></h4>
<p>The Court found no reason to refer the controller's questions to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling. Regarding the suspension of the proceedings, the Court held that in view of the current stage of the proceedings, the requirements of due process oppose a suspension. It stated that there was no risk of contradictory or - where the answers to the questions referred for a preliminary ruling are concerned - incompatible decisions being taken. However, the procedure would be unreasonably delayed if it were stayed.

Plaintiffs are hereinafter referred to as: SOMI, STBYP and SMC and together also as the foundations.

Defendants are referred to as: TikTok Ireland, TikTok UK, TikTok Inc, TikTok Pte, Bytedance, Beijing Bytedance and TikTok Ltd. The appearing defendants are collectively referred to as TikTok et al. and the appearing defendants and the non-appearing defendant together as the TikTok defendants.

Insofar as the parties have referred to "TikTok" without further specification, it is assumed that the claimants have meant all TikTok defendants - insofar as summoned by each of them - and that TikTok et al. only meant TikTok et al.

1 The procedure

1.1.

The course of the procedure is apparent from:

-

the role decisions of July 28, 2021, September 8, 2021, October 13, 2021 and February 23, 2022 and the documents referred to therein,

-

the interlocutory judgment of June 22, 2022, restored by judgment of July 27, 2022, stipulating an oral hearing,

-

the separate conclusions of SOMI, STBYP and SMC of 1 June 2022 on the jurisdiction of the Dutch court and the request for arrest, with exhibits,

-

the official report of the oral hearing of 10 October 2022 with the documents referred to therein and

-

a letter dated November 1, 2022 from mr. Potjewijd on behalf of TikTok et al. about the official report.

1.2.

Finally, verdict has been determined.

2 Introduction

2.1.

Defendants are entities within the Tiktok group. Bytedance is the parent company. In November 2017, Bytedance acquired the musical.ly application and merged it with TikTok, which makes it possible to post, view, like and share short homemade videos online (hereinafter: the TikTok Service). The TikTok Service is available through the app for mobile devices and through the website www.tiktok.com.

2.2.

SOMI was founded on May 31, 2016. After an amendment of the Articles of Association on May 31, 2021, its articles of association state, among other things:

2.1 The Foundation aims to:

(a) representing the interests of natural persons, in particular consumers and minors, who use online services, where at any time there is a violation of the rights of those natural persons, including but not limited to violations of fundamental rights, such as the right not to be discriminated against and the right to privacy and protection of personal data, as well as violations of consumer rights and laws and regulations protecting minors;”

2.3.

STBYP was incorporated on February 24, 2021. STBYP's Articles of Association, insofar as relevant, read as follows:

“ PURPOSE OF ARTICLE 2

1. The foundation aims to represent the interests of natural persons who use the internet and/or use other products and/or services that process personal data, so that these users may at any time be faced with a violation of their right to privacy, including but not limited to their right to the protection of personal data, or may be related to a violation of their consumer rights, or violation of other fundamental or legal rights, all in the broad sense of the the word (which persons are hereinafter also referred to as: the "Duppers"). The foundation also aims to do everything that is related to or may be conducive to the foregoing, all in the broadest sense of the word (…)”

2.4.

SMC was founded on March 15, 2021. The articles of association of SMC read, among other things, as follows:

“Article 3.

1. As an independent organization, the Foundation aims to represent the interests of consumers in general and of Participants of the Foundation in particular in the Netherlands - and insofar as possible and necessary outside of it - with any political or ideological organization. .

2. In order to protect the interests of consumers, the Foundation itself or one or more legal entities to be established by the Foundation may, among other things - but not exclusively - initiate legal or other claims as referred to in:

a. Section 3:305a(1) of the Dutch Civil Code;

b. article 6:240 Dutch Civil Code; or

c. Directive (EU) 2020/1828 of the European Parliament and of the Council of twenty-five November two thousand and twenty on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers and repealing Directive 2009/22/EC (…)”

2.5.

In a letter dated September 8, 2020, SOMI held TikTok UK responsible for, among other things, various violations of the privacy rights of children in the Netherlands. TikTok Ireland responded to this in a letter dated October 9, 2020. SOMI invited TikTok Ireland and TikTok Pte on May 7, 2021 to enter into consultations. TikTok Ireland informed SOMI on 20 May 2021 that it rejected the statements and claims made by SOMI, but was open to consultation. After further correspondence, SOMI has summoned TikTok Ireland on June 1, 2021.

2.6.

On June 23, 2021, STBYP held, among other things, the defendant TikTok parties liable for unlawful acts and invited them to enter into consultations. A response was received on 8 July 2021 and a discussion between the parties took place on 8 August 2021. The consultations did not lead to a solution. After that, the parties continued to communicate with each other. STBYP issued the subpoena on August 30, 2021.

2.7.

In a letter dated July 28, 2021, SMC held Bytedance, TikTok Ltd., TikTok Ireland, TikTok UK and TikTok Inc liable for the damage suffered by the SMC supporters due to the violation of (fundamental) rights and unlawful acts. She has also invited the TikTok parties that have been contacted to enter into consultations. On August 11, 2021, TikTok Ireland sent a response on behalf of the TikTok parties contacted by SMC. After further correspondence between the parties, SMC issued the summons on September 3, 2021.

3 What this case is about

3.1.

With effect from 1 January 2020, the Act on the Settlement of Mass Damages in Collective Action or the WAMCA (Act of 20 March 2019, Stb. 130, amending the Civil Code (BW) and the Code of Civil Procedure (Rv)) has come into effect. in order to enable the settlement of mass damages in a class action. In addition, Articles 3:305a to 3:305d of the Dutch Civil Code have been amended and title 14A ('Procedure of justice in cases concerning a class action and collective claim settlement') has been inserted into the Rv.

3.2.

The foundations have filed claims as referred to in Section 3:305a of the Dutch Civil Code. SOMI has summoned TikTok Ireland by subpoena dated June 1, 2021. STBYP and SMC then filed a class action against multiple TikTok entities for the same events.

3.3.

Very briefly, the foundations base the claims that each of the TikTok defendants is responsible for the way in which the fundamental rights of children (all foundations) and adults (SMC) have been and are being violated. The way in which the TikTok defendant(s) use/make use of personal data constitutes an infringement of the AVG1 and furthermore of provisions of the Telecommunications Act and the Media Act. In addition, the TikTok defendant(s) violates provisions of mandatory consumer and media law. The TikTok defendants are acting unlawfully. Without a lawful basis, the personal data of the users of the TikTok Service is processed and shared with third parties. The foundations demand, among other things, various declaratory decisions, that the court order various measures to stop the violations, that the (general) conditions that apply to the agreements with the users of the TikTok Service are annulled and that the TikTok service is cancelled. the defendant(s) is/are ordered to pay compensation for the material and immaterial damage of the supporters.

3.4.

The foundations each demand that the court designate it as the exclusive representative within the meaning of Article 1018e paragraph 1 DCCP and to determine that it represents the interests of the Narrowly Described Groups it has described in their summons. SOMI and STBYP's claims relate to minors and SMC's claims to minors and adults who have used the TikTok Service after May 25, 2018.

3.5.

The claims of the foundations are reproduced verbatim in the appendix attached to this judgment.

3.6.

A procedural order was established by a decision on the role of 23 February 2022. At present (the so-called first phase) it concerns the jurisdiction of the Dutch court. There are no incidents.

TikTok et al. and afterwards the foundations have each taken a conclusion or deeds on this subject. TikTok et al. submitted a request for preliminary rulings to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and furthermore, pending other ongoing proceedings (investigations by the Irish regulator into (privacy) infringements by TikTok and the answer of preliminary questions by the CJEU in another case) to stay this procedure.

4 The dispute in the first phase

4.1.

TikTok et al. concludes, in summary, its conclusion referred to under 3.6 as follows:

That the court, by judgment to be declared provisionally enforceable:

I. declares itself incompetent to take cognizance of all claims that fall within the scope of the GDPR;

II. in the alternative, with regard to the claim under I, the present proceedings continue with regard to every part of the claims in respect of which the court does not now declare that it has no jurisdiction;

III. in any event declares that the court has no jurisdiction with respect to claims relating to contract and

IV. in any case, orders the foundations to pay the legal costs and subsequent costs, plus statutory interest.

4.2.

The foundations each state in their deeds referred to under 3.6 that, summarized below, the court has jurisdiction to take cognizance of all claims and they conclude that the arrest requests of TikTok et al. STBYP requests that TikTok et al. be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings and the subsequent costs, plus statutory interest. SMC requests that TikTok c.s. be ordered to pay the legal costs, plus statutory interest.

5 The assessment

Jurisdiction – introduction

5.1.

The claims of the foundations relate to the period after May 25, 2018. That is after the entry into force of the GDPR. The parties agree that (the majority of) the claims are based on the GDPR. What divides them, among other things, is whether the court has jurisdiction under the GDPR and how the jurisdiction regime of the GDPR compares to that in the Brussels I bis Regulation2.

5.2.

Recital 145 of the GDPR states:

'For proceedings against a controller or processor, the complainant should be able to choose to bring the matter before the courts in the Member State where the controller or processor has an establishment, or to do so in the Member State where the data subject resides, unless the controller is a public authority of a Member State acting under public authority.'

5.3.

Recital 147 of the GDPR states:

'Where this Regulation provides for specific rules of jurisdiction, in particular with regard to proceedings seeking a remedy, including compensation, against a controller or processor, general rules of jurisdiction, such as those of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and the Council, without prejudice to the application of those specific rules.'

5.4.

Articles 79 and 80 of the GDPR are also relevant for the assessment, which include:

"Article 79"

Right to an effective remedy against a controller or a processor

(…)

2. Proceedings against a controller or processor shall be brought before the courts of the Member State where the controller or processor has an establishment. Such proceedings may also be brought before the courts of the Member State where the data subject habitually resides, unless the controller or processor is a public authority of a Member State acting in the exercise of public authority.'

Article 80

‘ Representation of stakeholders

1. The data subject shall have the right to a non-profit making body, organization or association duly constituted under the law of a Member State, whose statutory objectives serve the public interest and which is active in the field of protection of the data subject's rights and freedoms in relation to the protection of his/her personal data, to make the complaint on his behalf, to exercise on his behalf the rights referred to in Articles 77, 78 and 79 and to carry out on his behalf the in Article 82 to exercise the said right to compensation, if provided for under Member State law.

2. Member States may provide that a body, organization or association referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article has the right to lodge a complaint in that Member State with the competent supervisory authority in accordance with Article 77, independently of the mandate of a data subject, and exercise the rights referred to in Articles 78 and 79 if it considers that the rights of a data subject under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing.

(…)'

5.5.

Article 7 preamble and under 1 a) of the Brussels Ia Regulation provides that a person domiciled in the territory of a Member State in another Member State may be sued in respect of a contractual obligation in the court of the place where the obligation underlying the claim has been or is to be performed. In matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, a person domiciled in the territory of a Member State in another Member State may be sued in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur (Article 7 introductory words and under 2 of the Brussels Ia Regulation). Article 67(1) of the Brussels Ia Regulation states, inter alia, that this Regulation is without prejudice to the application of provisions governing jurisdiction in particular matters and which have been or will be included in Union acts.

5.6.

Also relevant in this case are the provisions of the first section (“Jurisdiction of the Dutch court”) of the first title of the first book of Rv. When interpreting these provisions, in principle, a link must be sought with the case law of the CJEU on the (predecessors of the) Brussels I bis Regulation.3

5.7.

TikTok et al. argue that the Dutch court does not have jurisdiction under the second paragraph of Article 79 of the GDPR. None of the defendants is domiciled in the Netherlands and jurisdiction cannot be derived from the domicile of the alleged supporters of the foundations as “person involved” within the meaning of that provision. Since the majority of the claims of the foundations are GDPR-related, the Dutch court cannot therefore take cognizance of the dispute. The jurisdiction rules of the GDPR have an exclusive character and take precedence over the rules from the Brussels I bis Regulation. As a lex specialis with regard to the Brussels I bis Regulation, the GDPR provides for its own rules of jurisdiction. In the event that the GDPR does not provide a basis for jurisdiction, jurisdiction cannot still be based on the general jurisdiction rules in the Brussels I bis Regulation.

5.8.

The foundations argue that the Dutch court has jurisdiction on the basis of Article 79 paragraph 2 of the GDPR as well as on the basis of the general rules of jurisdiction in the Brussels I bis Regulation and Rv. It follows from Article 80 of the GDPR that representatives of interests can rely on Article 79, paragraph 2 of the GDPR. Finally, the GDPR is not an exclusive regulation that sets aside the provisions of the Brussels Ia Regulation.

Jurisdiction TikTok Ireland

5.9.

First, jurisdiction will be assessed in respect of TikTok Ireland. TikTok Ireland has been sued by each of the foundations.

5.10.

The majority of the foundations' claims relate to alleged breaches of the GDPR. The Dutch court has jurisdiction over those claims. The basic principle here is that it is established that TikTok Ireland is in any case the controller with regard to the processing of personal data that is the subject of these proceedings.

5.11.

The first sentence of Article 79(2) of the GDPR states that proceedings against a controller or processor shall be brought before the courts of the Member State where the controller or processor has an establishment. In these proceedings, none of the defendants is established in the Netherlands. The position of the foundations that the Dutch court has jurisdiction on this ground, because TikTok has (also) had an office in the Netherlands since February 2022, does not require discussion. This is because the jurisdiction against TikTok Ireland can already be based on the second sentence of Article 79 paragraph 2 GDPR (see below).

5.12.

Article 79, paragraph 2, second sentence of the GDPR includes the option of bringing proceedings against the controller in the courts of the Member State where the data subject (i.e. the person whose data is processed) habitually resides. This procedure concerns data subjects residing in the Netherlands. The foundations have argued that, now that they represent the interests of those involved, the jurisdiction of the Dutch court has thus been given. TikTok et al. argue, on the other hand, that the foundations cannot rely on the residence of the data subjects for the purpose of jurisdiction. TikTok c.s. is not followed in this. Article 80 of the GDPR provides for the possibility for a representative to exercise the rights of data subjects without making a distinction between procedural and substantive rights. Also in view of the explicit reference in Article 80 GDPR (both paragraphs 1 and 2) to Article 79 GDPR, it is concluded that the foundations can rely on the habitual residence of the data subjects as representatives of the interests. TikTok et al.'s argument that the right to bring proceedings before the courts of the data subject's habitual residence can be regarded as a 'privilege of jurisdiction' exclusively for the individual data subject does not hold. Contrary to what TikTok et al. argue, that ground for jurisdiction is not an exception to a main rule. This is not apparent from the wording of Article 79(2) of the GDPR, nor from recital 145 to the GDPR, which provides that the complainant can 'choose' to bring the case before the courts in the Member State where the controller or processor has an establishment or to do so in the Member State where the person concerned resides. Any ranking in grounds of jurisdiction does not follow from this. Finally, the comparison made by TikTok et al. with Article 18 of the Brussels I bis Regulation and the judgments of the CJEU in the cases Shearson Lehman Hutton, [party] and Schrems4 does not hold. The foundations do not litigate on the basis of an order or power of attorney. The foundations conduct the process on the basis of Article 3:305a of the Dutch Civil Code and can therefore be regarded as representatives of interests within the meaning of Article 80 of the GDPR.

5.13.

SMC describes the Narrowly Described Group, among other things, as 'the natural persons who lived or stayed in the Netherlands at a time or during a period after the entry into force of the GDPR'. It is possible that members of that group were no longer living in the Netherlands at the time SMC issued its summons. The court will not now discuss the question of whether it is competent for the claims against those persons on the basis of what has been considered under 5.12. This will be taken into account in the decision to be taken regarding the determination of the Closely Defined Group.

5.14.

The conclusion is that the Dutch court has jurisdiction with regard to the claims against TikTok Ireland, as far as the GDPR-related claims are concerned.

5.15.

The claims of the foundations can mostly be qualified as violations of provisions of the GDPR. Insofar as these GDPR violations also qualify as unlawful acts and with regard to other non-GDPR-related claims, it must be assessed on the basis of the Brussels I bis Regulation whether the Dutch court has jurisdiction. The dispute falls within the scope of the Brussels Ia Regulation, both materially, formally and temporally.

5.16.

Because TikTok Ireland is established in Ireland, jurisdiction cannot be assumed under the main rule of the Brussels Ia Regulation (those domiciled in a Member State are sued in the courts of that Member State, Article 4(1)). . For the question whether the jurisdiction can be based on Article 7 paragraph 1 and/or Article 7 paragraph 2 of the Brussels Ia Regulation, it is important to determine whether any claim of the foundations is based on a contractual obligation in the sense of Article 7 paragraph 1 of the Regulation. According to settled case law of the CJEU, the concept of 'contracts in tort, delict or quasi-delict' within the meaning of Article 7(2) of the Brussels Ia Regulation includes any legal action aimed at challenging the liability of a defendant and which is not related to a contractual obligation within the meaning of Article 7(1)(a) of the Brussels Ia Regulation.5 A claim relates to contractual obligations when the interpretation of the agreement is necessary to establish whether the alleged conduct is lawful or unlawful is.6 This is particularly the case with a claim based on the terms of a contract or on the applicable legal rules.7 When the claimant invokes the rules of tort, i.e. a breach of a legal obligation , and it is not necessary to examine the content of the contract concluded with the defendant in order to determine whether the is lawful or unlawful, the ground for the claim, on the other hand, arises from tort within the meaning of Article 7, paragraph 2 of the Brussels I bis Regulation, since that obligation rests on the defendant independently of the contract.8 The court decides on behalf of from the assessment of its jurisdiction before this stage, it is assumed that the legal questions to be answered in the third stage do not require an explanation of the agreements between the TikTok defendants and the users of the TikTok Service. Insofar as the foundations demand a declaratory judgment that certain general terms and conditions used by the TikTok defendants are unreasonably onerous, it can be assumed on the basis of the Wikingerhof judgment that those claims are based on tort. As in the Wikingerhof judgment, this concerns a situation in which it must be assessed whether the fact that an agreement is concluded in a certain form constitutes abuse. In the case of Wikingerhof, this concerns a dominant position, in this case the possible abuse resulting from the fact that unfair general terms and conditions are included in the contract without negotiation. The legal question that is central to this claim is whether the TikTok entity has abused, in an agreement with a consumer as user of general terms and conditions, by means of unfair terms within the meaning of Directive 93/13 and - if Dutch law is applicable is - to include article 6:233 under a of the Dutch Civil Code in the agreement. That is a question that requires an abstract assessment of that clause within the meaning of Article 7 of Directive 93/13, whereby it is not necessary to interpret the concrete contracts concluded between the TikTok defendants and certain consumers.

5.17.

It is settled case law of the CJEU that Article 7 paragraph 2 of the Brussels I bis Regulation creates jurisdiction on the basis of the 'Handlungsort' (the place where the event causing the damage occurred) and the 'Erfolgsort' (the place where the damage occurred). This rule of special jurisdiction must be interpreted autonomously and strictly.9 It is based on the existence of a particularly close link between the action and the courts of the place where the harmful event occurred or may occur, so that, from the point of view of good administration of justice and a useful process organization is justified that these courts have jurisdiction. The Netherlands can be regarded as the place where the damage occurred ('Erfolgsort'). Important in this regard is the judgment of the CJEU in the eDate-[party] case, in which it was ruled that the 'Erfolgsort' in the event of an alleged violation of personality rights by content posted on the internet is located in the user's country where it is located. the center of its interests. 10 The situation in which (privacy) rights are violated via an online service can be equated with this. The users of the TikTok Service whose interests the foundations claim to represent have the center of their interests in the Netherlands (and insofar as this has changed in the meantime, what has been considered under 5.13) applies. This means that the damage has occurred in the Netherlands and the Dutch court can also derive jurisdiction with regard to TikTok Ireland from Article 7 paragraph 2 of the Brussels I bis Regulation.

5.18.

Contrary to what TikTok et al. has argued, the court also derives its jurisdiction with regard to GDPR violations that also qualify as unlawful acts (see number 5.15) from the Brussels I bis Regulation. The GDPR supplements the general jurisdiction rules as laid down in the Brussels I bis Regulation and these arrangements coexist. In view of the general character and, in principle, the broad substantive scope of the jurisdiction regime laid down in the Brussels Ia Regulation, it can only be assumed that the EU legislature intended to adopt a jurisdiction regime deviating from that regulation, not additionally but applying exclusively, if that is sufficiently clearly expressed in the relevant regulation. It cannot be inferred from the text of the GDPR and the preamble that the jurisdiction regulation of Article 79(2) of the GDPR is an exclusive regulation that sets aside the rules of the Brussels Ia Regulation. The preamble to the GDPR under 147 merely states that the general jurisdiction rules of the Brussels Ia Regulation may not prejudice the application of the specific jurisdiction rules included in the GDPR. This underlines the complementary nature of the GDPR compared to the Brussels Ia Regulation.
Furthermore, Article 67(1) of the Brussels Ia Regulation provides that that Regulation is without prejudice to the application of provisions governing jurisdiction in particular matters and which have been or will be incorporated into Union acts. The provisions of the Brussels I bis Regulation may thus not affect the application of specific jurisdiction regulations such as those resulting from the GDPR. This simply means that in a situation such as this, where both the Brussels Ia Regulation and the GDPR apply, the Brussels Ia Regulation cannot deprive a power designated by the GDPR. The jurisdiction rules of the GDPR are therefore not a lex specialis compared to those in the Brussels Ia Regulation.

Jurisdiction of other defendants - Related claims

5.19.

Between the Netherlands and the countries in which the other defendants involved by STBYP and SMC in these proceedings are established (the TikTok defendants with the exception of TikTok Ireland), no treaty applies with regard to the jurisdiction of the Dutch courts. The international jurisdiction of the Dutch court with regard to those defendants must be assessed on the basis of Rv. STBYP and SMC invoke (among other things) article 7 paragraph 1 Rv. It states that if, in cases to be initiated by summons, the Dutch court has jurisdiction over one of the defendants, it also has jurisdiction over other defendants involved in the same proceedings, provided that such coherence exists that reasons of efficiency justify joint treatment. It must therefore be assessed whether there is a sufficiently close connection in that sense between the claims against TikTok Ireland and the claims against the other defendants involved in the proceedings by STBYP and SMC.

5.20.

Although TikTok et al. argue that TikTok Ireland can be regarded as a processor of personal data and the other TikTok defendants appearing not, TikTok et al. has not disputed that the other TikTok defendants appearing are also involved in the provision of the TikTok Service; the defendant Beijing Bytedance who did not appear has not put forward a defense on this point, so that this can also be assumed in respect of her. TikTok et al. has also not specifically contested the connection alleged between the claims against the various defendants. The claims relate not only to the obligations of the controller or processor, but also to other aspects of the provision of the TikTok Service. In view of the complex of facts and the legal interdependence of the claims, it is justified for reasons of efficiency that the claims against the various defendants are heard jointly. The grounds of the claims brought by STBYP and SMC against all TikTok defendants are the same. It always concerns the same acts and the claims of both foundations are directed against all TikTok defendants - insofar as they have been summoned - without any distinction being made. Concomitant treatment is therefore recommended. The question of which defendants can be regarded as the processors of personal data or as those responsible for them is a question that becomes relevant in the substantive assessment of the dispute. This phase of the procedure only concerns the preliminary question with regard to jurisdiction and no further investigation on that point is necessary. The conclusion is that on the basis of article 7 paragraph 1 DCCP the Dutch court also has jurisdiction over TikTok UK, TikTok Inc, TikTok Pte, Bytedance, TikTok Ltd and with due observance of the provisions of article 139 et seq. Rv also with regard to Beijing. Bytedance.

Jurisdiction

5.21.

All this means that the Dutch court has jurisdiction to hear the claims of the foundations. The court is of the opinion that it also has relative jurisdiction with regard to those claims.

Preliminary questions

5.22.

In view of the foregoing, there is no reason to ask the CJEU questions for a preliminary ruling about (i) how the jurisdictional regulations from the GDPR and the Brussels I bis Regulation relate to each other and about (ii) whether a representative can invoke the jurisdictional ground. from the second sentence of Article 79 (2) GDPR. TikTok et al.'s request to that effect is therefore rejected.

Arrest

5.23.

TikTok et al. also request that these proceedings be adjourned pending a final decision by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) in two investigations into TikTok and pending the preliminary ruling of the CJEU in case C-132/21. The DPC's investigations focus on GDPR compliance with regard to data protection by design and default, compliance with transparency obligations and the transfer of personal data to third countries. The case pending before the CJEU concerns two parallel legal proceedings concerning GDPR compliance - administrative law and civil law - of the same data subject in a Member State. In that case, among other things, the relationship between public and private law enforcement under the GDPR is at the forefront. According to TikTok et al., the arrest serves the importance of a uniform interpretation and application of the GDPR, the process economy and process efficiency and guarantees the rights of TikTok et al.

5.24.

The foundations oppose the continuation of the procedure.

5.25.

Whether there are sufficient grounds for arrest is mainly determined by the requirements of due process, including the requirements of an efficient and expeditious administration of justice. The court must guard against an unreasonable delay in the proceedings. In view of the stage at which these proceedings have reached, the requirements of good procedural order preclude arrest. It is important here that no substantive treatment of the claims will yet take place in the next phase (‘the second phase’). In that second phase, the topics to be discussed are: the admissibility of the foundations, the applicable law and the appointment of an exclusive representative. The substantive debate will only start after the parties have taken deeds, the oral hearing has taken place and a decision has been made on the aforementioned subjects. There is therefore currently no risk that conflicting or – in answering the questions referred – incompatible decisions with EU law will be taken, but the procedure would be unreasonably delayed if arrested. For that reason alone, the request for arrest cannot be granted at this time.

Conclusion and costs of the proceedings

5.26.

The court rules that it is competent to take cognizance of the claims of the foundations, it rejects the defenses put forward by TikTok et al. (number 4.1 under I). TikTok et al.'s requests for arrest (number 4 under II) are also rejected.

5.27.

With this judgment, the dispute about jurisdiction and the request for arrest has been decided. TikTok et al. has been unsuccessful. The decision on the costs of the proceedings and the subsequent costs is reserved until a further verdict.

Appeal

5.28.

TikTok et al. has requested to allow an interim appeal against the decision on jurisdiction and the rejection of its requests. Pursuant to Article 337, paragraph 2 DCCP, an appeal can only be lodged against an interim judgment at the same time as that of the final judgment, unless the court has determined otherwise. There is no reason to make an exception to the main rule, given the delay that this entails. In this case, there are no compelling interests or special procedural reasons to deviate from the basic principle that no interim appeal is allowed. TikTok et al.'s request is denied.

The continuation of the procedure

5.29.

The procedural order was established in the role decision of February 23, 2022. The first phase of the procedure has been concluded with this judgment. This marks the start of the second phase, which relates to the admissibility of claimants, the applicable law and the appointment of an exclusive representative.

5.30.

The following is important with regard to the second phase of the procedure. The Explanatory Memorandum to the WAMCA states the following:
“Part c sets requirements for the financial resources that an interest organization must have. This gives the court the opportunity to assess whether a legal entity that institutes a collective action has sufficient resources to conduct the proceedings. Where necessary, the court may request access to the organisation's books, if necessary to be inspected by a third party to be designated by it, without this creating the obligation to also provide this information to the other party. In the event that a construction with Third Party Litigation Funding is opted for, the court may, on the basis of this requirement in combination with the general requirement of the sufficiently secured interests, inter alia request the financing agreement to examine how the financier's influence on the procedure has been arranged and whether that regulation does not stand in the way of careful representation of the interests of the injured parties. The assessment of this part can of course only be marginal. It is sufficient that a legal person can indicate that, at the time of the assessment, it has or can dispose of sufficient resources to be able to conduct the procedure. Incidentally, it is not necessary that the other party also has access to the financing agreement (HR December 20, 2002, NJ 2004, 4, Lightning Casino/Antilles).”11

5.31.

In this case, with a view to assessing the admissibility of each of the claimants and partly with a view to the appointment of an exclusive representative, the court sees grounds for ordering each of the claimants on the basis of the provisions of Article 22 paragraph 1 DCCP. to submit the financing agreement with the litigant financier, on the understanding that it will be determined, subject to analogous application of article 22 paragraph 2 DCCP, that the agreements need not be provided to the other party, but that only the court will take cognizance of them.

5.32.

For the purpose of the second phase of the procedure, a term will be determined below for:

- ((i) the deed of each of the claimants about

(a) the designation of an exclusive representative and

(b) submitting the financing agreement with the litigation funder and

- ((ii) defendants' conclusion on

(a) the admissibility of claimants,

(b) applicable law and

(c) the designation of an exclusive representative.

The date of the oral hearing in the second phase will then be determined. In principle, no reply or rejoinder is allowed at this stage.

5.33.
