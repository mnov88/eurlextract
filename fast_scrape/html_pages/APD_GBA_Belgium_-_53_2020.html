but also, according to the defendant's statements, of emails addressed to him personally, which were
which was not the case with regard to the complainant's e-mail which was indeed collected via the secretariat
of the mayor.
5. With regard to the modus operandi for sending the disputed email, the defendant responded to the
questions from the Data Protection Authority by co-signing the following explanation provided by
the municipal employee who was his secretary when he was mayor:
"In fact, from my private messaging service, I sent an election advertisement for the defendant, in order to
to avoid using his professional messaging in his capacity as an MPP. [...] And this e-mail has
was sent spontaneously, omitting to put in CCI the recipients. There is therefore no
intention to misuse these addresses or harm anyone else. It is just a mistake of
manipulation that we regret. We have apologized to the complainant as you have
could read it".2
6. As a result of these responses, the complainant confirmed to ODA's Front-Line Service that he was willing to
that his request for information be forwarded as a complaint to the ODA Litigation Chamber,
by letters dated July 11 and 26, 2019. On August 6, 2019, the Front Line Service of the Authority of

as to the substance pursuant to articles 95 § 1, 1° and 98 LCA. On the same date, the Dispute Chamber
forwarded the complaint and exhibits to the defendant by registered letter and invited the parties to
argue their case according to a set timetable. The letter stated that "each of the parties is
to transmit its conclusions simultaneously to the secretariat of the Litigation Chamber and to
the other party".

9. The respondent also states that it "sought the advice of an expert in the new
legislation "to help him coach his team" in order to avoid any future mistakes by the
like". The defendant states that the question of what precautions should be taken with
e-mail addresses that people have not spontaneously transmitted, is still under analysis. The
the defendant concluded that he thought he was entitled to contact the persons who had given him their
address, and that he is now aware that this is "obviously not so obvious".

the amount of the fine envisaged against it, as well as a list of the breaches observed at the

2. Violations of the GDMP
12. The defendant in his capacity as burgomaster at the time of the collection of the e-mail address
concerned, is the person responsible for processing the personal data file that he or she has
constituted from the data of citizens addressing his secretariat and/or himself
personally for various requests. It is his responsibility to ensure that the data

13. On the basis of these elements of the file, the Litigation Chamber considers that it is established
that the defendant used to send out election mailings a list of citizens who were in
contact with the commune of which the defendant was then mayor, for various questions related to
to its function as a public representative, and that the personal data collected in this context would have

of the Council of Europe (ETS 108), it is set out at
Article 6.1.b) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 24, 1995

Article 5.1(b) of the GDPR under the Principles for the Processing of Personal Data

18. A compatible purpose is, for example, a purpose that the data subject can foresee

RGPD). Based on the criteria in section 6.4 of the EDR: there is no link between the two.

19. Any subsequent incompatible use is prohibited with two exceptions provided for in Article
6.4. of the RGPD. Where the data subject has given his consent to further processing in order to

necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society, in particular to ensure the guarantee of

data compatible with the original purpose of collecting data from citizens in the context of

such data breaches to the competent authority when the conditions for the application of Article
33 of the RGPD are gathered together. In this case, no such notification has been introduced, which constitutes
also an infringement of the GDMP.
25. In summary, in light of the inspection report and taking into account the Respondent's findings,
the Litigation Chamber establishes the following violations of the GDR&#160;:
- Violation of articles 5.1.a, 5.1.b) and 6.1 of the RGPD, given that by sending the disputed email,
the defendant processed the plaintiff's personal data without a legal basis and in
violation of the purpose for which these data were collected by the Secretariat of the
mayor (answer his questions).
- Violation of sections 25.1 and 25.2 of the MPR, which require the person responsible to
processing to implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to
guarantee that, by default, only the personal data that are necessary to the
with regard to each specific purpose of the treatment are processed.
- Violation of articles 32.1 and 32.4 of the RGPD, since a person acting under
the defendant's authority has sent the plaintiff's email contact information to third parties, in the context of
of an e-mail where all the recipients were visible. Violation of article 33 of the RGPD being
given that this data leak was not notified to the DPA.

Decision on the merits 53/2020 - 9/13
3. Corrective action
26. The Litigation Chamber has already had the opportunity to rule on cases of unlawful treatment
of data for electoral purposes in the following cases&#160;: Decision 11-2019 of November 25, 2019;
Decision 10-2019 of November 25, 2019; Decision 04/2019 of May 28, 2019 and Decision 30/2020 of November 8, 2019; Decision 10-2019 of November 25, 2019; Decision 04/2019 of May 28, 2019 and Decision 30/2020 of May 8, 2019.
June 202010.
27. In these four cases, the Litigation Chamber imposed administrative fines,
in particular for non-compliance with the principle of finality, enshrined in article 5.1.b of the GDMP. These were
in these cases, the unlawful further processing for electoral purposes of data of a personal nature for the
personal data collected (at least with regard to the e-mail address at issue on 22 May 2019)
within the framework of the exercise of communal competences. The present case is part of this
jurisprudence.
28. The Litigation Chamber considers that the breaches it has identified (infra, § 22)
justify the imposition of administrative fines in accordance with articles 100, 13° and 101 of the ACL
as well as 83 of the DPGR, and this taking into account the following.
29. First, the nature and seriousness of the breaches are taken into account (section 83, 1,
(a) of the DPGR). Indeed, breaches of Articles 5.1.b (inconsistent subsequent treatment),5.1.a
(lawfulness) and 6.1 of the GDPMR (unlawful processing) identified in this Decision constitute
breaches of the fundamental principles of data protection. These include
violations for which the maximum fine amounts are the highest (Section 83.5 of the
RGPD).
30. Second, the Litigation Chamber considers that the quality of the defendant, at the time
of the data collection, namely that of the mayor, and subsequently the quality of
the time the litigious e-mail was sent11 , constitutes an aggravating circumstance at the time of the sending of the litigious e-mail.

in compliance with all applicable rules and, in this case, with the rules for the protection of
data.
31. Finally, the Litigation Chamber takes note of the fact that the defendant exposes his good
willingness to implement the DPGR, in that it states that it "sought the advice of an expert in the
new legislation "to help him coach his team" in order to avoid any new mistakes in the future.
of the kind" (see § 9 above). The Litigation Chamber cannot take into account the entry into force of the
of the DPGR as a mitigating circumstance, as the observed violations of the purpose and principles of the
lawfulness are not new elements in data protection legislation.
personal. In its note on "Elections" published in the early 2000s on the website of
the DPA and updated following the entry into force of the DPR12, the Data Protection Authority
already mentioned the ban on reusing data extracted from the
public sector (such as the National Registry, data from the
list of people assisted by a CPAS, data obtained from the public health care system, a list of
the exercise of an alderman's mandate, ...) or data from private sector files (client file of a
company, list of members of an association, ...)".
32. These principles already formed the cornerstone of the Parliament Directive 95/46/EC

not received the conclusions of the defendant, who is therefore in default of at least providing proof of
its full cooperation in this procedure. However, the defendant did receive the letter

its conclusions simultaneously to the other party. The defendant has acknowledged receipt of this letter.
by letter dated October 14, 201913. The Litigation Chamber cannot therefore follow the defendant in

the statement that "I have never been asked or even advised to send in any
conclusions to the complainant. The registered letter of the Litigation Chamber also offered the following
the possibility for the defendant to ask for a copy of the file of exhibits, in which he could have reread

and by email. His response that he had not been informed of the obligation to send
conclusions to the complainant is contrary to the facts. The Litigation Chamber is of the opinion that by this
omission and erroneous denials of facts, the defendant did not provide full cooperation in the
procedure, which constitutes an aggravating circumstance.
35. In his reply to the form of reaction to a proposed fine, the defendant shall
argues mainly that the sending of this mail is the result of an error of its view of
handling. In this respect, the Litigation Chamber recalls that such a mistake of manipulation, the
if applicable, constitutes a security breach and as such a data breach within the meaning of Article
4.12 of the DP Regs that result in the defendant's liability for implementation
adequate safety measures to avoid such errors (see § 20 above). The
The Litigation Chamber notes, however, that there is no evidence in the file that the infringement would have been
committed deliberately, on the instructions of the defendant. The Litigation Chamber therefore holds that
the non-deliberate nature of the infringement as a mitigating circumstance.
36. The defendant's arguments do not change the fact that the personal data
of the complainant and of all persons included in the "permanence" file were unlawfully
processed, namely all persons calling on the mayor's secretariat (see above, §.
5).
37. Lastly, as regards the amount of the fine, the Litigation Chamber adopts the same criteria as for the
those set out above to withhold the amount of EUR 5,000 in order to deter the defendant from repeating
such failures.
38. With regard to the amount, the defendant points out that the amount of the fine seems to him
disproportionate in view of the fact that, in his opinion, it is a handling error which would not have been
brought no benefit. In this respect, the Litigation Chamber has no information at its disposal that could

39. Concerning the financial means, the defendant reports financial difficulties following a

would only add to these difficulties. The defendant does not, however, bring any element of a nature to
statements, and does not propose to be at the disposal of the Litigation Chamber to
this topic. The plaintiff bears the burden of proof for the elements he or she puts forward in response to the
fine form. At this stage of the procedure, the Dispute Chamber decides not to reopen the case.

then MLA), as an aggravating circumstance in the present case (see supra, § 5 and 30).
Indeed, it is incumbent on every public agent to adopt exemplary conduct, including in relation to
concerns the respect of the legislation regarding the protection of personal data.
41. For these reasons, the Litigation Chamber considers that it is appropriate to maintain the amount of
the envisaged fine of EUR 5,000.
