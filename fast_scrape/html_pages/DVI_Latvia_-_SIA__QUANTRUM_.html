<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The controller is a company which provides security services. In its premises, it uses a CCTV system which records both the video and the audio.
</p><p>The data subject filed a complaint with the DPA and argued that, after they were recorded by the CCTV system, the footage was sent to them by an employee of the controller on WhatsApp and Telegram.
</p><p>On 8 February 2023, the DPA opened an investigation.
</p><p>The controller argued that none of its instructions to employees include copying video material onto any kind of private devices. Therefore, in the present case, the video footage was sent to the data subject by an employee without any instruction or order by the controller.
</p><p>Moreover, the controller informed the DPA that the footage had been deleted and the employment relationship with the employee had been terminated.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>Firstly, the DPA noted that the controller has established procedures to manage access authorisations, access control, for organising video surveillance, for viewing the archive of video surveillance recordings, and for creating, issuing and storing a copy of recordings. The DPA held that these technical and organisational measures adopted by the controller comply with the requirements of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR#1" title="Article 25 GDPR">Article 25(1) GDPR</a>.
</p><p>Moreover, the DPA found that the controller cannot be held liable for the action of its employees who deliberately disregarded the rules set by the controller and obtain CCTV footage without the appropriate authorisation.
</p><p>On these grounds, the DPA did not find an infringement and dismissed the complaint.
</p><p>However, the DPA decided ex officio to extend the scope of the investigation with regard to the fact that the CCTV was equipped with an audio recording function. The DPA noted that this audio recording had been conducted on the basis of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://likumi.lv/ta/id/333567-noteikumi-par-apsardzes-darbibas-registru-apsardzes-darbibas-registraciju-un-prasibam-apsardzes-vadibas-centram">Cabinet of Ministers Regulation of 21 June 2022 No. 369</a>. Sub-paragraph 4.24 of this regulation states that the conversations between security personnel that take place by means of remote communication must be recorded and stored for three months.
</p><p>The DPA, after asking an opinion to the Ministry of the Interior, stated that the audio recording through CCTV cameras does not fall into the scope of sub-paragraph 4.24, as it only recorded the voice of one of the two people having the conversation.
</p><p>Therefore, the DPA found that this processing activity was not compliant with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a" title="Article 5 GDPR">Articles 5(1)(a)</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c" title="Article 5 GDPR">(c)</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">6(1) GDPR</a>.
</p><p>On these grounds, the DPA ordered to the controller to cease the recording of audio in connection with the video surveillance.

      [3.3.] At the same time, from the information provided by SIA, it can be established that the security control center of SIA
the video surveillance system is equipped with an audio recording function. Audio recording by SIA, based on
Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers of June 21, 2022 No. 369 "Rules on the activity register of security guards,
registration of security operations and requirements for the security control center" (hereinafter - Regulations No. 369)
4.21. and 4.24. subsection.

      [4.] In accordance with the points [1-3] of this decision, the Inspection concludes the following.

context and intentions, as well as risks of varying likelihood and severity with respect to physical
rights and freedoms of individuals, the manager implements appropriate technical and organizational measures,

to ensure and be able to demonstrably demonstrate that processing takes place in accordance with this regulation. If necessary,
the mentioned measures are reviewed and updated.
      Article 25(1) of the Data Regulation states that, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs

organizational measures, such as pseudonymization, which are designed to effectively implement the data
protection principles such as data minimization and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing
in order to fulfill the requirements of this regulation and to protect the rights of data subjects.
      [4.3.] In accordance with the basic principles of data processing referred to in Article 5, Clause 1 of the Data Regulation, 5

incl. in accordance with subsection (f), the controller must ensure the security of personal data, including protection against
against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage,
using appropriate technical or organizational measures (integrity and confidentiality).
Recital 39 of the Data Regulation explains that [...] personal data should be processed in a way that ensures
adequate security and confidentiality of personal data, including preventing unauthorized access to personal data
data or its unauthorized use and unauthorized access to equipment used for processing.

In addition, in accordance with the principle of accountability established in Article 5, Clause 2 of the Data Regulation, directly to the controller

that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller or processor and having access

personal data, they are not processed without the controller's instructions, except when the said person is required to do so
in accordance with Union or Member State law.
      [4.4.] The inspection, after evaluating the personal data processing rules submitted by SIA, finds that
SIA has determined the management of access permits, access control, organization of video surveillance
procedures, procedures for viewing the archive of video surveillance records and making copies of records,
issuance and storage procedures.

      Thus, it can be concluded that SIA has introduced and is implementing such technical and organizational measures
measures that meet the requirements of Article 25, Paragraph 1 of the Data Regulation. At the same time, the Inspection takes
taking into account that SIA cannot be responsible for the actions of employees who deliberately disregard the rules of SIA, and
obtaining video surveillance footage without proper authorization.

the purposes and means of personal data processing [..]
5a) legality, integrity and transparency, b) purpose limitations; c) data minimization, d) accuracy; e) storage
restriction; f) integrity and confidentiality 3

      [5.] At the same time, observing 3.3 of this decision. personal data of the SIA found in sub-para

processing – audio recording with video surveillance in the security control center – Self-inspection
initiatives expanded the scope of the examination and concluded the following.
      [5.1.] Pursuant to Article 5, Clause 2 of the Data Regulation, the controller is obliged to perform data processing
in accordance with the basic principles of data processing referred to in Article 5 of the Data Regulation and Article 6 of the Data Regulation
to the established legal basis. Article 5(1)(a) of the Data Regulation provides that persons

data is processed lawfully, in good faith and in a manner transparent to the data subject ("lawfulness",
"integrity" and "transparency"), while subparagraph (c) requires that the data are adequate, relevant and
include only what is necessary for the purposes of their processing ("data minimization").
      Therefore, every processing of personal data carried out by the manager must be in accordance with Article 6 of the Data Regulation
for the specified legal basis. Only in that case can it be considered that personal data is being processed

done legally
      [5.2.] Regulation no. 369 4.24. subsection stipulates that there must be a security control center
means of communication with other security personnel, security commercial mobile groups,
security service recipients, other persons and institutions. Contact information is available
recorded and stored for at least three months.

      According to the information provided by SIA, SIA Regulation No. 369 4.24. subsection is executed with
for video surveillance cameras installed in the security control center, which are equipped with audio recording
performance function.
      [5.3.] Considering that from Regulation No. 369 4.24. the redactions of subsection are not unambiguous
it can be concluded that a CCTV camera equipped with an audio recording function is
                                                                                   6
sufficient Regulation No. 369 4.24. for the implementation of subsection, the Inspectorate asked for the opinion of the Internal Affairs
to the Ministry on whether the security merchant in the security control center should make an audio recording for them
for conversations that take place between persons in the security control center, or however this subsection
for enforcement, the security merchant must make a record only for the communication that took place through the communication
means (such as a telephone or radio).
                                                     7
      [5.4.] According to the opinion of the Ministry of the Interior, the security merchant is obliged to provide
the existence of means of communication (for example, a radio station, telephone) through which communication takes place between
employees of the security merchant with other employees located outside the control center,
for the security merchant's mobile groups, security service recipients, other persons and
institutions, and is also instructed to ensure the recording and storage of the mentioned communication information.

      [5.5.] Thus, it can be concluded that the security merchant, which is also an LLC, in order to ensure the Regulation
No. 369 4.24. the execution of sub-paragraph, the conversations that are carried out through communication must be recorded
funds. The inspection takes into account that, when guarding the object, it is essential to have in the event of an incident
available as large a body of evidence as possible to help reveal both the circumstances of the incident and
actions of the security guards, therefore it is essential that the communications provided during communication are recorded

information so that, if necessary, you can listen to what both participants of the conversation said.
      When making an audio recording with video surveillance, SIA does not provide Regulation No. 369
4.24. full implementation of the subsection, because the audio recording made by the video surveillance camera records
only what the security control center employee says, but what the other participant in the conversation says is not recorded.
In addition, during audio recording with video surveillance, SIA processes (obtains, stores) conversations between

to persons who are in the security control center, and these conversations may be unrelated to anyone
security incident.
      Taking into account the above, it can be established that the data processing carried out by SIA, when making an audio recording,
does not meet the requirements of Article 5(1)(a) and (c) and Article 6(1) of the Data Regulation.
      [6.] We inform you that the Inspection implements the "Consult first" principle in its activities, which provides that

The primary tasks of the inspection are the effective protection of data of natural persons (instructions on the controller

video surveillance.

      The administrative act is a suitable means to achieve the goal, as it creates a legal obligation for SIA

      The administrative act can be considered as the most proportionate means for achieving the goal, because in comparison
with the decision on imposing an administrative penalty is considered more lenient. At the same time, legal
the imposition of the obligation is aimed at the data subject in the Data Regulation, the Data Law and other regulatory acts
