<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A care worker (data subject) noticed cameras had been set up in the home of one of her clients (controller) in March 2024. 
</p><p>After noticing them, the data subject and her colleagues told the controller she did not wish to be recorded and the controller assured her that they were dummy cameras. 
</p><p>After the controller showed the data subject a recording of herself from the CCTV, the data subject filed a complaint with the DSB (Austrian DPA) on 12 May 2024.
</p><p>During the course of the investigation, the controller had noted that the cameras were installed in response to a suspected break-in at his house and concerns that he may fall over and require assistance. The controller had attended a consultation day at his local court and a judge advised him to install them, but to cover them while the carers were present. There were three cameras installed, covering both inside and outside of the property and capturing both audio and sound. They were remotely accessible by a family member of the controller.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA firstly considered the outside camera. The DPA found that it did not face the entrance to the house and there was no evidence of it having captured footage of the data subject. Accordingly, as no processing of personal data had occurred, the DPA ruled that the GDPR did not apply.
</p><p>The DPA then considered the cameras inside the house, and whether there the legitimate interest of the controller’s safety could legitimise the processing under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(f) GDPR</a>. The DPA reasoned that the continued use of the cameras when the data subject was present was not necessary to ensure the controller’s safety, as the data subject could help in the event that the controller fell over. The DPA accordingly found that the processing was not safeguarding a legitimate interest and infringed the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c). After finding that the use of internal cameras was unlawful, the DPA further noted that even if the cameras had been covered, the processing would remain unlawful as sound would continue to be recorded. 
</p><p>The DPA ordered that within two weeks, controller had to either restrict the processing of image and sound of the internal cameras so that the care workers are not recorded, or to shut them off entirely when they are giving care.

DECISION

RULING

The Data Protection Authority rules on the data protection complaint filed by Sigrid A*** (appellant) on May 12, 2024, against Gregor N*** (respondent) for violation of the right to confidentiality as follows:

1. The complaint is dismissed with regard to the camera in the garden.

2. The complaint is upheld with regard to the cameras in the living room and the anteroom, and it is determined that the respondent violated the respondent's right to confidentiality by processing the respondent's personal data using cameras.

3. The respondent is ordered to restrict the duration of the image and sound processing of the cameras in the living room and the anteroom within a period of two weeks, or face execution, so that no recordings are made during the care service, or the cameras are switched off during the care service.

Legal basis: Articles 5, 6, 51 (1), Article 57 (1) (f), and Article 77 (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter: GDPR), OJ L 119 of 4 May 2016, p. 1; Sections 1, 18 (1), and 24 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Act (DSG), Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999, as amended. Legal basis: Articles 5, 6, 51 (1), Article 57 (1), (f), and Article 77 (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter: GDPR), OJ L 119, 4 May 2016, Session 1; Sections 1, 18 (1), and 24 (1) and (5) of the Data Protection Act (DSG), Federal Law Gazette Part One, No. 165 of 1999, as amended.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENTS

1. In her filing of May 12, 2024, the complainant alleges that her right to confidentiality has been violated by the respondent and requests a declaration of violation.

On March 12, 2024, the complainant was filmed by cameras while working as a home helper for a client, Mr. J***. These cameras were installed by the respondent, Mr. J***'s adult representative. On May 12, 2024, the respondent showed the complainant a video recording from March 12, 2024, showing the respondent working as a home helper for a client, Mr. J***. The cameras had been installed there for several months, and the complainant repeatedly assured the complainant's employer that they were merely dummies. The complainant's colleagues and the complainant herself had refused their consent and approval from the outset.

2. In his statement of June 11, 2024, the respondent explained that he had installed three cameras. Originally, there were four cameras. On January 10, 2024, suspicious footprints were visible in the snow in Mr. J***'s garden. These extended from the locked garden gate to the bedroom window and from the bedroom window to the terrace. The respondent then went to the police station in L***stadt and asked what he could do, as Mr. J*** was afraid. At the police station, he was told to install wildlife cameras. He then told the police that money kept going missing, and the police were unable to help.

The respondent inquired about the consultation days at the court and then discussed his concerns with a judge. The judge advised the respondent to install cameras. When the respondent mentioned that the nursing staff was coming to see Mr. J***, the respondent said that the cameras would have to be covered while the nursing staff were doing their work, and when the nursing staff were finished, they would have to clear the cameras again. This happened on February 5, 2024, at approximately 9:50 a.m.

The respondent then informed the ward manager of the G*** aid organization, Ms. E***, that he wanted to install cameras and would let her know when they were installed. On February 13, 2024, he then called Ms. E*** to tell her that he would install the cameras over the weekend and that she should tell the staff that they would have to be covered and that when they were finished with their nursing service, the staff should clear the cameras again.

Since Mr. J*** unfortunately suffers from dementia and has fallen several times, and he had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance because he had once accidentally caused tissues in a metal bucket to smolder and emit smoke, and because he had thrown a lit cigarette into a trash can in the living room, this was necessary. The complainant had mentioned to the respondent that Mr. J*** supposedly always hits the display case with his key ring, which was untrue and the respondent had never seen it.

The cameras only record movements, lasting from 20 seconds to one minute. After three days, the recordings are automatically deleted. Unfortunately, there is no shorter setting. The cameras are not labeled. One hangs in the vestibule with the lens pointing toward the front door. The second camera is on a wall shelf in the living room and can be rotated 360 degrees. The third camera hangs on a wooden post and points toward the garden and terrace. The complainant had indeed installed the cameras solely for Mr. J*** because he was very worried about him, and he never intended to publish these images. The cameras were Video*** brand. They were indoor and outdoor cameras with a two-way system.

On March 12, 2024, the complainant gave Mr. J*** something to sign. She said, "Peterle, I have something from the boss to sign." This was despite the fact that the G*** aid organization knew that Mr. J*** was no longer allowed to sign documents, and had known so since November 16, 2022. The respondent only noticed that Mr. J*** had signed something every month through the recording, which lasted only 20 seconds. On March 13, 2024, the respondent asked the complainant if she had allowed Mr. J*** to sign anything, and she replied, "No." Since the respondent also had his own appointments, he left it at that for the time being.

Photographs showing the cameras, their positions, and the respective angles of view were attached to the submission.

3. On June 24, 2024, the final report of the investigation by the H***stadt Public Prosecutor's Office, dated June 14, 2024, was received by the Data Protection Authority. The Public Prosecutor's Office investigated, on the one hand, the complainant's complaint against the respondent for sexual harassment and, on the other hand, the respondent's complaint against the complainant for defamation.

4. On December 5, 2024, the Data Protection Authority interviewed the respondent and the complainant.

5. In her statement of December 6, 2024, the complainant explained that the G*** aid organization repeatedly sent emails to employees for the purpose of providing updates and information.

Attached to the submission were emails sent by superiors, including Ms. E***, to the employees of the G*** aid organization.

6. In his statement of December 16, 2024, the respondent stated that he never told the G*** aid organization that the cameras were dummies. He merely said that the cameras looked like dummies. Otherwise, he would not have said that the nursing staff should cover the cameras when they came to see Mr. J***. There were never any dummies. The cameras were necessary because Mr. J*** suffered from anxiety. In such a case, the respondent would have to go to him quickly and calm him down. The video and audio recordings would be stored for three days and then automatically deleted.

The respondent has been Mr. J***'s adult representative since January 2023. Contrary to the complainant's assertion in her submissions and during the interrogation on December 5, 2024, the respondent has never sexually harassed or insulted her. Mr. J*** is his stepfather, which is why he spends so much time with him. He also cared for both of his mother's children during her lifetime. He had discussions with Mr. J*** about the nursing home because he was afraid of it. He is now waiting for a place in the nursing home for Mr. J***. The respondent further elaborates on what has been stated so far.

Attached to the submission were the certificate appointing the respondent as Mr. J***'s legal adult representative dated January 16, 2023, and the correction order dated November 18, 2022.

7. In her statement of December 20, 2024, the complainant explained that the respondent had installed the cameras in February 2024, but that no consent had been obtained. Her supervisor, Michaela E***, had assured her several times that the cameras—although they had flashed—were dummies, that they recorded neither image nor sound, and that only the camera in the garden was active.

8. On January 13, 2025, the Data Protection Authority interviewed the witness Michaela E***.

9. In her statement of January 10, 2024, the complainant stated that she no longer knew exactly what the document she had Mr. J*** sign during the video recording was. In any case, she had been instructed by her supervisor to have it signed. She did not know what happened to it afterward. It had been decided that no further care would be provided while the respondent was present.

Furthermore, the complainant reiterated what she had already stated.

10. In his statement of January 19, 2025, the respondent stated that he had called Ms. E*** to tell her about the cameras, and that this had not happened during the nursing visit. He had said from the beginning that they were not dummies, and regarding the covering, he had also said from the beginning that they should do it. Furthermore, the complainant explained what had already been stated.

B. Subject Matter of the Complaint

Based on the submissions initiating the proceedings, the subject matter of the appeal is the question of whether the respondent violated the complainant's right to confidentiality by installing video cameras at her workplace.

C. Findings of Fact

1. The complainant works as a home helper for the Lower Austrian G*** aid organization. In the course of this work, she also cared for Mr. J***, whose adult representative is the respondent.

Evaluation of evidence: The findings are based on the consistent submissions of the complainant and the respondent, as well as the examination of the complainant on December 5, 2024, and the examination of the respondent on December 5, 2024.

2. Due to Mr. J***'s anxiety and risk of self-harm, particularly the risk of falling, the respondent installed two functioning cameras in his representative's apartment in February 2024. These are located in the entrance area and the living room and record the nursing staff entering and leaving the apartment, as well as while providing nursing care. The cameras process video and audio material. The recording area is as follows (format not reproduced 1:1):

[Editor's note: The photographs (Figures 1 and 2) from Mr. J***'s apartment, reproduced here in their original form as graphic files, have been removed for pseudonymization purposes.]

Evaluation of evidence: The findings are based on the respondent's statements in his submissions and the attached photographic enclosures reproduced here, the complainant's statement of December 5, 2024, and the credible statements of Michaela E*** in the witness statement of January 13, 2025.

3. Due to tracks in the snow, he installed another camera in the garden. The complainant was not captured by the camera either entering or leaving, or performing her work. The recording area is as follows (format not reproduced 1:1):

[Editor's note: The photograph (Figure 3) from Mr. J***'s garden, reproduced here in its original graphic file, has been removed for pseudonymization purposes.]

Evaluation of evidence: The findings are based on the respondent's statements in his submissions and the attached photographic enclosures reproduced here, as well as the complainant's statement of December 5, 2024.

3. During the nursing visit, the respondent informed witness Michaela E***, the complainant's then-supervisor, that the cameras in the living room and entrance area were dummies and that only the camera in the garden was active.

[Editor's note: The excerpt from an email reproduced here in the original as a graphic file (Figure 4) cannot be pseudonymized with reasonable effort and has therefore been removed.]

Assessment of evidence: The findings are based on the complainant's submissions, the email exchanges between her superiors and the employees of the G*** aid organization submitted by her and reproduced here, the complainant's credible statements in the party examination on December 5, 2024, and the credible statements of Michaela E*** in the witness examination on January 13, 2025, which are consistent with those of the complainant.

4. The witness Michaela E*** verbally communicated the information about the cameras to the employees of the G*** aid organization during the staff meeting. The G*** aid organization informed the respondent, as well as the other employees, that they should still cover the cameras for safety reasons when entering Mr. J***'s apartment to provide care. Afterward, the nurses were to uncover the cameras again. There was suspicion that the cameras were not dummies, but functioning ones. The complainant sometimes forgot to cover the cameras while performing her care duties.

[Editor's Note: The excerpt from an email exchange reproduced here in the original as graphic files (Figures 5 and 6) cannot be pseudonymized with reasonable effort and has therefore been removed.]

Assessment of Evidence: The findings are based on the complainant's submissions, the email exchanges submitted by her and reproduced here between her superiors and the employees of the G*** aid organization, the complainant's credible statements during the party examination on December 5, 2024, and the credible statements made by Michaela E*** during the witness examination on January 13, 2025.

5. The respondent was never asked for consent regarding the cameras. She never consented to being recorded, nor did the other employees of the G*** aid organization.

[Editor's Note: The excerpt from an email reproduced here in the original as a graphic file (image without a caption) cannot be pseudonymized with reasonable effort and has therefore been removed.]

Assessment of Evidence: The findings are based on the complainant's submissions, the email exchanges submitted by her and reproduced here between her superiors and the employees of the G*** aid organization, the complainant's credible statements during the party examination on December 5, 2024, and the credible statements made by Michaela E*** during the witness examination on January 13, 2025.

6. On March 13, 2024, the respondent confronted the complainant with a video recording of her. This video was recorded on the camera in the living room. The recording shows the complainant having Mr. J*** sign a document.

Evaluation of evidence: The findings are based on the consistent submissions of the complainant and the respondent. The findings regarding the facts presented in the recording are based on the submissions of the respondent and the video that the respondent submitted to the Data Protection Authority during the party hearing on December 5, 2024.

D. From a legal perspective, this results in the following:

1. On the right to confidentiality:

According to Section 1 (1) of the Data Protection Act, everyone has the right to keep personal data concerning them confidential, provided there is a legitimate interest in doing so. The existence of such an interest is excluded if data is not accessible to a confidentiality claim due to its general availability or its inability to trace back to the data subject. According to Section 1 (1) of the Data Protection Act, everyone has the right to keep personal data concerning them confidential, provided there is a legitimate interest in doing so. The existence of such an interest is excluded if data cannot be subject to a confidentiality claim due to its general availability or its inability to trace the data subject.

The legal definitions and principles of the GDPR must be applied to interpret the right to confidentiality (see Section 4 (1) of the Data Protection Act and the DSB's decision of October 31, 2018, file reference DSB-D123.076/0003-DSB/2018). According to Article 4 (1) GDPR, personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. According to Article 4(2) GDPR, processing is any operation performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or linking, restriction, erasure or destruction. The legal definitions and principles of the GDPR must be used to interpret the right to confidentiality (see Section 4, Paragraph 1, DSG and the DSB decision of October 31, 2018, GZ DSB-D123.076/0003-DSB/2018). According to Article 4, Paragraph 1, GDPR, personal data is all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. According to Article 4, paragraph 2, GDPR, processing is any operation which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or linking, restriction, erasure or destruction.

2.&#160;&#160;&#160;On the allocation of roles:

Determining the allocation of roles under data protection law is crucial for the complaint procedure pursuant to Section 24 of the Data Protection Act (DSG) and Article 77 (1) of the GDPR, as it determines who is responsible for compliance with the respective data protection provisions, how the data subject can exercise their rights, and ultimately against whom the data protection complaint must be directed (the respondent). Determining the allocation of roles under data protection law is crucial for the complaint procedure pursuant to Section 24 of the Data Protection Act (DSG) and Article 77 (1) of the GDPR, as it determines who is responsible for compliance with the respective data protection provisions, how the data subject can exercise their rights, and ultimately against whom the data protection complaint must be directed (the respondent).

According to Article 4 (7) of the GDPR, the controller is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. The key criterion here is the decision-making component. The role of the controller thus primarily arises from the fact that a specific entity has decided to process personal data for its own purposes. The "purpose" describes an expected result, while the "means" determine the manner in which the expected result is to be achieved (cf. the EDPB Guidelines of September 2, 2020, 07/2020 on the concept of controller and processor, paras 15 et seq.). According to Article 4, paragraph 7, GDPR, the controller is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data. The key criterion here is the decision-making component. The role of the controller thus primarily arises from the fact that a specific entity has decided to process personal data for its own purposes. The "purpose" describes an expected result, while the "means" determine the manner in which the expected result is to be achieved (see the EDSA Guidelines of September 2, 2020, 07/2020 on the concept of controller and processor, para. 15 et seq.).

The respondent decided on the purpose of the data processing in the case at hand, namely the control and, subsequently, the protection of Mr. J***, whose adult representative he is. He also decided on the means, namely the installation of video cameras. The respondent is therefore the controller pursuant to Art. 4(7) GDPR.

He also decided on the means, namely the installation of video cameras. The respondent is therefore the controller pursuant to Art. 4(7) GDPR.

3. Regarding the camera in the garden:

The camera in the garden, as established, only records the exterior of the care recipient's home. The camera does not record the entrance area, which is why the complainant's arrivals and departures are not recorded. The care service itself is provided in the home, which is why it cannot be assumed that the complainant was recorded while performing her duties as a home helper. The complainant has also never claimed to have been recorded by this camera in the garden. Therefore, the scope of application of Section 1 (1) of the Data Protection Act (DSG) does not apply to the camera in the garden, as the information does not relate to the complainant and therefore cannot be classified as personal data. The camera in the garden, as established, only records the exterior of the care recipient's home. The camera does not record the entrance area, which is why the complainant's arrivals and departures are not recorded. The care service itself is provided in the home, which is why it cannot be assumed that the complainant was recorded while performing her duties as a home helper. The complainant also never claimed to have been recorded by this camera in the garden. Therefore, the scope of application of Section 1, Paragraph 1, of the Data Protection Act does not apply to the camera in the garden, as the information does not relate to the complainant and therefore cannot be qualified as personal data.

The decision was therefore made in accordance with the ruling and the appeal was dismissed on this point.

4. Regarding the cameras in the living room and anteroom:

In the present case, the respondent uses the cameras to record both images and sound, i.e., the appearance, all actions, and everything spoken, of the complainant. Therefore, the scope of application of Section 1, Paragraph 1, of the Data Protection Act does apply, as the information relates to the complainant and therefore qualifies as personal data pursuant to Article 4, Paragraph 1, of the GDPR. The respondent's action, namely the processing of images and sound, is to be considered processing pursuant to Art. 4(2) GDPR. In the present case, the respondent uses the cameras to record both images and sound, i.e., the complainant's appearance, all actions, and everything spoken. Therefore, the scope of application of paragraph 1, subsection 1, DSG applies, since the information relates to the complainant and thus qualifies as personal data pursuant to Article 4, subsection 1, GDPR. The respondent's action, namely the processing of images and sound, is to be considered processing pursuant to Article 4, subsection 2, GDPR.

Restrictions on the right to confidentiality are permissible under Section 1 (2) of the Data Protection Act (DSG) if personal data are used in the vital interest of the data subject, the data subject has given their consent (or, in GDPR terminology, consent), if there is a qualified legal basis for the use, or if the use is justified by the overriding legitimate interests of a third party. Restrictions on the right to confidentiality are permissible under Section 1 (2) of the Data Protection Act (DSG) if personal data are used in the vital interest of the data subject, the data subject has given their consent (or, in GDPR terminology, consent), if there is a qualified legal basis for the use, or if the use is justified by the overriding legitimate interests of a third party.

The data processing in question is not in the vital interest of the complainant, and consent and a qualified legal basis are also not present.

At this point, for the sake of completeness, it should be noted that the fundamental right to confidentiality pursuant to Section 1 (2) DSG also provides for the “legitimate interests of third parties” as the legal basis for processing. Unlike Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, however, it should be taken into account that Section 1 (2) DSG does not require equality, but rather a predominance of the interests of third parties for the admissibility of processing. However, the scheme for balancing interests can also be applied to the case of Section 1 (2) DSG. At this point, for the sake of completeness, it should be noted that the fundamental right to confidentiality pursuant to Section 1 (2) DSG also provides for the “legitimate interests of third parties” as the legal basis for processing. Unlike Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, however, it should be taken into account that Section 1 (2) DSG does not require equality, but rather a predominance of the interests of third parties for the admissibility of processing. However, the balancing of interests scheme is also applicable to the case of paragraph 1, paragraph 2, of the Data Protection Act.

Accordingly, processing on the legal basis of "legitimate interests" is permissible under three cumulative conditions (cf. Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, Opinion 06/2014 on the concept of the legitimate interest of the controller pursuant to Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC, WP 217, 844/14/EN, p. 43 et seq., according to which implemented protective measures to prevent or mitigate disproportionate consequences for the data subject must be duly taken into account as a factor in the balancing of interests): Accordingly, processing on the legal basis of "legitimate interests" is permissible under three cumulative conditions cf. Article 29 -, D, a, t, e, n, s, c, h, u, t, z, g, r, u, p, p, e,, Opinion 06/2014 on the concept of the legitimate interest of the controller pursuant to Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC, WP 217, 844/14/EN, Session 43 et seq., which stipulates that the safeguards implemented to prevent or mitigate disproportionate consequences for the data subject must be duly taken into account as a factor in the balancing of interests):

i. Pursuance of a legitimate interest by the controller or the third party(ies) to whom the data are disclosed,

ii. Necessity of processing the personal data to achieve the legitimate interest, and

iii. The fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the perceived legitimate interest (cf. the judgment of the ECJ of July 4, 2023, C-252/21, paragraph 106).

The respondent explains that the purpose of installing the cameras was to protect Mr. J***. He is the adult representative of Mr. J*** and in his submissions he explains the risk of self-harm by the person he represents, in particular the risk of falling. The protection of the vital interests of another natural person can certainly be regarded as a legitimate interest, particularly in view of Article 6 (1) (d) GDPR. The respondent explains that the purpose of installing the cameras is to protect Mr. J***. He is the adult representative of Mr. J*** and in his submissions he explains the risk of self-harm by the person he represents, in particular the risk of falling. The protection of the vital interests of another natural person can certainly be regarded as a legitimate interest, particularly in view of Article 6 (1) (d) GDPR.

However, data processing is intended to be ongoing. The principle of data minimization pursuant to Art. 5 (1) (c) GDPR is directly linked to purpose limitation and establishes three cumulative elements: adequacy, relevance, and limitation to what is necessary. Recital 39 further states that personal data may only be processed if the purpose of the processing cannot reasonably be achieved by other means. This principle is intended to ensure that the processing of personal data is reduced to an unavoidable minimum (Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Art. 5 GDPR, as of December 1, 2020, rdb.at). Overall, the principle of data minimization requires a minimization of the number of data subjects and a limitation of the data stored for each data subject. However, data processing is intended to be ongoing. The principle of data minimization pursuant to Article 5, paragraph 1, letter c, GDPR is directly linked to purpose limitation and establishes three cumulative elements: adequacy, relevance, and limitation to what is necessary. Recital 39 further states that personal data may only be processed if the purpose of the processing cannot reasonably be achieved by other means. This principle is intended to ensure that the processing of personal data is reduced to an unavoidable minimum (Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Article 5, GDPR, as of December 1, 2020, rdb.at). Overall, the principle of data minimization requires a minimization of the number of data subjects and a limitation of the data stored on each data subject.

However, recording the entire living space, and this continuously, was not necessary to pursue the legitimate interest. While the nursing staff are present, these people are able to monitor and ensure Mr. J***'s health and general well-being. The respondent could have monitored Mr. J***'s health and mental state in a different way – namely, for a limited period of time. An examination of whether the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject outweigh the perceived legitimate interest is unnecessary. Even if the complainant had ordered the cameras to be covered, as he states, this would still be necessary and constitute a violation of the data minimization principle, since the complainant is captured during the covering and uncovering of the cameras, and the audio continues to be recorded.

The decision was therefore in accordance with the ruling, and the complaint regarding the cameras in the living room and the anteroom was upheld.

5.&#160;&#160;&#160;Regarding the performance mandate:

The Data Protection Authority has remedial powers pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) GDPR, which allow it to instruct a controller to modify or carry out processing operations in a specific manner and within a specific period of time. Based on the aforementioned provision, the respondent was therefore to be ordered ex officio to change the settings of the camera in question. The Data Protection Authority has remedial powers pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) GDPR, which allow it to instruct a controller to modify or carry out processing operations in a specific manner and within a specific period of time. Based on the aforementioned provision, the respondent was therefore to be ordered ex officio to change the settings of the camera in question.

As established, the complainant violates the right to confidentiality by operating the cameras in the living room and the anteroom. The respondent argues that the image and sound processing is justified to protect the legitimate interests of third parties, the health and general well-being of the person in his care. This argument cannot be accepted.

In the present case, it is certainly possible to track the presence and absence of the caregivers. Continuous monitoring of the home is not necessary to achieve the purpose and therefore contradicts the principle of data minimization pursuant to Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR. In the present case, it is certainly possible to track the presence and absence of the caregivers. Continuous monitoring of the home is not necessary to achieve the purpose and therefore contradicts the principle of data minimization pursuant to Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR.

The manner in which the first respondent specifically implements the service contract in point 3 of the ruling is left to the discretion of the respondent. The data protection authority has imposed a time limit, stating that no recordings may be made by Camera 1, Camera 2, Camera 3, or Camera 4 during the nursing service, or that the cameras must be deactivated. Outside of the nursing service—and thus outside the presence of other affected persons—it is the responsibility of the complainant to take preventive measures to protect the patient in his or her care.

Covering the cameras alone is not a sufficient measure to protect the data protection rights of the nursing staff, as they are still continuously recorded via audio processing and recorded again via image processing until the cameras are covered and after they are uncovered. Furthermore, such a measure places the burden of protecting their rights on the nurses as data subjects, while the complainant, as the controller, is responsible for ensuring compliance with the GDPR.

The respondent must provide the data protection authority with evidence of the restriction of processing in accordance with Article 58 (1) (a) GDPR. A period of two weeks seems appropriate to implement the changes, which do not involve significant technical effort, and to provide the data protection authority with appropriate evidence of this. The respondent must provide the data protection authority with evidence of the restriction of processing in accordance with Article 58, paragraph 1, letter a, GDPR. A period of two weeks seems appropriate to implement the changes, which do not involve significant technical effort, and to provide the data protection authority with appropriate evidence of this.
