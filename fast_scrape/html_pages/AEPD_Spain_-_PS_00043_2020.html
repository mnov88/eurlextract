<p>A citizen brought to the attention of the AEPD that the website that the respondent used as a platform for the position of president of a professional association in Madrid in 2019, did not have a privacy policy or legal notice, and therefore could be in breach of the right to information of visitors to the website.
</p><p>The website contained a form to collect personal data (name, telephone number, and e-mail address) from those interested in the project led by the defendant.
</p><p>The respondent stopped the data processing when it was warned of the possible unlawfulness of the conduct, and the AEPD was able to verify that the personal data collection form had been removed.

<p>Is collecting personal data without the required privacy policy a breach of Article 13 GDPR?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD considered that, in the present case, it was sufficient to impose a warning sanction for breach of the duty to provide information on the processing of data, as set out in article 13 GDPR.
</p><p>In order to determine the level of the sanction, the AEPD took into account the fact that this is a natural person whose main activity is not linked to the processing of personal data and that there is no evidence of recidivism, as there is no record of the commission of previous infringements.

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/9








4.The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply when and in the
to the extent that the interested party already has the information. "


The violation of this article is classified as an infringement in article 83.5 of the RGPD,
which it considers as such:

"Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or,

For the purposes of the statute of limitations for the offense, article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD
establishes:

"Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that suppose
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and, in particular, the

following:

[…] H) The omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the treatment of their
personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679. […] ”.



                                           III

In accordance with the evidence available in the present

sanctioning procedure, it is considered that the website
www.unionccafyde.site123.me, responsibility of the claimed, kept a form
collection of personal data without providing in any way the information that
establishes article 13 of the RGPD.

Regarding the allegations presented by the defendant - in which

points out that there had been no intentionality on his part, the form had been
originally designed in compliance with the provisions of the RGPD and that for a
computer error had occurred the events object of the present procedure (without
provide evidence in this regard) -, it should be noted that article 5.1.a) of the RGPD
states the principle of "lawfulness, loyalty and transparency", a principle on which the

Recital 39: «All processing of personal data must be lawful and fair. For
it must be fully clear to natural persons that they are collecting, using,
consulting or otherwise processing personal data that concerns them, as well as
the extent to which such data is or will be processed. The principle of transparency
requires that all information and communication regarding the processing of said data be

easily accessible and easy to understand, and that simple and clear language is used.
This principle refers in particular to the information of the interested parties about the
identity of the person responsible for the treatment and the purposes of the same and the information
added to ensure fair and transparent treatment with respect to people

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/9








affected individuals and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of the data
personal that concern them that are object of treatment. Natural persons
must be aware of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights

relating to the processing of personal data as well as the way to enforce their
rights in relation to the treatment. In particular, the specific purposes of the
processing of personal data must be explicit and legitimate, and must
be determined at the time of collection. Personal data must be
adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are
treaties. This requires, in particular, to ensure that its use is limited to a strict minimum.

conservation period. Personal data should only be processed if the purpose of the
treatment could not reasonably be accomplished by other means. To ensure that
personal data is not kept longer than necessary, the person responsible for the
Treatment must establish deadlines for its deletion or periodic review. Must
all reasonable measures are taken to ensure that they are rectified or deleted

personal data that is inaccurate. Personal data must be a
a way that ensures adequate data security and confidentiality
personal data, including to prevent unauthorized access or use of said data and
of the equipment used in the treatment. "

Recital 60 links the duty of information with the principle of transparency,

by establishing that “The principles of fair and transparent treatment require that
inform the interested party of the existence of the treatment operation and its purposes. The
data controller must provide the interested party with all the information
is necessary to guarantee fair and transparent treatment,
taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the

personal information. The interested party must also be informed of the profiling
and the consequences of such elaboration. If personal data is obtained from
interested parties, should also be informed if they are obliged to provide them and of the
consequences if they do not […] '. In this order, article 12.1 of the
RGPD regulates the conditions to ensure its effective implementation and article 13

specifies what information should be provided when the data is obtained from the
interested. In turn, article 11 LOPDGDD introduces the information rule by
layers when you have:

"one. When personal data is obtained from the affected party, the person responsible for the
treatment may comply with the duty of information established in article

13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, providing the affected party with basic information to the
referred to in the following section and indicating an email address or other
means that allows easy and immediate access to the rest of the information.

2. The basic information to which the previous section refers must contain, at the

less:

a) The identity of the person responsible for the treatment and their representative, if applicable.

b) The purpose of the treatment.


c) The possibility of exercising the rights established in articles 15 to 22 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679. […]&#160;»


C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/9








Thus established the duty of information and the obligation, on the part of the person responsible for
carry out a transparent treatment, it cannot be ignored that article 5.2
of the RGPD establishes that «the data controller will be responsible for the

compliance with the provisions of section 1 and capable of demonstrating it
(“Proactive responsibility”)&#160;». This means that, according to Articles 24 and 25
of the same legal text, the person in charge must guarantee the effective application of the
principles of treatment both at the time of determining the means of
treatment as during the treatment itself through the joint of a series
of measures, which must be periodically reviewed and updated.


This being the case, and even though in the present case the defendant had
proceeded, at the time of determining the means to design and implement
measures in accordance with guaranteeing compliance with the principle of transparency and
duty of information, this would not exempt you from continuing to be responsible for the effectiveness

of these measures during the entire time in which the collection and
processing of personal data, especially when in this case there has not been a
commissioning of the treatment to other actors.


                                            IV


The corrective powers available to the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data, as a control authority, are established in article 58.2 of the RGPD. Between
They have the power to sanction with warning - article 58.2 b) -, the
Power to impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83 of the RGPD

-article 58.2 i) -, or the power to order the person in charge of the treatment
that the processing operations comply with the provisions of the RGPD, when
proceed, in a certain way and within a specified period - article 58. 2
d) -.


According to the provisions of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the measure provided for in article 58.2
d) of the aforementioned Regulation is compatible with the sanction consisting of a fine
administrative.

Likewise, without prejudice to the provisions of article 83, the aforementioned RGPD provides the
possibility of sanctioning with warning, in relation to what is indicated in the

Recital 148:

"In the event of a minor offense, or if the fine likely to be imposed
constitutes a disproportionate burden for an individual, rather than
sanction by fine may be imposed a warning. It must however

pay special attention to the nature, severity and duration of the offense, its
intentional character, to the measures taken to alleviate the damages suffered,
the degree of responsibility or any relevant prior infringement, the way in which
that the supervisory authority has had knowledge of the infraction, to the fulfillment
of measures ordered against the person in charge or in charge, adherence to codes of

conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance. "

In the present case, when deciding the sanction to impose, they have taken into account
counts the following elements:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/9









 That it is a natural person whose main activity is not related to the
processing of personal data.


 That no recidivism is appreciated, as the commission of infractions is not recorded
previous.

Therefore, it is considered that the sanction that would correspond to impose is

warning, in accordance with the provisions of article 58.2 b) of the RGPD, in
relation to what is stated in Considering 148, cited above.


Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and the criteria of

graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been accredited, the Director of the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection RESOLVES:


FIRST: IMPOSE B.B.B., with NIF *** NIF.1, for an infraction of article 13 of the

RGPD, typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD, a sanction of APERCIBIMENTO.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to B.B.B. and inform A.A.A ..


In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this
