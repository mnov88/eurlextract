<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>An individual (the complainant) filed a complaint with the AEPD indicating that the website owned by the controller violated data protection and information society services regulations, with regard to the implemented Cookies Policy. The complainant raised several issues regarding the use of non-technical and non-necessary cookies without consent, the lack of an appropriate cookie banner and the extent of information provided in the Cookies Policy. 
</p><p>The AEPD gave the controller an opportunity to contest the facts. The controller indicated that the complaint was unfounded given that users were able to navigate the site without accepting or rejecting the cookies. Additionally, the controller adopted the following measures: the elimination of cookies from the web, and the elimination of the warning banner, which used to make it impossible to read documents on the site. The controller further clarified that no personal data was stored through cookies. 
</p><p>Nevertheless, the AEPD initiated an investigation into the controller's website. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>First, the AEPD recalled Article 22(2) LSSI, which establishes that users of websites must be provided with clear and complete information on the use of storage devices, data recovery and, in particular, on the purposes of data processing. 
</p><p>This provision applies also to the use of cookies on websites and requires the controller to obtain expressly stated consent whenever non-necessary or non-technical cookies are used. This can be done, for example, through clicking on an "Accept" button. There should be a possibility to withdraw consent at any time, as required also by <a href="/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR" title="Article 7 GDPR">Article 7 GDPR</a>. Moreover, a cookie banner should inform the user of a website about the the identity of the controller, the purposes of using specific types of cookies, the data collected, the manner in which to either accept, reject or adjust the use of cookies. There should also be a link to a page including more detailed information on the Cookies Policy. In this regard, the DPA emphasised that the use of "Cookie Walls", that is pop-up windows which block access to a website unless the user accepts the use of cookies, is prohibited. 
</p><p>In the present case, the AEPD found that there was no cookie banner as such, no possibility to reject non-technical and non-necessary cookies, nor was there a control panel, where cookies could be managed. 
</p><p>Secondly, the AEPD investigated the compliance of the information provided in the Cookies Policy with Article 22(1) LSSI. It concluded that the policy implemented on the controller's website lacked information on the identity of the controller, the types of cookies (first-party or third-party) used, their functionality or the time they would be active for.
</p><p>In consequence, the AEPD imposed on the controller a fine of €2,000, for the violation of Article 22(2) LSSI, regarding the Cookies Policy implemented on their website.

the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of the
art. 43.1, second paragraph, of the LSSI Law.

II.- About the "Cookies Policy" of the website www.preicojuridicos.com


       a).- On the use of cookies in the terminal equipment prior to
       consent:

Article 22.2 of the LSSI establishes that users must be provided with information
clear and complete information on the use of storage devices and

data recovery and, in particular, on the purposes of data processing.
This information must be provided in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR. So,
when the use of a cookie entails a treatment that enables the
identification of the user, those responsible for the treatment must ensure the
compliance with the requirements established by the regulations on the protection of

data.

However, it is necessary to point out that they are exempt from compliance with the
obligations established in article 22.2 of the LSSI those necessary cookies

In this sense, the GT29, in its Opinion 4/201210, interpreted that among the cookies
excepted would be the user input Cookies” (those used to
filling in forms, or managing a shopping cart); cookies from
user authentication or identification (session); user security cookies
(those used to detect erroneous and repeated attempts to connect to a site
Web); media player session cookies; session cookies to balance

load; user interface customization cookies and some of
plugin (plug-in) to exchange social content. These cookies would remain
excluded from the scope of application of article 22.2 of the LSSI, and, therefore, it would not be
necessary to inform or obtain consent on its use.


On the contrary, it will be necessary to inform and obtain the prior consent of the user.

third party, session or persistent that are not technical or necessary.

In our case, when entering the web for the first time, without accepting cookies or performing
no action on the page, it has been verified that cookies are used that are not

technical or necessary, whose domain is Google Analytics.

       b).- About the existing cookie information banner in the first layer
       (Homepage):


The banner on cookies of the first layer must include information regarding the
identification of the editor responsible for the website, in the event that your data
identifiers do not appear in other sections of the page or that their identity cannot

that is, that the user does not have to navigate inside the second layer to
locate it.

In the case at hand, it has been found that there is no type of banner
of information about cookies on the main page of the web.


       b).- Regarding consent to the use of unnecessary cookies:



C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/10








For the use of non-excepted cookies, it will be necessary to obtain the consent
expressly stated by the user. This consent can be obtained by doing
click on, “accept” or inferring it from an unequivocal action performed by the user that

denotes that consent has unequivocally occurred. Therefore, the mere
user inactivity, scrolling or browsing the website, will not be considered
effects, a clear affirmative action in any circumstance and will not imply the
provision of consent itself. Similarly, access to the second
layer if the information is presented in layers, as well as the necessary navigation to

acceptance of cookies.

The existence of "Cookie Walls" is not allowed either, that is, windows
pop-ups that block the content and access to the web, forcing the user to

accept the use of cookies to be able to access the page and continue browsing.

If the option is to go to a second layer or cookie control panel, the link
it should take the user directly to that configuration panel. To facilitate se-
lesson, the panel can be implemented, in addition to a granular management system
of cookies, two more buttons, one to accept all cookies and another to reject-

all of them If the user saves his choice without having selected any cookie,
You will understand that you have rejected all cookies. Regarding this second possibility,
In no case are the pre-marked boxes in favor of accepting cookies admissible.

If for the configuration of cookies, the web refers to the browser configuration

installed in the terminal equipment, this option could be considered complementary
to obtain consent, but not as the only mechanism. Therefore, if the publisher
opts for this option, it must also offer, and in any case, a mechanism that
allows you to reject the use of cookies and/or do it in a granular way, on your own page.

On the other hand, the withdrawal of the consent previously given by the user de-
It should be able to be done at any time. To this end, the publisher must offer a
mechanism that makes it possible to withdraw consent easily at any time.

If the editor's cookie management or configuration system does not allow to avoid the
use of third-party cookies once accepted by the user, information will be provided
training on the tools provided by the browser and third parties, de-
being aware that, if the user accepts third-party cookies and later wishes to

delete them, you must do it from your own browser or the system enabled by the
third parties for it.

In our case, it has been found that there is no possibility of rejecting cookies
that are not technical or necessary nor is there any type of control panel

where they can be managed granularly or by groups.

III.- Qualification and sanction that corresponds with respect to the infraction committed with respect to

to the Cookies Policy:

The deficiencies detected in the verification of the web page

       Organic 15/1999, of December 13, on the protection of personal data
       staff.
