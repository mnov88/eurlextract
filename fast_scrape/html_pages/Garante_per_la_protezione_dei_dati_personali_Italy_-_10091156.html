<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The Italian supervisory authority investigated the cookie practices of the www.onlinestore.it website on its own volition. The website belonged to e-commerce company Società Onlinestore S.r.l. (the data controller).
</p><p>The website’s cookie banner stated that the website used cookies (including third-party cookies) to offer a better browser experience and that users could edit their cookie preferences.
</p><p>The banner included three options: “Accept”, “Customize”, and “Learn more”. The banner included no option to reject cookies and no “X” icon<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> to close the banner. The “Customized” option opened a drop-down menu with preferences for both necessary cookies and profiling cookies. Profiling cookies were pre-selected by default and could be de-selected by the user.
</p><p>The authority tested the website and found that the same number of cookies were placed regardless of user preference.
</p><p>In its preliminary view, the authority held that the data controller did not allow users to express informed, freely given, and granular consent. The authority also held that the controller failed to provide users with a clear and transparent cookie notice. In the authority’s view, the controller violated Articles <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#11" title="Article 4 GDPR">4(11)</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">5</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR" title="Article 7 GDPR">7</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR" title="Article 24 GDPR">24</a>, and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR" title="Article 25 GDPR">25</a> GDPR, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/dettaglio/codici/datiPersonali">Article 122 d. lgs. 196/2003</a><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>, and the authority's guidelines on cookies and other trackers<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>.
</p><p>The data controller took the website offline as soon as it was informed of the investigation. The controller did not challenge the authority’s views and stated that it did not assess the compliance of its cookie implementation.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The authority held that the data controller violated Articles <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#11" title="Article 4 GDPR">4(11)</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">5</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR" title="Article 7 GDPR">7</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR" title="Article 24 GDPR">24</a>, and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR" title="Article 25 GDPR">25</a> GDPR, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/dettaglio/codici/datiPersonali">Article 122 d, lgs. 196/2003</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9677876">the authority's guidelines on cookies and other trackers</a>.
</p><p>The authority only issued a warning because the controller immediately took the website offiline. The authority also ordered the data controller to address its non-compliant cookie practices, should it make its website available again.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>The decision stems from a broader set of own volition investigations over the implementation of cookies on e-commerce websites.

HAVING SEEN the Memorandum of Understanding of 30 March 2021 signed by the Guardia di Finanza and the Guarantor for the protection of personal data;

HAVING SEEN note no. 57504 of 21 October 2022 with which the Authority, taking into account the need to carry out a verification of compliance with the aforementioned Cookie Guidelines, also in light of the numerous complaints received on the matter, delegated to the Special Unit for the Protection of Privacy and Technological Fraud of the Guardia di Finanza (hereinafter also “Unit”) the carrying out of a series of online checks, requesting to concentrate the activity, in a first phase, on a sample of possible operators in the e-commerce sector;

SEEN note no. 10808 of 24 January 2023 with which the Unit provided the lists of possible recipients, indicating the geographical area of origin and the turnover;

SEEN note no. 36204 of 28 February 2023 with which, in compliance with the canons of homogeneity of the intervention and in application of a predetermined and uniform selection criterion throughout the national territory, also based on dimensional and geographical indicators, the Company Onlinestore S.r.l. was identified, together with other owners, among the subjects receiving said checks, actually carried out on 13 April 2023 in relation to the website www.onlinestore.it;

CONSIDERING that, in that context, it emerged that:

- upon first access, the immediate pop-up banner on the use of cookies appeared on the home page which reported the following: "This site uses cookies, including third-party cookies, to offer you a better browsing experience" and that "You can manage the enabling of cookies at any time via the cookie management page";

- the banner at the bottom featured 3 (three) buttons labeled “Accept”, “Customize” and “More info”, without either the “X” command or the “Reject” button being provided to continue browsing using only technical cookies;

- accessing the “Customize” button opened a drop-down menu with two pre-selected options, the first referring to “necessary cookies”, which could not be deselected, the second to “advertising and profiling cookies”, which could be deselected;

- the number of cookies installed on the browser used for the assessment, both with both options active and with the deselection of “advertising and profiling cookies”, was always equal to 22;

SEEN the note of 11 September 2023 (prot. 126366/23) with which, pursuant to art. 166, paragraph 5, of the Code, the Authority communicated to Onlinestore S.r.l. the initiation of the procedure for the possible adoption of the measures referred to in art. 58, paragraph 2, of the Regulation and the alleged violations of the law, identified, in this case, in the violation of art. 4 point 11; 5; 7; 12; 13; 24 and 25 of the Regulation and art. 122 of the Code, as well as the indications contained in the Cookie Guidelines, attributable to the failure to provide clear and transparent information and to the failure to configure the banner in such a way as to allow the user to express informed, free and granular consent to the use of cookies other than technical cookies or to continue browsing with the default settings, without the use of cookies other than technical cookies;

HAVING ACKNOWLEDGED that the brief submitted on 10 October 2023 (ref. 138498/23) – to be understood as fully reported and reproduced here – and taking into account what was stated therein by the data controller regarding the fact of “not having carefully checked the setting of cookies on the site, also because there was no report in this regard”;

HAVING ACKNOWLEDGED that the Company did not contest the alleged violations indicated by the Office with the note of 11 September 2023 relating to the initiation of the sanctioning procedure;

HAVING ACKNOWLEDGED that the Company also promptly took the site offline;

NOTING that, based on the elements acquired during the investigation, at the time of the investigation the owner was found to have violated the obligation to provide clear and transparent information and to configure the banner in such a way as to allow the user to express informed, free and granular consent to the use of cookies other than technical cookies or to continue browsing with the default settings, without the use of cookies other than technical cookies, with consequent violation of Articles 4, point 11, 5, 7, 12, 13, 24 and 25 of the Regulation and Article 122 of the Code, as well as the indications contained in the Cookie Guidelines;

CONSIDERING the appreciable effort of the owner to remedy the contested violations by promptly taking the site offline and showing broad cooperation with the Authority;

CONSIDERING, therefore:

a) to have to address to the data controller, pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, letter a), of the Regulation, a warning so that, if you intend to put the site www.onlinestore.it online again, you will comply with the processing of personal data carried out through the use of cookies and other tracking tools in accordance with the applicable law, by publishing clear and transparent information and, in the case of use of cookies other than technical cookies, by configuring a banner that allows you to provide informed, free and granular consent or continue browsing with the default settings, without the use of cookies other than technical cookies;

b) due to the specific nature of the investigation, to be able to disregard in this case the adoption of pecuniary sanctions, limiting itself to sending Onlinestore S.r.l a warning pursuant to art. 58, par. 2, letter b) of the Regulation, for failure to comply with the provisions set out in the matter of processing of personal data through the use of cookies and other tracking tools; CONSIDERING that the conditions exist to proceed with the annotation in the internal register of the Authority referred to in art. 57, par. 1, letter u), of the Regulation, in relation to the measures adopted in this case against Onlinestore S.r.l. in accordance with art. 58, par. 2, of the Regulation itself;
