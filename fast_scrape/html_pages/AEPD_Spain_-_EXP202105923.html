<p>The Spanish DPA fined a controller €60,000 for violating <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1d" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(d) GDPR</a> by delivering a customer's contract to the wrong address.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA after a personal data breach. The controller, an electric and gas company, sent the data subject's contract to the wrong address. 
</p><p>The data subject had previously held a contract with the controller at their address, which was cancelled when the data subject moved. The data subject had indicated their new address when they registered again with the controller, but the controller had activated its online invoice service without updating the data subject's contact information, causing the new contract to be sent to the old address. 
</p><p>When the contract was mistakenly delivered to the old address, the data subject had a restraining order on the current resident, who now had access to, among other things, the data subject's current address.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA held that the controller had violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1d" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(d) GDPR</a> ("accuracy") for not keeping the data subject's contact information up to date. It considered the controller's negligence and routine handling of personal data as aggravating factors. For this infraction the DPA assessed a fine of €100,000. The controller ultimately paid €60,000, taking advantage of two reductions available for admitting responsibility and paying the fine before the resolution of the sanctioning procedure. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>The Spanish DPA found that the controller violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1d" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(d) GDPR</a> ("accuracy"), but a more natural conclusion would be to find a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1d" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32(1)(d) GDPR</a> ("adoption of adequate technical and procedural measures"). This somewhat strained interpretation may be explained by the fact that the LOPDGDD categorizes <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5 GDPR</a> violations as "very serious" and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32(1) GDPR</a> violations as merely "serious." The two categories differ both in statute of limitations and maximum fine.
