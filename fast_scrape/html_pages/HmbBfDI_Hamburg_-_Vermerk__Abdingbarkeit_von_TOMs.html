<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The DPA discussed to what extent controllers and processors must implement technical and organizational measures according to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>. It then answered the question whether the data subject can consent to a data processing which does not necessarily meet the requirements of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>To what extent are the provisions in Article 32 GDPR obligatory and thus, not subject to the preferences of the data subject?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The authority holds that Article 32 GDPR contains a number of obligations for controllers and processors, which allows for a certain margin of discretion. However, these obligations do not extend to data subjects. It is argued that data subjects have the right to consent to any conceivable data processing (e.g. those lacking certain technical and organizational measures), even if others might consider such processing harmful. The authority’s argument is based on Article 8(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights which explicitly mentions consent as a central element of data processing. Thus, according to the supervisory authority a data subject can, for example, consent to the sending of an email without proper encryption, even though Article 32 GDPR stipulates such a technical measure for certain emails.
</p><p>It is important to note that only Article 6(1)(a) GDPR allows for such a derogation from Article 32. The other legal basis in Article 6 restricts a data subject’s „disposition capability“.
</p><p>As mentioned above, only the data subject can consent to a derogation from the requirements of Article 32 GDPR. Nevertheless, Article 25(1) GDPR stipulates that the „controller shall, both at the time of the determination of means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organizational measures“. This means that regardless of a data subject’s eventual choice, a controller must have appropriate measures implemented, only then can a data subject consent to a data processing without the appropriate technical and organizational measures.
</p><p>The controller must also ensure that, if a data subject consents to a data processing without sufficient technical and organizational measures, the requirements of Article 7 GDPR are fulfilled. Otherwise, as is the case with all processing activities based on consent, the data processing is not in compliance with the GDPR.

                      Note: omission of TOMs (Art. 32 GDPR)

1. Issue and basic considerations


Article 32 of the GDPR provides that those responsible and contract processors have suitable technical and

contract processors through pseudonymization or encryption of personal data
as well as by ensuring confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience

The GDPR does not stipulate any specific protection in Article 32 of the GDPR.

level, but obliges those responsible to weigh up the risks
the processing and implementation costs as well as the type, scope, circumstances

and the purpose of the processing.

Recital 83 GDPR shows the standards according to which this balancing is to be carried out.

Could cause damage. "

Recital 83 GDPR states the purpose of the regulation:

"These measures should take into account the state of the art and the implementation

guarantee a level of protection (...) that is compatible with the risks emanating from the processing

risks and is appropriate to the type of personal data to be protected. "

The person responsible or the processor must therefore check which risks arise

                            Data protection and freedom of information



                         Note: omission of TOMs (Art. 32 GDPR)
                                       2
at the same time a (judgment) leeway. This does not apply if the person responsible for a very

agreed protective measure is legally required. This should be the exception
     3
because it depends on an overall assessment of the protective measures taken,
which must first guarantee the necessary protection in their entirety. However, can

the protection requirements of the data require that at least one of several conceivable technical

protective measures are taken if this corresponds to the state of the art.
