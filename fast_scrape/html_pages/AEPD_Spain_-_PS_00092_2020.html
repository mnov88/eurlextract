<pre>DECISION ON DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS
In the sanctioning procedure PS/00092/2020, instructed by the Spanish
Data Protection, before the entity, GROW BEATS SL, with CIF B02623601, holder
of the website, ***URL.1 (hereinafter "the requested entity"), for alleged infringement of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
27/04/16, relating to the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data and the Free Circulation of such Data (RGPD) and for alleged infringement of Law 34/2002, of July 11, on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce (LSSI), based on the following
BACKGROUND
FIRST: On 16/05/19, the following complaint was filed with this Agency
by Ms. A.A.A., (hereinafter, "the complainant"), in which she indicated, among others, the following
"On April 1, 2019, I placed an order for two pairs of headphones on the website
***URL.1. Nowhere on this website is the actual name of
the company, the CIF, nor the physical address of the entity. Neither is there any reference to the data protection law that online stores are obliged to indicate. When you pay by card, you are not sent to a secure gateway".
SECOND: In view of the facts set out in the complaint and the documents
provided by the claimant, the Subdirectorate General for Data Inspection proceeded
to take action for clarification, under the investigative powers granted to the supervisory authorities in Article 57(1) of Regulation (EU)
2016/679 (RGPD). Thus, on 12/07/19, 15/12/19 and 20/01/20, information requests are addressed to the requested entity.
THIRD: On 25/02/20, the entity complained of presented a written statement to the
Agency, in which, among other things, it indicates:
"Sorry for the delay in responding to this but for various reasons it has been impossible for us to do so more promptly. Likewise, we appreciate the consideration of sending a copy of the same in paper format, since it is a
The newly created entity is still in the process of adaptation in terms of
new regulations on communication with the authorities.
With respect to the information required by a claim filed with this AEPD
on 16 May 2019, we have to report that the obligations imposed on Data Protection to
those who own a web page in which personal data can be incorporated; having verified the fulfillment of the decalogue that
You refer us yourselves.
Likewise, they should not exist on the date when the complaint was made to the AEPD
gaps or non-compliance on the website since it is hosted, and was developed, in

an internet platform (SHOPIFY) specialized in making available to freelancers or new entrepreneurs models of websites to open up trade to the internet, and we assumed that this tool already provided all the
notices, models and warranties to serve the purpose for which it is offered.
In this way, and as we are assured on the platform itself, if there were secure payment systems that would guarantee the privacy and protection of the users' data
of the website and in fact, no breach or damage to any user has occurred. Even so, everything related to the payment platform has been improved by incorporating
other secure payment platforms and have been reviewed and implemented on the web all
the warnings and consents set out in the regulations.
Without prejudice to all this, and to the fact that we understand that the regulations on data protection are being complied with, this entity has commissioned an evaluation of
risks to a specialized company to carry out a diagnosis and propose
corrective measures where appropriate.
In any case, I would like to insist once again that it has been and is the will of this entity to act in accordance with data protection regulations, that we always trust in specialised entities in the sector and that there is a total predisposition to collaborate with the AEPD to guarantee the protection of our clientele's data and
on this basis we would appreciate any guidance or recommendation that from the
AEPD could make us".

In the present case, two aspects of the website ***URL.1.
On the other hand, in the privacy policy it still refers to the fulfillment of the Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13, on the Protection of Personal Data
(LOPD), and without having yet applied the new RGPD, which according to its Article 99, would enter
in force as of 25/05/18, it being noted that the claimed entity is NOT applying the provisions of Article 13 of the aforementioned RGPD, which establishes the information that must be provided to the interested party at the time of collection of its data
personal.
These facts constitute an infringement, attributable to the defendant, for violation of Article 13 of the RGPD, since his website was not adapted to the RGPD and not
provide the user with the information set out therein, at the time of
collection of your personal data.
For its part, Article 72.1.h) of the LOPDGDD, considers very serious, for the purposes of
the omission of the duty to inform the affected person about the treatment of
your personal data in accordance with Articles 13 and 14 of the GPRS'.
This infringement is punishable by a fine of up to 20,000,000 euros or, in the case of a company, of up to 4&#160;% of the total annual turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is the greater
higher amount, in accordance with Article 83.5(b) of the GPRS.

On the other hand, regarding the Cookie Policy of the claimed website, in its first

Also, no mechanism to reject all cookies.
These facts constitute an infraction, attributable to the defendant, for violation of Article 22.2 of the LSSI, according to which
"Service providers may use data storage and retrieval devices in the terminal equipment of the recipients, provided that the recipients have given their consent after the information has been provided
clear and complete on its use, in particular on the purposes of the processing of

of personal data protection.
Where technically possible and effective, the consent of the recipient to
accepting the processing of the data may be facilitated by the use of the
appropriate browser or other applications.
The above shall not preclude possible storage or access of a technical nature to the
to effect the transmission of a communication over a communications network
electronic or, to the extent strictly necessary, for the provision of
an information society service expressly requested by the recipient".
This infringement is classified as "minor" in Article 38.4 g) of the aforementioned law, which
considers as such: "Use data storage and retrieval devices

Following the evidence obtained in the preliminary investigation phase, it is considered that
The penalty to be imposed should be graduated according to the following criteria established in Article 40 of the ISSA:

the reported entity the determination of a system for obtaining informed consent that is consistent with the mandate of the ISSA.
- The period of time during which the infringement has been committed, as the complaint was filed in May 2019, (section b).
In accordance with these criteria, it is considered appropriate to impose on the entity complained of
a penalty of EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros), for the infringement of Article 22(2) of
LSSI.
Therefore, in accordance with the above, by the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
