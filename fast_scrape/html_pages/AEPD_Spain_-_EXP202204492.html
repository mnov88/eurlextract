<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A telecommunications service provider, ORANGE ESPAGNE, S.A.U. (the controller), registered a telephone number with a fraudulent third party who used the data subject's personal information. The data subject found out about the theft of their identity after receiving a call from the police informing them that fraud had been committed with the unlawfully contracted telephone number. Subsequently, the data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA. 
</p><p>During the proceedings, the DPA received a written reply from the controller indicating that as soon as it became aware of the facts, it classified the number as an irregular activation, ordering the corresponding adjustments in favour of the data subject. The adjustements included the rectification of any incorrectly issued invoices and documents. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA recalled that in order for the processing of personal data to be lawful, it needs to have a legal basis under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a>. In this case, the data subject did not consent to the processing nor entered any contract with the controller, rendering any subsequent processing unlawful. Furthermore, the controller did not adequately verify the identity of the person requesting the contract, in order to prevent identity theft.
</p><p>The DPA held that the controller violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a> by concluding a telephone contract with an unauthorised person, giving rise to the theft of the data subject's identity. Pursuant to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR" title="Article 83 GDPR">Article 83 GDPR</a>, the DPA imposed a fine on the controller. The DPA took into account aggravating circumstances provided in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2018-16673&amp;tn=2">Article 76(2)(b) of the Spanish Data Protection Law</a>, following <a href="/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR" title="Article 83 GDPR">Article 83(2)(k) GDPR</a>, and set a fine of €50,000. In particular, the DPA considered as an aggravating factor the fact that the controller was a telecommunications services provider who processed personal data on a large scale. 
</p><p>However, the controller benefited from reductions due to voluntary payment and acknowledgement of guilt, with the final amount set to €30,000.

Likewise, it is indicated that all recovery actions that
may exist and, that the claimant's data has never been transferred to files of

patrimonial solvency at the request of this company.

They are manifested as concrete measures aimed at avoiding this type of
fraudulent practices the following:


• Controls in applications for registration/portability/in-flight migration: rules applied in
scoring.

Therefore, if it is rejected before activation, the registration would not take place.


These actions are carried out by an external platform.

• Daily controls on orders processed from CCNNPP (teleshopping and eshop).

As in the previous case, if it is rejected before activation, there is no registration.


• Audits on FIDE provider platforms, by provider analysts, who
They report at the time of detection and weekly.

The solution varies depending on the case, being able to find ourselves before: cancellations of
orders and/or requests for portability, suspension of lines, cancellations of

fixed provision, to cite a few examples.

• Periodic checks of unpaid customers or concentration of bank accounts in
JAZZTEL.


• Management in the CRMs (company systems) of claims, escalated by
different functional groups by unrecognized lines/orders.

• Daily registration validation controls and identity portability, verifying
in the census if the NIE or NIF coincides with the name and surnames that appear in the
application.


• Management of claims for inclusion in asset solvency files.

As evidenced, through the control systems created, ORANGE has
knowledge of the existence of possible irregularities in the contracting of
services, and after the corresponding studies and analysis, is in a position to

classify it as fraudulent, proceeding to stop any
recovery action, as well as the rectification of all those invoices issued
inappropriately.
