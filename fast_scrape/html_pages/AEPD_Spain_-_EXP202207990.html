<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>Repsol (the controller) is a Spanish multinational energy and petrochemical provider. The controller contacted a data subject regarding their next periodic and mandatory gas inspection. The data subject responded to clarify that their home had already gone through an inspection recently, and found out that there was another location registered under their name and ID that they were unaware of. In January 2022, the controller mistakenly included the personal data of the data subject in two contracts of another client. The controller included the data subject’s full name, but not their ID or bank account information (these corresponded to the other client). The controller then changed the contract information for both contracts in March 2022, but the data subject still received bills from the contract.      
</p><p>The data subject filed a complaint to the DPA on 22 June 2022. The controller argued that there was no violation of the GDPR because it was a human error resulting from the complete similarity between the data subjects’ names. Furthermore, the controller argued that there was no violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>, because it had appropriate technical and organisational measures in place at the time. The controller also stated that in the case the DPA found a violation, the statute of limitations will have passed.  
</p><p>The DPA began the sanctioning procedure against the controller on 27 May 2024.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA first dismissed the argument on statute of limitations. According to the DPA, the statute of limitations (2 years) had not passed, because the data subject had received bills in July 2022 on the contract mistakenly attributed to them. 
</p><p>The DPA found a violation of the principle of data accuracy (<a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(d) GDPR</a>). The DPA considered that, while the names were similar, they were not exactly the same. Furthermore, other data such as their ID and bank account were different. The DPA stated that the incident could have been avoided if the controller had checked the all the clients’ data. The DPA considered this a reasonable measure the controller could have taken, and therefore the requirements of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1d" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(d) GDPR</a> were not met. Finally, the DPA highlighted the important consequences that data inaccuracy can have on a data subject, as stated in national case law.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> 
</p><p>Another issue was the fact that the data subject had access to the other clients’ information through the bills sent to them. This included information on how much the person consumed or the unique identifier of the location. The DPA found a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>, which gives the controller the obligation to implement adequate technical and organisational measures taking into account the risks involved in the processing. 
</p><p>The risk of human error is one of the factors the controller should have taken into account due to the high number of employees working for the controller. The scale and regularity of processing, according to the DPA, also increases the risk and therefore the expectations of compliance of the controller. Finally, the DPA considered that the controller had not addressed the existing risk of human errors, despite the controller detecting it. This posed a widespread risk for future contracts, and had significant implications for the right to privacy enshrined in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1978-31229#a18">Article 18 of the Spanish Constitution</a>. 
</p><p>The DPA fined the controller €1,380,000 in total: €130,000 for the violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1d" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(d) GDPR</a>, and €1,250,000 for the violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>. The DPA considered the constant data processing of the controller as a large company as an aggravating factor.

SANCTIONING PROCEDURE RESOLUTION

From the procedure initiated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based

on the following

BACKGROUND

FIRST: On June 13, 2022, A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complainant)

filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
complaint is directed against REPSOL COMERCIALIZADORA DE ELECTRICIDAD Y
GAS S.L.U., with NIF B39540760 (hereinafter, the respondent). The grounds for the claim are as follows:

The complainant states that, on February 15, 2022, she learned that the respondent had contracted gas and electricity services, using her personal data, without her consent, at a supply point unknown to her, giving access to her data to a third-party contract holder.

After calling, she was told that it had been an error due to a "data cross-check," and the contracts were canceled.

The complainant states that after requesting written cancellation of these terms, he received an email on March 14, 2022, informing him that the cancellation had been recorded since March 4, 2022.

Along with the complaint, he provides emails exchanged with the data protection officer, in which he requested to know the measures that had been taken regarding the leak of his personal data without his consent. He received a response on May 24, 2022, but regarding information corresponding to a request to exercise the right to access his personal data, which the complainant indicates he had not made.

Likewise, the claim filed on July 6, 2022, includes an electricity bill issued by the respondent in June 2022, which

includes the billing period between May 5, 2022, and June 8, 2022, for an amount of ***AMOUNT euros, relating to a supply point in ***LOCATION.1.

SECOND: In accordance with Article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5,

2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), this claim was forwarded to the respondent,
so that it could analyze it and inform this Agency within one month of the actions taken to comply with the requirements set forth in the data protection regulations.

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), via electronic notification, was received on July 28, 2022, as evidenced by the certificate in the file.

On August 22, 2022, this Agency received a response letter indicating that on January 13, 2022, a person other than the complainant requested a change of ownership of the electricity and gas supplies, a change that was made in the complainant's file "due to the almost identical correspondence between names."

Once the complaining party contacted the respondent, the Data Protection Officer's team immediately proceeded to analyze the incident, deeming it unnecessary to notify the AEPD of the security breach "since the breach did not pose a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals." The complaining party was informed of the decision taken within the framework of a right of access.

The complaint is considered to be a one-time human error in the change of ownership in favor of a third party who is also a client of the entity. The invoices received by the complaining party are the result of this change.

The complaint reports that a series of measures have been adopted to prevent the repetition of errors of this type. Likewise, training campaigns have been planned for the agents to strengthen change of ownership procedures and prevent a similar incident.

Finally, it adds that all relevant measures have been taken to

regularize the ownership of the electricity and gas supplies, deleting the complainant's personal data.

THIRD: On August 30, 2022, after analyzing the documentation in the file, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency issued a resolution declining the claim. The

resolution was notified to the complainant on August 30, 2022, as evidenced in the file.

FOURTH: On September 7, 2022, the appellant filed an optional appeal for reconsideration through the AEPD Electronic Registry against the decision in file EXP202207990. In this appeal, the appellant expressed its disagreement with the contested decision, providing new documentation and new facts, and arguing that the respondent reported that two contracts had been erroneously registered in the appellant's name and terminated (***CONTRACT.1 and ***CONTRACT.2). Despite this, upon terminating the electricity contract ***CONTRACT.2, the appellant registered a new contract, ***CONTRACT.3, for which invoices have continued to be issued after the appellant's complaint and whose cancellation is not known to the appellant. Therefore, the appellant's complaint has not yet been adequately addressed. C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 3/51

Additionally, it notes that on May 24, 2022, the respondent informed the respondent, in response to the right of access, that its data was not being processed for any purpose and was blocked to comply with legal obligations.
However, after this date, the appellant received invoices for the contract that remained active, as well as an informative communication from the respondent on July 1, 2022. Therefore, it considers that its data, contrary to the respondent's claims, continues to be processed beyond the legal obligation to block, in a manner contrary to regulations.

Finally, it notes that the respondent has not taken measures to prevent the use of the appellant's personal data communicated to third parties, without having requested their deletion.

Subsequently, on September 9, 2022, the respondent stated that he received an email from another entity regarding an independent improper billing procedure, which he considered to be a new incorrect processing.

FIFTH: On March 8, 2023, the appeal was forwarded to the respondent within the framework of the provisions of Article 118.1 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP) for the purpose of formulating allegations and submitting any documents and supporting documents it deemed appropriate, which was verified by means of a response letter dated March 23, 2023.

SIXTH: On April 11, 2023, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency decided to uphold the appeal for reconsideration filed against the decision of this Agency issued on August 30, 2022, and to admit the claim for processing in accordance with the provisions of Article 65 of the Spanish Data Protection Agency. the
LOPDGDD.

SEVENTH: The Subdirectorate General for Data Inspection proceeded to carry out preliminary investigative actions to clarify the facts in question, pursuant to the functions assigned to the supervisory authorities in
Article 57.1 and the powers granted in Article 58.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), and in accordance with the provisions of Title VII, Chapter I, Section Two, of the LOPDGDD.

EIGHTH: On January 19, 2024, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency decided, first, to declare the expiration of the preliminary investigation procedures since more than twelve months had elapsed since the date the claim was admitted for processing, without the resolution initiating the sanctioning procedure having been issued and notified, and second, to open new investigation procedures, incorporating the documentation comprising the preliminary investigation procedures that were declared expired. NINTH: The Subdirectorate General of Data Inspection proceeded to carry out preliminary investigations to clarify the facts in question, pursuant to the functions assigned to the supervisory authorities in Article 57.1 and the powers granted in Article 58.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), and in accordance with the provisions of Title VII, Chapter I, Section Two, of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act), having been informed of the following:

When a consumer decides to contract an electricity and/or gas supply with a supplier of their choice, the supplier requests access for that consumer to the distributor corresponding to the network to which they wish to connect, providing them with the data. necessary to manage the supply point, in compliance with current data protection regulations.
Similarly, when a modification to the current access contract is necessary, for example, a change of ownership, the marketer is the one who has the consumer's data and processes the request with the distributor on their behalf.

All information exchanges between distributors and marketers are carried out using the Format defined by the National Commission of Markets and Competition (CNMC) for each process.

The Format defines the flow of communications or messages exchanged between the agents involved, i.e., distributors and marketers, the deadlines established for sending messages, cases of concurrency with other processes, reasons for rejection and incidents, as well as the electronic communication files that must be used to transmit each message.
This exchange of communications or messages between marketers and distributors is carried out through the Transport and Distribution Communication System (hereinafter, "SCTD"). The SCTD is, therefore, an exchange whose mission is to ensure that communication is carried out following the formats defined by the CNMC.

Specifically, the format defined for access contract modifications is the M1 format, in the case of electricity supply, and the A1-05 format, in the case of gas supply. For further details, the Access Contract Modification process can be consulted in Resolution INF/DE/152/15 at the following link:

Regarding the facts

The complainant confirms that on February 15, 2022, he received an SMS from the gas distribution company informing him of the date of the next mandatory periodic inspection of the gas installation, adding:

"Since this inspection was carried out at my home at the end of October 2020 and is due every 5 years, I contacted the gas distribution company to clarify. They told me that, indeed, the inspection was not required, but that there was another gas supply point in ***LOCALITY.1 associated with my ID and first and last name with the company REPSOL and that I should contact them.

I called the REPSOL phone number they provided me and they informed me that not only was there a gas contract with my information, but also an electricity contract at the same supply point in ***LOCALITY.1.

I did not sign these contracts with REPSOL, and the address of the supply point is completely unrelated to me."

The complainant provides the following invoices issued by REPSOL in its name and associated with the supply point in ***LOCALITY.1, which it does not recognize:

INVOICE PERIOD
Gas Rectification 01/14/2022 - 02/14/2022

Electricity 03/04/2022 - 05/05/2022
Electricity 05/05/2022 - 06/08/2022
Electricity Rectification 03/04/2022 - 05/05/2022

Electricity Rectification 05/05/2022 - 06/08/2022

The customer information on the invoices includes the complainant's name and ID number. The complainant indicates that the bank account number included on the invoices does not belong to it and that no charges/credits have been made to date in relation to said contracts.

Furthermore, the complainant has signed an electricity supply contract with (...) from February 2019 to July 28, 2022.

The contracts that the complainant does not recognize are associated with the following supply points, for gas and electricity, respectively:

- ***CODE.1

It is confirmed that on January 14, 2022, REPSOL REYG sent the gas distributor a request for a change of ownership in favor of the complainant. The distributor activated this request for change of ownership in favor of the complaining party on January 14, 2022.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 6/51

It is confirmed that on March 3, 2022, the distributor received a new request for change of ownership from REPSOL REYG in favor of a different person,
Customer C. Therefore, the complaining party is no longer listed as the owner of the gas supply when this new request is activated, on March 3, 2022.

- ***CODE.2

It is confirmed that on January 14, 2022, REPSOL REYG sent the electricity distributor a request to modify the access contract, due to a change of ownership by transfer, in favor of the complaining party. The distributor activated this
request for change of ownership in favor of the complainant on January 16, 2022.

It is confirmed that on March 3, 2022, the distributor received a new request for change of ownership from REPSOL REYG in favor of a different person,
Customer C. Therefore, the complainant is no longer listed as the owner of the gas supply when this new request is activated on March 5, 2022.
In the context of the investigation, REPSOL REYG states:

On January 14, 2022, a request for a change of supplier with a change of ownership was received from a person other than the complainant (hereinafter "Customer A") (FILE 1). Since the first and last names correspond almost identically, the request is executed in the complainant's customer file. At this time, the first request for change of ownership is being sent to the distributor as a result of Client A's registration with RE&amp;G.

In the request dated January 14, 2022, the distributor is provided with the data contained in the complainant's customer file. Due to the identity of the complainant's first and last names, the two new contracts for Client A are recorded in the file. Since the complainant is a Repsol RE&amp;G customer, the source of the data communicated to the distributor is none other than the interested party itself.

In FILE 1 provided, Request for Change of Ownership of the Electricity/Gas Contract, Evidence EXP202207990 of entry REGAGE23e00047317903, it is verified that the first and last names appearing in the NEW HOLDER'S DETAILS and I DECLARATION (B.B.B.) fields match the first and last names,

in a different order, of the complainant (A.A.A.).
When the respondent asked for documentation proving that the complainant is a REPSOL REYG customer, the respondent stated:
Although we do not have the contract signed by the complainant because, at the time of the contract execution on January 22, 2011, the systems belonged to (...).

REPSOL REYG provides a screenshot of its systems showing the start and end dates of the contractual relationship between the complainant and REPSOL REYG as January 22, 2011, and February 4, 2019, respectively. Document 4 of the
entry REGAGE23e00075463061.
REPSOL REYG also provides a screenshot of the complainant's customer file. The information it contains is: first name, last name, ID number, and mobile phone number. The complainant's customer file contains the alert (…).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 7/51

REPSOL REYG indicates that this alert was generated on February 4, 2019, the date on which the contract with the complainant ended.

Regarding the retention period for its customers' data, REPSOL REYG informs that it has defined a retention period of 6 years from the end of the contractual relationship, in compliance with applicable legislation. This period applies to all REPSOL REYG customers, regardless of whether they come from subsequently acquired companies. Consequently, the personal data of the complainant, a former REPSOL REYG customer, will be deleted once the aforementioned retention period has elapsed.
Regarding the applicable regulations under which the retention periods for customer data have been defined, REPSOL REYG states that it has taken into consideration:

i. Article 30 of the Commercial Code, which establishes a retention and safekeeping period for the entrepreneur's books and documents of six (6) years from the last entry made in the books.

i. Articles 60 et seq. of the General Tax Law, which establish a four (4) year statute of limitations for liabilities, during which the Tax Agency may request any type of documentation.

ii. Article 1964.2 of the Royal Decree of July 24, 1889, publishing the Civil Code, which establishes a five (5) year period from which compliance with the obligation may be required.

iii. Articles 123.4 et seq. of Royal Legislative Decree 1/2007, of November 16, approving the revised text of the General Law for the Defense of Consumers and Users and other complementary laws, which establishes a three (3) year period applicable to contracts made by telephone or digital channels (distance contracting).

iv. Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights, which establishes a three (3) year statute of limitations for very serious violations arising from the processing of personal data.
v. Law 24/2013, on the electricity sector, and Law 34/1998, on hydrocarbons, which

establishes a five (5) year retention period for data relating to transactions in electricity and gas supply contracts signed with wholesale customers and transmission network operators, as well as with storage and LNG network operators, in order to make them available to the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism, the Autonomous Communities, or the CNMC.

Considering the diversity of time periods established by applicable legislation, a period of six (6) years has been established, of which five (5) years correspond to the active retention period and one (1) year to the blocking period, in compliance with the obligation established in Article 32 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act).
Additionally, REPSOL REYG states that it is developing a project to improve the automation of data blocking and deletion. In relation to this project, it states:

REPSOL REYG's procedure for processing access contract modifications due to changes in ownership

REPSOL REYG follows the Change of Ownership Procedure in effect at the time of the incident, FILE_3 of the REGAGE23e00047203945 entry, where the first step in processing the request is to identify the contacting customer by applying the Security Policy, FILE_4 of the REGAGE23e00047203945 entry.

 The Change of Ownership Procedure provided includes:

1.1.1.1 Identification of the account holder

Identify the customer contacting Repsol by applying the Security Policy.
1.1.1.1 Preliminary checks and analysis of information

Check whether the customer is a Repsol customer or not and whether a customer file exists, and verify
whether there is any debt.

If the customer has sent documentation, check whether we have all the documentation to carry out the corresponding procedure.

[…]

Repsol Reyg also adds:

On August 11, 2022, following the first request for information from the
AEPD (Spanish Data Protection Agency), the Change of Ownership Procedure was updated, including an

explicit reference to the obligation to perform searches in the systems using the interested party's DNI (National Identity Document), so as to avoid human errors or malpractice that could lead to incidents similar to the one that occurred.

 In the Security Policy provided, in the Ex-Customer section, it is stated:

Whenever we access the file of a former customer, an alert will appear.

For this type of customer, we must follow the usual Security Protocol, except for the last question, the one from the bank.

The following questions will be asked:
1) Owner's ID

1) Contact: phone/email (at least one)
2) Supply point address

REPSOL REYG certifies that Client A provided the Change of Ownership Request document, entry REGAGE23e00047205302, and indicates that she also provided

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 9/51

a photocopy of her ID and the property deeds, as proof of "fair title" to the supply points ***CODE.2 for electricity and ***CODE.1 for gas.

Regarding the invoices issued,

The complainant is listed as the owner of the electricity and gas supply points,

***CODE.2 and ***CODE.1, for the periods from January 14, 2022, to March 5, 2022, and from January 14, 2022, to March 3, 2022, respectively.
The invoices generated by REPSOL REYG on behalf of

the complainant and related to the above supply points are identified below:

INVOICE PERIOD

1 Gas 01/14/2022 - 02/14/2022
2 Gas 02/15/2022 - 03/02/2022

3 Gas Rectification 01/14/2022 - 02/14/2022
4 Electricity 03/04/2022 - 05/05/2022
5 Electricity 05/05/2022 - 06/08/2022

6 Electricity Rectification 03/04/2022 - 05/05/2022
7 Electricity Rectification 05/05/2022 - 08/06/2022

Regarding the generation of these invoices, REPSOL REYG explains:
1. Invoice 1: This invoice was issued as a result of the initial human error

of the agent who processed the change of ownership for Customer A in the complaining party's customer file.

1. Invoice 2: This billing period covers the period from the detection of the incident on 02/15/2022, when the complaining party contacted REPSOL REYG Customer Service to report the error, until 02/28/2022, when the request for a change of ownership was sent to the distributor in favor of Customer C, with the change becoming effective on 03/03/2022.

2. Invoice 3: By canceling the erroneously generated contract, the invoices issued under the same error were canceled.

3. Invoice 4: As a result of the quality process carried out on June 17, 2022, focused on correcting the unusual changes that had occurred in the systems due to the incident, the invoice for that period was issued in the name of the complainant. This invoice was canceled on July 12, 2022, as it was an internal adjustment (Invoice 6).

4. Invoice 5: This invoice was generated under the same circumstances as the previous invoice. It was issued on the same date and canceled on July 12, 2022, by means of a corrective invoice (Invoice 7).

Regarding the communications sent to the complainant,

REPSOL REYG reports that this incident is exceptional in nature, and since the complainant had a high number of open complaints at the time of the incident, one of the agents serving both RÉGSITI and REPSOL
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 10/51

REYG, in order to provide its full cooperation in resolving the incident, consolidated different aspects into a single response.

As a result of this event, REPSOL REYG states that it has agreed to centralize the management of more complex cases in a single specialized agent, or "VIP Agent," to avoid errors or malpractice in the management of critical incidents and/or those affecting personal data. Document 7 of the entry REGAGE23e00075463486.

Regarding security measures

At the time the incident occurred, REPSOL REYG had established:

- Change of Ownership Procedure
- Security Policy

REPSOL REYG confirms that from the moment it became aware of the incident from the complainant, it adopted the appropriate measures to regularize the ownership of the affected electricity and gas supply points.

REPSOL REYG also reports that:

- (…).

- (…).

- (…).

- (…).

It agreed to correctly complete the information included in the technical requests for incident resolution, considering that it may be necessary to apply retroactive action so that requests are not automatically sent to the distributor when certain internal modifications are made.

File 8 of the REGAGE23e00047149400 entry.

- Reinforce with (...) so that when new contracts are created or cancelled, it is verified that, if they are not due to be invoiced, they remain blocked.

- The Repsol Group's Electricity and Gas business is designing a plan to improve compliance with the retention and blocking periods defined in the RAT.

Document 1 of entry REGAGE24e00010184889.

TENTH: According to the report collected from the AXESOR tool, the entity
REPSOL S.A. It is a large company, established in 1986, with a turnover of €2,417,000,000 in 2023.

ELEVENTH: On May 24, 2024, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against the respondent, pursuant to Articles 63 and 64 of the LPACAP (Spanish Data Protection Act), for the alleged violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, as defined in Article 83.5 of the GDPR, and for the alleged violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, as defined in Article 83.4 of the GDPR.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 11/51

The initiation agreement was notified in accordance with the rules established in the LPACAP,
via electronic notification, and was received on May 27, 2024, as
recorded in the certificate in the file.

TWELFTH: In response to the letter requesting an extension of the period granted to it to submit allegations, as well as a copy of the file, on May 29, 2024, the requested copy was sent in accordance with the provisions of
Article 53.1 a) of the LPACAP, and it was agreed to extend the period for submitting allegations
up to a maximum of five days, which should be counted from the day following
the end of the first period for allegations.

THIRTEENTH: After notification of the aforementioned initiation agreement in accordance with the rules established in the LPACAP, on June 17, 2024, the respondent submitted a written statement of allegations in which, in summary, it stated that

FIRST. - IN RELATION TO THE ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE 32 OF THE GDPR: VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF TYPICALITY AND, IN ANY CASE, STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR THE INFRINGEMENT

The Court considers that, in the present case, it is not possible to classify the defendant's conduct within the proposed infringement of Article 32 of the GDPR, in conjunction with Article 83.4 of the GDPR, as "appropriate technical and organizational measures were in place to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk," taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

In this regard, it states that it has been fully proven through the

documentation in the administrative file, as well as in the
responses to the requests made by the AEPD, that it had and has
in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk.

Thus, at the company level, it reports that it has a Corporate Information Asset Protection Policy, of global scope, applicable to all
company employees and all Repsol Group companies, as well as to
any third party that has access to any Repsol Group information. This Policy covers, among others, the security measures set forth in Article 32 of the GDPR, by way of example: implementing information classification and protection measures to ensure its confidentiality, integrity,

availability, and resilience (section 3.1. Protection Policy); establishing the mandatory nature and content of the Continuity Plans and mechanisms that allow for the recovery of information in the event of an incident affecting information assets (section 3.6. Protection Policy); the obligation to conduct mandatory periodic risk analyses on the company's various information assets (section 3. Protection Policy); etc. This document is attached as Document No. 1.

In addition to the above, it is stated that Repsol Comercializadora de Electricidad y Gas has established:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 12/51

(i) (…).

(ii) (…):

- (…).

- (…).

Therefore, it considers that the measures were adopted and appropriate (reasonable diligence) to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, so there is no violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, as it had established adequate measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. This is regardless of the result caused by a fortuitous, involuntary, and occasional human error, which only affected a single client, their name, surname, and ID number (not even their bank account); and that, in a completely proactive manner and in pursuit of excellence, once the situation was detected, the necessary measures were added to avoid similar future situations (strengthening existing ones). It insists again that the origin lies in human error, a one-off, isolated, and fortuitous event, so that in the face of an absolutely remote risk (the virtual identity of the first and last names of two clients), the prior establishment of other security levels cannot be required (contrary to the risk-based approach provided for in the second section of Article 32 of the GDPR). Zero risk does not exist. The measures adopted at the time fall within the reasonable diligence that can be expected in light of the risk. The opposite would lead to the absurdity of Article 32 of the GDPR being a violation of absolutely objective liability, since, even with appropriate technical and organizational measures, any minimal and involuntary error would entail, as the AEPD now intends, an analogical application of the sanctioning type, in clear violation of the principle of criminality. And let us remember that the Supreme Court considers this an
obligation of means and not of results, as this Administration claims.

Consequently, it finds that there would be no breach of the obligation
established in the applicable regulation, so there would not be, in the present case, a
perfect fit between the alleged conduct of the respondent party and that described in
the alleged type of infringement. Therefore, any sanctioning resolution would be
contrary to the aforementioned principles of legality and criminality and, therefore, would be null and void in accordance with the provisions of Article 47.1.a) of Law 39/2015. It considers that, based on the foregoing, the proceedings should be filed and dismissed.

In addition to the foregoing, and despite denying the existence of a violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, in its opinion, the violation would have expired, since

the Initiation Agreement was notified on May 27, 2024, and
the alleged infringing acts took place, as detailed in the Initiation Agreement and the Preliminary Action Report, on January 14, 2022, it is
clear and unquestionable that the two-year statute of limitations established by the Applicable Law for serious violations has expired.

Therefore, it considers that the sanction sought to be imposed would be null and void, as the statute of limitations for the violation had expired at the time this sanctioning procedure was initiated and notified.

SECOND. - IN RELATION TO THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 5.1.F AND 32 OF THE GDPR: VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF GUILT AND, SUBSIDIARY, OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY.

Violation of the principle of culpability.

It is stated that, since this is, at most, a case of very minor negligence, they should not be subject to sanction under a system of subjective liability such as that governing our sanctioning law, since it exceeds the maximum levels of diligence that can be required of a person that, under no circumstances, isolated (unintentional) human errors occur in the exercise of an activity with traffic as significant as that carried out by the defendant.

It argues that, since there is no such conscious intention to violate the applicable rule, the subjective element of the alleged offender cannot be considered concurrent, and therefore the imposition of a sanction would violate the principle of liability, a corollary of the principle of culpability, established in Article 28.1 of Law 40/2015, in conjunction with Article 25.1 of the Spanish Constitution.

Violation of the principle of proportionality

Subsidiarily to the above, and in the event that it is not taken into consideration (quod non), it is considered evident that the principle of proportionality has been violated in two areas: first, by establishing a fine instead of a warning (a less harmful measure available to the AEPD) and, second, by establishing fines that are grossly disproportionate, inappropriate, and unnecessary in light of the facts that occurred (€130,000 for the alleged violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR and €1,250,000 for the violation of Article 32 of the GDPR).

In its opinion, this Agency would not be respecting the general legal principle of proportionality, since (i) the sanctioning measure is not appropriate, as it is not effective in achieving the purpose it supposedly pursues (prior to the initiation of this case, as expressly indicated in the Preliminary Investigation Report, it "diligently adopted the appropriate measures to regularize the ownership of the contracts associated with the affected electricity and gas supply points and proceeded to strengthen its procedures"); (ii) it is also not necessary (since there are less burdensome or harmful measures, such as a warning); and (iii) it is far from proportional (since it is clear that imposing a fine of €1,380,000—given a human error that only affected a single client and only their first name, surname, and ID number—is a completely disproportionate measure, especially considering the legal doctrine and other cases of Sanctioning Resolutions issued by this Agency).

For all the foregoing reasons, it alleges that the Initiation Agreement would be null and void,

due to the disproportionate use of sanctioning powers, and therefore, the sanctioning procedure should be declared null and void.

Finally, and in addition to the previous allegations and in the hypothetical
case that they are not taken into consideration (quod non), Repsol
Comercializadora de Electricidad y Gas, S.L.U. understands that there has been a

violation of the principle of proportionality (Article 29 of Law 40/2015) by proposing sanctions in amounts higher than the minimum.

Based on the foregoing, the Initiation Agreement would be unlawful because it imposes a fine of €130,000 for the alleged violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR (duty of confidentiality) and €1,250,000 for the violation of Article 32 of the GDPR (security of processing). The reasoning in this regard is not sufficient or legally binding, and is contrary to the principle of proportionality (Articles 29 of Law 40/2015 and 35 of Law 39/2015, as well as Article 83.1 of the GDPR).

The Court alleges that it has been fully established that the cause of the error lies in the prior checks, "because there is a similarity with the name and surname of the complaining party (A.A.A.) and as a result of human error on the part of the agent, the contracts are binding on the complaining party."

Therefore, the nature of the error is a human error; it is a specific case (it only affected a single person, as you rightly acknowledge), and the seriousness of this error is limited to your first name, last name, and ID number. The statement that "it is likely to affect all contracts in a generalized manner" is manifestly unlawful and has not been proven by this Administration to aggravate the violation related to the security of processing. This subjective, uncertain, and probabilistic statement has no justification whatsoever. Aside from the fact that an uncertain, probabilistic, and unproven event such as this fact has not been proven. Aside from the fact that, as was made clear, the error occurred during a change of ownership and not in a contracting process, there is very little likelihood that there are many clients who share almost identical first and last names. And finally, there has been no damage or harm, as the complainant herself acknowledges and as stated in the Preliminary Investigation Report. Secondly, regarding the alleged aggravating factor of "intentionality or negligence in the action," it goes without saying that this was a single case, due to a single, fortuitous human error of little or no significance. Furthermore, the AEPD itself acknowledges that: "it is proven that, since REPSOL REYG became aware of the incident involving the complainant, it diligently adopted the appropriate measures to regularize the ownership of the contracts associated with the affected electricity and gas supply points and proceeded to strengthen its procedures as described throughout this report." This should lead not to the establishment of an aggravating factor, but rather a mitigating factor, given that it was a completely fortuitous event, combined with the "diligent" nature of the reinforcement measures. Based on the foregoing, it concludes that the Initiation Agreement violates the principle of proportionality provided for in Article 29 of Law 40/2015, in conjunction with Article 35 of Law 39/2015, as well as Article 83.1 of the GDPR, and that, therefore, this sanction should be reduced to the minimum possible amount. C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 15/51

Based on the foregoing, the Court requests that, considering the allegations to the Initiation Agreement issued within the framework of the aforementioned sanctioning procedure as formulated in a timely and proper manner, it be admitted and, in accordance with the provisions set forth therein, a resolution be issued ordering the closing of the proceedings and the administrative sanctioning procedure, pursuant to the provisions of Article 47.1.a) of Law 39/2015 or, where appropriate, alternatively, reducing the sanction to a minimum. All of this, for the reasons set forth.

FOURTEENTH: On April 24, 2025, a resolution proposal was made, proposing:

&lt;&lt;That the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency sanction
REPSOL COMERCIALIZADORA DE ELECTRICIDAD Y GAS, S.L., with Tax Identification Number (NIF) B39540760,

for violating Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR, classified in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.5 of the GDPR, classified as very serious for the purposes of the statute of limitations, in Article 72.1 a) of the LOPDGDD, with a fine of 130,000 euros.

- for the violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, classified in accordance with the provisions of

Article 83.4 of the GDPR, classified as serious for the purposes of the statute of limitations, in Article
73 f) of the LOPDGDD, with a fine of €1,250,000.&gt;&gt;

The aforementioned resolution proposal was sent, in accordance with the rules established in
the LPACAP, by electronic notification, and was received on April 25,

2025, as evidenced by the certificate in the file.

FIFTEENTH: On May 13, 2025, REPSOL COMERCIALIZADORA DE ELECTRICIDAD Y GAS, S.L., submitted a written statement of objections to the Proposed Resolution, which, in summary, basically reiterates the objections already presented throughout the sanctioning procedure, stating that there are grounds for the filing and dismissal of the sanctioning proceedings.

FIRST. - THE STATUTE OF STATUTES OF LAW FOR THE ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 32 OF THE GDPR AND THE VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S OWN ACTS.

In the opinion of Repsol Comercializadora de Electricidad y Gas, the violation of Article 32 of the GDPR has been subject to a statute of limitations.

It considers that the violation of Article 32 of the GDPR cannot be classified as permanent, but rather ends at the time the violation allegedly occurs. This is because the allegedly infringing obligation is that "appropriate technical and organizational measures have not been applied to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk." Therefore, once the human error that led to said violation has occurred, it asserts that this act completely completes the alleged violation, and that cessation of the conduct is not necessary, since the erroneous change in ownership of the supply points occurred on January 14, 2022, and with it, the alleged non-compliance, regardless of when the situation is reversed. That is,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 16/51

That is, it understands that the security of processing under Article 32 of the GDPR is a type of single violation (if the measures are not deemed appropriate) and cannot be classified as a permanent violation.

In the event that it is deemed permanent based on what is established in the administrative file, and in the Initiation Agreement itself and in the Preliminary Action Report, it considers that it is expressly indicated that the complaining party was incorrectly listed as the owner of the affected electricity and gas supply points from January 14, 2022, to March 3 or 5, 2022 (depending on the corresponding contract).

Therefore, it understands that the cessation of the conduct referred to in the Draft Resolution occurred, without any doubt, on March 3 or 5, 2022. Thus, it affirms that, given that the Commencement Agreement was dated May 24, 2024 (dies ad quem) and,

given that the alleged infringing acts took place, as detailed in the Commencement Agreement and in the Preliminary Action Report, on January 14, 2022 (or, where applicable, the conduct ceased on March 5, 2022) - dies a quo -, it considers that it is clear and unquestionable that the two-year statute of limitations established by the Applicable Law for serious infringements has been exceeded.

In conclusion, the Court understands that the sanction sought to be imposed would be null and void as the statute of limitations for the serious violation of Article 32 of the GDPR had expired at the time this sanctioning procedure was initiated.

SECOND. - VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF TYPICALITY: NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 5.1.D AND 32 OF THE GDPR.

The Court argues that it is not possible to sanction the entity based on the facts described, as its actions do not constitute any administrative violation, nor, in particular, a violation of Article 5.1.d) or Article 32 of the GDPR. Therefore, it considers that any sanctioning resolution in this sanctioning case would be null and void, pursuant to the provisions of Article 47.1.a) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations. ▪ Alleged violation of Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR (principle of accuracy)

The Court states that the proposed resolution changes the legal classification of the alleged infringing acts, due to an alleged violation of the principle of accuracy of Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR, as defined in Article 83.5.a) of the GDPR, given that the "facts giving rise to the allegation have remained unchanged."

The Court considers that it is not possible to subsume the alleged acts (the error in the change of ownership of the contracts by including the name, surname, and ID number in another client's file) under the obligation of Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR, since the obligation imposes "all reasonable measures to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are processed are deleted or rectified without delay."

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 17/51

That is, it understands that the obligation entails acting reasonably (deleting or rectifying inaccurate data) without delay, but it does not impose, as the Draft Resolution intends, by making a broad interpretation (proscribed by the principle of typicality) that whenever an error occurs and there is inaccurate data in a file, we are faced with a violation of the principle of accuracy of Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR. This is logical, since the opposite, it states, would lead to the absurdity of having to impose sanctions whenever there is inaccurate data for any reason.

Finally, it states that the fact that the client received a new invoice in June 2022 was not due to inaccurate processing data (the appropriate measures had already been diligently implemented), but rather an internal adjustment as a result of the quality assurance process. Therefore, there would be no violation of Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR, in conjunction with Article 83.5.a) of the GDPR. Therefore, any eventual resolution would violate the principle of criminality.

▪ Alleged violation of Article 32 of the GDPR (security of processing)

In this regard, it states that it had and has implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk.

It alleges that the measures previously implemented by
Repsol Comercializadora Electricidad y Gas are the result of an assessment of the risks inherent to the processing (among others, in response to a possible accidental alteration, as in the present case and as provided in the Recitals), for its security

and confidentiality, and that all necessary measures were taken to avoid "causing physical, material, or immaterial damage." Furthermore, it asserts that
no damage or harm, which is what the measures of Article 32 of the GDPR (in accordance with Recital 83) seek to avoid, has been caused to the
complainant, as stated in the Resolution Proposal itself: "(...) there has been no

damage or harm, as acknowledged by the complainant herself and as stated in the Preliminary Investigation Report." Therefore, it considers that the measures implemented have fulfilled their
purpose: to avoid causing physical, material, or immaterial damage or harm.

Therefore, it considers that there is no violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, since
Repsol Comercializadora de Electricidad y Gas reiterates that it had adequate measures in place to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk. This is regardless of the result caused by a fortuitous, involuntary, and occasional human error, which only affected a single customer, their name, surname, and ID number (not even their bank account); and that, in a completely proactive manner and in pursuit of excellence, once the situation was detected, it states that the necessary measures were added to prevent similar situations in the future (by strengthening existing ones).

It indicates that Zero Risk does not exist and that the measures adopted at the time are within the reasonable diligence that can be expected in light of the risk.

It concludes by stating that the facts for which the respondent is to be sanctioned (the mere existence of inaccurate data) do not constitute a violation of the principle of accuracy, which requires acting reasonably (by deleting or correcting) without delay when inaccurate data exists (not due to its mere existence); and it insists on the existence of appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk in accordance with the security of the processing; Therefore, it considers that the facts do not perfectly fit the alleged violation of the GDPR's obligations of accuracy and security, thereby violating the principle of legality and criminality. Therefore, any decision would be null and void in accordance with the provisions of Article 47.1.a) of Law 39/2015.

THIRD. - VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF FAULT.

In the opinion of the respondent, there is no administrative liability for the alleged infringing acts, as they are an involuntary human error.

The court states that, since this is, at most, a case of simple non-compliance, they should not be subject to sanction under a subjective liability system such as that governing our sanctioning law, since it exceeds the maximum levels of diligence that can be required of a person that, under no circumstances, should isolated (unintentional) human errors occur in the exercise of an activity with such significant traffic as that carried out by the defendant. It considers that this is a one-off, unintentional event, the result of an accidental error, with no significance whatsoever for the client. The Court concludes by stating that there is no conscious intent to violate the applicable rule, and therefore the subjective element of the alleged offense cannot be considered concurrent. Therefore, the imposition of a sanction would violate the principle of liability, a corollary of the principle of culpability, established in Article 28.1 of Law 40/2015, in conjunction with Article 25.1 of the Spanish Constitution.

FOURTH. - VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF GOOD FAITH, LEGAL SECURITY, AND EQUITY.

The Court reiterates that this was a one-off error and that the Court acted with complete diligence. The Court considers that the universal principle of fairness is not being respected and that it has acted in good faith, as this was a human error, of no consequence to the complainant. Therefore, it believes that the principles of good faith, legal certainty, and fairness have been violated by this disciplinary action.
FIFTH. - VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY.

It considers that the principle of proportionality has been violated in two areas:

- first, by establishing a fine instead of a warning (a less harmful measure available to the AEPD); and

- secondly, by establishing fines that are grossly disproportionate, inappropriate, and unnecessary in light of the facts that occurred (€130,000 for the alleged breach of Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR and €1,250,000 for the alleged violation of Article 32 of the GDPR).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 19/51

The Court states that the LOPDGDD (a special regulation subsequent to the GDPR, which also adapts data protection regulations to the Regulation and supplements its provisions) expressly provides for the possibility of a warning and that the sanctioning authority used by this Administration is completely disproportionate.

The Court states that the cause of the error lies in the prior checks, as there is a similarity with the complaining party's name and surname, and that the contract is due to human error on the part of the agent. Therefore, the nature of the error is human error, a completely isolated case (it only affected a single person), and the alleged seriousness of the error is limited solely to the complaining party's name, surname, and ID number, without any financial harm.

It considers that all of this should lead to the non-establishment of an aggravating factor, but, in any case, a mitigating factor, given that it was a completely fortuitous event, coupled with the "diligent" nature of the reinforcement measures.

The Court argues that the deterrent effect intended to be achieved with such a disproportionate fine does not fulfill its intrinsic function, that the Draft Resolution does not say anything about the existence of possible mitigating factors, and that there are numerous examples in which, in similar or much more serious situations, the fine was not so disproportionate.

Finally, it concludes by stating that the Draft Resolution would violate the principle of proportionality provided for in Article 29 of Law 40/2015, in conjunction with Article 35 of Law 39/2015, as well as Article 83.1 of the GDPR, and that, therefore, the Draft Resolution should be annulled or, alternatively, the penalty should be reduced to the
minimum amount possible.

For all these reasons, the Court requests that the statute of limitations be declared for the violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, that a resolution be issued ordering the closing of the proceedings and the administrative sanctioning procedure, pursuant to the provisions of Article 47.1.a) of Law 39/2015, for any of the reasons stated above, and that, in addition to the above, that the sanction be reduced to the minimum.

In light of all the actions taken by the Spanish Data Protection Agency in this proceeding, the following facts are considered proven:

PROVEN FACTS

FIRST: The complainant stated that they contacted the entity after receiving an SMS informing them of the date of the next mandatory periodic inspection of the gas installation, and added:

"Since this inspection was carried out at my home at the end of October 2020 and is due every 5 years, I contacted the gas distributor to clarify. They told me that, in fact, the inspection was not required, but that there was another gas supply point in ***LOCATION.1 associated with my ID number and first and last name

with the company REPSOL, and that I should contact them.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 20/51

I called the phone number provided by REPSOL and was informed that there was not only a gas contract with my information, but also an electricity contract
at the same supply point in ***TOWN.1.

I did not sign these contracts with REPSOL, and the address of the supply point is completely unknown to me."

SECOND: The contracts that the complaining party does not recognize are associated with the following supply points, for gas and electricity, respectively:

- ***CODE.1

It is proven that on January 14, 2022, REPSOL REYG sent the gas distributor a request for a change of ownership in favor of the complaining party. The distributor activated this request for a change of ownership in favor of the complaining party on January 14, 2022.

It is proven that on March 3, 2022, the distributor received a new request for a change of ownership from REPSOL REYG in favor of a different person, Client C. Therefore, the complaining party is no longer listed as the owner of the gas supply when this new request is activated on March 3, 2022. 2022.

- ***CODE.2

It is confirmed that on January 14, 2022, REPSOL REYG sent the electricity distributor a request for modification to the access contract, due to a change of ownership by transfer, in favor of the complaining party. The distributor activated this request for change of ownership in favor of the complaining party on January 16, 2022.

It is confirmed that on March 3, 2022, the distributor received a new request for change of ownership from REPSOL REYG in favor of a different person, Customer C. Therefore, the complaining party is no longer listed as the owner of the gas supply when this new request is activated on March 5, 2022.

In the context of the investigation, REPSOL REYG states:

On January 14, 2022, a request for change of ownership was received. distributor
with a change of ownership by a person other than the complainant (hereinafter, "Client A") (FILE 1). Since there is an almost identical correspondence
between the first name and two surnames, the request is executed in the complainant's customer file.
At this time, the first request for change of ownership is sent to the distributor as a result of Client A's registration with RE&amp;G.
In the request dated 01/14/2022, the distributor is provided with the data that appears in the complainant's customer file, since, due to the identity of the first name and two surnames, the two new contracts of Client A are recorded in her file.
Since the complainant is a Repsol REYG customer, the source of the data communicated to the distributor is none other than the interested party herself.

THIRD: The first name and surname that appear in the DATA OF THE NEW OWNER and I DECLARE (B.B.B.) fields match the Name and surname, changed in order, of the complaining party (A.A.A.). Other details such as ID number and bank account information do not match.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 21/51

FOURTH: The start and end dates of the contractual relationship between the complaining party and REPSOL REYG are 01/22/2011 and 02/04/2019, respectively.

The complaining party's customer file contains the following information: name, surname, ID number, and mobile phone number.

The complaining party's customer file includes the alert EXCLIENTE-ML.

REPSOL REYG indicates that this alert was generated on 02/04/2019, the date on which the contract with the complaining party ended.

FIFTH: Regarding the invoices Issued, the complainant appears as the owner of the electricity and gas supply points, ***CODE.2 and ***CODE.1, mentioned in the Second Proven Fact.

The following invoices are issued by REPSOL REYG in the name of the complainant and related to the above supply points:

INVOICE PERIOD

1 Gas 01/14/2022 - 02/14/2022

2 Gas 02/15/2022 - 03/02/2022
3 Gas rectification 01/14/2022 - 02/14/2022

4 Electricity 03/04/2022 - 05/05/2022
5 Electricity 05/05/2022 - 06/08/2022
6 Electricity Rectification 04/03/2022 - 05/05/2022

7 Electricity Rectification 05/05/2022 - 08/06/2022

Regarding the generation of these invoices, REPSOL REYG explains:

1. Invoice 1: This invoice was issued as a result of the initial human error
of the agent who processed the change of ownership for Customer A in the complaining party's customer file.

2. Invoice 2: This billing period covers the period from the detection of the incident on February 15, 2022, when the complaining party contacted REPSOL REYG Customer Service to report the error, until February 28, 2022, when the change of ownership was sent to the distributor in favor of Customer C. The change became effective on 03/03/2022.

3. Invoice 3: By canceling the contract that had been erroneously generated, the invoices issued under the same error were canceled.

4. Invoice 4: As a result of the quality process carried out on June 17, 2022, focused on correcting the unusual changes that had occurred in the systems due to the incident, the invoice for that period was issued in the name of the claimant.

It was canceled on July 12, 2022, by means of a corrective invoice, as it was an internal adjustment (Invoice 6).

5. Invoice 5: This invoice was generated under the same circumstances as the previous invoice.
It was issued on the same date and canceled on July 12, 2022, by means of a corrective invoice (Invoice 7).

II
Allegations to the Initiation Agreement

Regarding the allegations made regarding the agreement to initiate this sanctioning procedure, a response was provided to them in the Proposal of the resolution, rejecting the defendant's arguments. However, for the sake of greater clarity, the main arguments presented are listed below:

FIRST. - IN RELATION TO THE ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OF ARTICLE 32 OF THE GDPR: VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF TYPICALITY AND, IN ANY CASE, STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON THE INFRINGEMENT

First, REPSOL COMERCIALIZADORA DE ELECTRICIDAD Y GAS S.L.U. alleges that the alleged violation of Article 32 of the GDPR in relation to Article 83.4 of the GDPR and classified as serious for the purposes of statute of limitations in Article 73 f) of the LOPDGDD does not exist, since the facts presented have established the existence of appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk. The facts would not perfectly match the proposed offense, and in any case, it should be understood that the offense would have expired at the time of the initiation of this sanctioning procedure, as more than two years have passed since the alleged offenses occurred.

In the present case, it should be noted that during the investigation,
the existing measures were found to be inadequate or insufficient.

REPSOL COMERCIALIZADORA DE ELECTRICIDAD Y GAS S.L.U. alleges that the AEPD has linked the alleged non-compliance with Article 32 to the

result that occurred as a result of a fortuitous, involuntary, and occasional human error, which only affected a single customer, their name, surname, and ID number (not even their bank account); and that, in a completely proactive manner and in pursuit of excellence, once the situation was detected, the necessary measures were added to avoid similar future situations (by strengthening existing ones).

It therefore concludes that the AEPD is imposing, with regard to the adoption of security measures, an obligation of results, but that it is nevertheless an obligation of means. In this regard, it brings to mind what the Supreme Court stated in its ruling of February 15, 2022 (appeal 7359/2020), which clearly states that the obligation imposed by personal data protection regulations to adopt technical and organizational measures aimed at ensuring the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information is an obligation of means, not of results. In this regard, it should be noted that the aforementioned Judgment effectively indicates, regarding data protection security measures, that "... the obligation that falls upon the controller and the data processor to adopt the necessary measures to guarantee the security of personal data is not an obligation of results but of means, without requiring the infallibility of the measures adopted. The only thing that is required is the adoption and implementation of technical and organizational measures that, in accordance with the state of the art and in relation to the nature of the processing carried out and the personal data in question, reasonably make it possible to prevent their alteration, loss, processing, or unauthorized access." (emphasis added).

The ruling continues by stating, in the specific case analyzed, that
"...the program used to collect customer data did not contain any security measures that would have allowed it to be verified whether the email address entered was real or fictitious and whether it actually belonged to the person whose data was being processed and who gave consent to it. The state of the art at the time these events occurred allowed for the establishment of measures to verify the authenticity of the email address, conditioning the continuation of the process on the user receiving the contract at the address provided and only from there providing the necessary consent for its collection and processing. These measures were not adopted in this case.

(...) Therefore, at the time these events occurred, there were technical measures related to the registration process that would have prevented the leakage of personal data. This implies that the technical measures adopted breached the security conditions in the terms required in Article 9.1 of Organic Law 15/1999, thereby incurring the violation provided for in Article 44.3.h)
consisting of "Maintaining files, premises, programs, or equipment containing personal data without the proper security conditions established by regulation [...]".

Therefore, although the Judgment infers that the obligations established in Article 32 of the GDPR are related to means, it also makes it clear that, if at the time of the incident, adequate technical measures existed to avoid or mitigate its effects and they were not applied, this constitutes a breach of the aforementioned obligation imposed by the GDPR and, therefore, a violation thereof.

It should be noted that, despite the defendant's insistence on this, the first and last name data do not fully match the two clients involved, since the The first name does not completely match—B.B.B. versus A.A.A.—and, although the

surnames match, their order does not—B.B.B. versus A.A.A.—so this presumed complete coincidence of the data cannot be accepted. This is without prejudice to the fact that data that would have also detected that the change of ownership was taking place was incorrect, such as the ID number or bank account, which also did not match, were not verified.

In the present case, as noted, there was a vulnerability derived from a
misconfiguration of the change of ownership procedure, which was detected
through the investigation carried out.

Remember that the purpose of Article 32 of the GDPR is to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing personal data, through the
application of appropriate technical and organizational security measures,
specifically security. The absence of such a level of security appropriate to the
risk implies a breach of the precept. This establishes an obligation of means, which is specified in the obligation to design appropriate technical and organizational means. Their correct implementation and appropriate use are also required. Therefore, the court will also be liable for the lack of due diligence in their use, understood as reasonable diligence considering the circumstances of the case.

The National Court stated in various rulings—among them, that of June 13, 2002 (appeal no. 1,517/2001)—that the obligation arising from the implementation of security measures regarding personal data refers to the necessary and appropriate measures, mentioning their determination and effective implementation:

"Compliance is not achieved by adopting any measure, since they must be the necessary ones." to guarantee the objectives established by the precept, and of course, formal approval of the security measures is not enough, since they must be effectively implemented and put into practice. Let us also recall what was stated by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on December 14, 2023, in Case C-340/2021.

30 Thus, it follows from the wording of Articles 24 and 32 of the GDPR that these provisions are limited to obliging the data controller to adopt technical and organizational measures aimed at preventing, as far as possible, any personal data breach. The appropriateness of such measures must be assessed in each specific case, examining whether the controller has adopted these measures taking into account the different criteria established in the aforementioned articles and the data protection needs specifically inherent to the processing in question and the risks it entails.

37 Furthermore, it follows from Article 82, paragraphs 2 and 3, of the GDPR that, although a controller is responsible for the damage caused by processing that constitutes a breach of that Regulation, the controller is exonerated from liability if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event causing the damage.

42 It follows from Article 32(1) and (2) that the appropriateness of such technical and organizational measures must be assessed in a phased manner. On the one hand, it is necessary to identify the risks of a personal data breach that the processing entails and their potential consequences for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. This assessment must be carried out in each specific case, taking into account the likelihood of the identified risks and their seriousness. It must then be verified whether the measures taken by the controller are appropriate to these risks, taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing.

46 Such an examination requires a specific analysis of both the nature and content of the measures taken. by the data controller, the manner in which these measures have been applied, and their practical effects on the level of security that the controller was obliged to ensure, taking into account the risks inherent in such processing.

69 It follows from these provisions, on the one hand, that the data controller must, in principle, compensate for the damage caused by a breach of the Regulation related to such processing and, on the other hand, that it can only be exonerated from liability if it provides proof that it is in no way responsible for such damage.

71 Where, as in the present case, the personal data breach, within the meaning of Article 4(12) of the GDPR, has been committed by cybercriminals and, therefore, by "third parties" within the meaning of Article 4(10) thereof, that breach cannot be attributed to the controller, unless the controller made it possible by failing to comply with an obligation under the GDPR and, in particular, the data protection obligation to which it is subject under Articles 5(1)(f), 24, and 32 of the same regulation.

Regarding the statute of limitations, the defendant errs in arguing that the violation would be time-barred since, in the present case, we are dealing with one of the so-called permanent violations, characterized by the conduct worthy of administrative reprimand being maintained over a prolonged period of time, and therefore the calculation of the statute of limitations does not begin until said conduct ceases or is interrupted. Such violations are committed while the harmful effects of such potential infringing behavior persist. Consequently, the violation of the protected legal right continues over time, throughout the entire period in which such behavior contrary to the legal system is maintained. In the specific case under consideration, taking into account the permanent nature of this infringement, the statute of limitations cannot, as the respondent claims,

be computed from January 14, 2022, but rather the statute of limitations will begin to run only when the infringing conduct has ceased.

In this regard, the file confirms that the complainant received a final consumer bill issued by the respondent in July 2022, relating to a supply point unknown to the complainant, which includes the period between May 5, 2022, and June 8, 2022 as the billing period. Therefore, between the commission of the alleged infringement, which occurred in July 2022, and the date of notification of the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure to the respondent, that is, May 27, 2024, the two years provided for in Article 73 f) of the LOPDGDD have not elapsed. Therefore, for the reasons stated, the statute of limitations for the infringement invoked must be rejected.

SECOND. - IN RELATION TO THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 5.1.F AND 32 OF THE GDPR: VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF FAULT AND, SUBSIDIARILY, OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY

Violation of the principle of culpability

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 27/51

It is recalled that, indeed, the principle of liability provided for in Article 28.1 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector, provides that: "Only natural and legal persons may be sanctioned for acts constituting an administrative violation, as well as, when a law recognizes their capacity to act, groups of affected parties, unions and entities without legal personality, and independent or independent assets." self-employed persons who are found responsible for them due to intent or negligence.

However, according to the ruling in Supreme Court Judgment 7887/2011 of November 24, 2011,

Rec. 258/2009, "(...) since its ruling 76/1990, of April 26, the Constitutional Court has declared that strict liability or liability without fault does not apply to administrative sanctions. This doctrine is reaffirmed in ruling 164/2005, of June 20, 2005, which excludes the possibility of imposing sanctions based solely on the result, without proving even a minimum level of culpability, even on the grounds of mere negligence. However, the method of attributing liability to legal entities does not correspond to the intentional or reckless forms of culpability that are attributable to human conduct.

Thus, in the case of violations committed by legal entities, even if there is a If the element of culpability is present (see the judgment of this Chamber of the Supreme Court of November 20, 2011 (appeal in cassation in the interest of law 48/2007), this is necessarily applied differently than it is with respect to natural persons. According to STC 246/1991, "(...) this different construction of the imputability of the authorship of the infringement to the legal person arises from the very nature of the legal fiction to which these subjects respond. They lack the volitional element in the strict sense, but not the capacity to infringe the rules to which they are subject. The capacity to infringe and, therefore, direct blameworthiness that derives from the legal asset protected by the rule being infringed and the need for such protection to be truly effective and the risk that, consequently, the legal person subject to compliance with said rule must assume."

To the above, it should be added, following the judgment of January 23, 1998, partially transcribed in STS 6262/2009, of October 9, 2009, Rec 5285/2005, and STS 6336/2009, of October 23, 2009, Rec 1067/2006, which states that "although the culpability of the conduct must also be subject to proof, it must be considered, in order to assume the corresponding burden, that the volitional and cognitive elements necessary to assess the conduct are ordinarily part of the proven typical conduct, and that their exclusion requires proof of the absence of such elements, or, in its normative aspect, that the due diligence required by the party claiming their absence has been exercised; in short, invoking the absence of culpability is not sufficient to exonerate oneself from typically unlawful conduct."

Furthermore, we cannot We cannot simply speak of a specific human error, since it has been necessary to strengthen the Change of Ownership Procedure for ATC Agents, so that searches in their systems are carried out solely and exclusively using the DNI (National Identity Document), avoiding identification errors, as well as the need to strengthen the Security Policy to verify all client data prior to contracting or any contractual process and centralize the management of the most complex cases in a single specialized agent, avoiding performing several actions in parallel that can cause misunderstandings, errors, and confusion for the client.

Violation of the principle of proportionality

Firstly, it should be remembered that the corrective measures with which the Supervisory Authorities are provided are defined in the GDPR as "powers," that is, as powers of action that, logically, are will be applied depending on the circumstances present in each specific case.

On the other hand, this Agency wishes to point out what Recital 148 of the GDPR states regarding the possibility of imposing a warning:

“In the case of a minor infringement, or if the fine that would likely be imposed would constitute a disproportionate burden for a natural person, a warning may be imposed instead of a fine. However, particular attention should be paid to the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, its intentional nature, the measures taken to mitigate the damage suffered, the degree of responsibility or any relevant prior infringement, the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, compliance with measures ordered against the controller or processor, adherence to codes of conduct, and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstances.”
In light of the terms in which it is stated, the GDPR generally urges the imposition of fines and provides that a warning is the measure used when the infringement is minor—a circumstance that does not occur in this case—or entails a disproportionate burden when the infringement has been committed by a natural person.

In the present case, this Agency has evaluated and justified all the aggravating or mitigating circumstances referred to in the aforementioned recital 148 of the GDPR (which are none other than those in Article 83.2 of the GDPR). Since the infringements in question are not minor for the purposes of the GDPR, it is considered legally appropriate to impose a fine instead of issuing a warning. This is why this claim is rejected.

Regarding the principle of proportionality, the Supreme Court of Justice, Third Chamber, of December 16, 2003 (Recital No. 4996/98) already indicated that the principle of proportionality of sanctions requires that "the discretion that The Administration is granted the right to apply the sanction by weighing the concurrent circumstances in all cases, in order to achieve due proportionality between the alleged acts and the required liability. This principle of proportionality is not deemed to have been violated, and the sanction proposed to the entity is considered proportionate, given the proven facts and the concurrent circumstances, as detailed below.

This Agency wishes to point out that the GDPR does not require that serious damages and/or losses be incurred by the complaining party in order to establish the existence of an infringement, as in the present case.

The nature of the infringement, the number of people affected, and the existence or absence of damages are all issues that have been taken into account and duly motivated when determining the sanction to be imposed on the complainant. REPSOL
ELECTRICITY AND GAS MARKETING COMPANY S.L.U.

However, in response to the above, several points should be noted:

First, Article 83.1 of the GDPR establishes that administrative fines for violations of the GDPR must be "...in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive." Section 2 of the aforementioned provision then states that "Administrative fines shall be imposed according to the circumstances of each individual case, either in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated..." (emphasis added). It then establishes certain circumstances to be taken into account.

Thus, the calculation of the amount of the fines is at the discretion of the supervisory authority, subject to the rules provided for in the GDPR.

In this context, the GDPR requires, as noted, that the amount of the fine be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive in each case (Article 83.1 of the GDPR).
Furthermore, when setting the amount of the fine, the supervisory authorities will duly take into account a list of circumstances that relate to the characteristics of the infringement (its severity) or the nature of the perpetrator (Article 83(2) of the GDPR).

Finally, the amount of the fine will not exceed the maximum amounts provided for in Article 83(4), (5) and (6) of the GDPR.

Therefore, the quantification of the fine is based on a specific assessment carried out in each case, within the parameters provided for by the GDPR.
Furthermore, it should be noted that the calculation of a fine is not a mere mathematical exercise; the circumstances of the specific case are the determining factors that lead to the final amount, which may be, in all cases and for each infringement, a different amount up to the legal maximum.

As a general and final consideration, it should be noted that none of the sanctions applied violate the principle of proportionality. Thus, it should be noted that Articles 83.4 and 83.5 of the GDPR, which respectively define the infringement of Article 32 and Article 5.1.f), establish limits on the amounts of fines that may be imposed that are far removed from those ultimately established.

Therefore, it cannot be said that the sanctions ultimately imposed violate the principle of proportionality, taking into account that "Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for the infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 are effective, proportionate, and dissuasive in each individual case." (emphasis added)

Let us recall at this point what the CJEU stated in its judgment in Case C-683-21.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 30/51

78 The existence of a system of sanctions that allows for the imposition, when the specific circumstances of each case warrant it, of an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83 of the GDPR creates an incentive for controllers and processors to comply with the Regulation. With their deterrent effect, administrative fines contribute to strengthening the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and are therefore a key element in ensuring respect for the rights of such individuals, in accordance with the purpose of the aforementioned Regulation to ensure a high level of protection for such individuals with regard to the processing of personal data.

Likewise, the recent ECJ ruling of February 13, 2025, in Case C-383/23,
establishes that the imposition of a fine requires, in the examination of each individual case, a series of elements provided for in Article 83 of the GDPR, of which turnover is one additional element (neither the sole nor the determining factor), in order to impose a fine that is proportionate, dissuasive, and effective, thus strengthening the protection

of natural persons.

25 Thus, pursuant to Article 83(1) of the GDPR, each supervisory authority must ensure that administrative fines pursuant to the aforementioned
Article 83 for the GDPR infringements indicated in its paragraphs 4 to 6
are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

26 Beyond compliance with these three requirements, Article 83(2) requires, in deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and its amount, the competent supervisory authority to duly consider, in each individual case, a number of elements.
27 Pursuant to the latter provision, those elements include, in particular, the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered, the intentionality or negligence in the infringement, the measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered, the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, and the categories of personal data affected by the infringement.
28 These elements relate either to the conduct of the controller or processor accused of infringing certain provisions of the GDPR, or to the infringements themselves. Thus, they serve to ensure that each of these infringements is assessed on the basis of all relevant individual circumstances and that the objectives pursued by the sanctioning regime under the GDPR are achieved.
29 Although these elements do not refer to the concept of an undertaking within the meaning of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, the Court of Justice has already held that only a fine that takes into account not only all the elements characterizing the GDPR infringements found, but also, where appropriate, the actual or material economic standing of the recipient, meets the three requirements set out in Article 83(1) of the GDPR, namely, that it must be both effective, proportionate, and dissuasive. In order to assess these requirements, it must be taken into account whether the recipient is part of an undertaking within the meaning of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU (see, to this effect, judgment of 5 December 2023, Deutsche Wohnen, C 807/21, EU:C:2023:950, paragraph 58).

III
Allegations to the Proposed Resolution

With regard to the allegations raised against the Proposed Resolution, which basically reproduce those formulated throughout the sanctioning procedure, it should be noted that they have already been analyzed in detail and rejected in the Legal Grounds for the Proposed Resolution, which is transcribed in Legal Grounds II of this Resolution, to which, for the sake of procedural economy, reference should be made.

With regard to the remaining allegations, the following are addressed in the following order:

FIRST. - THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR THE ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 32 OF THE GDPR AND THE VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S OWN ACTS.

In this regard, it is worth recalling that Article 30.2 of Law 40/2015 establishes that
"the statute of limitations for infractions shall begin to run from the day on which the infraction was committed. In the case of continuing or permanent infractions, the period shall begin to run from the end of the infringing conduct."

The respondent errs in maintaining that the infraction would be time-barred since, in
the present case, we are dealing with one of the so-called permanent infractions, characterized by the conduct deserving of administrative reproach being maintained over a prolonged period of time, and therefore the calculation of the statute of limitations does not begin until said conduct ceases or is interrupted. Such infractions are committed while the harmful effects of such potential infringing conduct continue. Consequently, the damage to the protected legal right is prolonged over time, throughout the entire period in which such conduct contrary to the legal system is maintained.

It should be clarified that, as a result of the investigation, indications of two violations were detected, one of which is structural in nature and associated with the procedures implemented by the respondent. In this regard, it should be noted that this violation will continue to exist as long as the procedure is not changed.

In the specific case under examination, taking into account the nature of this violation, the statute of limitations cannot, as the respondent claims, be computed from January 14, 2022, but rather the statute of limitations will begin to run only when the infringing conduct has ceased.

In this regard, we can mention the recent Supreme Court ruling of December 17, 2020, Appeal No. 4442/2019, which states the following: "The calculation of the statute of limitations begins when the violation is committed, and in the case of a continuing violation, the dies a quo is not determined by the date on which the violation begins, but by the date on which the last violation was committed or the conduct ceased."

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 32/51

In this regard, the file confirms that the complainant received a final consumer bill issued by the respondent in July 2022, relating to a supply point unknown to her, which includes the billing period between May 5, 2022, and June 8, 2022. Therefore, between the commission of the alleged infringement, which occurred in July 2022, and the date of notification of the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure to the respondent, that is, May 27, 2024, the two years provided for in Article 73 f) of the LOPDGDD have not elapsed. Therefore, for the reasons stated, the statute of limitations for the infringement invoked must be be rejected.

SECOND. - ON THE VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF TYPICALITY: NO VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 5.1.D AND 32 OF THE GDPR.

Regarding the appropriateness of changing, in the resolution proposal phase, the legal classification of the facts that the Initiation Agreement classified as a violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR and the impact that such a change could have on the respondent's right of defense, it was stated in the resolution proposal that there was no legal impediment to such a change, provided that, as was the case in this case, the facts on which the new charge was based remained unchanged.

Based on the foregoing, the proposed resolution considered the change in legal classification made in this procedure to be fully legally compliant, given that the facts that were included in the infringement attributed to the respondent in the proposed resolution (Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR) were included in the initial agreement, although they were included in the infringement of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR. Therefore, the new legal classification did not imply a change in the initially assessed facts, but rather they remained unchanged.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the investigation phase is specifically for analyzing

in more depth and, in light of the evolution of the procedure, further fine-tuning the
possible infringements associated with the detected violations of the regulations, all within a framework of sufficient and appropriate guarantees for the data controller. In this case, the violations proposed to be charged to the respondent were clearly explained, and a hearing was granted so that the respondent could present any allegations that she considered within her rights.

The documentation in the file shows that the respondent violated the principle of accuracy because it processed inaccurate data when carrying out a change of ownership in an electricity supply contract and a gas supply contract, in favor of the complainant instead of Client A, the party that requested the change of ownership.
It should be noted that all processing of personal data must respect the principles that govern it, set forth in Article 5 of the GDPR, including the principle of accuracy. Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR provides that personal data shall be “d)
accurate and, if necessary, kept up-to-date; all reasonable steps shall be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are processed are erased or rectified without delay (“accuracy”).” (Our emphasis).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 33/51

Under the GDPR, the data controller shall at all times be obliged to take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal data it collects or otherwise processes are accurate.

The activities or measures that the data controller must implement or adopt to ensure data accuracy cannot result in disproportionate demands, but "reasonable" measures are required, which makes it necessary to assess the purpose and context of the processing. In this sense, while Recital 39 of the GDPR refers to "reasonable measures to ensure that inaccurate personal data are rectified or erased," Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR connects data accuracy with the purposes for which it is processed. The National Court stated in its ruling of February 27, 2008 (Appeal 210/2007)

that "The principle of truthfulness or accuracy is highly relevant, as it is not only necessary that data be collected for processing in accordance with a series of criteria (principle of proportionality) and that the data be used for purposes compatible with those that motivated its collection (principle of purpose), but it also requires that those who collect and process personal data guarantee and protect that the information being processed is not inaccurate and is up-to-date.

Noncompliance with or violation of the principle of truthfulness may have significant consequences for the data subject." (Emphasis added).

In addition, Article 5.2. The GDPR incorporates the principle of proactive accountability, under which the data controller will be responsible for compliance with the provisions of section 1, which is now relevant, in section d) and capable of demonstrating compliance. The principle of proactivity transfers to the data controller the obligation not only to observe the principles governing processing, but also to be able to demonstrate such compliance. Worth mentioning is Opinion 3/2010 of the Article 29 Working Party (WP29) - WP 173 - issued during the validity of Directive 95/46/EEC, repealed by the GDPR, but whose reflections are still applicable today. It understands that the "essence" of proactive accountability is the controller's obligation to implement measures that, under normal circumstances, ensure that data protection rules are complied with in the context of processing operations, and to have documents available that demonstrate to data subjects and supervisory authorities what measures have been taken to achieve compliance with the rules governing the fundamental right to the protection of personal data. At this point, we refer to the invoices issued to the complainant, as a result of the failure to verify all customer information used by the respondent in the supply ownership change procedures prior to contracting. Thus, through the invoices received, the complainant also had access to the CUPS number associated with the home, the contract number and type, supply address, supplier, billing information (bank details, invoice date and number, amount, charge date, payment tracking number), and consumption information for the person who signed the contract.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 34/51

Based on the considerations presented throughout the sanctioning procedure and the documentation in the file, it is considered that the respondent violated Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR, which establishes a basic principle of the right to personal data protection, according to which data must be accurate and, if necessary, updated ("principle of accuracy").

Regarding the violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, this Agency once again emphasizes that this violation is due to the lack of measures or the failure to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk in the procedure established for the contract, as well as for the change of owner.

The respondent asserts that it had and has implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

In response, it should be noted that the facts indicate the opposite.
Repsol, when assessing the risks of varying probability and severity, should have taken into account the risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals and implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

The respondent is charged with violating the aforementioned Article 32 because the reprehensible conduct that violates this provision is the lack or inadequacy of security measures appropriate to the risk.

In the present case, as noted, there was a vulnerability derived from a poor configuration of the contracting procedure and the change of ownership. A procedure that only contemplated the identification of the owner by name.

Throughout the procedure, it was found that there were no very basic measures associated with risks that could be considered common, such as errors that can be made when a data subject is misidentified by their name alone or their ID number. This is not an isolated case; the respondent did not have a procedure appropriate to the level of risk involved, which significantly impacts the company's operations. A very simple verification measure would have been, for example, to establish the obligation to check the two fields, name and ID number, sequentially. Thus, in order to prevent human errors in the handling of personal data, as occurs in the present case, the entity should have adopted various effective measures. Among these, it seems clear that the
establishment, for example, of a measure consisting of also identifying clients by another field, such as their ID number, in the contracting processes,
would have prevented clients with the same or very similar first and last names

from being subject to erroneous contracts.

Among the respondent's reactive measures is accessing client data by their ID number instead of their first name. This method of contracting
would prevent errors with clients with similar names, but
would not prevent an error when entering an ID number, which would not

solve the problem. Organizations must conduct an adequate analysis
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 35/51

of the existing risks to avoid implementing procedures that pose high risks to the rights and freedoms of their clients. As already indicated, the
principle of proactive responsibility that the data controller must have

is to be present in its actions.

Furthermore, it is essential to consider the nature of the respondent entity's operations and their impact on compliance with data protection obligations, taking into account that it regularly processes a considerable amount of personal data. This perspective is relevant due to the scale and regularity of the processing of personal data, which increases the risk and, consequently, the expectations of compliance with data protection regulations by the responsible entity. The regularity with which the company processes personal data requires a robust and up-to-date data protection system, since any failure can have repeated or prolonged effects, regardless of whether the failure is human-caused or of any other nature, as the lack of technical and organizational measures makes human error possible. In this case, the investigation has confirmed this lack of security measures.

But not only has this lack of security measures been verified, but also

the lack of subsequent controls to detect these failures has been verified,
despite the fact that the respondent indicates that they have been implemented. This demonstrates a
significant deficiency in its prevention, supervision, and internal audit mechanisms,
which reinforces the need to implement detection, review,

and continuous control systems, not only to prevent errors, but also to detect and
rectify them in a timely manner, thus ensuring compliance with the GDPR. This
demonstrates the respondent's inability to proactively identify and address
the error itself, even after becoming aware of the

incident in which it decided to identify the customer by ID instead of by name, which, in this Agency's opinion, is not an appropriate procedure to guarantee a
level of security appropriate to the risk.

This clearly demonstrates a breach of Article 32 of the GDPR, as it requires appropriate measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing.

All of this merely reflects a lack of diligence on the part of REPSOL in ensuring security appropriate to the risk of the data processing it carries out, which it has not yet corrected. In this regard, it should not be forgotten that the affected database contains the personal data of thousands of customers, which requires appropriate security measures aimed specifically at ensuring that said personal data is not accessed illegitimately.

THIRD. - VIOLATION OF THE FAULT PRINCIPLE.

In the opinion of the respondent, there would be no administrative liability for the alleged infringing acts, as this was due to involuntary human error.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 36/51

However, we cannot speak of a single, isolated human error, since we are dealing with two distinct infractions, one of which is linked to a procedure that does not comply with the provisions of Article 32 of the GDPR, as indicated above. As has been pointed out throughout the sanctioning procedure, it is reiterated that, indeed, the principle of liability provided for in Article 28.1 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector, provides that: "Only natural and legal persons, as well as, when a law recognizes their legal capacity, affected groups, unions and entities without legal personality, and independent or autonomous assets that are found responsible for such acts due to intent or negligence, may be sanctioned for acts constituting an administrative infraction."

However, according to the ruling in Supreme Court Judgment 7887/2011 of November 24, 2011, Rec. 258/2009, "(...) since its ruling 76/1990, of April 26, the Constitutional Court has declared that strict liability or liability without fault does not apply to administrative sanctions. This doctrine is reaffirmed in ruling 164/2005, of June 20, 2005, which excludes the possibility of imposing sanctions based solely on the result, without proving even a minimum level of culpability, even on the grounds of mere negligence. However, the method of attributing liability to legal entities does not correspond to the intentional or reckless forms of culpability that are attributable to human conduct.

Thus, in the case of violations committed by legal entities, even if there is a If the element of culpability is present (see the judgment of this Chamber of the Supreme Court of November 20, 2011 (appeal in cassation in the interest of law 48/2007), this is necessarily applied differently than it is with respect to natural persons. According to STC 246/1991, "(...) this different construction of the imputability of the authorship of the infringement to the legal person arises from the very nature of the legal fiction to which these subjects respond. They lack the volitional element in the strict sense, but not the capacity to infringe the rules to which they are subject. The capacity to infringe and, therefore, direct blameworthiness that derives from the legal asset protected by the rule being infringed and the need for such protection to be truly effective and the risk that, consequently, the legal person subject to compliance with said rule must assume."

To the above, following the judgment of January 23, 1998, partially transcribed in Supreme Court Judgment 6262/2009, of October 9, 2009, Rec 5285/2005, and Supreme Court Judgment 6336/2009, of October 23, 2009, Rec 1067/2006, which states that "although the culpability of the conduct must also be subject to proof, it must be considered, in order to assume the corresponding burden, that the volitional and cognitive elements necessary to assess the conduct are ordinarily part of the proven typical conduct, and that their exclusion requires proof of the absence of such elements, or, in its normative aspect, that the due diligence required by the party claiming their absence has been exercised; in short, invoking the absence of culpability is not sufficient to exonerate oneself from typically unlawful conduct."

Therefore, the approach that The defendant's arguments on this matter are inconsistent with the law.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 37/51

FOURTH. - VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF GOOD FAITH, LEGAL SECURITY, AND EQUITY.

The defendant reiterates that this was a one-off error and that the defendant acted in a completely diligent manner. The defendant considers that the universal principle of equity is not being respected and that the defendant acted in good faith, as this was a human error, of no consequence to the plaintiff, and therefore believes that the principles of good faith, legal certainty, and equity have been violated by this disciplinary action.

This statement cannot be accepted, since the assessment of the degree of diligence must especially consider the professionalism or lack thereof of the defendant, and there is no doubt that, in the case under consideration, when the activity of Since the entity being sued constantly handles extensive amounts of personal data, it is necessary to insist on the rigor and exquisite care required to comply with the legal provisions in this regard. [Judgment of the National Court of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006)].

We refer to what was previously indicated regarding one of the violations being of a structural nature and due to a procedure inadequate to the risk of avoiding the misidentification of a client.

FIFTH. -VULNERATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY.

First, as set out in the proposed resolution, the corrective measures provided to the Supervisory Authorities are defined in the GDPR as "powers," that is, as powers of action that, logically, will be applied depending on the circumstances present in each specific case.

Furthermore, this Agency wishes to point out the following: Recital 148 of the GDPR states the possibility of imposing a warning:

“In the case of a minor infringement, or if the fine likely to be imposed would constitute a disproportionate burden for a natural person, a warning may be imposed instead of a fine. However, particular attention must be paid to the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, its intentional nature, the measures taken to mitigate the damage suffered, the degree of responsibility or any relevant prior infringement, the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, compliance with measures ordered against the controller or processor, adherence to codes of conduct, and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstances.”
In light of its wording, the GDPR generally encourages the imposition of fines and provides that a warning is the measure used when the infringement is minor—a circumstance that does not occur in in this case—or entails a disproportionate burden when the infringement was committed by a natural person.

In the present case, this Agency has assessed and justified all the aggravating or mitigating circumstances referred to in the aforementioned recital 148 of the GDPR (which are none other than those in Article 83.2 of the GDPR), and since the infringements in question are not minor for the purposes of the GDPR, it is considered in accordance with the law to impose a fine instead of issuing a warning. This is why this claim is rejected.

Regarding the principle of proportionality, the Supreme Court of Justice, Third Chamber, of December 16, 2003 (Recital No. 4996/98) already indicated that the principle of proportionality of sanctions

requires that "the discretion granted to the Administration to apply the sanction must be carried out by weighing the concurrent circumstances in all cases, in order to achieve due proportionality between the alleged acts and the required liability." This principle of proportionality is not deemed to have been violated, and the sanction proposed to the entity is considered proportionate, given the proven facts and the concurrent circumstances, which are detailed below.

This Agency wishes to point out that the GDPR does not require that serious damages and/or losses be incurred by the complaining party in order to establish the existence of an infringement, as in the present case.

The nature of the violation, the number of people affected, and the existence or absence of damages are all issues that have been taken into account and duly justified when determining the sanction to be imposed on REPSOL
COMERCIALIZADORA DE ELECTRICIDAD Y GAS S.L.U.

However, in response to the allegations, several points should be noted:

First, Article 83.1 of the GDPR establishes that administrative fines for violations of the GDPR must be "...effective, proportionate, and dissuasive in each individual case." Section 2 of the aforementioned provision then states that "Administrative fines shall be imposed according to the circumstances of each individual case, either in addition to or as a substitute for the measures contemplated..." (emphasis added). The following sets out certain circumstances to be taken into account.

Thus, the calculation of the amount of fines is at the discretion of the supervisory authority, subject to the rules set forth in the GDPR.

In this context, the GDPR requires, as noted, that the amount of the fine be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive in each case (Article 83(1) GDPR).
Furthermore, when setting the amount of the fine, the supervisory authorities will duly take into account a list of circumstances relating to the characteristics of the infringement (its gravity) or the nature of the perpetrator (Article 83(2) GDPR).

Finally, the amount of the fine will not exceed the maximum amounts provided for in Article 83(4), (5) and (6) GDPR.

Therefore, the quantification of the amount of the fine is based on a specific assessment carried out in each case, within the parameters set forth in the GDPR.

Furthermore, it should be noted that calculating a fine is not a mere mathematical exercise; the circumstances of the specific case are the determining factors that lead to the final amount, which may be, in all cases and for each violation, a different amount up to the legal maximum.

28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 39/51

As a general and final consideration, it should be noted that none of the sanctions applied violate the principle of proportionality. Thus, it should be remembered that Articles 83.4 and 83.5 of the GDPR, which respectively classify the violation of Article 32 and Article 5.1.d, establish limits on the amounts of fines that can be imposed that are very different from those ultimately established.

Therefore, it cannot be said that the sanctions ultimately imposed violate the principle of proportionality, taking into account that "Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for the infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive" (emphasis added).

Consequently, the allegations must be rejected, meaning that the arguments presented do not distort the essential content of the infringements claimed to have been committed nor do they provide sufficient justification or exculpation.

IV
Obligation breached. Violation of Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR.

Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR establishes the following:

“Article 5 Principles relating to processing:

1. Personal data shall be:

(…)

d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up-to-date; all reasonable steps shall be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are processed are erased or rectified without delay (“accuracy”);”

In relation to this principle, Recital 39 of the GDPR states that:

“(…) to ensure that personal data are not retained longer than necessary, the controller must establish deadlines for their deletion or periodic review. All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate are rectified or erased.”

And recital 71: “(71) (...) in order to ensure fair and transparent processing with respect to the data subject, taking into account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are processed, the controller should use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for profiling, implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure, in particular, that factors that introduce inaccuracies into the personal data are corrected and the risk of error is minimized, secure personal data in a manner that takes into account potential risks to the interests and rights of the data subject and prevent, inter alia, discriminatory effects on natural persons based on race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or beliefs, trade union membership, genetic condition or health status or sexual orientation, or processing that results in give rise
to measures that produce such an effect."

In the present case, the investigation procedures carried out reveal that
the respondent carried out a change of ownership in an electricity supply contract and a gas supply contract, in favor of the complainant instead of

in favor of Client A, who requested the change of ownership.
The cause of the error was in the prior checks when identifying

Client A (B.B.B.) who contacted REPSOL REYG. According to the respondent, it was
the result of human error on the part of the agent that the contracts were linked to the complainant, due to the similarity between the first and last names of the complainant.
(A.A.A.) Similarity, not coincidence, as we have already indicated, since, in addition to the fact that the first name does not exactly match, the order of the surnames and other relevant data such as the ID number or bank account details also do not match, as these were not verified and would have prevented the incident.

This situation represents an alleged violation of the principle of accuracy, as stipulated in the aforementioned Article 5.1 d) of the GDPR and in the terms set out below.

First, it should be noted that Article 4 defines personal data as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("the data subject"); an identifiable natural person shall be any person whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person."

The act of erroneously associating the complainant's personal data, such as name, surname, and ID number, with a contract that was not signed by the complainant, constitutes a violation of the principle of data accuracy. In the present case, the file confirms the complainant's receipt of a consumption invoice issued by the respondent in June 2022, relating to a supply point unknown to the complainant, which includes the period from May 5, 2022, to June 8, 2022, as the billing period, and which displays the complainant's name, surname, and ID number.

The respondent has stated that the following invoices were issued to the complainant.

BILL PERIOD

1 Gas 01/14/2022 - 02/14/2022
2 Gas 02/15/2022 - 03/02/2022

3 Gas Rectification 01/14/2022 - 02/14/2022
4 Electricity 03/04/2022 - 05/05/2022
5 Electricity 05/05/2022 - 06/08/2022

6 Electricity Rectification 03/04/2022 - 05/05/2022
7 Electricity Rectification 05/05/2022 - 06/08/2022

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 41/51

Invoices 4 and 5 were issued even after the respondent was aware of the facts.

The invoices issued to the complainant are the result of not verifying all the customer information used by the respondent prior to contracting the contract in the supply ownership change procedures. Thus, the complainant also had access, through the invoices received, to the CUPS number associated with the home, the contract number and type, supply address,

retailer, billing information (bank details, invoice date and number, amount, charge date, payment tracking number), and consumption information for the person who signed the contract.

From the foregoing, it is evident that the respondent has violated

Article 5.1.d), the principle of accuracy, in relation to Article 5 of the LOPGDD, "Data Accuracy."

The obligation arising from Article 5.1.d) imposes the need for the personal data collected to be accurate, and reasonable measures must be taken at all times to ensure that the data is not inaccurate.

The data controllers are responsible for compliance with this obligation.

In this regard, the National Court stated in its ruling of February 27, 2008, Appeal 210/2007, "... The principle of truthfulness or accuracy is highly relevant, as it is not only necessary that data be collected for processing in accordance with a series of criteria (principle of proportionality) and that they be used for purposes compatible with those for which they were collected (principle of purpose), but it also requires that those who collect and process personal data ensure and protect that the information being processed is not inaccurate and is up-to-date. Failure to comply with or violate the principle of truthfulness may have significant consequences for the data subject..."

Therefore, in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, it is required that "reasonable measures be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they were collected are deleted or rectified without delay." that are processed."

In this regard, Article 5.1.d) does not require disproportionate measures to update the data, but rather reasonable measures, taking into account the available means and the purpose for which the data is used. This is also stated in the aforementioned Recital 39 of the GDPR.

Consequently, the proven facts are considered to constitute an infringement due to the fact that inaccurate client data was processed for a period of time—despite the numerous complaints filed, according to the respondent—in violation of Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR.

V
Classification of the infringement of Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 42/51

The aforementioned violation of Article 5.1.d) of the GDPR constitutes the commission of one of the violations classified in Article 83.5 of the GDPR, which, under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines," provides:

"Violations of the following provisions shall be punished, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

a) the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9; (…)”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its Article 71 “Infractions,” establishes that
“The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute infringements.”

For the purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 72 "Very Serious Violations" of the LOPDGDD states:

"1. Pursuant to the provisions of Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, violations that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular, the following, are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:

a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees established in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)"

VI
Sanction

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:

"1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this article for violations of This Regulation

indicates in sections 4, 5, and 6 are effective, proportionate, and dissuasive in each individual case.

2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures provided for in

Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:

a) the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the
nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage they have suffered;

b) the intentionality or negligence involved in the infringement;
c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to 43/51

mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects;
d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;
e) any previous breaches committed by the controller or processor;
f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;
h) how the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the breach and, if so, to what extent;
i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with those measures;
j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or Certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42, k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement. For its part, Article 76 "Sanctions and Corrective Measures" of the LOPDGDD

provides:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria established in section 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account:

a) The ongoing nature of the infringement.

b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.
c) The benefits obtained as a result of the infringement.
d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the infringement.
e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the entity. Absorbent.
f) The impact on the rights of minors.
g) Having, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.
h) Voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in those cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.

In accordance with the transcribed provisions, for the purposes of setting the amount of the penalty for a violation of Article 5.1 d) of the GDPR, the fine must be adjusted taking into account the following circumstances:

Article 83.2 a) GDPR: "the nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered."

The complainant was incorrectly listed as the owner of the affected electricity and gas supply points from January 14, 2022, to March 5, 2022, and from January 14, 2022, to March 3, 2022, respectively.

Furthermore, the complainant filed a high number of complaints, in the words of the respondent, regarding these events.

Regarding the context in which the incident occurred, it occurred in a contractual environment, where individuals trust the entity to securely handle their personal information, thus eroding the affected party's trust and expectations regarding the processing of their personal data.

Article 83.2 b) GDPR: "Intentional or negligent infringement"

The Supreme Court has held that negligence exists whenever a legal duty of care is disregarded, that is, when the infringer fails to behave with due diligence. And in assessing the degree of diligence, the professionalism or lack thereof of the subject must be especially considered. There is no doubt that, in the case now under review, when the activity of the entity in question involves constant and extensive handling of personal data, rigor and exquisite care must be emphasized to comply with the legal provisions in this regard. [Judgment of the National Court of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006)].

The following are considered aggravating factors:

Article 76.2 b) LOPDGDD: "The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data."

The business activity of the defendant entity requires continuous processing of personal data, as it is one of the largest companies in the country in its business sector or activity, and the violation occurred within the framework of its main activity, the contracting of its services.

Considering the factors set forth, the estimated fine amount is €130,000 for a violation of Article 5.1 d) of the GDPR.

VII
Article 32 of the GDPR

Article 32 of the GDPR, security of processing, establishes the following:

“1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, which, where appropriate, includes, among others:

a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
b) the ability to guarantee the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services;
c) the ability to restore availability and access to personal data promptly in the event of a physical or electronic incident. technical;
d) a process for regular verification, evaluation, and assessment of the effectiveness

of the technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing.

2. When assessing the adequacy of the level of security, particular account shall be taken of the risks posed by data processing, in particular as a result of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.

3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or a certification mechanism approved pursuant to Article 42 may serve as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.

4. The controller and the processor shall take measures to ensure that any person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to personal data only processes those data on instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by law. of the Union or of the Member States.”

Recital 74 of the GDPR states:

“The controller’s responsibility should be established for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller or on its own behalf. In particular, the controller should be obliged to implement timely and effective measures and should be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. Those measures should take into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.”

It should be noted that the GDPR does not establish a list of security measures applicable in accordance with the data being processed, but rather establishes that the data controller and the data processor shall apply technical and organizational measures appropriate to the risk posed by the processing, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, and the risks of likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Likewise, security measures must be appropriate and proportionate to the risk detected, noting that the determination of technical and organizational measures must take into account: pseudonymization and encryption, the ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience, the ability to restore availability and access to data after an incident, a verification process (not an audit), evaluation, and assessment of the effectiveness of the measures.

In any case, when assessing the adequacy of the security level, the risks posed by data processing will be particularly taken into account, such as the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration of personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed, or the unauthorized communication or access to such data, which could cause physical, material, or immaterial damage.

In this same sense, Recital 83 of the GDPR states that:

“(83) In order to maintain security and prevent processing in breach of this Regulation, the controller or processor should assess the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate them, such as encryption. Those measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of their implementation, in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. When assessing the risk related to data security, the risks arising from the processing of personal data should be taken into account, such as the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or unauthorized disclosure of or access to such data, which may, in particular, cause physical, material or immaterial damage.”

The respondent's liability is determined by the lack of adequate security measures to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data, as they are responsible for making decisions aimed at effectively implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, ensuring the confidentiality of the data, restoring its availability, and preventing access to it in the event of a physical or technical incident.

In this regard, in order to prevent human error in the handling of personal data, as is the case here, an entity must conduct a risk analysis to determine in advance the measures to be adopted. It is easy to understand that a company with a significant number of employees must consider the human factor as one of the risks. In this case, the investigative actions carried out showed that security measures existed, but no measures were in place to protect personal data, that is, measures that were adequate to guarantee the fundamental right.

Furthermore, despite having detected an error in the contracting and ownership change procedure, in the opinion of this Agency, the respondent party has not resolved the risk in the aforementioned procedure.

Furthermore, it is essential to consider the nature of the respondent entity's operations and their impact on compliance with data protection obligations,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 47/51

taking into account that it regularly processes a considerable amount of personal data. This perspective is relevant due to the scale and regularity of the processing of personal data, which increases the risk and, consequently, the expectations of compliance by the responsible entity. The company's regular processing of personal data requires a robust and up-to-date data protection system, since any failure can have repeated or prolonged effects, regardless of whether the failure is human-caused or of any other nature, as the lack of technical and organizational measures makes human error possible.

Consequently, the proven facts are considered to constitute a procedural or structural violation that is independent of the previous one, attributable to the respondent, due to a violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, due to the failure to adopt technical and security measures appropriate to the risk, which, in general, guarantee the security of the processing of personal data.

VIII
Classification of the violation of Article 32 of the GDPR

The aforementioned violation of Article 32 of the GDPR entails the commission of the violations

classified in Article 83.4 of the GDPR, which, under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines," provides:

"Violations of the following provisions shall be sanctioned, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 10,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the total global annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

a) the obligations of the controller and the processor under Articles 8,

11, 25 to 39, 42, and 43; (...)"

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its Article 71 "Infractions" establishes that
"Infractions are the acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law."

For the purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 73 "Infractions Considered Serious" of the LOPDGDD states:

"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, are considered serious and will be subject to a two-year statute of limitations:

f) Failure to adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing, in accordance with the terms required by Article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679."

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 48/51

IX
Sanction

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR, previously cited in Legal Basis IV, must be observed.

For its part, Article 76 "Sanctions and Corrective Measures" of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on Personal Data Protection) provides:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria established in section 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account:

a) The ongoing nature of the infringement.
b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.

c) The benefits obtained as a result of the infringement.
d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the infringement.
e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the entity. Absorbent.

f) The impact on the rights of minors.
g) Having, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.
h) The voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in those

cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party."

In accordance with the transcribed provisions, for the purposes of setting the amount of the penalty for a violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, the fine must be graduated taking into account the following circumstances:

Article 83.2 a) GDPR: "the nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage and harm they have suffered";

The facts show that the contracting process and the change of ownership of the respondent's services lack adequate technical and organizational security measures, which, in this Agency's opinion, have not been addressed.
This lack of measures occurs in a contractual environment, where individuals trust the entity to securely handle their personal information, thus eroding the affected party's trust and expectations regarding the processing of their personal data.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 49/51

The lack of measures proven in this procedure is likely to have a widespread impact on all contracts, thereby losing all control over the personal data involved in the change of ownership of supplies, thus rendering meaningless the fundamental right to the protection of personal data recognized in Article 18 of the Spanish Constitution. As the Constitutional Court has stated (Judgment 292/2000, of November 30, 2000), "the fundamental right to data protection seeks to guarantee individuals the power to control their personal data, its use, and its destination, with the aim of preventing illicit trafficking that is harmful to the dignity and rights of the data subject (…) The right to data protection guarantees individuals the power to dispose of such data."

Article 83.2 b) GDPR: "Intentional or negligent infringement"

The Supreme Court has held that negligence exists whenever a legal duty of care is disregarded, that is, when the offender fails to behave with the required diligence. In assessing the degree of diligence, the professionalism of the individual must be especially considered. There is no doubt that, in the case now under review, when the defendant entity's activity involves constant and extensive handling of personal data, rigor and exquisite care must be emphasized to comply with the legal provisions in this regard. [Judgment of the National Court of 17/10/2007 (rec. 63/2006)].

It should be noted that the vulnerability detected in the procedure when verifying all of a customer's data prior to contracting has led to the update of the Change of Ownership Procedure, including an explicit reference to the obligation to perform searches in the systems using the interested party's DNI. However, as already indicated, the respondent has not analyzed the existing risks that would not be reduced by identifying the customer through their DNI.

The following are considered aggravating factors:

Article 76.2 b) LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act): "The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data."

In the present case, considering the volume of personal data managed by the respondent due to the sector in which it operates, it carries with it a greater responsibility regarding the implementation of security systems. The failure to establish adequate security measures in this area increases the significant risk of unauthorized access, manipulation, or loss of data, which leads to the existence of this potential aggravating circumstance.

Considering the factors outlined above, the estimated fine is €1,250,000 for violations of Article 32 of the GDPR.

Therefore, in accordance with applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for graduating sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

Finally, it is noted that, in accordance with the provisions of Article 90.3 a) of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Code), a final administrative decision may be provisionally suspended if the interested party expresses their intention to file an administrative appeal.
