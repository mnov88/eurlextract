<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>In May 2023, the data subject applied for a job position in a school (‘controller’). The data subject was not selected for this position, but the refusal decision was published on Smartschool, a digital school platform. The decision was made visible to around 150 staff members. 
</p><p>Following this event, the school board issued a communication to the school staff indicating that this confidential information was regrettably made public, and they added that the general director did not participate in the assessment of the candidate, nor did they have an influence on it. 
</p><p>On 26 August 2023, the data subject received an email from the general director of the school who addressed him about his cover letter. From this, the data subject concluded that during the selection process, the selection committee passed his cover letter to the director, who was a third party.
</p><p>On 24 October 2023, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA (‘GBA’) regarding the transmission of his cover letter to a third party.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>First, the GBA considered that the publication of the refusal decision of Smartschool allowed other staff members to access the refusal decision, resulting in an unauthorized exposure of personal data to third parties and a breach of confidentiality.
</p><p>Second, the GBA held that given that the publication on Smartschool may have been an error, there was no intention to make the refusal decision widely known. However, the DPA considered that such an error may indicate the absence of technical and organizational measures. 
</p><p>Finally, the GBA suspected that internal and confidential documents, such as the data subject’s CV and cover letter, were forwarded to third parties who were not involved in the selection process. The GBA could not verify the exact involvement of the third party. However, the DPA noted that the general director did not participate in the assessment which seemed to confirm the data subject’s allegations. 
</p><p>Therefore, the DPA issued a prima facie warning against the controller for (i) violating the principle of legality by publishing the refusal decision to the wrong recipients which was not based on a legal basis under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a>, (ii) violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(c) GDPR</a> by sending the data subject’s personal data to wrong recipients and (iii) not taking the necessary technical and organizational under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR" title="Article 25 GDPR">Article 25 GDPR</a>.

                                                     Decision 81/2024 of May 24, 2024


File number: DOS-2023-04145


Subject: The occurrence of a data leak at Smartschool and it is unlawful

forwarding a motivation letter/CV



The Disputes Chamber of the Data Protection Authority, composed of Mr

Hielke HIJMANS, sole chairman;

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016

on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of

personal data and regarding the free movement of such data and to the revocation of

Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), hereinafter “GDPR”;


Having regard to the law of 3 December 2017 establishing the Data Protection Authority,
hereinafter “WOG”;


In view of the internal rules of order, as approved by the House of Representatives

Representatives on December 20, 2018 and published in the Belgian Official Gazette on

January 15, 2019;


Considering the documents in the file;


Has made the following decision regarding:


Complainant: X, hereinafter “the complainant”



The defendant: Y, hereinafter “the defendant” Decision 81/2024 — 2/6



I. Facts and procedure


 1. The subject of the complaint concerns the publication of personal communications in

       in connection with an application from the complainant via the Smart School system that the defendant
       (an educational institution) uses and forwards the complainant's motivation letter to

       third parties.


 2. The complainant indicates that he has applied for a position with the defendant. The complainer

       was not retained for this position, but unfortunately saw the refusal decision

       be published on Smartschool, where it would have been visible to approximately 150

       staff members. The school board then made an announcement on (...) stating:

       addressed to the employees of Y, which reads as follows:

       “Notice to the staff of Y


       On May 5, an internal selection committee, composed solely of three, made the decision

       mandated board members, based on the submitted CV with motivation and vision statement

       not to consider X's candidacy and therefore not to invite him
       for a selection interview. The assessment was made on substantive grounds, which depend on the

       candidate have been notified by email and by registered letter. There is understanding for the

       experienced disappointment, but it is regrettable that this is confidential to the candidate

       targeted communication apparently made public and caused a commotion.


       The board of Z wishes to state that the management did not participate in the assessment and there

       had no influence whatsoever. With respect for all involved, the board remains committed to the

       decisions made, it looks forward to the recruitment of a suitable candidate for the

       renewed vacancy for director Y.”

 3. On August 26, 2023, the complainant will receive an email from the general manager of the

       educational institution, which speaks to him about the contents of the application letter sent by the complainant

       submitted at the time. The complainant concludes from this that during the candidacy process the

       selection committee has passed on its motivation letter to this third party. After all, this one is

       not a member of the selection committee.

 4. On October 24, 2023, the complainant will submit a complaint to the Data Protection Authority

       against the defendant.

      copying the file, he or she must contact the secretariat of the

II. Justification


 7. As acknowledged by the defendant in the 'Notice to the staff of Y,

      confidential communications made public by mistake, indicating a
      possible “personal data breach”. Through the publication of the

      refusal decision at Smartschool, other employees of the complainant could

      gain access to the denial decision, which resulted in an unauthorized

      exposure of personal data to others and a breach of confidentiality.

 8. Based on the facts presented, the Dispute Chamber concludes prima facie that the

      defendant does not have a valid legal basis according to Article 6.1 of the GDPR for the

      processing of the relevant data. Moreover, this processing probably has

      confidentiality and integrity were compromised because third parties gained access to the

      facts.

 9. In this regard, the Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that, given the fact that the publication on

      Smartschool may have been a mistake, it was by no means the intention to do so

      to make the refusal decision generally known. This certainly follows from the nature of a decision
      mistake itself. However, such an error may indicate the absence of

      technical and organizational measures that reduce the risk of unlawful processing

      as a result of human error.

 10. In addition, the Disputes Chamber suspects that internal, "confidential" documents (i.e.

      motivation letter and/or CV from the complainant) to third parties who were not involved in the

      selection process for the vacancy would have been forwarded. The complainant claims that this

      third party is not part of the selection committee. The exact involvement of this one

      third party in the process, however, cannot be verified at this time by the

      Dispute Chamber. The 'Notice to Y's staff indicates that “the direct does not
      participated in the assessment”, which seems to confirm the complainant's claims and

      suggests that the general manager was indeed not part of the

      selection committee.

 11. Based on this analysis, the Disputes Chamber concludes that the defendant may

      has infringed the GDPR. This justifies taking a decision on the basis of Decision 81/2024 - 4/6


      of Article 95, §1, 4°, of the WOG, namely issuing a warning to the

      defendant.


 12. Prima facie the Disputes Chamber can determine that there is insufficient care
      applied when processing the complainant's personal data. The Disputes Chamber states

      established that the following infringements have probably been committed:


           a. The principle of legality was violated because the publication of the

               refusal decision from the complainant to the wrong recipients
               was not based on a legal basis under Article 6(1) of the GDPR;


           b. The principle of integrity and confidentiality as set out in Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR

               was violated because the defendant by sending

               personal data of the complainant to wrong recipients
               confidentiality of that personal data has been compromised; and


           c.  From the sending of the complainant's personal data to a wrong person

               recipient seems to result from the fact that the defendant has not provided the necessary technical and

               has organizational measures in accordance with Article 25 of the GDPR

               taken to ensure and demonstrate that the processing has taken place
               took place in accordance with the GDPR.


 13. This decision is a prima facie decision taken by the Disputes Chamber

      in accordance with Article 95 of the WOG on the basis of the complaint submitted by the complainant,
                                                                                   3
      in the context of the “procedure prior to the decision on the merits” and none
      decision on the merits of the Disputes Chamber within the meaning of Article 100 of the WOG.


      The Disputes Chamber has thus decided, on the basis of Article 58.2.a) GDPR and

      Article 95, § 1, 4°, of the WOG, to impose a warning on the defendant.

 14. The purpose of this decision is to inform the defendant of the fact that this

      may have committed an infringement of the provisions of the GDPR and this in the

      to provide the opportunity to still comply with the aforementioned provisions, or

      to avoid such infringements in the future.

 15. If the defendant does not agree with the content of this prima facie case

      decision and is of the opinion that it can put forward factual and/or legal arguments that

      could lead to a new decision, it can request a reconsideration

      submit to the Disputes Chamber in accordance with the procedure established in Articles 98 in conjunction

      99 of the WOG, known as a “treatment on the merits”. This request must be

      sent to the email address litigationchamber@apd-gba.be within a period of 30

       days after notification of this primafacie decision. If applicable, implementation will take place

       of this decision is suspended for the above-mentioned period.

 16. In the event of a continuation of the merits of the case, the

       Disputes Chamber the parties on the basis of Articles 98, 2° and 3° in conjunction with Article 99 of the

       invite WOG to submit their defenses and any documents they consider useful

       to be added to the file. If necessary, the present decision will become final

       suspended.


 17. Finally, for the sake of completeness, the Disputes Chamber points out that a hearing on the merits

       of the case may lead to the imposition of the measures referred to in Article 100 of the

       WOG . 4


 18. In accordance with Article 57 of the WOG and taking into account the language in which the complaint was submitted

       Dutch is used as the procedural language.
