<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A data subject filed a complaint against Lia's Clothes (an online clothes store) stating that the website did not have an adequate privacy policy or cookie banner. 
</p><p>The Spanish DPA (AEPD) initiated an investigation, and determined that once data subjects were prompted to introduce their personal data, there was indeed no information provided related to the protection of personal data, or a link to a privacy policy.
</p><p>The AEPD also verified that when entering the website, non-essential cookies such as Google Analytics are used, without an adequate banner informing data subjects about their use, the possibility to reject them, or consent to them in a differentiated granular manner.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD held that by processing personal data without the data subject’s clear, affirmative, informed and free consent, or any other valid legal basis, the online store had violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a>.
</p><p>The AEPD also held that the online store had violated its obligation under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a> to provide data subjects information related to the processing of their personal data when collected from them, in particular by not having a privacy policy and not disclosing any details as to who the controller of that personal data would be.
</p><p>Lastly, the AEPD held that the online store’s use of non-essential cookies without having a cookie banner violated Article 22.2 of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2002-13758">Spanish Law of Information Society Services (LSSI)</a>, which establishes that clear and complete information on the use of cookies and the purposes of the data processing must be provided to data subjects, as well as the possibility to reject non-essential cookies.
</p><p>Taking into account that the online store was owned by a private individual, the AEPD issued a fine of €1000 for the each of the three aforementioned violations, for a total fine of €3000. Due to the fact that the individual voluntarily paid the fine and expressly accepted their responsibility, the fine was reduced to €1800. 
</p><p>The AEPD also ordered the owner of the store to incorporate an adequate privacy policy and cookie banner in order to comply with GDPR and national data protection provisions.

In this sense, article 6.1.a) of the RGPD, establishes, on the legality of the treatment

of personal data, that the treatment of these will only be lawful if at least
one of the conditions indicated in point 1, among which is: a) the

compliance with the fact that in order to obtain the consent of the users, they are provided with a
blank box or similar mechanism where you can give the consent of a

affirmative, informed and free manner.



Before providing personal data and giving consent to their processing,

It would be desirable that the interested party be recommended to read and understand the privacy policy.
emptiness Also, it would be considered good practice to remind the user of their choice
of permissions and request a confirmation of your consent, in the same way that

many times a second confirmation is requested when the user unsubscribes from
an online service or advertising communications.

Thus, article 72.1.b) of the LOPDGDD considers it very serious, for the purposes of
prescription, “The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the

conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation”.




This infraction can be sanctioned with a maximum fine of €20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for the

of greater amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.



The balance of the circumstances contemplated, with respect to the infraction committed,

by violating the provisions of article 6.1 of the RGPD, and considering that the owner of
the claimed web page is a natural person, it allows setting an initial sanction of
1,000 euros, (one thousand euros), when carrying out an illicit treatment of personal data

obtained from the "purchase" form of the web page of its ownership.



Along with this and in accordance with article 58.2 of the RGPD, the corrective measure that

could be imposed on the owner of the web page would consist of ordering him to take the
necessary measures to adapt it to current regulations, with the inclusion of a

mechanism that enables users of this to provide their consent for the
treatment of your personal data, in a clear, affirmative and voluntary way.




III.- About the "Privacy Policy" of the website:

from the page: “contact: 34685792696 infozapatones@gmail.com”.




Article 13 of the RGPD establishes the information that must be provided to the

case; c) the purposes of the treatment to which the personal data is destined and the basis

2. In addition to the information mentioned in section 1, the person in charge of the

treatment will facilitate the interested party, at the moment in which the data is obtained
personal, the following information necessary to guarantee data processing
fair and transparent: a) the period during which the personal data will be kept or,

when this is not possible, the criteria used to determine this period; b) the
existence of the right to request access to data from the data controller
related to the interested party, and its rectification or deletion, or the limitation of its

treatment, or to oppose the treatment, as well as the right to the portability of the
data; c) when the treatment is based on article 6, paragraph 1, letter a), or the
Article 9, paragraph 2, letter a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent in

any time, without affecting the legality of the treatment based on the

For its part, article 72.1.h) of the LOPDGDD considers it very serious, for the purposes of
prescription, “the omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the treatment of
your personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the RGPD”

For the use of non-excepted cookies, it will be necessary to obtain the consent

V- Violation of the Cookies Policy



The known facts could constitute an infraction, attributable to the

responsible for the web, for violation of article 22.2 of the LSSI, since it establishes
what:




“Service providers may use storage devices and
recovery of data in terminal equipment of the recipients, provided that

they have given their consent after they have been provided
clear and complete information on its use, in particular, on the purposes of the
data processing, in accordance with the provisions of Organic Law 15/1999, of 13

December, on the protection of personal data.



Where technically possible and effective, the recipient's consent to

Accepting the processing of the data may be facilitated through the use of the parameters
from the browser or other applications.




The foregoing will not prevent the possible storage or access of a technical nature to the sole
purpose of effecting the transmission of a communication over a communications network

electronic or, to the extent that is strictly necessary, for the provision of
a service of the information society expressly requested by the
addressee".




This Infraction is typified as "minor" in article 38.4 g), of the aforementioned Law, which
considers as such: “Use data storage and retrieval devices

when the information has not been provided or the consent of the
recipient of the service in the terms required by article 22.2.”, and may be

sanctioned with a fine of up to €30,000, in accordance with article 39 of the aforementioned
LSSI.


C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 13/18










After the evidence obtained in the preliminary investigation phase, and without prejudice to

whatever results from the investigation, it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction to
impose in accordance with the following aggravating criteria, established by art. 40 of

the LSSI:



    - The existence of intentionality, an expression that must be interpreted as

        equivalent to a degree of guilt according to the Judgment of the
        National High Court of 11/12/07 relapse in Appeal no. 351/2006,
        corresponding to the denounced entity the determination of a system of

        Obtaining informed consent that is in accordance with the mandate of the LSSI.



In accordance with these criteria, it is considered appropriate to impose an initial sanction of

1,000 euros (one thousand euros), for the infringement of article 22.2 of the LSSI, regarding the
cookie policy made on the website in question.




Along with this, the corrective measure that could be imposed would consist of ordering that,
take the necessary measures on the web page of its ownership to adapt it to

current regulations, with the inclusion of a mechanism that makes it impossible to use
of non-necessary cookies before the user gives his consent; including a
mechanism that makes it possible to reject all cookies or do it in a granular way to

through a control panel; including a homepage banner with information
tion about cookies and a "Cookies Policy" with more detailed information in a
Second layer.




VI-Initial total sanction:




In accordance with the criteria set out in the previous points, the total initial sanction to be
impose would be 3,000 euros (three thousand euros): 1,000 euros (one thousand euros) for the infraction

of article 6.1 of the RGPD; 1,000 euros (one thousand euros), for the infringement of article 13 of the
