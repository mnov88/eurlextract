<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>In 2022, the data subject was notified that since 2014 he was registered in the Fraud Signaling Facility (Fraudesignaleringsvoorziening – FSV), a database used by the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration to register indications of fraud. The FSV did not comply with the GDPR and therefore since 2020 was no longer in use.    
</p><p>The Minister of Finance investigated the incident on its own initiative and found that data subject's data had the not been shared with other agencies,  the registration did not negatively impact the data subject and therefore he was not eligible for compensation.  
</p><p>In November 2023, the data subject submitted an access request <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">under Article 15 GDPR</a> for his personal data stored in the FSV to the Minister. The Minister granted this request with a ministerial decision and provided an overview of his registration. The data subject disagreed with this ministerial decision and filed an objection claiming that the record provided was incomplete. Then the Minister provided additional data.
</p><p>The data subject filed an appeal against the ministerial decision on objection before the North Holland District Court (HAA) maintaining that the data remained incomplete. Furthermore, the data subject claimed that the FSV registration had long-term harmful effects on his reputation and business due to unlawful sharing with third parties and led to negative decisions by other agencies. Lastly, he seeked €25,000 in non-material damages. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>First, the court found no evidence that the data subject’s FSV data had been shared with other authorities. The negative decisions from other agencies were received before his registration in 2014. 
</p><p>Second, the court also stated it was not competent to award damages in this case. According to national procedural law, only a civil court could assess claims for damages stemming from factual acts of the public administration, like data sharing, as the administrative court can only assess damages directly linked to unlawful decisions. The court concluded that the registration or hypothetical sharing of data did not qualify as such.
</p><p>Consequently, the court ruled that the appeal against the ministerial decision on objection unfounded. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>The data subject's claim failed due to lack of evidence of unlawful data sharing, absence of harm directly linked to an administrative decision, and the court's lack of jurisdiction over damage claims for factual acts.

<pre>COURT OF NORTH HOLLAND
Seat Alkmaar
Administrative law
case number: HAA 24/5038

ruling of the single chamber of 10 June 2025 in the case between
[plaintiff] , from [place 1] ( [country] ), plaintiff
(authorized: mr. P.F.M. Deijkers)

and
the Minister of Finance
(authorized agents: mr. A. Strooper and mr. A. van der Linden).

Summary
1. This ruling concerns the plaintiff's request to the minister for access to his personal data in the Fraud Signaling Provision (FSV). The plaintiff made this request on the basis of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)1. The minister has granted the request and provided an overview of the FSV. The plaintiff objected to this, because he said the overview provided was incomplete. In the decision on objection, the minister provided additional access to the 'notes' section to the plaintiff's FSV registration. The plaintiff does not agree with this, for which he gives a number of arguments (appeal grounds). On the basis of these grounds of appeal, the court assesses the decision on objection.

2. The court comes to the following judgment in this ruling. Plaintiff has not made it plausible that his personal data from the FSV have been shared with other bodies. The indications given by the plaintiff for this are insufficient for this. Also, in this case, the court is not competent to award damages to the plaintiff. The plaintiff is therefore not right and the appeal is therefore unfounded. After this, the court explains how it comes to this judgment and what consequences this judgment has.

2.1.
The laws and regulations important for the assessment of the profession can be found in the annex to this ruling.

Process
3.1.
Plaintiff has reported to the Recovery Allowances department to have the situation with his childcare allowance investigated. In the letter of April 30, 2022, the Tax and Customs Administration informs the plaintiff that he was registered in the FSV. This was due to the suspicion that the plaintiff had applied for more childcare allowance for 2013 than he was entitled to. The letter also states that the FSV did not comply with the GDPR and therefore per
February 27, 2020 is no longer used. The minister went further to investigate whether the FSV registration had had negative consequences for the plaintiff. The minister also investigated whether the FSV registration has been shared with other authorities.

3.2.
In the letter of April 29, 2023, the Tax and Customs Administration informs the plaintiff about the results of the investigation. The FSV registration has not led to an adapted handling of declarations or applications for the plaintiff. The registration is also not shared with other organizations. Furthermore, there was no special personal data in the registration. This leads to the conclusion that the plaintiff is not eligible for an allowance.

3.3.
On November 1, 2023, the plaintiff submitted a request for inspection to the minister. Plaintiff wanted an overview of his personal data that was in the FSV. The Minister granted this request in the decision of November 14, 2023. The Minister has provided an overview of the registration. Plaintiff disagreed with this decision and objected.

3.4.
In the decision on objection of 31 May 2024, the Minister partially agrees with the plaintiff. The overview provided was not complete. That is why the Minister of the Plaintiff also provides access to the 'notes' section of the FSV registration. The Minister emphasizes that the plaintiff's registration has not been shared with other organizations. Therefore, the plaintiff cannot gain access to it. The minister also notes that in the event that FSV data has been shared, that data is not subject to the right of inspection of the GDPR.2
Furthermore, the minister explains that the System Diary of Person-Oriented Intensive Supervision (PIT) was used from 2009 to 2014. The data from PIT has been transferred one-to-one into the FSV. The plaintiff's registration was not yet included. The plaintiff's report was registered on February 11, 2014. That report then came from the KOT-Allowances department. The minister does not have any other systems for these types of registrations. Finally, the plaintiff cannot access the names of employees who have seen the registration. This data has not been kept. The names of employees are also protected for privacy reasons. The plaintiff appealed against this decision to the court.

3.5.
The minister responded to the appeal with a statement of defence.

3.6.
Plaintiff submitted further documents on 5 March 2025.

3.7.
The court heard the appeal on March 18, 2025. Plaintiff participated in this via an image connection. The plaintiff's representative and the minister's representatives were present in the court.

Assessment by the court
Jurisdiction of the court
4. At the hearing, the plaintiff stated that he lives in [country]. The appeal states that he lives in [place 2]. According to several file documents, the plaintiff is also registered with the Tax and Customs Administration as a resident of [place 2]. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, this court assumes that the plaintiff was living in [place 2] at the time of the appeal, so that it is competent to decide on the appeal on the basis of Article 8:7, paragraph 2, of the General Administrative Law Act (Awb).

Has the plaintiff made it plausible that the FSV registration has been shared with other authorities?
5. Plaintiff argues that his FSV registration has been shared with other authorities. He has several indications for this. First, the plaintiff points to the report Blind for People and Law, the State Secretary's letter of January 30, 2023 and the Handreiking Team Fraud. According to the plaintiff, it follows from these documents that data from the FSV were distributed outside the FSV. Secondly, the registration for the plaintiff had the effect of a 'black list'. The evidence for this is in the decisions of various authorities that are negative for the plaintiff. These decisions also show that the plaintiff should have been known as a fraudster before 2014. From 2009, the plaintiff already had to repay childcare allowance. From 2011, the plaintiff had problems obtaining CIZ indications for his company in intercultural care. The fraudster label has therefore also led to the plaintiff's clients recovering their lost PGB budgets from the plaintiff. Plaintiff also suspects that as a result he was also labeled as a fraudster at Zilveren Kruis.
During that period, the company's turnover fell significantly. Plaintiff argues that he could no longer and cannot do his job and that he is a victim of the system. The plaintiff further explained these circumstances at the hearing. Plaintiff wants his damage to be compensated.

5.1.
The court considers that the minister, in his own investigation, came to the conclusion that the plaintiff's FSV registration was not shared with other organizations. This is stated in the letter of April 29, 2023. The minister's representatives further explained at the session how this went. For the court, this explanation by the minister is not implausible or illogical. The FSV registration was done because of the report that something may have gone wrong with an application from the plaintiff. That report was received externally by the Tax and Customs Administration. The notification and registration therefore did not immediately give the plaintiff the stamp 'frauder', but are a reflection of a possible problem. After it was determined that the FSV is contrary to the GDPR, the minister started an investigation into possible negative effects of the FSV registration. This also includes an investigation into whether the FSV registration has been shared with other authorities. In this study, several systems, including that of the Allowances Service, were looked at on the basis of the name and the citizen service number. The conclusion of the investigation was that the plaintiff's FSV data had not been shared with other authorities. The FSV was only considered a kind of notepad of incoming notifications with possible tax risks. For example, if the UWV requests information, it was also registered. Sometimes the Tax and Customs Administration is obliged by law to share data. Here, too, no indications of this were found in the case of the plaintiff during the investigation. Because the plaintiff's AVG request only refers to the FSV, no access to data from other systems or other bodies was granted.
5.2.
The court must then assess whether the plaintiff has made it plausible that the registration has led to negative decisions from other authorities and has therefore been shared with those authorities. The court ruled not. The FSV overview follows that on
February 11, 2014 a report was registered in the FSV and that report was done on April 7, 2014. This is after the stated negative decisions from 2009 and 2011 that the plaintiff refers to. Plaintiff also did not support concrete evidence that the registration must have been transferred from the older PIT system to the FSV. It also follows from the overview that the registration has been included due to possible irregularities in childcare allowance. Thus, problems with that surcharge are the reason for the registration and therefore the non-result. The plaintiff did submit documents on the amount of a debt of a client of his to Zilveren Kruis, but the mere existence of that debt shows no connection with the FSV registration.
The letter from the State Secretary, the report and the handbook that the plaintiff cites do not lead to a different judgment. Those documents only give a general presentation of the problems surrounding the FSV, including the distribution of personal data. This does not indicate that in each individual case FSV data have been shared with other bodies.
The court understands the difficult situation in which the plaintiff, his family, business and clients end up in his, as he explained in detail at the hearing. Only the plaintiff did not make it plausible that this was due to his (short-term) FSV registration, so that this registration must have been shared with all kinds of authorities.
The plaintiff's ground of appeal does not succeed.
The Minister's appeal to the GDPR
6.1.
As a second ground for appeal, the plaintiff argues that it is bad that the minister invokes provisions of the GDPR in this procedure to place data outside the right of access. The Tax and Customs Administration has recognized that the FSV was in conflict with the GDPR, as a result of which the personal rights of the plaintiff have been violated.

6.2.
This concerns a subsidiary position of the minister in the event that personal data would be shared with other authorities. The court has already ruled that the plaintiff did not make it plausible that his FSV registration was shared with other authorities. Therefore, it is not necessary to assess this position of the minister.

Damage compensation
7.1.
Plaintiff requests the court to order the minister to pay damages of €25,000.3

7.2.
The court is not competent to rule on this request. In this, the court follows the minister's position from the statement of defence. The current rules of the Awb for a request for compensation do not apply to damage caused by decisions or other acts of administrative bodies insofar as taken or performed in the context of tasks assigned to the Tax and Customs Administration.4 This appeal concerns an act of the Tax and Customs Administration. This decision therefore falls under the exception.
The plaintiff's request for compensation is therefore subject to old law.5 On the basis of the old law, the cause of the damage determines whether the court has jurisdiction. For example, on the basis of the former Article 8:73, paragraph 1, of the Awb, the administrative court may, at the request of a party, order the administrative body to damage suffered by that party as a result of the contested decision, when an appeal is justified. In addition, the administrative court is entitled under the old law to judge a decision of an administrative body on a request for compensation for damage as a result of a decision that can be challenged by the administrative court.
Plaintiff claims that his damage was caused by sharing his FSV registration with other authorities. Regardless of whether it is plausible that the data has been shared, the registration or exchange of data is a factual act. Registering or sharing is therefore not a decision within the meaning of the Awb. The court is not competent to judge actual acts. The written decision of a governing body on an AVG inspection request does count as a decision.6 However, the plaintiff does not argue that his damage (also) comes from the decisions on his request for inspection. Moreover, the appeal is unfounded. Only the civil court is competent to assess the plaintiff's claim for damages.7
Conclusion and consequences
8. The court is not competent to rule on the plaintiff's request for damages. Furthermore, the court declares the appeal against the decision on objection unfounded. This means that the plaintiff is not right, the decision is not annulled and no new decision is taken on access to the plaintiff's personal data in the FSV. Because the appeal is unfounded, the plaintiff also does not receive compensation for the registry fee and his legal costs.
