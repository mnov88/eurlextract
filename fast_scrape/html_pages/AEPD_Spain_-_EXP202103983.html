<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A data subject realised that their neighbour (controller) installed surveillance cameras that were monitoring their private garden. They considered that the monitoring was violating the Spanish data protection law (Art.22 LOPDGDD) in force. 
</p><p>The data subject therefore filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA recalled that image of a person, according to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR" title="Article 4 GDPR">article 4.1 GDPR</a>, is a personal data and its protection is, therefore, subject of this Regulation. The concept of "processing" of personal data is defined in Article 4.2 of the GDPR. Article 22 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish national data protection law: Ley Orgánica de Protección de Datos Personales y Garantía de los Derechos Digitales BOE-A-2018-11673) sets out the specific rules for the processing of data for video surveillance purposes and stating that natural or legal persons, may carry out the processing of images through camera or video camera systems for the purpose of preserving the security of persons and property, as well as of their installations. However, images may only be captured from the public insofar as it is essential for these security reasons. 
</p><p>Against this background the DPA holds that Video cameras may not capture images of persons who are outside the private space where the video surveillance system is installed, since the processing of images in public places can only be carried out by the Security Forces and Corps.
</p><p>In the prersent case, the DPA found that there were no security reasons that justified the monitoring of a private garden.

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The proceedings processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of the Regulation (EU) in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its provisions issued in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in the subsidiary subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures."
II
The image of a person, according to article 4.1 of the RGPD, is a personal data and its protection is, therefore, subject of this Regulation. Article 4.2 of the GDPR defines the concept of "processing" of personal data. The concept of "processing" of personal data is defined in Article 4.2 of the GDPR.
Article 22 of the LOPDGDD sets out the specific rules for the processing of data for video surveillance purposes and states the following:
"1. Natural or legal persons, whether public or private, may carry out the processing of images through camera or video camera systems for the purpose of preserving the security of persons and property, as well as of their installations.
2. Images may only be captured from the public thoroughfare insofar as it is essential for the purpose mentioned in the previous paragraph.
However, it shall be possible to capture images of the public thoroughfare over a greater extension when it is necessary to guarantee the security of strategic goods or installations or of infrastructures linked to transport, but in no case may it involve the capture of images of the interior of a private home.
3. The data shall be deleted within a maximum period of one month from their capture, except when they have to be kept to prove the commission of acts against the integrity of persons, goods or facilities. In such a case, the images be made available to the competent authority within a maximum period of seventy-two hours from the date of seventy-two hours after the existence of the recording is known.
The blocking obligation provided for in article 32 of this Organic Law shall not apply to such processing.
4. The duty to provide information provided for in Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be understood to be fulfilled by the posting of an informative device in a sufficiently visible place identifying, at least, the existence of the processing, the identity of the controller and the possibility of exercising the rights provided for in Articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. A connection code or internet address to this information may also be included in the informative device.
In any case, the controller shall keep at the disposal of the data subjects the information to which the data subjects the information referred to in the aforementioned regulation.
5. Pursuant to Article 2.2.c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, it is considered to be excluded from its scope of application the processing by a natural person of images that only capture the interior of his or her own home.
This exclusion does not cover processing carried out by a private security entity that has been contracted for the surveillance of a home and has access to the images.
6. The processing of personal data from images and sounds obtained through the use of cameras and video cameras by the Security Forces and Corps and by the competent bodies for the surveillance of the home and by the competent bodies for the surveillance and control in penitentiary centers and for the control, regulation, surveillance and discipline of traffic, shall be governed by the legislation transposing the Directive (EU) 2016/680, where the processing is for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offenses or the execution of criminal sanctions, including the protection of and prevention against threats to public security. Outside these cases, such processing shall be governed by their specific legislation and supplementarily by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and this organic law.
7. The provisions of this article shall be understood without prejudice to the provisions of Law
5/2014, of 4 April, on Private Security and its implementing provisions.
8. The processing by the employer of data obtained through camera or video camera systems is subject to the provisions of article 89 of this organic law.

III
In accordance with the above, the processing of images through a video surveillance system, in order to comply with the regulations in force, must comply with the following requirements:
- Respect the principle of proportionality.
- When the system is connected to an alarm center, it can only be installed by a private security company.
be installed by a private security company that complies with the requirements of article 5 of the
requirements set forth in Article 5 of Law 5/2014 on Private Security, of April 4, 2014.
- Video cameras may not capture images of persons who are outside the private space where the video surveillance system is installed, since the image processing in video surveillance system is installed, since the processing of images in public places can only be carried out, unless there is governmental authorization, by the Security Forces and Corps. Neither may the following be captured or recorded: spaces owned by third parties without the consent of their owners, or, as the case may be, of the persons who are in them.
This rule admits some exceptions since, on some occasions, for the protection of private spaces, where cameras have been installed on façades or in the or inside, it may be necessary, in order to guarantee the security purpose, to record a portion of the  public road. In other words, cameras and video cameras installed for security purposes may not obtain images from the public roadway
of the public roadway unless it is essential for this purpose, or it is impossible to avoid it due to the location of the cameras and, exceptionally, the minimum space for such purpose shall also be included. Therefore, the cameras could exceptionally capture the minimum portion necessary for the intended security purpose.
- The duty to inform the data subjects provided for in Articles
12 and 13 of the RGPD and 22.4 of the LOPDGDD.
- The data controller must keep a record of the processing activities carried out under its responsibility, including the information referred to in article 30.1 of the GDPR.
- The installed cameras may not obtain images of private spaces of third parties and/or public space without a duly accredited justified cause, nor may they affect the privacy of passers-by passing freely through the area. It is not permitted, therefore, to place cameras on the private property of neighbors with the purpose of of intimidating them or affecting their private sphere without justified cause.
- In no case shall the use of surveillance practices be allowed beyond the area of the surroundings of the installations and, in particular, may not affect the surrounding public spaces, adjoining surrounding public spaces, adjoining buildings and vehicles other than those accessing the accessing the area under surveillance.
