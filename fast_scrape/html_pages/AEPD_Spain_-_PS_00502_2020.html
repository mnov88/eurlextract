<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The complainant filed a complaint against Avilon Center 2016 SL. The complainant received commercial calls from Avilon Center on their private number, despite being listed on the Robinson List (opt-out list of people who do not wish to receive marketing transmissions).
</p><p>The Spanish DPA (AEPD) investigated these facts. In its investigation, it found that the telephone number which called the claimant was operated by Sewan Comunicaciones SL. 
</p><p>The AEPD also asked Avilon Center about where they go the claimant's telephone number, the object of the call, the legitimacy of the call, and information provided to the claimant about the origin of the claimant's personal data . Avilon Center responded that information on the origin of the data could not be provided to the data subject during the call as the data subject interrupted the call by stating that they were registered on the Robinson List and hung up. Avilon also mentioned that it is registered in Adigital as a provider of services that has access to the Robinson List and that on the data of the call, there was a software error that blocked the table with the persons included on the Robinson List. This error was solved after 30 minutes, but Avilon Cneter has already made the call to the claimant during that time.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Does making a commercial call to a data subject registered on the Robinson List violate Article 48(1)(b) LGT and Article 21 GDPR in conjunction with Article 23(4) LOPDGDD?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA (AEPD) held that the facts of the case point to the fact that Avilon Center breached Article 48(1)(b) of the Spanish Law on Telecommunications (LGT) as well as Article 21 GDPR in conjunction with Article 23(4) of the Spanish Law on Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (LOPDGDD). 
</p><p>The defendant argued that the reason why a call was made to the claimant despite them being on the Robinson List was because Adigital had a software error so the Robinson List was no accessible to be checked by Avilon Center prior to making the call. However, the AEPD stated that an analysis of the risk prior to processing any person data should be performed. Additionally, necessary controls must be put in place to avoid making calls when such system errors occur. 
</p><p>The AEPD stated that strict liability does not apply in the present case, but that the defendant lacked due diligence in the technical and organisational measures that they applied to the processing of personal data linked to telephone lines. As this lead to a violation of the claimant's rights (notably: right to object by registering themselves on the Robinson List), the AEPD concluded that Avilon Center was responsible for the processing of personal data. 
</p><p>The Spanish DPA therefore imposed a fine of €20,000 on Avilon Center. In accordance to Spanish Administrative Law, this fine was reduced to €12,000 as Avilon Center made a voluntary, early and guilty payment of the fine.

As a result of the investigative actions carried out, it is verified that the

responsible for the treatment is the one claimed.



Likewise, the following points are found:




Transfer the claim to ORANGE, owner of the Jazztel trademark, with

050582/2019, brief of allegations sent by this entity stating, between

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/10








- Regarding the information provided by this entity to the claimant about the origin of
their data, declare that after initiating the agent who called on behalf of Jazztel, the

claimant interrupted him stating that he was registered on the Robinson list and that
would make a claim. He then interrupted the communication, which is why

the agent was unable to provide further information to the claimant.

- AVILON adds that it is registered in ADIGITAL as a provider of
services so you have access to the Robinson list whose data is updated
in their systems monthly. However, on the aforementioned date, it indicates that

produced an error in the software used, momentarily blocking the
table in which all the numbers included in the Robinson File are registered.
This incident was solved in 30 minutes, this call was produced in the

table lock period.





                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW




                                             I




        In accordance with the provisions of article 84.3) of Law 9/2014, of 9
May, General of Telecommunications (LGT), the competition to resolve the
This Penalty Procedure corresponds to the Director of the Agency

Spanish Data Protection.




                                             II






        In the present case, it has been proven that the claimant is included in the
Robinson List.




In accordance with the evidence available at the present time of
agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction, it is considered that the defendant has contravened article 48.1 b) of the

LGT, in relation to article 21 of the RGPD, and article 23.4 of the LOPDGDD, already
that the claimant received on August 21, 2019 at 7:08 p.m. from

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/10








the calling line *** PHONE. 2. business call on your personal mobile phone
from one of the claimed telesales collaborators, such as

recognizes the claimed in his statements to this Agency on July 16 last, "in
the referred date, indicates that there was an error in the software used, leaving
the table in which all numbers are registered is momentarily locked

included in the Robinson File. This incident was resolved in 30 minutes,
this call taking place in the table lock period ”.



       In the present case, the defendant argues that the call to the
claimant for marketing purposes, when the line was included

previously in Adigital's Robinson Listing, was caused by an error in the
software used when the pre-check was momentarily inoperative
with the Robinson Listing.




       However, this deficiency should have been taken into account in the analysis of
risks prior to any processing of personal data and having incorporated the

controls necessary to avoid that in the event of a system error such as the one now analyzed
calls are prevented while the incident lasts.




       Although strict liability is not applicable to the case, if it is true that
there was a lack of due diligence on the part of the respondent in the organization and
technical means applied to the processing of personal data linked to the

receiving telephone lines that have caused the commission of the offense now
charged when the rights of the affected party were violated, even when he had
previously expressed their right to object by incorporating their line into the

Róbinson advertising exclusion. Consequently, the claimed entity is
responsible for the treatment.




       The facts presented (the violation of the right to object) could
suppose the commission by the claimed party of an infraction of article 48.1.b) of

the LGT Law, contained in its Title III, which states that: “Regarding the protection of
personal data and privacy in relation to subscriber directories, users
end of electronic communications services will have the following

rights: (…) b) To oppose receiving unwanted calls for the purposes of
commercial communication carried out through systems other than those
established in the previous letter and to be informed of this right ”,


       Although the aforementioned article does not configure such a right, so we must go to
the data protection regulations in which the right of opposition is regulated:

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/10








Article 21 of the RGPD, (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of the European Parliament and of the

Council, of 04/27/2016, regarding the Protection of Individuals in what
Regarding the Processing of Personal Data and the Free Circulation of this Data) and
Article 23 of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Protection

of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights).




        This offense is classified as "minor", in article 78.11) of
said norm, which considers as such: “The breach of the obligations of
public service, public obligations and violation of the

rights of consumers and end users as established in Title III
of the Law and its implementing regulations ”, which may be sanctioned with a fine of up to

€ 50,000, in accordance with article 79.1.d) of the aforementioned LGT.



                                              III




        In accordance with the indicated precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the sanction to be imposed in

In the present case, it is considered that the sanction to be imposed should be adjusted according to
with the following criteria established in article 80.1) and 2) of the LGT:




   - The consideration of the economic situation of the offender, (point 2).




    After the evidence obtained in the preliminary investigation phase, it is considered
that the penalty to be imposed should be graduated in the amount of € 20,000 (twenty thousand euros).




        Therefore, based on the foregoing,
