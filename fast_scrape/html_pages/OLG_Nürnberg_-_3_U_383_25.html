<p>A court found that a credit information agency lawfully retained a data subject's payment default data for three years after the outstanding debt was settled. The controller could base the processing on legitimate interest and rightfully rejected the data subject's erasure request.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The controller, a credit information agency, made two entries in its register regarding past default payments  by the data subject from 2019 and 2021, in the amounts of €201 and €100, both of which were settled on 03.08.2023 and 07.05.2024.
</p><p>On 9 July and 9 August 2024, the data subject requested the deletion of the data and correction of her score but the controller refused.
</p><p>The data subject filed a case before the court of  first instance (Regional Court of Regensburg-LG Regensburg) requesting the deletion of the entry, correction of the score value and injunctive measures against renewed storage by the controller. 
</p><p>The court of first instance rejected her claims under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_16_GDPR" title="Article 16 GDPR">Article 16</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17 GDPR</a>, holding that the controller’s interests outweighed the data subject’s, according to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1))f GDPR</a>, and that there was no unlawful processing. Also, the data subject could not demand the complete deletion due to an alleged lack of necessity.  
</p><p>The data subject appealed against this judgment before the court of appeal (Higher Regional Court of Nuremberg-OLG Nürnberg). She argued in particular that the court of first instance misjudged the allocation of the burden of proof, because the burden of proof for the existence of a legitimate interest in data processing lies with the controller and that the controller had not convincingly argued the necessity of storing the data for three years after the claims had been settled, invoking ECJ jurisprudence<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>.   
</p><p>The controller claimed that it had legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, and referred to industry standards permitting a three-year retention. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Higher Regional Court of Nuremberg issued its preliminary legal view of the case (Hinweisbeschlüssen).   
</p><p>First, the court of appeal held that the burden of proof under German civil law lies with the data subject to demonstrate that their interests override the controller’s. It also held that processing is always lawful if it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller, even if these are equivalent with the interests of the data subject. Processing only becomes unlawful if the interests and rights of the data subject prevail, for which the data subject consequently bears the burden of proof. The court also points out that the ECJ’s interpretation in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=280623&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=DE&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1">C-340/21</a> does not shift this burden in civil proceedings but only refers to the principle of accountability of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(2) GDPR</a>.  
</p><p>Second, the court of appeal decided that the data processing by the controller was carried out to protect its own legitimate interests and the legitimate interests of its contractual partners in assessing creditworthiness, without this being opposed by overriding interests of the data subject <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1))f GDPR</a>. In this case, the data subject’s general claims of reputational harm and credit denials were considered insufficient and unsubstantiated. 
</p><p>Third, the court of appeal found the three-year storage period is proportionate and appropriate in the specific case, after weighing up the conflicting interests, and is in alignment with industry standards. It distinguished this case from public enforcement or insolvency data contexts, noting that the information in question related to ordinary private-sector payment defaults, not public registers. 
</p><p>Lastly, the court of appeal dismissed the case rejecting data subject's claim under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_16_GDPR" title="Article 16 GDPR">Article 16</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17 GDPR</a>, and the claim for injunctive relief. 
</p><p>It must be pointed out that this judgement is not binding yet. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>This decision confirms that German courts apply a strict balancing test under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(f) GDPR</a>, requiring data subjects to clearly demonstrate why their rights outweigh a controller’s legitimate interest. The OLG also deferred to industry norms and a Code of Conduct to justify the three-year retention of resolved defaults.
</p><p>As in OLG München (14 U 3590/24 e), the court held that credit difficulties alone do not constitute a “special situation” under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#1" title="Article 21 GDPR">Article 21(1) GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>While aligned with domestic German legal precedent, this approach arguably favours controllers and sectoral stability over the GDPR’s founding principle of empowering individuals with stronger control over their personal data, particularly in sensitive areas like credit assessment.

The Senate intends to dismiss the appeal against the judgment of the Regensburg Regional Court of January 28, 2025, case no. 61 O 1551/24, pursuant to Section 522 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), because it unanimously believes that the appeal clearly has no prospect of success, that the legal matter is also of no fundamental importance, that neither the development of the law nor the safeguarding of uniform case law requires a decision by the Court of Appeal, and that an oral hearing on the appeal is not necessary.

Reasons

A.

I. According to the facts of the first-instance judgment, the following facts are undisputed between the parties:

The plaintiff asserts a claim against the defendant for the deletion of an entry in its register. The defendant's database contains two entries from Deutsche T. regarding the plaintiff's payment difficulties from 2019 and 2021. These amounts amounted to €201.30 and ultimately just under €100. These were settled on August 3, 2023, and May 7, 2024, respectively. The plaintiff requested the deletion and correction of the defendant's score on July 9 and August 9, 2024, respectively. The defendant refused these requests on July 11 and August 14, 2024, respectively. The corresponding data entries were forwarded to other customers of the defendant.

II. The Regensburg Regional Court dismissed the action seeking deletion of the plaintiff's entry, correction of the score, and injunction against further storage by the defendant with a final judgment dated January 28, 2025. In its reasoning, the Regional Court stated, in particular, that the plaintiff was neither entitled to the deletion of the disputed entries under Art. 17 (1) GDPR nor to rectification under Art. 16 GDPR. A claim for injunctive relief under Sections 1004 (1) Sentence 2 and 823 (2) BGB was also not applicable.

The defendant did not unlawfully process the data, as the defendant's interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR outweighed the plaintiff's current interest. The data was not unlawfully processed. The legitimate interest within the meaning of the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) was not dependent on the existence of an enforcement order from the debtor.

The requirements for the plaintiff's right to deletion were not met.

Further storage for a period of more than six months after the debt was settled was also not disproportionate and continued to fulfill a permissible warning function. The plaintiff cannot demand complete deletion due to a lack of necessity. The necessity for storage has not ceased simply because the debt has since been settled. The provisions regarding the deletion periods of the debtor register pursuant to Sections 882b et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) are not applicable accordingly. There is also no scope for a corresponding application of the requirements for entries in the debtor register.

The retention period of three years, which was set by the code of conduct issued by the Association of Credit Reporting e.V., is lawful and raises no fundamental concerns. Since the GDPR does not contain any specific regulations regarding the duration of storage of personal data, the criterion of necessity and thus a balancing of interests in the individual case is decisive for the legality of further processing. There are no specific circumstances that justify a special need for protection of the data subject. Furthermore, the plaintiff merely made a general claim about alleged difficulties in obtaining a loan and finding an apartment without providing any further evidence.

Because the stored information is not inaccurate, the plaintiff also has no right to rectification.

Furthermore, there is no claim for injunctive relief; in particular, there is no risk of repetition for the disputed entry to be saved again.

III. The plaintiff appeals this judgment. She requests that:

1. The defendant be ordered to delete the entry concerning the settlement of the previous claim under the account number held by the defendant against the plaintiff dated August 2, 2023, and all related entries from its file maintained by the plaintiff.

2. The defendant be ordered to delete the entry concerning the settlement of the previous claim under the account number held by the defendant against the plaintiff dated May 8, 2024, and all related entries from its file maintained by the plaintiff.

3. The defendant be ordered to correct the score values it maintains, which it uses to assess the plaintiff's creditworthiness, after deletion.

4. The defendant is ordered to refrain from re-saving or otherwise processing any entries relating to the previous claim against the plaintiff, which was marked as settled on August 2, 2023, under the account number held by the defendant, on pain of a fine of up to EUR 250,000 to be determined by the court for each case of infringement, or alternatively, imprisonment to be enforced against its legal representative (board of directors), or imprisonment to be enforced against its legal representative (board of directors) for up to six months, or up to two years in the event of a repeat offense.

5. The defendant is ordered to refrain from re-saving or otherwise processing any entries relating to the previous claim against the plaintiff, which was marked as settled on May 8, 2024, under the account number held by the defendant, on pain of a fine of up to €250,000 to be determined by the court for each case of violation, or alternatively, imprisonment to be enforced against its legal representative (board member), or imprisonment to be enforced against its legal representative (board member) for up to six months, or up to two years in the event of a repeat offense.

6. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff's out-of-court costs in the amount of €973.66.

Alternatively and as a precautionary measure, the plaintiff requests leave to appeal (page 55 of the appeal file).

In support of its claim, the plaintiff argues, in particular, that the Regional Court misjudged the allocation of the burden of proof, arguing that the burden of proof for the existence of a legitimate interest in data processing lies with the defendant. The defendant did not convincingly argue the necessity of three years of storage after the claims have been settled. The first-instance balancing decision to determine an appropriate storage period pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR does not meet the legal requirements of the two-stage review. The interpretation of this standard is erroneous, particularly in view of the ECJ judgment of December 7, 2023, in the joined proceedings, Cases C-26/22 and C-64/22. Furthermore, there is a contradiction in the assessment of Section 882e of the Code of Civil Procedure. The Regional Court erred in law by failing to sufficiently consider the indirect third-party effect of the principle of equal treatment pursuant to Art. 3 (1) of the Basic Law. The – since amended – rules of conduct of the Code of Conduct cannot replace an individual balancing of interests. The new gradation of storage periods contained therein also fails to meet the requirement of a comprehensive balancing of interests under Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The effects of the defendant's data processing and scoring are particularly intrusive for those affected. The plaintiff experiences everyday problems due to the entry, ranging from a feeling of being unfairly portrayed in a negative light to specific, repeated rejections of credit applications. The data processing in question violates the transparency requirement under Art. 5 (1) (a) GDPR.

IV. The defendant requests

dismissal of the appeal with costs (pages 6/7 of the appeal file).

It points out in particular that it is permissible to store the information in question based on legitimate interests for a period of three years from the settlement of the underlying claim. In support of this, the plaintiff submits, among other things, a statement from KPMG Law Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft mbH dated September 11, 2023, regarding the storage of information on payment defaults and settled claims for a period of three years (Exhibit BB 4). Also to be considered is the approval of the new Code of Conduct (Exhibit BB 2) by the data protection supervisory authority responsible for the association "Die Wirtschaftsauskunfteien e.V." on May 24, 2024 (Exhibit BB 3). The burden of presentation and proof lies with the plaintiff. The plaintiff's alleged disadvantages are implausible and their arguments unsubstantiated (pages 78 ff. of the appeal file). The plaintiff failed to meet its payment obligations despite the immediate termination of the underlying contractual relationship for four years and two months with regard to claim 1) of T. Deutschland GmbH, t-mobile division, and despite two reminders for three years and two months with regard to claim 2) of T. Deutschland GmbH (pages 67/68 of the appeal file). In the balancing of interests, the plaintiff's interests did not outweigh the interests of the defendant, its contractual partners, and the general public in the specific case (pages 102 et seq. of the appeal file). There was no violation of the transparency requirement (pages 106 et seq. of the appeal file). There was also no violation of Article 3 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz, GG) (pages 137 et seq. of the appeal file).

V. Reference is also made to the written submissions of both parties.

B.

The members of the Senate are convinced that the plaintiff's appeal has no prospect of success.

I. The district court's judgment is not based on an incorrect assessment of the burden of presentation and proof regarding the defendant's right to store the plaintiff's data. This burden lies with the plaintiff as a substantive prerequisite for the claim according to general principles (see: Federal Court of Justice GRUR 2020, 1338, para. 31).

By referring to the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-340/21 (NJW 2024, 1091), the plaintiff is unable to establish a burden of proof for the defendant. In this judgment (C-340/21), the ECJ ruled solely on the – affirmative – burden of proof of the "controller" within the framework of the principle of accountability formulated in Art. 5 (2) GDPR and concretized in Art. 24 GDPR (see ECJ, ibid., paras. 48 et seq.). Art. 5 (2) GDPR is a purely commercial administrative law provision, according to which the data controller must document compliance with the GDPR and be able to demonstrate it to a supervisory authority. Therefore, in public law cases, this may result in a general burden of proof for the data controller. However, the European Court of Justice has not ruled on the general allocation of the burden of proof in German civil proceedings. The same applies to the Federal Administrative Court decision cited by the plaintiff (cf. BVerwG, NVwZ 2022, p. 1205, paras. 49 et seq.).

Rather, national law applies to the burden of presentation and proof applicable to individual data subject claims. Accordingly, it is incumbent upon the data subjects themselves to explain their interests, which must be taken into account in the specific balancing of interests pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The wording of the processing restriction in Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR "[...] unless [...]" results in a rule-exception relationship – which must be refuted by the data subjects – for the admissibility of data processing necessary to protect legitimate interests. Pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, this is lawful precisely if it is carried out to protect legitimate interests and the interests and rights of the data subject do not override them. According to this system, processing is therefore always lawful if it is necessary to protect legitimate interests, even if the interests of the data subject conflict, as long as these interests are equivalent. Processing only becomes unlawful if the interests and rights of the data subject prevail, for which the data subject consequently bears the burden of presentation and proof (see in parallel proceedings: Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart, judgment of August 10, 2022 - 9 U 24/22, BeckRS 2022, 20818, para. 33).

Contrary to the plaintiff's legal opinion, a different distribution of the burden of proof does not arise from the case law on disputes under the right to freedom of expression. It is true that in the case of slander, according to the evidentiary rule of Section 186 of the German Criminal Code (StGB), which has been transformed into civil law freedom of expression via Section 823 (2) of the German Civil Code (BGB), the burden of proof for the truth of the factual allegation infringing personal rights generally lies with the tortfeasor (cf. Federal Constitutional Court, NJW 2016, 3360 para. 17; Federal Court of Justice, NJW 2013, 790 para. 15). However, the case at issue does not involve slander within the meaning of Section 186 of the German Criminal Code, nor does it involve the dissemination of a factual allegation by the defendant.

In this context, it must also be considered that the plaintiff's statements regarding her interests are limited to general statements. In response to the defendant's denial, the plaintiff referred in particular to her interest in economic participation in her reply (pages 123 ff. of the Regional Court file) and, in the appeal proceedings, to her feeling of being unfairly portrayed in a negative light and to repeated rejections of loans, without sufficiently specifying these negative effects.

II. The defendant processed the data in dispute to protect its own legitimate interests and those of at least its contractual partners as third parties, without any overriding interests of the plaintiff conflicting with this (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).

1. The processing of personal data is lawful under three cumulative conditions: First, a legitimate interest must be pursued by the controller or a third party; second, the processing of the personal data must be necessary to achieve that legitimate interest; and third, the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the person whose data is to be protected must not prevail (cf. ECJ, GRUR 2023, 1131 para. 106 – Facebook Ireland; OLG Düsseldorf, GRUR-RS 2024, 32757 para. 37).

2. The defendant's data processing in the form of storage was initially carried out in the defendant's own interest as a general basis for its business model, as it concludes contracts with companies that offer services that may in any case also be of a credit nature. It receives remuneration from its customers for the opportunity to obtain information about their potential customers that it considers to be credit-relevant. Since all interests within the meaning of Art. 6 GDPR can be legitimate, whether of a legal, personal, non-material, or purely economic nature, the defendant's purely commercial interest in storing the data also constitutes such a legitimate interest. Storage for this purpose is also necessary because the defendant would otherwise be unable to fulfill its contractual obligations to its customers regarding inquiries concerning the plaintiff due to a lack of a complete data basis (cf. Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart, judgment of August 10, 2022 – 9 U 24/22, BeckRS 2022, 20818, para. 25; Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt, judgment of January 18, 2023 – 7 U 100/22, BeckRS 2023, 583, para. 30). In the case at issue, the storage was carried out in order to safeguard these interests.

Furthermore, the storage also served, in particular, the legitimate interests of the defendant's contractual partners as potential lenders to the plaintiff. This storage formed the data basis for the information requested by this limited group of people, the members of the defendant as a joint institution of the German lending industry, with a demonstration of a legitimate interest, which will usually be present in the case of a concrete intended business relationship with the plaintiff. Thus, the processing of this personal data serves the socio-economic interests of the credit sector (cf. ECJ NJW 2024, 417 para. 83 – Score). The fact that the interests of the defendant's potential customers are not only considered legitimate, but also particularly worthy of protection by the legal system - both European and national - is evident in particular from Article 8 of Directive 2008/48/EC of 23 April 2008 on consumer credit agreements and repealing Directive 87/102/EEC, according to which the creditor is obliged, before concluding the credit agreement, to assess the consumer's creditworthiness on the basis of sufficient information, if necessary also on the basis of information from public and private databases (cf. Higher Regional Court of Cologne, judgment of 27 January 2022 - 15 U 153/21, BeckRS 2022, 1208, para. 22; ECJ, loc. cit., para. 84 - Score). This obligation to assess consumers' creditworthiness is intended not only to protect the credit applicant but also – as emphasized in Recital 26 of Directive 2008/48 – to ensure the smooth functioning of the entire credit system (see ECJ, op. cit., para. 86 – Score). Furthermore, with regard to consumer credit agreements relating to residential immovable property, Article 18(1) and Article 21(1) of Directive 2014/17, in conjunction with Recitals 55 and 59 of that directive, stipulate that the creditor must conduct a thorough assessment of the consumer's creditworthiness and has access to credit databases, with consultation of such databases being a useful element in this assessment (see ECJ, op. cit., para. 85 – Score).

3. This and the resulting transmission of the requested data are necessary to protect these legitimate interests, as the inquiring customers clearly consider their previous payment behavior to be contractually relevant for their own potentially intended business relationship with the plaintiff. Otherwise, they would not request information about such data, which is typically stored by the defendant. Without storing such credit-relevant information about payment defaults, the defendant would not be able to provide its contractual partners with an accurate and objective assessment of the plaintiff's creditworthiness.

a) The information in dispute is – even today – necessary to compensate for the information disparity between lenders and borrowers. Otherwise, lenders would be solely dependent on the self-disclosures of potential borrowers. The determination of creditworthiness, which credit institutions are obligated to do not only in their own interest, and the provision of credit reports form the foundation of the German credit system and also serve the functioning of the economy and the protection of consumers from over-indebtedness (cf. Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt, op. cit., paras. 31/33).

The purpose of transmitting data to the defendant's customers is to provide them with information about the plaintiff's past payment history as their potential contractual partner, so that they can make a broader decision as to whether they wish to assume the economic risk associated with an advance payment. It is common experience that many debtors do not voluntarily provide their potential, advance-paying contractual partners with comprehensive and truthful information about their previous and current financial situation in order to enable them to comprehensively assess the risks. The data transfer serves, in particular, to compensate for this existing disparity in the information basis (see Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart, judgment of August 10, 2022 – 9 U 24/22, BeckRS 2022, 20818, para. 39). To the extent that it enables an objective and reliable assessment of the creditworthiness of the potential customers of the credit agency's contractual partners, the analysis of a credit agency can compensate for information differences and thus reduce any risks of fraud and other uncertainties (see ECJ, ibid., para. 93 – Score).

b) The fact that the plaintiff paid the disputed liability of €201.30 only four years and two months after Deutsche T. terminated the underlying contractual relationship without notice, and the additional liability of approximately €100 only three years and two months after the first reminder, has a direct bearing on the plaintiff's assessment of its ability and willingness to pay.

Against this background, the defendant stores a reference to the date of full settlement of the claim in the disputed information. This does not change the necessity of processing the data, as the settlement was preceded by significant unreliability. The banking industry has a legitimate interest in knowing the extent to which contract fulfillment has been reliable in the past. Negligence in payment behavior in the past may justify the assumption that difficulties in contract fulfillment may arise in the future (see Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart, judgment of August 31, 2022 – 9 U 65/22, p. 10). Against this background, the mere settlement of a claim cannot justify a claim for deletion of a corresponding entry.

4. The plaintiff does not have overriding interests or fundamental rights and freedoms in this case.

a) The proposed storage period of three years is not objectionable in principle; rather, it is reasonable, considering the interests of the data subject against the interests of the defendant, and is limited to what is necessary for the purposes of its processing.

Unlike Section 35 of the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) (old version), the GDPR does not stipulate any time limits for the storage period. The standard period provided for in the Code of Conduct appears objectively appropriate; this is particularly true with regard to the interests of the defendant's lending members in relation to the plaintiff's interest in deletion. The underlying risk of default on loans granted can in any case justify the proposed storage period if, as in this case, claims of a relatively small amount of EUR 201.30 and approximately EUR 100 have not been settled over a not inconsiderable period of several years.

The Senate also considers the deadline to be appropriate in light of the assessments expressed in Section 35 (2) Sentence 2 No. 4 of the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) (old version). This provision provided for, in the event of a resolved matter at the end of the third calendar year, only an assessment of the necessity of commercially processed personal data. In addition, according to the revised Code of Conduct, effective May 24, 2024, a rigid three-year deadline no longer applies; in certain cases, deletion occurs after just 18 months. However, such an exception does not apply here.

These rules of conduct were reviewed and approved by the Hessian State Data Protection Commissioner. Due to the fact that the plaintiff failed to comply with the two disputed demands within the deadline, its legitimate interests are superseded in the individual case. A retention period of three years is appropriate in this specific case after weighing the conflicting interests.

b) This is also not contradicted by the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Score case.

The ECJ ruled that Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation 2016/679 in conjunction with Article 6(1)(f) of that regulation is to be interpreted as precluding a practice by private credit reporting agencies that consists in storing in their own databases information from a public register on the granting of discharge of residual debt to natural persons for the purpose of providing information on the creditworthiness of those persons for a period that exceeds the storage period of the data in the public register. It emphasizes that the lawfulness of processing within the framework of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR requires a comprehensive balancing of interests. In this case, this balance is in favor of a maximum storage period of six months. This is also the assumption of the legislature in Section 3(1) and (2) of the InsBekV.

A comparable connection exists. However, this is not the case here. Thus, the disputed entries only concern payment delays. Furthermore, the ECJ's decision refers solely to the situation, which is not relevant here, namely that the stored data was taken from public registers and is intended to be stored for a longer period than in the public registers themselves.

Section 3 of the InsoBekV provides for a six-month storage period exclusively for data from insolvency proceedings, including the opening of insolvency proceedings. Such data relating to insolvency proceedings are not the subject of the dispute here. Rather, the information relates to the liabilities not fulfilled by the plaintiff in a timely manner. There is no statutory provision comparable to Section 3 of the InsoBekV for information in a private database on due, unpaid claims as serious payment defaults (cf. Brandenburg Higher Regional Court, judgment of July 3, 2023 - 1 U 8/22, BeckRS 2023, 16930, para. 14).

c) There is also no unjustified or unreasonable unequal treatment of Entries taken from the debtors' register and other entries exist. Rather, these are different situations:

The mere existence of an enforcement title is not enough to enter an entry in the public debtors' register; rather, according to Section 882b (1) Nos. 1 – No. 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, entries are only made in the cases specified therein. Entry under Section 882c of the Code of Civil Procedure is part of the enforcement proceedings and requires a special entry order from the bailiff. In contrast, entry in other cases is usually based on a creditor's notification.

The deletion of an entry in the debtors' register occurs either exactly three years later or earlier if the Central Enforcement Court notifies the court of the deletion of the entry from the debtors' register. This requires a special deletion order from the Central Enforcement Court (Section 882e of the Code of Civil Procedure), for the issuance of which the debtor must demonstrate to the court that the creditor has been satisfied or that the grounds for entry no longer apply. Central Enforcement Court.

However, a situation comparable to the debtor register does not exist with the defendant's storage and processing of data. The defendant only provides information to its contractual partners (primarily banks, savings banks, cooperative banks, credit card, factoring, and leasing companies), and even then, only to these partners if there is a legitimate interest. Such a legitimate interest exists, among other things, if a company makes an advance payment to the debtor in question with a service or delivery and thus bears an economic risk. Thus, on the one hand, the circle of potential recipients of information is significantly smaller than that of the debtor register, and on the other hand, the defendant, as a legal entity under private law, only provides information to this smaller group of persons in certain circumstances, i.e., in the event of an advance financial payment to the debtor and thus based on a recognizable interest of this group of persons. In view of this, there is no scope for a corresponding application of the requirements regarding entries in the debtor register (cf. Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt, judgment of January 18, 2023 - 7 U 100/22, BeckRS 2023, 583, paras. 37 et seq. with further references).

In terms of a control consideration, the above result of a fundamental interest in information of three years also corresponds to the statutory deletion period for entries from the debtors' register pursuant to Section 882e (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO). This can be seen as a legislator's assessment of the period for which potential lenders are to be granted a legitimate interest in information about past payment behavior (cf. Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart, judgment of August 10, 2022 - 9 U 24/22, BeckRS 2022, 20818, para. 49).

d) Against this background, there is no violation of Article 3 (1) of the Basic Law in the present case, without the need for a decision on its (indirect) applicability with regard to the defendant. This is because – as just explained – the defendant's differentiation of the retention periods is based on a factual Reason: The intensity of intervention entailed by discharge of residual debt and thus the filing of insolvency is significantly higher than by the settlement of a specific obligation. This is also reflected, for example, in the fact that the defendant notes a note after the settlement of the obligation that the obligation has since been settled. This also informs potential borrowers.

e) The defendant has made substantiated arguments regarding the necessity of a three-year storage period in cases of this type, in particular by submitting a statement from KPMG Law Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft mbH dated September 11, 2023, regarding the storage of information on payment defaults and settled claims for a period of three years. This statement concludes that negative characteristics for settled claims have a statistically relevant significance for a period of three years. The probability of a new payment default among persons who have experienced payment defaults is still statistically significantly higher three years after the settlement of the claim than among persons without negative characteristics. A shortening of the three-year storage period for information on settled payment defaults is not equally appropriate. This information on settled Payment defaults cannot be substituted without a significant loss of quality.

f) In contrast, the plaintiff's arguments, which bear the burden of proof, are limited to general statements that, due to the defendant's information, she has to endure relevant adverse effects regarding problems with obtaining credit and the feeling of being unfairly portrayed in a negative light. These statements are not suitable for demonstrating the alleged, concrete, and unacceptable effects within the scope of her burden of presentation and proof.

IV. Against this background, the plaintiff is not entitled to the asserted claims.

1. The plaintiff has no right under Art. 17 GDPR to the deletion of the disputed entries in the defendant's database.

The personal data are neither no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected (Art. 17 (1) (a) GDPR) nor have the personal data been processed unlawfully (Art. 17 (1) (d) GDPR). As explained, the processing by the defendant was carried out both to protect its own legitimate interests and those of its contractual partners, without this being conflicted with the overriding interests of the plaintiff (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).

Deletion is also not required under Article 17 (1) (c) GDPR. To the extent that the processing complies with Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, a right to erasure under Article 17 (1) (c) GDPR may be considered (cf. ECJ, loc. cit., paras. 109 et seq. – Score). However, the right to erasure requires an objection by the data subject under Article 21 GDPR, whereby the objection must be justified by a particular personal situation. There must be specific circumstances in the individual case that justify a particular need for protection of the data subject; such as special family circumstances, other sensitive information, or legitimate business confidentiality interests (cf. Paal/Pauly/Martini, 3rd ed. 2021, GDPR Art. 21 para. 30).

The plaintiff has neither substantiated nor proven such a special situation within the meaning of Art. 21 (1) GDPR. The circumstances she has presented, namely that there are difficulties in granting credit, are not the result of a special, atypical situation, but rather a typical consequence of a credit report. No further circumstances that could justify an atypical situation are apparent. Furthermore, as already explained, the interests of the defendant, its contractual partners, and the general public outweigh the legitimate interests of the plaintiff.

2. It follows that there is no right to correction of the score value. In any case, such a right would fail due to the legality of the information in dispute.

The question of whether the "score values" maintained by the defendant are value judgments and whether they are even subject to the obligation to correct data under Art. 16 GDPR (cf. BeckOK DatenschutzR/Worms, 51st Ed. 1 November 2024, GDPR Art. 16 paras. 53 et seq.) can therefore be left aside in this case as not relevant to the dispute.

3. Likewise, the plaintiff is not entitled to a claim for injunctive relief against future processing of the data set in question simply because the processing of the data was and continues to be lawful.

Furthermore, there are doubts as to whether there is a risk of repetition of the asserted claim for injunctive relief with regard to a renewed storage of the entry in question. If deletion is carried out after the appropriate three-year period, the threat of re-storage of the disputed information would only arise if the contractual partner re-reports the claim to the defendant and the defendant were to include the corresponding information in its database. However, this has neither been argued nor is apparent. The claims underlying the disputed entries have undisputedly been settled in the meantime, as they have been settled by the plaintiff. Therefore, there is no discernible reason for the defendant's contractual partner to re-register the claim.

4. Due to the lack of existing claims in the main proceedings, the plaintiff has no claim against the defendant for reimbursement of its pre-trial legal fees. C.

Since the appeal has no prospect of success, the court recommends withdrawing the appeal for cost reasons. In the event of withdrawal, the court fees are reduced from 4.0 to 2.0 (see No. 1222 of the list of costs for the Court Court Act).
