<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The company called the complainant offering them a deal on hotels; they claimed to have obtained the complainant's telephone number and consent to call the complainant by contacting a friend of the complainant via Whatsapp. The consent of the complainant themselves had not been obtained. The complainant then objected to the contact made by the company and no further contact was made.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Was the company in breach of any data protection laws?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>In its decision, the AEPD held that the company had violated a provision in Spanish law, Article 48(1)(b) of the 2014 Telecommunications Law (Ley 9/2014 General de Telecomunicaciones). The fine was issued on this basis. However, the AEPD also noted that the complainant had a right to object to processing for marketing purposes under Article 21 GDPR.
Despite no further contact being made the company, the AEPD still fined the company for the initial establishment of contact, which took place without the complainant's consent. The fine was initially €1500, but was reduced €1200 of the basis of the company's voluntary early payment of a fine. Under Spanish law, such a payment entails the waiver of any action or appeal in administrative proceedings against the sanction.

FUNDAMENTOS DE DERECHO
 I
In accordance with the provisions of article 84.3) of Law 9/2014, of 9 May, General of Telecommunications (LGT), the competence to resolve the present Sanctioning Procedure corresponds to the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency. In the present case, it has been verified that the interested party, being included in the Robinson List, was called by the company in question to make a commercial call. The facts set out (the violation of the right of opposition) could imply the commission by the entity in question of an infringement of Article 48.1.b) of the LGT, contained in its Title III, which states that: "With regard to the protection of personal data and privacy in relation to directories of subscribers, the end users of electronic communications services shall have the following rights: (... ) b) To object to receiving unwanted calls for commercial communication purposes which are made through systems other than those established in the previous paragraph and to be informed of this right": Article 21 of the RGPD, (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of the European Parliament and the Council, of 27/04/2016, relating to the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data and the Free Movement of such Data) and Article 23 of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law 3/2018 of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights).
