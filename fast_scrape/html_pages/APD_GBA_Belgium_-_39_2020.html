14. On 17 June 2019, the defendant will send an e-mail to the Inspectorate in response to
the letters from the Inspectorate. The defendant points out that the personal data, which
were used to send the letter to new residents, were merely
taken from the 2018 electoral roll. The defendant points out that several
candidates on his party's list removed the voters from the electoral roll so that only the
new voters remained on the list. According to the defendant, this was done on the basis of
"ready knowledge". In this sense, it can be noted that the Inspectorate established that the
municipality has more than 10,000 inhabitants. The defendant clarifies that the aforementioned
ready knowledge could be harnessed by the fact that "many of the candidates have been active for 18 to 30 years.

22. On 28 October 2019, the Disputes Chamber will receive a reply from the complainant.
23. The complainant refers to the Inspectorate's report and mentions the defence that the list

24. The complainant also commented:
"In the email of 17 June [2019], [the defendant] admits that he has 'even' the list of

establishment of the new list of inhabitants in 2018:
"Only the 2018 electoral roll and the 'deleted' list of possible [new
inhabitants] were drawn up by the candidates themselves on the basis of their ready knowledge

28. The defendant underlines that the letters were only sent to people who

the ready knowledge with regard to the new inhabitants of the municipality is "very large".
This is explained in the defendant's conclusion as follows:

made of all kinds of algorithms in EXCEL. This is because the defendant can only use a few

3.2. The principles governing the processing of personal data and the
lawfulness of processing (Articles 5 and 6 of the AVG)
a) Processing of personal data from old electoral rolls
40. In his statements to the Inspectorate, the defendant refers to the
Electoral Code of 12 April 1894, but that reference is erroneous. For the legal
provisions on the use of voters' lists for local elections, it is Local and
Provincial Electoral Decree of 8 July 2011 (hereinafter: Local Electoral Decree) applicable.
3
41. Article 3 of the Local Electoral Decree states that the decree applies to the
organisation of the municipal council in all the municipalities of the Flemish Region. The situation
where the defendant and his local party stand for election as candidates to the
municipal elections in 2018 for a Flemish municipality, and in that period
sending out electoral propaganda - including the contested letter - falls within the ambit of the
scope of application of the aforementioned Decree.

42. Article 20(3) of the Local Electoral Decree states:
"§3. The Municipal Executive may not submit lists of voters to the Provincial Executive.
to persons other than those who, in accordance with paragraph 1
or paragraph 2, first paragraph, have requested the list. The persons who have applied for a

making the list available and the date of the election".
43. The electoral lists made available in the context of a given election shall be drawn up in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 3.
election should therefore only be used until the date of that election. The
purpose limitation of the electoral roll is thus not limited to its use in the
within the framework of elections ('electoral purposes'), but also cumulatively until the election
for which the voters' list was created. Applied to the facts of the case, this means
that a 2012 electoral roll may not be used for the purposes of the
Municipal elections in 2018.
44. The defendant claims that he juxtaposed the electoral rolls for 2012 and 2018, and
continues that the information from the 2012 electoral roll was not "used or misused by the
establishment of the 'new' list of 'possible' new residents'.
The Dispute Chamber points out that merely storing and consulting the
personal data included in the 2012 electoral roll, including processing of
constitutes personal data within the meaning of the AVG, in accordance with Article 4(2) AVG.
45. The processing did not merely constitute a breach of this principle with regard to the processing of
personal data for those data subjects whose personal data are entered on the electoral roll of
2012, but also for those concerned - such as the complainant - who did not appear on the
electoral list of 2012 were mentioned. Determining the absence of the
personal data of data subjects on an old electoral roll, by consulting that list
old electoral roll, to modify and structure personal data of the same
persons concerned to be included on a new list of residents in 2018, should be considered to be
a diversion from the purpose of the old electoral roll in accordance with Article 5(1),
point (b) AVG.
46. The Chamber of Disputes finds that the storage and consultation of the electoral roll from 2012
by the defendant infringes the principle of purpose limitation in accordance with
Article 5(1)(b) AVG.
47. In addition, it may be established that the processing of personal data of the
2012 electoral roll with disregard for the purpose limitation, ipso facto an unlawful
processing within the meaning of Article 6(1) of the AVG. In this respect, the Disputes Chamber deems the
unlawfulness sufficiently clear, in view of the Local Kiesdecreet's use - i.e. also
consultation and comparison - of voters' lists for another party
election than that for which they have been made available. That is why it does not
raise the issue of Article 6(4) of the AVG in the light of the legal
provision in Article 20 of the Local Electoral Decree no assessment can be made with other
interests of the defendant, in the same way as the legal provision does not allow an account to be taken
be kept with other circumstances in order to allow the personal data to be kept
process.
Decision on the merits 39/2020- 10/23
...
48. Even if disregarding the legal provisions relating to electoral rolls is in itself
sufficiently clear to establish the unlawfulness, the Chamber of Disputes shall designate
the completeness also on the reasoning in section b) below, where the Dispute Settlement Chamber
justifies the creation of a 'new list of residents' with the personal data
on an electoral roll is not lawful in this case, even if it occurs during the period
within which the electoral rolls may be consulted and used. A fortiori, the following applies
justification for the processing of personal data on an old electoral roll from 2012,
whereby, by analogy, unlawfulness may be established for the purpose of making
a 'new list of inhabitants'.
b) Drawing up a list of new residents with the personal data on an electoral roll
49. In accordance with Article 16 of the Local and Provincial Electoral Decree, the voters' list mentions
the first name(s) and surname, date of birth, sex, and
main residence and, in certain cases, the nationality of the voters. Candidates at
elections may use the personal data contained in those electoral rolls for the purposes of conducting elections
of political prospection in the run-up to elections on the basis of the applicable
electoral legislation, which makes such processing somewhat foreseeable for the
person concerned.4

is a front-runner, indicate that they are submitting personal data on the basis of their "ready knowledge".
have amended the electoral roll for the 2018 municipal elections in this way
and structured in such a way that they retained a list of (potential) new residents of the
municipality. The list was subsequently used by the defendant and his local party to
send letters to those (potential) new residents.
51. The defendant does not refer to any particular basis for the lawfulness of the
processing described above, and in particular one of the conditions laid down in Article 6(1), - processing as described above, and in particular one of the conditions laid down in Article 6(1).

provision, given that there are only individual interests or interests limited to the local party
in the context of the 2018 municipal elections (Article 6(1)(e) AVG).
53. The Chamber of Disputes finds that the processing of personal data from electoral rolls,
and in this case the modification, structuring and further use of those personal data,
may be carried out only where such processing is necessary for the purposes of promoting
the legitimate interests of the defendant within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f) AVG.
54. The Litigation Chamber understands that the defendant has an interest in having the personal data
on the electoral roll of a municipality in such a way that it changes,
structuring and further use of the electoral roll provides a list of new residents
who are members of the electoral public for the 2018 municipal elections in the
municipality where the defendant stands as a candidate.
55. Article 6(1)(f) AVG provides that the legal basis may be used in so far as
"processing is necessary in order to safeguard the legitimate interests of
the controller or of a third party, except where the interests or the
fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject who seek to protect
personal data outweigh those interests, in particular when the
person concerned is a child'.
56. The case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union requires that reliance be placed on
Article 6(1)(f) of the AVG must meet three cumulative conditions, "namely,
first, the representation of a legitimate interest of the parties concerned in the
controller or of the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, in
Secondly, the need for the processing of personal data for the purposes of the
defence of the legitimate interest and, thirdly, the condition that the
fundamental rights and freedoms of the data protection officer
do not prevail."
6
57. In other words, the person responsible for processing must prove that:
(1) the interests pursued by the processing can be considered legitimate
recognised (the "target test");
2) the intended processing is necessary for the realisation of these interests (the
"necessity test"); and
3) the balancing of these interests against interests, fundamental freedoms
and fundamental rights of persons concerned in favour of the
Processing controller or of a third party (the "balancing test").
1) The target test
58. In this case, it is important to underline that the legal predecessor of the European
The Data Protection Committee ("the Committee") states that the importance of the
processing controller is closely related to the purpose of a processing operation.7
The purpose of the processing of the personal data by the defendant is the following

candidate to be more attractive.8
59. For the use of personal data on electoral registers, the Flemish
legislator in Article 20 of the Local Electoral Decree that the personal data for such
can be used for electoral purposes.9
60. It is therefore possible to establish an interest for the defendant, an interest which is
is explicitly endorsed by the Flemish legislator. In view of the
Municipal elections still had to take place at the time of processing
of the personal data happened, it can also be established that it was a real
and present interest at the time of the facts.
61. The Dispute Chamber therefore finds that there is indeed a justified
it was in the defendant's interest to process the personal data entered on the electoral rolls
at the time of the events.
2) The necessity test
62. The Court of Justice pointed out that in order to pass the test of necessity
it should be examined 'whether the legitimate interest in the processing of data should be investigated
that is being pursued [...] cannot reasonably be achieved as effectively with
other means which are less detrimental to fundamental freedoms, and
rights of the persons concerned, in particular the right to respect for the
privacy and the right to the protection of personal data as guaranteed by the
Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter.
10
63. The condition of necessity should be examined in conjunction with the
minimum data processing in accordance with Article 5(1)(c) of the AVG as a general rule

64. At no time does the defendant cite the reasons why it amends, structures and
continue to use the personal data from the 2018 electoral roll as 'new data'.

that "no legislation exists which prohibits political parties from using their

66. The Dispute Chamber is of the opinion that further changes, structures and uses of the
electoral roll drawn up by the defendant, creating a new list of residents, not
is necessary for the campaign of the defendant and his local party. The use of
the electoral roll is not subject to the use provided for by the legislator, and is therefore not subject to the
use expected by those concerned, which is relevant to the balancing test. The

68. The criterion relating to the seriousness of the infringement of the rights and freedoms of the person concerned

fundamental rights of the person concerned may, in particular, override the interests of the

circumstances in which the data subjects cannot reasonably be expected to carry out further processing

12 In this context, the following can be considered relevant: the Flemish legislator considers the identification number

71. The Litigation Chamber takes the view that the defendant's legitimate interest in
modify, structure and further amend the electoral roll in the manner described above
use, do not pass the weighting test.
72. The Chamber of Disputes points out, among other things, the nature and concrete manner of processing
of the data concerned: having regard to the defendant and other candidates of his local
batch for (many) years several ship mandates and the
take up the mandate of mayor, it can be expected that knowledge will be put to use
for processing collected in the exercise of those mandates.
73. In addition, the defendant himself states that his ready knowledge of the inhabitants of the
municipality stems from his decades-long professional career as a doctor, and the years of
the exercise of political mandates within the municipality, including the mandate as

74. It is not in line with the principle of purpose limitation for knowledge that was, inter alia
acquired in the course of the exercise of the profession of doctor or within the framework of the
mandate of the defendant as mayor, to be applied when amending, structuring
and further use of a voters' list.
75. In addition, the Chamber of Disputes noted that a large number of those involved in the present case
in view of the number of inhabitants of the municipality stated by the Inspectorate, and
having regard to the number of voters on the electoral roll transmitted by the defendant to
the Inspectorate. In the 'form for reaction against proposed fine' it states
the defendant itself that the municipality has 8,074 voters, a significant number of those concerned
whose personal data were further processed.
76. In addition, it is not insignificant to establish that the data subjects did not in all reasonableness
Further processing could be expected.15 For example, the complainant refers in her complaint to the
information on a website of the Flemish government, which is the legislation on electoral lists
and municipal elections.16 Here it can be reiterated that the
electoral rolls on the basis of the legal provisions only of the first name(s) and
surnames, date of birth, sex, principal place of residence and in certain cases
cases, indicate the nationality of voters.
77. The persons concerned may therefore reasonably expect that the use
of those electoral rolls shall be limited to the personal data which are listed exhaustively
in legislation. Taking into account the legislation on the protection of
It is indeed possible, on the basis of the personal data collected, to
consult in the electoral roll itself, a proportion of the voters can be registered.17 The complainant
did not expect, however, that the defendant and the other candidates of his local party

Disputes Chamber in its opinion that that processing on the basis of a justifiable
importance does not pass the weighting test.
4) Conclusion
80. On the basis of the target test, the necessity test and the weighting test, the
Dispute resolution chamber established that there can be no lawful processing on the basis of lawfulness

hoped for support for the local party "on 14 October" and reference is made to the

data subjects have the right to request access to and rectification of personal data

o what the categories of personal data concerned are (the content of the

that this has been rectified in the meantime. It attaches to its conclusion a document which
demonstrates that, following the Inspectorate's findings, steps have been taken to

dealt with in previous cases, in particular Decisions 04/2019, 10/2019, 11/2019 and the
most recently in decision 30/2020.
In each of those cases, the Chamber of Disputes proceeded to impose an
administrative pecuniary penalty, in particular for non-compliance with the principle of the
purpose limitation, as laid down in Article 5(1)(b) AVG.
100. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that, due to the reasons given above
infringements, an administrative fine within the meaning of Article 100, §1, 13° j° Article 101
WOG, as well as Article 83 AVG, is justified, taking into account the following considerations
elements.
101. Taking into account article 83 AVG and the case law of the Market Court,
The Chamber of Disputes justifies the imposition of an administrative sanction in concrete terms:
a) The seriousness of the infringement
102. The foregoing reasoning shows the seriousness of the infringement. Infringements of the
basic principles in Articles 5 and 6 AVG give rise to the highest fines in Article
83, paragraph 5 AVG.
Also with regard to the infringements of Article 14 of the AVG on transparency and information on the
personal data, the Chamber of Disputes notes that the lack of information in a letter
draw the attention of those concerned to the seriousness of the infringements.
In the event of infringements of those rights, the highest fines shall also be imposed.

technical and organisational measures have been taken in order to comply with the
obligations under the AVG. Not only is the defendant not sufficiently precise

information and does not offer sufficient transparency with regard to those concerned.
(c) The duration of the infringement:
105. In view of the special nature of the processing of personal data in function of (the
preparation for) the sending out of electoral propaganda in the run-up to the
Municipal elections in 2018,
24 has the processing only within a short
time period took place. However, it should be pointed out that the electoral roll of a
previous municipal election, in 2012, was still used to make an amendment and
structure the electoral roll in 2018 (supra, 3.2., part a).
106. However, the legislation in the Local Electoral Decree stipulates that the electoral roll may only be used for the purposes of the elections.

108. In the Statement of Objections to Proposed Fines, the defendant cites that
the party's expenditure is limited. He shall also produce the necessary supporting documents for this purpose.
The defendant argues that, in view of the processing operations carried out within the framework of a local
electoral campaign, a proposed fine of EUR 5 000 would be disproportionate. The
Dispute Settlement Chamber takes these new elements into account in its deliberations and decides
as a result, to reduce the amount of the fine, given an amount of EUR 3 000,

that, given that the local party is a de facto association, the decision is merely

the Registrar of the Chamber of Disputes, but has not simultaneously transferred to the other party
party, as explicitly requested by the Disputes Chamber in its letter of 25 September 2019.
112. Given that the complainant did not oppose consideration of the document with the
conclusion of the defendant, and the complainant states that he or she considers that he or she has been sufficiently heard, and
in order to be able to include all relevant elements in the deliberations of the Dispute Settlement Chamber
the Chamber of Disputes has decided to uphold the conclusion with the pleas in law put forward by the
not to exclude the defendant from the proceedings.
