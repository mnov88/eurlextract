<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 9 July 2019, a data subject ("complainant") submitted a complaint to the AEPD stating that the products contracted with Vodafone España ("defendant") were not delivered in the name of the data subject, but in the name of a third party. The complainant updated the complaint on 13 September 2019 advising that they contacted Data Protection Officer of Vodafone via email requesting them to restore the accuracy of their data. However, no response was received to this request. 
</p><p>Subsequently, the complainant was contacted by Vodafone and was advised that the issue had been corrected and that the products purchased had been put in their name. However, in September 2019, the complainant contacted the Vodafone's customer service and was addressed in the name of the third party. 
</p><p>The complainant also advised that on 11 September 2019, the Municipal Consumer Information Office (“OMIC”) informed them that they had a response to their complaint, and it turned out that Vodafone had responded with the complaint resolution of another customer as well as provided supporting evidence in the name of the third party. 
</p><p>Based on the evidence provided by the complainant, the AEPD decided to initiate an investigation into the matter and was able to confirm that:
</p>
<ol><li>The defendant was aware of this incident since 03/07/2019 when the data subject complaint about the accuracy of their data.</li>
<li>The incident was caused by an error in their system due to a system migration.</li>
<li>The incident had been resolved on 15/07/2019 when a crossover of information in Vodafone’s system had occurred and Vodafone deactivated the third party who appeared to be named on the client ID associated with the complainant. Vodafone provided proof to have resolved the incident on 15/07/2019 and that the complainant's records are currently in the correct name. Vodafone confirmed that it had not disclosed the complainant's personal data to any third party.</li>
<li>In relation to the response provided to the OMIC, Vodafone confirmed that due to a human error during the complaint response process they had provided the OMIC with the correspondence intended for another individual. Vodafone clarified that the information about the complainant was not shared with an unauthorised third party.</li></ol>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Were the actions of the defendant a violation of the principles relating to the processing of personal data contained in Articles 5(d) and 5(f) of the GDPR? 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>Based on the facts presented, the AEPD held that the actions of the defendant infringed the following principles of processing pf personal data: 
</p>
<ul><li>Article 5(1)(d) GDPR – Accuracy principle, as it was proven that in Vodafone’s systems, the products contracted by the complainant were in the name of a third party.</li>
<li>Article 5(1)(f) GDPR – Confidentiality principle, as Vodafone responded to the complaint with the response that was intended for another individual not for the complainant, meaning that Vodafone does not have appropriate security measures in place to protect the confidentiality personal data.</li></ul>
<p>The AEPD held that this offense is considered ‘grave’ in accordance with Article 72(1)(a) LOPDGDD and falls under the criteria defined in article 83(5)(a) GDPR where a company can be fined up to €2 million, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4&#160;% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. 
</p><p>The AEPD imposed a fine of €60000 for the violating Article 5(1)(d) GDPR and €30000 for violating Article 5(1)(f) GDPR. 
</p><p>In imposing the fine, the AEPD factored in that the infringement was considered negligent not intentional but significant and that the records affected corresponded to complainant ’s basic personal data such as name and address. 
</p><p>Vodafone España, S.A.U. acknowledged its responsibility in accordance with Article 85 (1) LPACAP which resulted in a 20% reduction of the penalty. Furthermore, it carried out the voluntary payment of the proposed fine before the resolution, so it benefited from an additional reduction of 20% (Article 85 (2) LPACAP). Therefore, Vodafone España, S.A.U benefited by the two 20% reductions and paid € 54000 instead of the initial € 90000.

                             FOUNDATIONS OF LAW



                                              I




        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each

control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDPGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve
this procedure.




                                              II




        Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the assumptions that allow considering
lawful processing of personal data.




        For its part, article 5 of the RGPD establishes that personal data will be:


C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/13










        “A) treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party

("Lawfulness, fairness and transparency");



        b) collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be processed

subsequently in a manner incompatible with said purposes; in accordance with article 89,
section 1, the subsequent processing of personal data for archiving purposes in

public interest, scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes are not
deemed incompatible with the original purposes ("purpose limitation");




        c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes
for those who are processed ("data minimization");




        d) accurate and, if necessary, updated; all measures will be taken
reasonable so that the personal data that
are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are processed ("accuracy");




        e) maintained in a way that allows the identification of the interested parties
for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of data processing

personal; personal data may be kept for longer periods
provided that they are treated exclusively for archival purposes in the public interest,

scientific or historical research or statistical purposes, in accordance with article

appropriate measures imposed by this Regulation in order to protect the rights and

freedoms of the interested party ("limitation of the conservation period");



        f) treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate security for the

personal data, including protection against unauthorized or illegal processing and
against their loss, destruction or accidental damage, by applying measures

appropriate technical or organizational ("integrity and confidentiality").



        The person responsible for the treatment will be responsible for compliance with

provided for in section 1 and capable of demonstrating it ("proactive responsibility"). "

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/13










                                            III




       In accordance with the evidence available in the present
moment, and without prejudice to the results of the instruction, it is considered proven that

in the systems of the complainant, he appeared as the owner of the services contracted by the
claimant a third party.




       In this way, it is fully proven that the defendant violated the
principle of accuracy, included in article 5.1 d) of the RGPD, as recognized in

his answer in which he states: "after the crossing of
data occurred in Vodafone systems and effectively process the
deactivation of the third party that was listed as the owner of the client ID associated with the

claimant ”.



       On the other hand, the documentation in the file shows

that the defendant also violated the principle of confidentiality article 5.1 f) of the
RGPD.




        In this sense, it is important to highlight that the complainant provided the answer to
his claim, and it was found that the defendant answered him with the resolution of a

third.



       It should also be borne in mind that the defendant acknowledges said error and

states that: “in the response process, the claimant was sent a copy of a
answer that were not related to the claim of the complainant before the
OMIC and not the reply addressed to it, which had its origin in an error

punctual of a human nature and that in no case has the
answer addressed to the claimant to a third party ”.




       Therefore, there is no doubt, given the regulation that violates the duty of secrecy of the
Article 5.1.f) of the RGPD. Does not comply with security measures that result in

breach of confidentiality article 5.1 LOPDGDD.



C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/13








       Ultimately, a third party could access the claimant's data, that is,
had access to the information associated with the services contracted by the claimant

which could constitute, on the part of the defendant, two infractions, one against
provided in article 5.1 d) of the RGPD, in relation to article 4.1 of the

LOPDGDD, and another against the provisions of article 5.1 f) of the RGPD, in relation to the
Article 5.1 of the LOPDGDD that governs the principles of accuracy and confidentiality of
Personal information.




                                           IV




       Article 72.1.a) of the LOPDGDD states that “depending on what is established
Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and
The infractions that suppose a substantial violation will prescribe after three years

of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following:



       a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees

established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679




                                           V



       Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following: “Each control authority

will have all of the following corrective powers listed below:



       b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with

warning when the processing operations have violated the provisions of
these Regulations;




       d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment are in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified time;

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/13








        i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition or in

place of the measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances
of each particular case;




                                              SAW




        These infractions can be sanctioned with a fine of € 20,000,000 as
maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% as

maximum total annual global business volume of the previous financial year,
opting for the highest amount, in accordance with article 83.5 of the RGPD.




        Likewise, it is considered that the sanctions to be imposed should be
in accordance with the following criteria established in article 83.2 of the RGPD:




        As aggravating factors the following:




     In the present case we are dealing with unintentional negligent action, but it signifies
        cativa (article 83.2 b).




     Basic personal identifiers are affected, (name, surname,

        two, domicile) (according to article 83.2g).
