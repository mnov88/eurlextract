THIRD: On October 23, 2019, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the respondent, for the alleged infringement of Article 13 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD.

In view of all that has been done, the following are considered to be proven facts by the Spanish Data Protection Agency in these proceedings,
