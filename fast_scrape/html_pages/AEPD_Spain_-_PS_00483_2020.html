<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>Asesoria Alpi Clua S.L., an audit company, mistakenly sent via email the personal data of one of their clients to a different client, the claimant, when this client asked for documentation concerning their own data. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Did Asesoria Alpi Clua infringe the principle of confidentiality established by Article 5(1)(f) GDPR?
</p><p>Was there a personal data breach?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD considered that there was an infringement of Article 5(1)(f), as there was a leak of personal data without the consent of the data subject. Additionally, they considered that there was an infringement of Article 32(1), as they concluded that the audit company did not have the appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to ensure an adequate level of protection.
</p><p>For this, the AEPD fined Asesoria Alpi Clua:
</p>
<ul><li>for the infringement of Article 5(1)(f), €2,000.</li>
<li>for the infringement of Article 32(1), €1,000.</li></ul>

        Therefore, this duty of confidentiality is an obligation incumbent upon not

                                            V


       Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the basic principles

or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the

total annual global business lumen of the previous financial year, opting for the

       The LOPDGDD in its article 72 indicates: “Violations considered very serious:

        Secondly, article 32 of the RGPD “Security of treatment”, establishes-
ce that:

                                             VII

        The violation of article 32 of the RGPD is typified in article

83.4.a) of the aforementioned RGPD in the following terms:

        "4. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with

        For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 73, for the purposes of prescription, qualifies
of "Violations considered serious":


        "Based on the provisions of article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

                                            VIII

        The RGPD defines personal data security violations as “all-
those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or alteration

        In this same sense, recital 83 of the RGPD states that:


        “(83) In order to maintain security and prevent treatment from infringing the dis-
