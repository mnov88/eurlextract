<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>Carrefour S.A. (the controller) reported five data breaches to the DPA between January and September 2023. According to the controller, all breaches were likely related to the unlawful access to client’s accounts using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Credential stuffing">Credential Stuffing</a>, however it was unable to identify the original source of the stolen credentials. The controller was aware of the first breach in October 2022, but did not report it until January 2023.  
</p><p>According to the DPA, the breaches affected a high number of data subject's accounts (almost 119,000 in total). This was disputed by the controller, who argued that a much lower number of accounts (974) was affected. The data breach revealed personal data related to their clients; at the very least, the attacker was able to confirm that the credentials were correct, and there was a high risk that they also had access to personal information in the accounts (such as their full name, contact information and address).  
</p><p>The controller claimed to have communicated with its clients following the third breach, however, the e-mail only informed the client of a change in their password, and did not specify that there was a data breach. The controller merely stated that it had reset the passwords to improve their services, and how the data subject could set a new password.   
</p><p>The DPA began investigating in May 2023.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA stated that the controller had not adhered to its security obligations under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a>. The controller infringed on <a href="/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR#1" title="Article 24 GDPR">Article 24(1) GDPR</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">32 GDPR</a> by not having appropriate security measures in place. This is a proactive obligation that requires the controller to go beyond reacting to data breaches and implement preventative measures if necessary; the DPA criticised the controller for its delay in implementing measures. For example, the controller did not introduce two factor authentication until the fifth breach.  
</p><p>The DPA considered two aspects as aggravating factors:  
</p><p>First, that the data breaches posed a serious security risk for the data subjects. The data that accessed allowed third parties to construct a detailed profile of the data subject, which increased the probability of identity theft and fraud.  
</p><p>Second, that the controller processed very large amounts of data on a daily basis. The controller also operates in a sector where trust and information security are essential. According to the DPA, the controller has the responsibility to more rigorously guarantee the protection of personal data principles based on these two factors. Reports from the regular audits the controller carried out showed clear security risks and recommended specific measures. The controller was aware of the security and confidentiality risks but chose not to implement measures in response to them. 
</p><p>In addition, the controller did not give the data subjects sufficient information about the data breach; the email did not specify that there was a data breach, or mention its severity, the implications on their data or the measures taken in response. This left the data subjects unaware of the risks, and was a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_34_GDPR" title="Article 34 GDPR">Article 34 GDPR</a>. The DPA took into account the communication following the fourth and fifth data breach. At the time of the decision, the statute of limitations for the first three breaches had passed in accordance with national law<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>.  
</p><p>Finally, the DPA dismissed the arguments of the controller to reduce the fine. The controller claimed that only 974 accounts were affected during the data breaches, and that it had fully collaborated with the DPA. Both arguments were dismissed, as the DPA’s findings revealed a much higher number of accounts affected, and the fact that reporting is a legal obligation under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR" title="Article 33 GDPR">Article 33 GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>The DPA fined the controller €3,200,000 in total. €2,000,000 for the violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a>, €1,000,000 for the violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a> and €200,000 for the violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_34_GDPR" title="Article 34 GDPR">Article 34 GDPR</a>. The controller was also ordered to communicate the data breach to the affected data subjects in accordance with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_34_GDPR" title="Article 34 GDPR">Article 34 GDPR</a>, subject to fines for noncompliance.

FIFTH: Having requested an extension of the period granted to it to submit allegations, pursuant to the provisions of Article 32.1 of the LPACAP, on May 6, 2024, it was agreed to extend said period up to a maximum of five days, which were to be counted from the day following the end of the first period for allegations.

SIXTH: Having been notified of the aforementioned initiation agreement in accordance with the rules established in the LPACAP, the investigated entity submitted a written statement in which, in summary, it states:

PRIOR CLAIM

- that it has not violated Articles 5.1 f) and 32 of the GDPR. The Second and Third Statements are devoted to this issue.

- declares that it acknowledges responsibility for the alleged violation of
Article 34 of the GDPR, relating to the communication of breaches to affected individuals.

It devotes the Fourth Allegation to this issue.

- and devotes the Fifth Allegation to listing the documents provided by CCC along with

this statement of allegations.

Before setting out the reasons why it considers that there has been no violation of Articles 5.1 f) and 32 of the GDPR, it makes a series of clarifications
regarding the nature and dynamics of the attacks that gave rise to the incidents
suffered by CCC.

FIRST ALLEGATION. Preliminary clarifications regarding the security incidents
suffered by CCC

First, regarding the obtaining of credentials, it states that the incidents arose from the obtaining of credentials (username and password)
by a third party. These credentials were obtained in an environment outside CCC's control. That is, access to this first piece of personal data (credentials) does not occur in databases for which CCC is responsible. In this regard, it notes that the hash function used to protect credentials today is considered robust. It provides Document 1 as an explanatory document.

Secondly, regarding the access requests, it indicates that the number of affected accounts reported to the Agency in each of the reported security breaches corresponds to the number of accounts for which the third party obtained confirmation of the credentials' validity. These are not accounts to which the third party had access, nor did it have access to the personal data of those customers.

Thirdly, once the third party has confirmed the validity of the credentials, it proceeds to sell them through various channels. As Document 2, it provides two screenshots of ***APP.1 channels in which it can be seen how credentials are offered from various merchants, including CCC. In this way, the third party will obtain financial compensation from the sale of these verified credentials.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/62

and, in turn, the third party who purchases the credentials will be able to use them to access the customer area and attempt to commit financial fraud by using the Savings Check.

However, it is important to note that access will not be granted if: there is no buyer or the buyer never uses the credentials; if the compromised credentials have been reset; and/or a two-factor authentication has been implemented.

It also makes some additional clarifications:

It understands that there has been no unauthorized or illicit access to 118,895 customer accounts and, therefore, no impact on the integrity and/or confidentiality of the personal data of the account holders in all these cases.

It considers that there are only 234 cases in which the integrity of clients' personal data has been compromised; and 973 cases in which the confidentiality of the Affected Personal Data has been compromised.

The First, Second, Third, and Fourth Breaches affected CCC's application,

while the Fifth Breach affected the website.

(…)

Regarding the penetration tests (also known as pentests)

conducted after the First Breach, it wishes to clarify that these are not measures
adopted reactively and that CCC has been conducting pentests periodically
for both the website and the application since before the incidents. In this regard, it clarifies, regarding the results obtained, that certain security measures (gray box) were deactivated to conduct the audits; therefore,

the recommendations and improvements detected in these audits do not correspond
to reality and should be clarified.

Based on the clarifications made in this First Claim, the Court then proceeds to assess the existence of a violation of Articles 5.1 f) (Second Claim) and 32 of the GDPR (Third Claim).

SECOND CLAIM. CCC has not violated the principle of integrity and confidentiality.

It reiterates that the confidentiality of CCC customers' personal data has been violated in only 973 cases.

Regarding integrity, the number of cases in which it was violated amounts to 234. In this regard, it should be noted that:

a) As reported in the First Breach, it has been verified that there were only 234 cases of customers whose personal data were modified. The data that was modified included the email address, the delivery address, as well as, in some cases, the phone number and name.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/62

b) In fact, on March 14, two-factor authentication was implemented to modify personal data from the customer area, so the integrity of the personal data was not compromised in the remaining breaches.

Regarding confidentiality, the number of cases in which it was compromised amounts to 973. This number corresponds to the cases in which fraud has been detected in the customers' Savings Checks, which are distributed between: (i) the 234 cases of the First Breach, where the breach of integrity also entailed a breach of confidentiality; and (ii) 739 cases spread between the Second and Fifth Breach.

The credential reset prevents the buyer from accessing the affected person's customer area.

(…)

Therefore, the total number of affected persons reported in the breaches (118,895) does not correspond to the total number of cases in which integrity and confidentiality were compromised. Rather, the compromise on integrity was limited to 234 customers and the compromise on confidentiality to 973.

It indicates that CCC did adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent the loss of integrity and confidentiality from recurring and, in any case, to effectively reduce the likelihood of the loss of integrity and confidentiality of its customers' personal data.

Below is a list of the measures adopted prior to the first personal data breach.

Technical measures:

(…)

Organizational measures:

(…)

As Document 4, it provides a copy of the extension and renewal agreement for the cyber surveillance and vulnerability assessment contract signed with ***COMPANY.1, which certifies that these services were in effect prior to the First Breach.

(…)

Likewise, it provides, as Document 9, a report issued by ***COMPANY.2, which concludes that CCC's compliance status is higher than that of other leading entities in the retail sector.

For all the above reasons, it is understood that the technical and organizational measures adopted by CCC were adequate to prevent the loss of integrity and confidentiality

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/62

from recurring or, at the very least, to effectively reduce the likelihood of the loss of integrity and confidentiality of its clients' personal data.

Alternatively, if the Agency determines that a violation has occurred and a sanction should be imposed on CCC, the following mitigating circumstances must be taken into account:

The nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the

nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question,
as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages and losses they have suffered (Article 83.2 a) of the GDPR):

It is understood that the amount of the sanction should be reduced, taking into account that the

number of data subjects whose integrity and/or confidentiality of their personal data has been compromised is 973, not 118,895. Furthermore, it considers that, although in these cases a set of data has been affected (name and surname, full postal address, and date of birth), these data are not critical, especially considering that, as stated (Document 2), the ultimate goal pursued by the third party is to commit economic fraud, with the affected personal data being a means to commit such fraud, not an end in itself.

or The intentionality or negligence in the infringement (Article 83.2 b) of the GDPR):

(…)

Furthermore, CCC understands that the following circumstances should be considered as mitigating factors:

i. Any other measure taken by the data controller to mitigate the damages suffered by the data subjects (Article 83.2 c) of the GDPR).

It considers that the fact that CCC took measures to mitigate the damages suffered by the data subjects should be considered as mitigating factors. In this regard: it reset the compromised credentials; and in those cases

where fraud occurred with the Savings Checks, CCC reimbursed the amount of the Savings Checks and issued gift cards to the affected individuals, so that they did not suffer any financial impact from the fraud.

Furthermore, these measures were taken spontaneously, before CCC

was aware of the information requests and the initiation of the Agency's investigation.

ii. The degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach (Article 83.2 f) of the GDPR), as well as the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller notified the breach and, if so, to what extent (Article 83.2 h of the GDPR).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/62

CCC considers this mitigating circumstance applicable to the extent that the Initiation Agreement was issued as a result of the five security breaches reported by CCC to the Agency. The fact that the breaches were notified should be considered a mitigating circumstance, diligently fulfilling this duty. Information was provided with complete transparency, and therefore, it also believes that these mitigating circumstances should apply. Finally, CCC has cooperated favorably with the investigation, responding to all requests made.

THIRD ALLEGATION: CCC adopted appropriate security measures.

It states that CCC adopted appropriate security measures, without prejudice to the fact that, if Articles 5.1 f) and 32 of the GDPR were deemed to have been violated (quod non), we would be facing a single violation, and that the alleged lack of appropriate technical and organizational measures should be understood, as a means of perpetration, as a violation of the principles of integrity and confidentiality.

(…)

Regarding the pentests of ***EMPRESA.1, it indicates that CCC did not conduct the pentest reactively after the first breach. The pentests are part of a wide range of technical and organizational measures adopted by CCC to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the personal data processed.

The pentests were conducted – and continue to be conducted – periodically for both the website and the application. In this regard, the Court refers to the SOC services provision contract signed with ***EMPRESA.1 (Document 4), which includes a web application security audit service. In addition, as Document 10, the Court provides a certificate prepared by ***EMPRESA.1 certifying the pentests performed prior to the First Breach.

In this regard, the Court states that it is true that the report refers to alleged "deficiencies in the controls implemented in CCC's information systems." However, it indicates that it should be noted that certain security measures (gray box) were deactivated during the audits, so the recommendations and improvements detected in these audits do not correspond to reality and should be clarified. Tables are attached, listing the short-term recommendations identified in the pentests and including a justification for their lack of relevance.

Based on the above, it is understood that the technical and organizational measures adopted by CCC were appropriate in accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR.

Alternatively, in the event that the Agency determines that a violation has occurred and a sanction should be imposed on CCC, it considers that the following aggravating and mitigating circumstances should be taken into account:

The nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the

nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question,

as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages and losses they have suffered (Article 83.2 a) of the GDPR).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/62

It understands that either the fact that there has been an impact on the Affected Personal Data (in which case it should be limited to the
actually affected customers, not all users of the website and application) is considered an aggravating circumstance, or,

on the contrary, the fact that the impact of the The lack of technical and organizational measures affects all users of the website and the application (in which case it cannot be argued that their personal data has been effectively compromised, since this has occurred only in certain cases).

In any case, the Court considers that, although in certain cases a set of data (name and surname, full postal address, and date of birth) may have been affected, these data are not critical, especially considering that the third party's ultimate goal is to commit financial fraud, with the affected personal data being a means to commit such fraud, not an end in itself.

Regarding the duration, it has been seen how the progressive implementation of new measures has reduced the impact (implementation of the second factor to modify personal data and to access the application, among others). Therefore, it understands that this circumstance cannot be considered an aggravating factor.

o Intentionality or negligence in the infringement (Article 83.2 b) of the GDPR

To the extent that the Agency's argument is the same as that used when addressing this circumstance for the alleged infringement of Article 5.1 f) of the GDPR, reference is made to the information set forth in the Second Allegation.

Furthermore, CCC understands that the following circumstances should be taken into account as mitigating factors:

i. Any other measures taken by the data controller to mitigate the damages suffered by the data subjects (Article 83.2 c) of the GDPR).

CCC adopted technical and organizational measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of the risk materializing. Furthermore, these measures were adopted proactively, that is, prior to becoming aware of the Agency's investigations that led to the issuance of the Initiation Agreement.

ii. The degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach (Article 83.2 f) of the GDPR), as well as the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller notified the breach and, if so, to what extent (Article 83.2 h of the GDPR).

Reference is made to the information provided for this circumstance in the Second Claim.

FOURTH CLAIM. CCC acknowledges its liability in relation to the alleged breach of Article 34 of the GDPR: communication of breaches to affected persons.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/62

Although CCC considered at the time that communication of the breaches to the affected individuals was not mandatory, CCC acknowledges its sole and exclusive liability for the alleged violation of Article 34 of the GDPR, in relation to those individuals whose confidentiality and/or integrity of their personal data was compromised. This should result in a 20% reduction in the proposed fine for this violation (€200,000). Furthermore, if payment were made before the resolution of this procedure, the fine should be reduced by an additional 20%, with the amount payable being €120,000.

FIFTH ALLEGATION. List of documentary evidence provided, for the purpose of demonstrating the absence of a violation or, where appropriate, reducing the penalty proposed by the Agency.

a) As Document 1, a document explaining the hash function used by ***COMPANY.3.
b) As Document 2, screenshots of ***APP.1 channels in which CCC customer credentials were offered.
c) As Document 3, screenshots of ***APP.1 channels in which the impossibility of using the acquired credentials was mentioned.
d) As Document 4, a copy of the extension and renewal agreement for the cyber surveillance and vulnerability analysis contract signed with ***COMPANY.1.
e) As Document 5, a copy of the audit report for ***COMPANY.4 (2022).
f) As Document 6, a copy of CCC's compliance matrix (...).
g) As Document 7, information on the implementation of the second authentication factor in the digital channels of other leading retailers in Spain.

h) As Document 8, document in the list of calls to (...) from ***COMPANY.3.
i) As Document 9, copy of the report issued by ***COMPANY.2 on May 2, 2024.
j) As Document 10, copy of a certificate from ***COMPANY.1 listing the pentests performed prior to the First Breach.

In light of the foregoing, the Court requests that Centros Comerciales Carrefour, S.A. be deemed liable for the alleged violation of Article 34 of the GDPR, and that Centros Comerciales Carrefour, S.A. be deemed liable for the alleged violations of Articles 5.1 f) and 32 of the GDPR: that the case be dismissed with the subsequent filing of the proceedings, as none of the alleged violations have been committed.
Alternatively, if any penalty is imposed, it should be imposed in a minimal amount, in light of the mitigating circumstances indicated.

Finally, it states that it does not yet have the Spanish translation of Documents 5 and 6, and therefore announces that it will provide these translations as soon as they are available. It is preparing an additional document detailing the process followed in the digital channels identified in the table provided as Document 7, regarding the implementation of the second authentication factor in the digital channels of other leading retailers in Spain. Therefore, it announces that it will provide this additional document as soon as it is available.

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/62

1. Password policy detailing the measures implemented and their implementation date.

CCC's current password policy was implemented in June 2022. According to this policy, for a password to be valid, it must meet the following characteristics:

(…)

Provide as Document 1 the development sheet for the password policy, modified in June 2022, and a screenshot showing the characteristics that passwords must meet to be valid.

2. Number of accounts, of the 1,741 already compromised in the third personal data breach, to which the third party gained access in the fourth personal data breach.

In the Third Breach (notified on April 21, 2023), there were 61,083 successful access requests ("OK"), and in the Fourth Breach (notified on June 26, 2023), there were 10,943. The number of matching accounts in both breaches—that is, those for which the third-party query resulted in an "OK" result—was 1,741.

3. Reports of the penetration tests (Pentest) conducted by Carrefour in 2022,
on the Carrefour.es Ecommerce website and the Carrefour app.

The Report is provided as Document 2.

It shows that the vulnerabilities identified in the pentest (none of critical or high severity) were detected as a result of providing information to the auditor about the CCC systems infrastructure and disabling security measures to allow the audit to be conducted.

4. Date of implementation of the measures recommended in the penetration test reports (Pentest) conducted on the Carrefour website and app, completed on March 3, 2023, and February 9, 2023, respectively.

Regarding the application pentest (February 28, 2023):

A total of 10 recommendations were included, listed in the following pentest sections: 5.1.4, 6.1.4, 6.2.4, 6.3.4, 6.4.4, 7.1.4, 7.2.4, 7.3.4, 7.4.4, and 7.5.4.

Of these 10 recommendations:

a) One of them (5.1.4, corresponding to a high-severity vulnerability) was implemented on February 13, 2023, as evidenced in the pentest itself:

5.1 Insecure Object Reference (IDOR) (CORRECTED)

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

b) Four of them (6.1.4, 6.2.4, 7.1.4, and 7.2.4, all corresponding to medium-severity vulnerabilities) are not applicable, as they are recommendations derived from vulnerabilities that were detected as a result of providing information to the auditor about the infrastructure of CCC systems and the elimination of security measures to facilitate the auditor's work in the pentest. in gray box mode.

c) The remaining five (6.3.4, 6.4.4, 7.3.4, 7.4.4, and 7.5.4, all of which correspond to low-severity vulnerabilities) were assumed, that is, they were not implemented,

to the extent that the attack vector for these vulnerabilities was local or physical,
so the risk is low and very reduced, particularly in physical attack vectors, where the attacker needs to physically interact with the client's device.

d) In any case, none of the 10 recommendations impact the breaches addressed in the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure.

Regarding the web pentest (March 6, 2023):

A total of 19 recommendations were included, listed in the following sections of the pentest: 5.1.4, 5.2.4, 5.3.4, 5.4.4, 5.5.4, 5.6.4, 5.7.4, 5.8.4, 5.9.4, 5.10.4, 5.11.4, 5.12.4, 5.13.4, 5.14.4, 5.15.4, 5.16.4, 5.17.4, 5.18.4, and 5.19.4.

Of these 19 recommendations:

a) Four of them were implemented on the following dates:

- 5.1.4 (corresponding to a critical severity vulnerability) was implemented on July 11, 2023. We provide supporting documentation for the implementation of this recommendation as Document 3.

- 5.6.4 (corresponding to a medium severity vulnerability) was implemented in September 2024.

- 5.9.4 (corresponding to a medium severity vulnerability) was implemented in September 2024.

- 5.17.4 (corresponding to a low severity vulnerability) was implemented in September 2024.

We provide supporting documentation for the implementation of recommendations 5.6.4, 5.9.4, and 5.17.4 as Document 4. As can be seen in the "Configuration" section, CCC does not use cipher suites such as RC4 (recommendation 5.6.4), Triple-DES, and 64-bit block ciphers (recommendation 5.9.4), as well as CBC (recommendation 5.17.4).

b) One of them (5.2.4, corresponding to a high-severity vulnerability) could not be reproduced by the auditor and was ultimately marked as corrected, as shown in the screenshot provided as Document 5.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 16/62

c) Three of them (5.5.4, 5.7.4, and 5.8.4; all corresponding to medium-severity vulnerabilities) are not applicable, as they are recommendations derived from vulnerabilities that were detected as a result of providing information to the auditor about the infrastructure of CCC systems and the elimination of security measures to facilitate the auditor's work in the gray-box pentest.

d) Two of them (5.3.4 and 5.4.4; both corresponding to medium-severity vulnerabilities) were not implemented, as the corresponding vulnerabilities cannot be exploited due to the existence of other security measures (in both cases, the use of web application firewalls) implemented by CCC. In fact, in 5.3, the auditor admits that it has not been possible to "verify the exploitation of this vulnerability" and that its existence requires notification in order to "request its mitigation if necessary." e) The remaining nine (5.10.4, 5.11.4, 5.12.4, 5.13.4, 5.14.4, 5.15.4, 5.16.4, 5.18.4, and 5.19.4; the first three corresponding to medium-severity vulnerabilities and the remaining six to low-severity vulnerabilities) were assumed, that is, they were not implemented to the extent that the vulnerabilities—and the resulting recommendations—did not exceed the materiality threshold.

f) In any case, none of the 19 recommendations impact the breaches addressed in the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure.

5. Total number of access requests made by the attacker against the Carrefour website and app for each of the five personal data breaches, including requests to Carrefour accounts that did not result in an "OK" response.

CCC does not keep track of the number of unsatisfactory requests for the five breaches.

However, the number of satisfactory requests for each breach is as follows:

Breach Satisfactory Access Requests
First Breach (…)

Second Breach (…)
Third Breach (…)
Fourth Breach (…)
Fifth Breach (…)

TWELFTH: On December 5, 2024, a resolution proposal was made, proposing:

&lt;&lt;. That the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency sanction
CENTROS COMERCIALES CARREFOUR, S.A., with Tax ID No. A28425270,

for violating Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, classified in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.5 of the GDPR, classified as very serious for the purposes of the statute of limitations, in Article 72.1 a) of the LOPDGDD, with a fine of 2,000,000 euros.

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 17/62

- for the violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, classified in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.4 of the GDPR, classified as serious for the purposes of the statute of limitations, in Article 73 f) of the LOPDGDD, with a fine of €1,000,000.

- for the violation of Article 34 of the GDPR, classified in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.4 of the GDPR, classified as minor for the purposes of the statute of limitations, in Article 74 ñ) of the LOPDGDD, with a fine of €200,000.

That the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency order
CENTROS COMERCIALES CARREFOUR, S.A., with NIF A28425270, pursuant to Article 58.2.d) of the GDPR, to demonstrate within one month that it has complied with the following measure: communication of personal data breaches to the affected parties whose data has been affected under the terms and conditions set forth in Article 34 of the GDPR.

The aforementioned proposed resolution was sent, in accordance with the rules established in the LPACAP, by electronic notification, and was received on December 10, 2024, as evidenced by the certificate in the file.

THIRTEENTH: The entity under investigation has not submitted any objections to the proposed resolution.

In light of all the actions taken by the Spanish Data Protection Agency in this proceeding, the following facts are considered proven:

PROVEN FACTS

FIRST: Notifications of personal data breaches:

Carrefour has reported up to five personal data security breaches, all of them related to unauthorized access to customer accounts by unauthorized third parties, with a high probability of using the credential stuffing attack technique using leaked credentials (email/password pairs), and there is no evidence of a brute force attack.

First breach of personal data security

The following information is recorded in the Preliminary Investigation Report:

(…)

Second breach of personal data security:

The following information is recorded in the Preliminary Investigation Report:

Date of Birth.

Likewise, the notification of the third personal data breach, which occurred on April 18, 2023, states that the attacker had access to basic data (e.g., first name, last name, date of birth), national identity card (DNI), foreign national identification number (NIE), passport, and/or any other identification document, economic or financial data (without payment methods), contact information, and access or identification credentials (username and/or password).

The notification of the fourth personal data breach, which occurred on June 23, 2023, states that the attacker accessed basic data (e.g., first name, last name, date of birth), contact information, and access or identification credentials (username and/or password).

The notification of the fifth personal data breach that occurred on September 11, 2023, states that the attacker had access to basic data (e.g., first name, last name,

date of birth), DNI, NIE, passport, and/or any other identification document, contact information, access or identification credentials (username and/or password).

FOURTH: Carrefour has provided the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for the processing activity affected by the breach ("Carrefour Club Clients"), created on April 14, 2021, and ending on July 19, 2022.

This document analyzes the different legal bases for processing and uses the contract as the legitimate basis for processing (referring to the acceptance of the Club and My Account Legal Bases as the signing of a contract for the processing of the data subject's personal data).
Furthermore, they also use other legitimate bases for the following

purposes:

 Legitimate interest: For prior verification against CC CARREFOUR databases, advertising management,
achieving centralization of customer processing operations,
development of sales processes and channels,
behavioral analytics and review of suspicious transactions,
fraud prevention.
 Express consent: (i) sending advertising by Carrefour about products from collaborating entities and

Group and non-Group Affiliated Entities (Iberdrola, Cepsa,
etc.) (ii) transfer of personal data to Affiliated Entities of the Carrefour Group for these entities' own advertising.

It is stated that this processing involves profiling, but without legal effects for the interested parties:
Without prejudice to systematic customer evaluations, this has no legal effects on them; it only impacts the type of advertising that club members receive.

A description of the data processing and flow is provided, detailing each of the assets involved in the different phases of collection, storage, and destination of the personal data processed.

Risk analysis and management are performed, highlighting:

 The risk factor of identity theft that poses a financial or privacy risk is analyzed, assigning it an inherent risk of High Impact and a residual risk of Medium Impact.
 The financial risk for the subjects involved in the processing is analyzed, initially assigning an inherent risk of Very High and a residual risk of Low.
 The risks of loss of confidentiality are analyzed, assigning an inherent risk of High Impact and a residual risk of Low.

 Among the security measures mentioned for managing the risks are:

Likewise, an annex to the DPIA is included, which includes a list of security projects under development throughout 2023 with the aim of strengthening security. From the analysis of this document, the following can be concluded:

(…)

The report concludes with the following recommendations and actions to be taken:

(…)

(ii) Pentest report on the Carrefour app for Android/iOS, carried out with a start date of February 6, 2023, and an end date of February 9, 2023.

From its analysis, the following can be concluded:

Regarding the methodology (point 3 of the report) (…).

 One high-level vulnerability was detected (although the same report states that it has been corrected), 5 medium-level vulnerability, and 5 low-level vulnerability.
 The report concludes the following recommendations on
actions to be taken:
(…)

SIXTH: In the present case, it has been confirmed that Carrefour sent a communication on June 23, 2023, to 9,202 affected individuals, corresponding to the fourth personal data breach, and on September 11, 2023, to 10,959 affected individuals, corresponding to the fifth personal data breach.

Regarding the investigation carried out by this authority, the investigated entity itself states that it communicated via email, as well as via push channels for customers available through this means. The content of the message sent was as follows:

"Dear customer:
To offer you better service, we have reset your password. To obtain a new one, please request it under "Forgot your password?" when accessing the App or the website.
On the website

https://www.carrefour.es/myaccount
In the App
Log in and click on "Forgot your password?"
Best regards
The Carrefour team"

There is no evidence that Carrefour notified those affected of the first, second, and third personal data breaches, in the terms indicated in Article 34 of the GDPR, although this potential violation due to the failure to notify those affected of the first, second, and third personal data breaches must be considered time-barred.

SEVENTH: The CCC password policy currently in force was implemented in June 2022. According to this policy, for a password to be valid, it must meet the following characteristics:

- (…)

Provide as Document 1 the development sheet for the password policy modified in June 2022 and a screenshot showing the characteristics that passwords must meet to be valid.

EIGHTH: In the Third Breach (notified on April 21, 2023), there were 61,083 successful access requests ("OK"), and in the Fourth Breach (notified on June 26, 2023), there were 10,943. The number of matching accounts in both breaches—that is, those for which the third-party query resulted in an "OK"—was 1,741.

NINTH: Carrefour has provided a Penetration Test Report (Pentest) conducted in 2022, titled "***REPORT.1".

Regarding the severity of the breaches, the report indicates:

High Medium Low

TENTH: Implementation date of the measures recommended in the Penetration Test Reports (Pentest) conducted on the Carrefour website and app, completed on March 3, 2023, and February 9, 2023, respectively.

Regarding the application pentest (February 28, 2023):

A total of 10 recommendations were included, listed in the following pentest sections: 5.1.4, 6.1.4, 6.2.4, 6.3.4, 6.4.4, 7.1.4, 7.2.4, 7.3.4, 7.4.4, and 7.5.4.

Of these 10 recommendations:

a) One of them (5.1.4, corresponding to a high-severity vulnerability) was implemented on February 13, 2023, as shown in the pentest itself:

5.1 Insecure Object Reference (IDOR) (CORRECTED)

b) Four of them (6.1.4, 6.2.4, 7.1.4, and 7.2.4, all corresponding to medium-severity vulnerabilities) are not applicable, as they are recommendations derived from vulnerabilities that were detected as a result of providing information to the auditor about the infrastructure of CCC systems and the elimination of security measures to facilitate the auditor's work in the pentest. gray box mode.

c) The remaining five (6.3.4, 6.4.4, 7.3.4, 7.4.4, and 7.5.4, all of which correspond to low-severity vulnerabilities) were assumed, that is, they were not implemented, since the attack vector for these vulnerabilities was local or physical, so the risk is low and very reduced, particularly for physical attack vectors, where the attacker needs to physically interact with the client's device.

d) In any case, none of the 10 recommendations impact the breaches addressed in the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure.

Regarding the web pentest (March 6, 2023):

A total of 19 recommendations were included, listed in the following pentest sections: 5.1.4, 5.2.4, 5.3.4, 5.4.4, 5.5.4, 5.6.4, 5.7.4, 5.8.4, 5.9.4, 5.10.4, 5.11.4, 5.12.4, 5.13.4, 5.14.4, 5.15.4, 5.16.4, 5.17.4, 5.18.4, and 5.19.4.

Of these 19 recommendations:

a) Four of them were implemented on the following dates:

- 5.1.4 (corresponding to a critical severity vulnerability) was implemented on July 11, 2023. We provide supporting documentation for the implementation of this recommendation as Document 3.

- 5.6.4 (corresponding to a medium severity vulnerability) was implemented in September 2024.

- 5.9.4 (corresponding to a medium severity vulnerability) was implemented in September 2024.

- 5.17.4 (corresponding to a low severity vulnerability) was implemented in September 2024.

We provide supporting documentation for the implementation of recommendations 5.6.4, 5.9.4, and 5.17.4 as Document 4. As can be seen in the "Configuration" section, CCC does not use cipher suites.

RC4 (recommendation 5.6.4), triple-DES, and 64-bit block ciphers (recommendation 5.9.4), as well as CBC (recommendation 5.17.4).

b) One of them (5.2.4, corresponding to a high-severity vulnerability) could not be reproduced by the auditor and was ultimately marked as corrected, as shown in the screenshot provided as Document 5.

c) Three of them (5.5.4, 5.7.4, and 5.8.4; all corresponding to medium-severity vulnerabilities) are not applicable, as they are recommendations derived from vulnerabilities that were detected as a result of providing information to the auditor about the infrastructure of CCC systems and the elimination of security measures to facilitate the auditor's work in the gray-box pentest.

d) Two of them (5.3.4 and 5.4.4; both corresponding to medium-severity vulnerabilities) were not implemented, as the corresponding vulnerabilities cannot be exploited due to the existence of other security measures (in both cases, the use of web application firewalls) implemented by CCC. In fact, in 5.3, the auditor admits that it has not been possible to "verify the exploitation of this vulnerability" and that its existence requires notification in order to "request its mitigation if necessary." e) The remaining nine (5.10.4, 5.11.4, 5.12.4, 5.13.4, 5.14.4, 5.15.4, 5.16.4, 5.18.4

and 5.19.4; the first three corresponding to medium-severity vulnerabilities and the remaining six to low-severity vulnerabilities) were not addressed; that is, they were not implemented to the extent that the vulnerabilities—and the resulting recommendations—did not exceed the materiality threshold.

f) In any case, none of the 19 recommendations impact the breaches addressed in the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure.

LEGAL BASIS

I

Jurisdiction

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 24/62

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR) and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act), the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary manner, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II

Preliminary Questions

The public limited company Centros Comerciales Carrefour is a company dedicated to the

operation of both large retail stores and establishments located within them.
Specifically, it specializes in marketing in non-specialized establishments, predominantly food and beverages. It also provides e-commerce services. For this purpose, it processes the personal data of its customers and employees. Personal data is understood to mean "all information about an

identified or identifiable natural person."

It carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller, since it is the controller who determines the purposes and means of such activity, pursuant to Article 4.7 of the GDPR:

"controller" or "controller" means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing; where Union or Member State law determines the purposes and means of processing, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.

An identifiable natural person is one whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

Likewise, processing should be understood as "any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction."

Article 4, paragraph 12 of the GDPR broadly defines "personal data security breaches" as "any breaches of security that lead to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or unauthorized communication of or access to such data."

In this case, up to five personal data breaches have been reported by the data controller CARREFOUR, all of them related to unauthorized access to customer accounts.
At least four of them were highly likely to have used the credential stuffing attack technique, using leaked credentials (email/password pairs), with no evidence of a brute force attack.

During the course of the investigation, it has become clear that the second, third, fourth, and fifth personal data breaches, reported on January 20, 2023, April 18, 2023, June 26, 2023, and September 14, 2023, are of the same type (Credential Stuffing).

Automated methods were used that utilized email addresses arranged in alphabetical order, indicating that the attacker used some type of database as a dictionary to launch their attacks. The attacks were carried out in a short period of time and from multiple IP addresses, which, according to CARREFOUR, made it difficult to identify them and stop them during execution.

Regarding the possible source or origin of the credentials that the attackers could have used to carry out the Credential Stuffing attack, in its January 20, 2023, communication, CARREFOUR reported that it was discovered on January 17, 2023, that credentials for some compromised email addresses were being offered in a ***APP.1 group. It also reported in its July 7, 2023, communication that it was discovered that packages of exposed credentials from several organizations, including Carrefour Spain, are currently being offered on various Dark Web sites. However, it states that all attempts by CARREFOUR to locate the original source of this data have been unsuccessful due to the high complexity of locating such sites.

Regarding the type of personal data that the attacker may have accessed in the second personal data breach, Carrefour has reported that, once the reactive measures were implemented following the first breach detected in January 2023, the following are:

o First Name, Last Name, Last Name
o Email Address
o Contact Phone Number (all digits masked with asterisks except the last 3)
o National Identity Document (all characters masked with asterisks except the last 4)
o Full Postal Address: Postal Code, Staircase/Floor/Door,
Municipality, Street Name, Street Number, Province, Street Type, Date of Birth

Likewise, the notification of the third personal data breach, which occurred on April 16, 2023, states that the attacker had access to basic data (e.g., first name, last name, date of birth), DNI (National Identity Document), passport, and/or any other

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 26/62

identification document, economic or financial data (without payment methods), contact information, access or identification credentials (username and/or password).

The notification of the fourth personal data breach, which occurred on June 23, 2023, states that the attacker accessed basic data (e.g., first name, last name, date of birth), contact information, and access or identification credentials (username and/or password).

The notification of the fifth personal data breach, which occurred on September 11, 2023, states that the attacker had access to basic data (e.g., first name, last name, date of birth), national identity document (DNI), foreign national identification number (NIE), passport and/or any other identification document, contact information, access or identification credentials (username and/or password).

As part of the processing principles set forth in Article 5 of the GDPR, the integrity and confidentiality of personal data is guaranteed in Section 1.f) of Article 5 of the GDPR.

For its part, the security of personal data is regulated in Articles 32, 33, and 34 of the GDPR, which govern the security of processing, the notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority, and the communication of a personal data breach to the data subject, respectively.

Regarding the violation of Article 33 of the GDPR, defined in Article 83.4 of the aforementioned Regulation, it is clear that the entity under investigation suffered a personal data breach, which it became aware of on October 6, 2022, although it did not notify this Agency until January 13, 2023, without having provided any reasons justifying such a delay. However, since the LOPDGDD (General Data Protection Act) establishes a one-year statute of limitations in Article 74 m) for these violations, it is appropriate not to charge them.

III
Response to the allegations regarding the initiation agreement

Regarding the allegations made regarding the initiation agreement of this sanctioning procedure, the following are addressed in the order

set forth by CCC:

FIRST ALLEGATION. Preliminary clarifications regarding the security incidents suffered by CCC

Carrefour states that the number of affected accounts reported to the Agency in each of the personal data breach notifications corresponds to the number of accounts for which the third party obtained confirmation of the validity of the access credentials, but that these are not accounts to which the third party had access.

In this regard, it should be noted that, in the personal data breach notification issued by Carrefour on January 13, 2023, it is stated that the data of 234 customers was compromised in the incident of October 6, 2022. In the notification,
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 27/62

of January 20, 2023, it is stated that 35,735 customers were affected in the incident of January 18, 2023; in the notification of April 18, 2023, 61,083 customers were affected in the incident of April 16, 2023; in the notification of June 26, 2023, a total of 10,943 customers were affected in the incident of June 23, 2023; and finally, in the notification of September 13, 2023, it is stated that 10,900 customers were affected in the incident of September 11, 2023.

Breach Access requests
successful
First Breach (…)

Second Breach (…)
Third Breach (…)
Fourth Breach (…)
Fifth Breach (…)

Therefore, despite Carrefour's argument, this AEPD considers that the personal data breaches reported by Carrefour affected a total of 118,895 unique accounts. In 118,895 accounts, the attacker obtained successful authentication, so they knew that the access credentials for those accounts were correct and successfully accessed them. Therefore, they had access to the personal information of the account holders, at least the credentials they used to log in, which posed a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

It should be remembered at this point that the concept of personal data must be interpreted broadly, encompassing not only the personal data collected and stored by the data controller, but also all information resulting from such processing (ECJ of May 4, 2023, in Case C-487/21) and, therefore, users' passwords/usernames are personal data.

As such, a total of 118,895 access credentials were compromised in the attacks. Obtaining these credentials poses a serious risk to individuals whose security has been compromised, potentially causing them to become victims of identity theft, fraud, or other acts of phishing.

Thus, as of October 6, 2022, the third party obtained confirmation of the validity of the access credentials, which, as stated, posed a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms. Carrefour's credentials were sold in a group of ***APP.1. In this regard, Carrefour acknowledges that once the third party has confirmed the validity of the credentials, they proceed to sell them through various channels: dark web, deep web, ***APP.1 channels, etc.

Furthermore, Carrefour claims to have sent a communication to those affected by the

third breach and, on June 23, 2023, and September 11, 2023, to those affected, corresponding to the fourth and fifth security breaches, respectively.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 28/62

Although the communication did not clearly warn those affected that Carrefour had suffered a personal data breach, they were therefore unaware of the risks to which they had been exposed.

SECOND CLAIM. CCC has not violated the principle of integrity and confidentiality.

First, it states that the breach of the integrity and confidentiality of CCC customers' personal data occurred in only 973 cases.

It notes that the number of affected accounts reported to the Agency in each of the reported security breaches corresponds to the number of accounts for which the third party obtained confirmation of the validity of the credentials.
These are not accounts to which the third party had access, nor did it have access to the personal data of those clients.

Regarding integrity, it states that the cases in which it was affected amount to 234 cases of clients whose personal data was modified. The data that was modified included the email address, the delivery address, as well as, in some cases, the telephone number and name.

Regarding confidentiality, it indicates that the number of cases in which it was violated amounts to 973. This number corresponds to the cases in which fraud was detected in clients' Ahorró checks, which are distributed between: the 234 cases of the First Breach, where the breach of confidentiality also led to a breach of integrity, and 739 cases distributed between the Second and Fifth Breach. It considers that the total number of affected individuals reported in the breaches (118,895) does not correspond to the total number of cases in which integrity and confidentiality were affected, but rather that the breach of integrity was limited to 234 clients and the breach of confidentiality to 973.

In this regard, it should be noted that the investigation carried out by this authority has established:

(…)

In this regard, there is no way to defend the absence of a violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, since, in the absence of adequate measures, there was illegitimate access to personal data by an unauthorized third party, which resulted in the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and control of numerous personal data, affecting all those whose data were known, not only those clients whose data was subsequently stolen. This constitutes a breach
of the duty to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of personal data, since
as indicated, Article 5.1.f) states that they must be processed in such a way

as to ensure adequate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 29/62

Therefore, the risk of loss of confidentiality has materialized, which means that personal data may be used for unknown purposes (sold, communicated, published, etc.), all without the consent of its owners,

leading to a total and absolute loss of control over them. Furthermore, it also poses a very high risk of fraudulent use of the data (identity theft, fraud, financial loss, etc.) or of it being used for any other purpose that, under certain circumstances, constitutes a threat to its owners. It should also be noted that most of the personal data affected is data that cannot be modified or changed by others (name, surname).

This loss of control over one's own personal data results in a violation of the fundamental right to data protection recognized in Article 18 of the Spanish Constitution. As the Constitutional Court has stated (Judgment 292/2000, of November 30, 2000), "the fundamental right to data protection seeks to guarantee individuals the power to control their personal data, its use, and its destination, with the purpose of preventing illicit trafficking that is harmful to the dignity and rights of the data subject (...) The right to data protection guarantees individuals the power to dispose of such data."

In the case at hand, it has been proven that CCC has violated this duty of confidentiality in relation to the personal data it processes. Therefore, it is not appropriate to accept that the amount of the fine should be reduced, considering that the number of affected parties whose integrity and/or confidentiality of their personal data has been compromised is 973, since the loss of control over their personal data occurs from the moment the personal data breach materializes, that is, from the moment an unauthorized third party accesses the personal data processed by CCC. In any case, what is relevant to understanding that confidentiality has been breached is that the information is completely available to unauthorized third parties.

This is the loss of confidentiality attributed to the data subject, and this is when the data subject's loss of control over their personal data materializes.

In the case at hand, due to the type of data processed and affected by the breaches, which the CCC appears to disregard, there is a high risk, if its confidentiality is breached, of fraudulent use: identity theft, phishing, financial fraud, etc. It is also important to keep in mind, in any case, that the risk of loss of confidentiality has already materialized since unauthorized access has occurred. Therefore, there is no longer a "probability" of risk of loss of confidentiality and control of individuals over their personal data, but rather the materialization of this risk, which in turn may entail a high risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals who may suffer identity theft, fraud, or financial loss.

Therefore, it is understood that the breach of confidentiality attributed to CCC

is the one that corresponds to it, that is, for failing to comply with the obligation imposed in Article 5.1.f) to process data in such a way as to ensure adequate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing, through the application of appropriate technical or organizational measures.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 30/62

CCC states that it does not agree with the aggravating circumstances taken into account when calculating the penalty. Thus:

o The nature, severity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the
nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question,
as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered (Article 83.2 a) of the GDPR):

It is understood that the amount of the fine should be reduced, taking into account that the
number of affected parties whose integrity and/or confidentiality of their personal data has been compromised is 973. Furthermore, it considers that, although in these cases a set of data has been affected (name and surname, full postal address, and date of birth), they are not critical, especially if

we take into account that, as stated (Document 2), the ultimate purpose pursued by the third party is to commit economic fraud, with the affected personal data being a means to commit such fraud, not an end in itself.

In this regard, it should be noted that such considerations cannot be accepted as a mitigating circumstance or as a circumstance that lessens the seriousness of the events; quite the contrary, because precisely because of the high number of processing operations it carries out and the number of clients affected, CCC is obliged to act with the special diligence required of an entity of this nature, which carries out numerous personal data processing operations. Finally, the considerable number of those affected by the personal data breaches cannot be ignored. The investigations carried out have revealed that the number of affected parties whose integrity and/or confidentiality of their personal data has been compromised is 118,954. This is due to unauthorized access to personal data by an unauthorized third party, which resulted in the loss of confidentiality and control of numerous personal data and affected all those whose data was known, not only those clients whose data was subsequently stolen. It is worth recalling the ruling of the National Court of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006), which, with respect to entities whose activities involve the continuous processing of customer data, states: "...the Supreme Court has held that negligence exists whenever a legal duty of care is disregarded, that is, when the offender fails to behave with the required diligence. In assessing the degree of diligence, the professionalism of the individual must be especially considered. There is no doubt that, in the case under consideration, when the appellant's activity involves constant and extensive handling of personal data, rigor and exquisite care must be emphasized in complying with the legal provisions in this regard."

In the case at hand, the type of data processed and affected by the breaches, which CCC appears to disregard, poses a high risk of fraudulent use if its confidentiality is breached: identity theft, phishing, financial fraud, etc.

o The intentionality or negligence in the infringement (Article 83.2 b) of the GDPR:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 31/62

It is understood that the existence of due diligence would be supported by the passing of the audit of ***COMPANY.4 and provides a 2022 report on the evaluation carried out from September to October 2022 on the security of ***COMPANY.5's information systems (Document 5), (...) (Document 6), as well as by the fact that the second authentication factor was not – and is not – a market practice in the digital channels of leading Spanish retailers (Document 7).
Likewise, also in relation to two-factor authentication, it once again highlights that this implementation occurred before October 30, 2023.
For the app channel (to which all attacks were directed except the last one), it was

implemented in March 2023.

In this regard, it should be noted that the data controller must
implement technical and organizational measures taking into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks of varying

probability and severity to the rights and freedoms of natural persons (Article 24.1 GDPR). Therefore, the risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals must be identified and assessed, and the measures must be applied, taking into account, among other circumstances, the "context" in which the measures are to be defined and applied, which in this case was a series of personal data breaches suffered by CCC. The documentation provided does not reflect the new risks to the rights and freedoms of individuals arising from the bankruptcies suffered by Carrefour, and, furthermore, the existence of these events is what differentiates Carrefour from other contexts in which other digital channels of other leading Spanish retailers may be located.

Therefore, the fact that the second authentication factor was not—and is not—a market practice in the digital channels of leading Spanish retailers cannot be taken into consideration in this case. Regarding data protection, the technical and organizational measures to be adopted by data controllers and other obligations to be fulfilled by the GDPR must be appropriate in relation to the specific risks posed by the specific processing carried out by each controller. Therefore, when analyzing the diligence of each party in compliance with the regulations, the circumstances of each case must be taken into account, taking into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of each processing. Therefore, there are no identical cases.

In this regard, it is worth remembering that it was not until after the fifth breach (specifically, on October 30, 2023) that the decision was made to implement 2FA (with the sending of an OTP key) for logins to the e-commerce digital channel. Having this measure in place earlier would have most likely prevented all attacks on this channel, demonstrating a lack of diligence on the part of CCC in implementing appropriate technical measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to people's rights and freedoms. The implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) was undoubtedly a significant step forward in protecting data security. However, this step came late, after critical vulnerabilities had emerged and up to five personal data breaches had occurred, with widespread impact and using the same entry vector. The fact that CCC is a large company whose activity involves constant and extensive handling of personal data, carrying out processing operations that entail a likely high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, requires greater diligence in the processing of personal data than can be required of a small company that carries out sporadic or incidental processing.

Furthermore, CCC understands that the following circumstances should be taken into account as mitigating factors:

i. Any other measure taken by the data controller to mitigate the damages suffered by the data subjects (Article 83.2 c) of the GDPR).

It considers that the fact that CCC took measures to mitigate the damages suffered by the data subjects should be considered as mitigating factors. In this regard, it reset the credentials that had been affected; and in those cases

where fraud occurred with the Savings Checks, CCC reimbursed the amount of the Savings Checks and issued gift cards to the affected individuals, so that, it argues, they did not suffer any economic impact from the fraud.

Furthermore, it states that these measures were taken spontaneously, before CCC was aware of the information requests and the start of the Agency's investigation.

To this end, it should be noted that the effects of the breach of personal data not only had economic effects, derived from the Savings Checks fraud, but went much further, as the loss of confidentiality of personal data

involved a greater risk to the rights and freedoms of those affected, even as indicated, their credentials were sold in ***APP.1.

ii. The degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach (Article 83.2 f) of the GDPR), as well as the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller notified the breach and, if so, to what extent (Article 83.2 h of the GDPR).

CCC considers this mitigating circumstance applicable to the extent that the Initiation Agreement was issued as a result of the five personal data breaches reported by CCC to the Agency. It states that the fact that it was notified, and that it diligently complied with this duty, should be considered a mitigating circumstance.
Information was provided with complete transparency, and therefore, it also believes that these mitigating circumstances should apply. Finally, CCC has cooperated favorably with the investigation, responding to all requests made.

In this regard, it should be noted, first, that notifying supervisory authorities and informing data subjects of a personal data breach are obligations imposed on the data controller by the GDPR (Articles 33 and 34, respectively). That is, compliance with these obligations is required by law. It is a mandate that must be fulfilled. Therefore, failure by the data controller, in accordance with the requirements of these provisions, may constitute a violation of the GDPR.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 33/62

Second, the requirements of the AEPD are mandatory.

Therefore, in this case, the degree of cooperation with the Agency cannot be assessed, and the mitigating circumstance is not applicable, since the consideration of cooperation with the Agency as a mitigating circumstance, as the entity claims, is not linked to any of the cases in which collaboration or cooperation is legally provided for, or responding to a request pursuant to a legal mandate. Therefore, when the actions are due and required by law, as in the case at hand, its application is not applicable.

Consequently, the allegations must be dismissed, meaning that the arguments presented do not distort the essential content of the violations they allege nor do they constitute sufficient justification or exculpation.

THIRD ALLEGATION: CCC adopted appropriate security measures.

(i) Regarding the measures, CCC indicates that it did adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent the loss of integrity and confidentiality from recurring and, in any case, to effectively reduce the likelihood of the loss of integrity and confidentiality of its clients' personal data materializing. It includes a list of these measures in its written submission and affirms that it thereby complies with the requirements of Article 32 of the GDPR.

In contrast, it should be noted that the facts indicate the opposite.

When assessing the risks of varying probability and severity, CCC should have taken into account the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons and implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. Security. Only security.

CCC is charged with violating the aforementioned Article 32, regardless of whether a breach of confidentiality has occurred or not, because the reprehensible conduct that violates this precept is the lack or inadequacy of security measures. That is, it is violated and sanctioned regardless of whether a personal data breach has occurred or not.

An analysis of the documentation provided by CCC in response to the request for information reveals the following: "(...)"

Therefore, there was a deficiency in the security measures implemented, as the defective measures were inadequate, regardless of whether a personal data breach had occurred or not, as they allowed consecutive access from more than 7,000 different IP addresses from different network providers, without any abnormal behavior being detected. This clearly demonstrates a breach of Article 32 of the GDPR, as it requires appropriate measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing. C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 34/62

To this end, we must refer to Recital 83 of the GDPR, which establishes that

“In order to maintain security and prevent processing infringing this Regulation, the controller or processor should assess the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate them, such as encryption. These measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of implementation, in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. When assessing the risk related to data security, the risks arising from the processing of personal data should be taken into account, such as the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or unauthorized communication of or access to such data.” data, likely in particular to cause physical, material, or immaterial damage." (emphasis added)

Furthermore, Article 32 of the GDPR indicates that the measures implemented must

include the ability to guarantee the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and
resilience of processing systems and services (letter b of Article 32.1 GDPR). Therefore, it is not enough to have measures in place to react as quickly as possible
when confidentiality has been breached; appropriate prior measures must also be in place to prevent a breach, such as preventive and detective measures aimed at avoiding any loss of confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of personal data.

The technical and organizational security measures to be applied are those relevant to the existing risk, assessing, among other factors, the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, and the likelihood and severity of the risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

In this sense, Article 32 does not establish specific and static security measures; rather, it is up to the data controller to determine the security measures necessary at any given time to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data. Consequently, the protection of the same data may require different security measures depending on the specific characteristics of the different data processing operations.

The security obligation imposed on the data controller by Article 32 of the GDPR is an obligation of means; its violation does not require that a result has occurred: the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

As stated in the Supreme Court of February 15, 2022 (cassation appeal 7359/2020), "In obligations of means, the commitment acquired is to adopt the technical and organizational means, as well as to carry out diligent activity in their implementation and use, aimed at achieving the expected result with means that can reasonably be described as suitable and sufficient for their achievement. Therefore, they are called obligations of "diligence" or "conduct." (Our emphasis).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 35/62

Also relevant is the Court of Justice of the European Union, of December 14, 2023, case C-340/21, in which the Court states the following:

"(...) the appropriateness of such technical and organizational measures must be assessed in a phased manner. On the one hand, it is necessary to identify the risks of personal data breaches that the processing entails and their potential consequences for the rights and freedoms of individuals. This assessment must be carried out in each specific case, taking into consideration the likelihood of the identified risks and their severity. Next, it must be verified whether the measures adopted by the data controller are appropriate to these risks, taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing."
(section 42).

In this case, the measures implemented by CCC did not guarantee an adequate level of risk, as they did not take into account the identified risks and their severity.
CCC was experiencing a series of successive personal data breaches and did not adopt adequate measures to mitigate the impact in the event of a personal data breach. This was regardless of whether it ultimately occurred.

Well, in the audit conducted on the website (www.carrefour.es) between February 14, 2023, and March 3, 2023, it is noted in section 5.11 of the report "(...)". This vulnerability is considered severe. Media.

In the testing phase, CCC stated that this vulnerability was not addressed, that is, it was not implemented to the extent that the vulnerability—and the resulting recommendations—did not exceed the materiality threshold. However, nothing is said in the report about not exceeding the materiality threshold.

(…)

But, what's more, it also did not adopt other security measures recommended in the short-term in the pentest reports conducted.

In this regard, it should be noted that the pentest report regarding the audit

conducted on the web channel (www.carrefour.es) between February 14, 2023, and March 3, 2023, also includes the following vulnerabilities, among others:

(…)

However, according to the pentest report for the Carrefour website
(Carrefour.es), to conduct the tests in the Gray Box mode (…).

At this point, CCC indicates that they were not addressed, this es, were not implemented to the extent that the vulnerabilities – and the resulting recommendations – did not

exceed the materiality threshold. However, the report does not mention anything about the fact that the materiality threshold was not exceeded.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 36/62

For its part, the report on the pentest conducted on Carrefour's APP channel, between February 6, 2023, and February 9, 2023, includes, among others, the following vulnerabilities:

 (…).

Regarding these vulnerabilities, Carrefour has stated that the
recommendations were not implemented because "they are not applicable, to the extent that they are recommendations derived from vulnerabilities that were
detected as a result of providing information to the auditor about the

infrastructure of CCC's systems and the elimination of security measures
for Facilitate the auditor's work in the gray-box pentest.

However, point 3 of the APP's pentest report states that "(...)".

According to the official website of the National Cybersecurity Institute, there are

different types of penetration tests (pentesting) depending on the initial information available to the auditor. These can be:

• White box: if they have all the information about the systems, applications, and infrastructure, allowing them to simulate that the attack is being carried out by someone familiar with the company and its systems;

• Gray box: if they have some information, but not all;
• Black box: if they have no information about our systems; in this case, what an external cybercriminal would do is simulated.

Therefore, in the pentesting test performed in the APP, the auditor was not provided

with any information, as it was not a gray-box test but a black box test.

Consequently, CCC's claim regarding the existence of adequate measures must be rejected.

(ii) CCC indicates that it should be taken into account that certain security measures (gray box) were deactivated during the audits.

However, as indicated above, the pentest test performed on the APP was conducted in Black Box mode, and while it is true that the pentest test performed on the website began in Gray Box mode, as stated in the Pentest report for the Carrefour website (Carrefour.es), in order to perform the tests in Gray Box mode (...), this claim must therefore also be rejected.

(iii) Regarding the critical and high-level vulnerabilities detected in the February 2023 Pentest analysis, a document has been provided with the report of an expert auditor certifying and accrediting the correction of the critical vulnerability. This report is dated July 19, 2023.

However, regarding the high-level vulnerability (regarding the possible use of outdated software with known vulnerabilities), they state that they are currently working on remediating it. Other recommendations for addressing medium-level vulnerabilities, recommended for short-term implementation, have not been implemented either, despite, as indicated, the events suffered by Carrefour.

All of this merely reflects a lack of diligence on the part of CCC when it comes to implementing security measures appropriate to the risk of the data processing it carries out. It should not be forgotten that both the CCC application and the website process the personal data of thousands of customers, which represents large-scale processing, requiring appropriate security measures for this environment and specifically aimed at ensuring that illegitimate access to said personal data does not occur.

(iv) It considers that, in this case, if Articles 5.1 f) and 32 of the GDPR were deemed to have been violated (quod non), we would be dealing with a single violation, and that the alleged lack of appropriate technical and organizational measures should be understood, as a means of perpetration, to include a violation of the principles of integrity and confidentiality.

Now, data confidentiality and security are fundamentally reflected in two independent provisions of the GDPR: Article 5.1 f) and Article 32 of the GDPR.

Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR is one of the principles relating to processing. The principles relating to processing are, on the one hand, the starting point and the closing clause of the data protection legal system, constituting true rules that inform the system with an intense expansive force; on the other hand, since they are highly specific, they are mandatory rules that are susceptible to being violated.

Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR establishes the principle of integrity and confidentiality and determines that personal data shall be processed in such a way that adequate security of personal data is guaranteed, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, through the application of appropriate technical or organizational measures. It establishes an obligation of result, not an objective one. Furthermore, Article 32 of the GDPR regulates how data processing security must be structured in relation to the specific security measures to be implemented. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, among other things, the ability to guarantee the confidentiality of the data.

As we can see, Article 32 of the GDPR, although related to Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, does not fully circumscribe the principle. Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR expressly requires that confidentiality be guaranteed, and requires a loss of confidentiality, availability, or integrity for its attribution. We may encounter

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 38/62

cases in which inadequate measures exist without resulting in a loss of integrity, availability, or confidentiality.

The lack of security measures constitutes an autonomous and independent violation, sufficient in itself to be sanctioned without the need for a personal data breach to materialize. A violation of Article 32 is not necessary for a violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR to be considered.

In the present case:

- The violation of the principles of integrity and confidentiality, both established in the aforementioned Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, is manifested in illegitimate access to customer accounts by unauthorized third parties, in some cases even able to modify personal data and make purchases, which led to the notification of up to five personal data breaches by the data controller CARREFOUR. It is also evident in the inadequate management of personal data security violations.

- The violation of Article 32 of the GDPR is inferred from the statements of the

investigated entity itself, which acknowledged during the course of the investigation that most of the rules are based on volumetric errors from the same IP address, the same user, or specific ranges. However, the system allowed more than 7,000 different IP addresses from different network providers to be used for access; therefore, the security measures implemented were insufficient. This constitutes a violation of Article 32 of the GDPR.
It also stems from the failure to implement the measures recommended in the pentest reports, which would prevent the attacker from accessing personal data in the event of an attack.

Alternatively, the Court considers that the following circumstances should be taken into account:

The nature, severity, and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages and losses they have suffered (Article 83.2 a) of the GDPR).

The Court considers that there is an inconsistency in the initial agreement and that either the fact that the Personal Data has been affected is considered an aggravating factor (in which case it should be limited to the customers actually affected, not all users of the website and application), or, conversely, that the fact that the impact due to the lack of technical and organizational measures affects all users of the website and application is considered an aggravating factor (in which case it cannot be argued that their personal data has been effectively affected, since it has occurred only in certain cases).

In any case, the Court considers that, although in certain cases a set of data (name and surname, full postal address, and date of birth) has been compromised, these data are not critical, especially considering that the third party's ultimate goal is to commit financial fraud, with the compromised personal data being a means to commit said fraud, not an end in itself.

Regarding the duration, it has been seen how the progressive implementation of new measures has reduced the impact (implementation of the second factor to modify personal data and to access the application, among others). Therefore, it understands that this circumstance cannot be considered an aggravating factor.

Regarding this aggravating factor, the focus is on the lack of security measures that affect the personal data of Carrefour customers who use the website and the app. This broad impact amplifies the severity of the breach, given that each client was at risk of loss of confidentiality, availability, and integrity.

Furthermore, regarding the duration of the breach, the lack of measures extends

until at least November 8, 2024, the date Carrefour submits its response to the requested evidence, given that necessary technical or organizational measures have not been implemented.

o The intentionality or negligence in the breach (Article 83.2 b) of the GDPR

Regarding this circumstance, there is no doubt that the documentation in the proceedings reveals a serious lack of diligence in managing the security of personal data.

CCC also believes that the following circumstances should be taken into account as mitigating factors:

i. Any other measures taken by the data controller to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects (Article 83.2 c) of the GDPR)

CCC adopted technical and organizational measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of the risk materializing. Furthermore, these measures were adopted proactively, that is, prior to becoming aware of the Agency's investigations that led to the issuance of the Initiation Agreement.
As indicated above, CCC reportedly did not take measures to prevent unauthorized third parties from exploiting the identified vulnerabilities.

ii. The degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach (Article 83.2 f) of the GDPR), as well as how the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller notified the breach and, if so, to what extent (Article 83.2 h of the GDPR).

We refer to the Second Allegation for this circumstance.

Consequently, the allegations must be dismissed, meaning that the arguments presented do not distort the essential content of the violations

declared to have been committed nor do they constitute sufficient grounds for justification or exculpation.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 40/62

FOURTH ALLEGATION. CCC acknowledges its liability in relation to the alleged violation of Article 34 of the GDPR: communication of breaches to affected individuals.

Although CCC considered at the time that communication of the breaches to the affected individuals was not mandatory, CCC acknowledges its sole and exclusive liability for the alleged violation of Article 34 of the GDPR in relation to those individuals whose confidentiality and/or integrity of their personal data was compromised, which should result in a 20% reduction in the proposed fine for this violation (€200,000). Furthermore, if payment were made before the resolution of this procedure, the fine should be reduced by an additional 20%, resulting in a total amount payable of €120,000.

The entity under investigation acknowledges its liability and requests the reductions in the amount of the fine provided for in the regulations.

Article 85.1 of the LPACAP states that "Once a sanctioning procedure has been initiated, if the offender acknowledges responsibility, the procedure may be resolved with the imposition of the appropriate sanction."

Therefore, the agreement initiating this sanctioning procedure indicated that "In accordance with the provisions of Article 85 of the LPACAP, the offender may acknowledge responsibility within the period granted for submitting allegations to this initiation agreement; this will entail a 20% reduction in the sanction to be imposed in this procedure."

On the other hand, the same initiation agreement stated that "Likewise, the offender may, at any time prior to the resolution of this procedure, voluntarily pay the proposed sanction, which will entail a 20% reduction in its amount." This payment will imply the termination of the procedure, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding measures.

Furthermore, Article 85.3 of the LPACAP states that the effectiveness of such a reduction
"will be conditioned upon the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the sanction." This aspect is also reflected in the aforementioned
agreement to initiate this sanctioning procedure, which also states that

"In any case, the effectiveness of either of the two aforementioned reductions
will be conditioned upon the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the sanction."

Therefore, although the investigated entity has acknowledged its liability within the deadline for submitting allegations to the initiation agreement, this has not been accompanied by either the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the sanction, or the payment thereof. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 85.2 of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Code), it is hereby informed that it may, at any time prior to the resolution of this procedure, expressly express its withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal, as well as voluntarily pay the proposed sanction. This will entail a 20% reduction in the amount of the sanction, and its payment will imply the termination of the procedure, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding measures.

IV
Breached Obligation. Principle of Integrity and Confidentiality.

Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR establishes the following:

“Article 5 Principles relating to processing:

1. Personal data shall be:

(…)

f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, by applying appropriate technical or organizational measures (“integrity and confidentiality”).”

In relation to this principle, Recital 39 of the aforementioned GDPR states that:

“[…]Personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of personal data, including to prevent unauthorized access to or use of such data and of the equipment used in the processing.”

According to the Guidelines on notification of personal data breaches pursuant to Regulation 2016/679 of the WP29, a “breach of confidentiality” occurs when there is an unauthorized or accidental disclosure of, or access to, personal data; a “breach of integrity” occurs when there is an unauthorized or accidental alteration of personal data; and a “breach of availability” occurs when there is an accidental or unauthorized loss of access to, or destruction of, personal data.

The principle of confidentiality and integrity, within the framework of the GDPR, implies the

obligation to ensure that personal data remains protected and can only be accessed or modified by those authorized
to process it, for the legitimate purpose intended by the data controller.

In the case at hand, the investigation carried out by this authority reveals an alleged violation of the aforementioned principle of confidentiality and integrity. This breach is manifested primarily in the personal data breaches suffered by the entity and reported by the investigated entity itself, which are:

(…)

The fact that the attackers illegitimately accessed customer accounts, likely using the Credential Stuffing attack technique, using leaked credentials (email/password pairs), regardless of the
method in which they accessed said credentials, and that they were able to modify personal data and make purchases, constitutes a manifestation of the violation of the

principles of integrity and confidentiality, both established in the aforementioned Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR.

In this regard, it should not be forgotten, as has been revealed in the investigation and the information transmitted, that the attackers accessed and modified the clients' personal data, at least in the first reported breach.

The high number of accesses to personal data increases the risk of misuse and fraud and demonstrates that the technical and organizational measures adopted by the controller before and after the incidents were not appropriate to guarantee the integrity and adequate confidentiality of the personal data, especially to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing.

Art. Article 24 of the GDPR, on the controller's responsibility, provides in paragraph 1 that "Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that processing is in compliance with this Regulation. These measures shall be reviewed and updated as necessary. (emphasis added)

For its part, Recital 74 of the GDPR states that "The controller's responsibility for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller or on its own behalf should be established. In particular, the controller must be obliged to implement timely and effective measures and must be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with the General Data Protection Regulation, including the effectiveness of those measures." Such measures must take into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.”

And Recital 76 adds that “The likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject must be determined by reference to the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the data processing.” Risk must be assessed based on an objective assessment to determine whether data processing operations pose a risk or whether the risk is high.

WP248 Guidelines of the WP29 on data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) and determining whether processing is likely to pose a high risk for the purposes of the GDPR, adopted on April 4, 2017, and last revised and adopted on October 4, 2017, define the concepts of "risk" and "risk management." A "risk" is a scenario that describes an event and its consequences, estimated in terms of severity and probability. On the other hand, "risk management" can be defined as the coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with respect to risk.

As stated in the AEPD's guide on "Risk management and impact assessment in the processing of personal data," "F for reaction" In the event of a breach, the controller will have to address, within the risk management cycle, all necessary measures to prevent the incident or breach from recurring. This task will involve reviewing the controls related to the occurrence of the breach, as well as possibly implementing new controls that may be necessary. This will involve, for the purposes of this matter, the application of those resources, procedures, and controls that may be necessary to ensure compliance with the principle of integrity and confidentiality, which is not stated to have been done in this case.

In this regard, the aforementioned guide also states, "As interpreted by Declaration WP218, it should be emphasized that addressing the risks that data processing may pose to the rights and freedoms of individuals cannot be limited to applying security measures exclusively. Therefore, security risk management is one of the activities for managing risks to rights and freedoms and must be subordinate to the latter. Furthermore, from the GDPR perspective, mitigation measures must be aimed at reducing the impact and likelihood of personal data breaches affecting the data subject.

In the present case, five personal data breaches occurred, with the attackers likely using credential stuffing. Carrefour confirmed that no brute force attacks were carried out and that customer credentials were being offered. Carrefour has not proven that it adopted adequate technical and organizational measures, not just security measures, to prevent the loss of integrity and confidentiality from recurring or to effectively reduce the likelihood of its occurrence. This includes verifying the effectiveness of the resources, procedures, and controls implemented, reassessing the risk, and conducting the necessary reviews within an appropriate timeframe to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the personal data. did.

Carrefour did not diligently implement two-factor authentication, which would have prevented access to accounts whose credentials could have been compromised by the breaches.

It should be noted that the appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk cannot be solely reactive measures, that is, exclusively to immediately resolve a personal data breach after it has occurred. It is worth remembering that the implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), while a significant advance in data security protection, came late at a reactive time, after critical vulnerabilities had been revealed and up to five personal data breaches had occurred, with far-reaching effects.

And inadequate management of personal data security breaches is not only evident in the late implementation of 2FA, at least in the web channel, but also in other circumstances. Thus, an impact has been observed. In the first breach, 234 were affected, in the second breach: 35,735, in the third breach: 61,083, in the fourth breach: 10,943, and in the fifth breach: 10,900. CCC has stated that it reset the affected passwords after the successive breaches and that in the fourth breach, the credentials of 1,741 customers were again compromised, also affected in the third breach. However, of the 10,943 customers affected, in the fourth breach, only the passwords of 9,202 customers were expired. The passwords of 1,741 customers were not reset again because they had already been reset after the third breach, leaving those 1,741 credentials unreset. that
they had become compromised again.

In this regard, it should not be forgotten, as has been revealed in the investigative actions and the information transmitted, that there was illegitimate access to personal data by an unauthorized third party, which resulted in the loss of confidentiality and control over numerous personal data and affected all those whose data was known, not just those customers whose data was subsequently impersonated.

Regarding the type of personal data that the attacker may have accessed in the second personal data breach, once the reactive measures were implemented following the first breach detected in January 2023, the investigated entity itself includes a list of personal data that may have been accessed, organized by data type:

o First Name, Last Name, Last Name
o Email Address
o Contact Phone Number (all digits masked with asterisks except the last 3)
o National Identity Document (all characters masked with asterisks except the last 4)
o Full Mailing Address: Postal Code, Staircase/Floor/Door,

Municipality, Street Name, Street Number, Province, Street Type, Date of Birth.

Likewise, the notification of the third personal data breach, which occurred on April 16, 2023, states that the attacker had access to basic data (e.g., first name, last name, date of birth), DNI, NIE, passport, and/or any other identification document, economic or financial data (without payment methods), contact information, and access or identification credentials (username and/or password).

The notification of the fourth personal data breach, which occurred on June 23, 2023, states that the attacker accessed basic data (e.g., first name, last name, date of birth), contact information, and access or identification credentials (username and/or password).

The notification of the fifth personal data breach, which occurred on September 11, 2023, states that the attacker had access to basic data (e.g., first name, last name, date of birth). Birth certificate), DNI, NIE, Passport, and/or any other identification document, Contact information, Access or identification credentials (username and/or password).

Consequently, the proven facts are considered to constitute an

infraction, attributable to the entity under investigation, for violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR.

Classification and qualification of the violation

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 45/62

The aforementioned violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR entails the commission of the violations classified in Article 83.5 of the GDPR, which, under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines," provides:

"Violations of the following provisions shall be sanctioned, in accordance with

section 2, with fines administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher:

a) the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9; (…)”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in Article 71 “Infractions,” establishes that
“The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute infringements.”

For the purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 72 “Infractions considered very serious” of the LOPDGDD states:

“1. Pursuant to Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:

a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees established in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)”

VI
Sanction

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:

“1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for infringements of this Regulation indicated in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures provided for in Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:

a) the nature, severity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them;

b) the intentionality or negligence involved in the infringement;
c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects;
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 46/62

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es (d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;
(e) any previous breaches committed by the controller or processor;
(f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate any adverse effects of the breach;
(g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;
(h) how the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the breach and, if so, to what extent;
(i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been ordered against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with those measures;
j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or to certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42,
k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.

For its part, Article 76 "Sanctions and corrective measures" of the LOPDGDD

provides:

"1. The sanctions provided for in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria established in paragraph 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account:

a) The continuous nature of the infringement.

b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.
c) The benefits obtained as a result of committing the infringement.
d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the commission of the infringement.
e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the acquiring entity.
f) The impact on the rights of minors.
g) Having, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.
h) Voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, in cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.

According to the transcribed provisions, for the purposes of setting the amount of the fine for a violation of Article 5.1 f) of the GDPR, the fine must be graded taking into account:

The following are taken into account when graduating the penalty:

Article 83.2 a) GDPR: "the nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation involved, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered."

It should be noted that the violation of the principle of integrity and confidentiality in the present case involves a set of personal data whose nature amplifies the implications of the security breach. This is evident from the fact that certain personal data, such as name, Last Name 1,
Last Name 2, Email Address, Full Mailing Address: Postal Code,
Staircase/Floor/Door, Municipality, Street Name, Street Number, Province, Street Type, Date of Birth, and credentials, the exposure of which increases the risk of misuse and fraud, as well as social engineering attacks and cyberscams.

The combination of this type of personal data significantly increases the level of risk to the rights and freedoms of its owners and the implications of a breach of confidentiality. This is due to the fact that such a combination not only increases the amount of information available to a malicious actor, but also broadens the scope of potential abuses. This does not involve isolated data or individual pieces of information, but rather the exposure of an integrated set of personal data that, when combined, can be used to build a complete and detailed profile of an individual, which can allow an attacker to carry out fraud and identity theft operations with a higher success rate.

Specifically, online orders were placed and QR codes were used in physical stores, and stolen accounts were accessed through other devices using customer coupons. This level of access increases the risk of misuse and fraud, as well as loss of control over your personal data.

Finally, the considerable number of those affected by the breaches cannot be ignored, given that an impact has been confirmed in the first breach: 234 affected, in the second breach: 35,735 affected, in the third breach: 61,083 affected, in the fourth breach: 10,943 affected, and in the fifth breach: 10,900 affected, which highlights both the scale of the incident and the considerable number of individuals whose rights and freedoms were compromised. This widespread impact amplifies the severity of the breach, given that each affected customer represents a potential case of fraud, identity theft, or financial loss, exponentially multiplying the negative repercussions of the incident.

Furthermore, the breach is aggravated by the context in which it occurs, where individuals trust the entity to securely handle their personal information,

having eroded the trust and expectations of those affected regarding the processing of their personal data.

Article 83.2 b) GDPR: "Intentional or negligent infringement"

The Supreme Court has held that negligence exists whenever a legal duty of care is disregarded, that is, when the offender fails to behave with the required diligence. In assessing the degree of diligence, the professionalism of the individual must be especially considered. There is no doubt that, in the case now under review, when the defendant entity's activity involves constant and extensive handling of personal data, rigor and exquisite care must be emphasized in complying with the legal provisions in this regard. [Judgment of the National Court of 17/10/2007 (rec. 63/2006)].

The investigation carried out by this authority reveals a possible insufficiency of technical and organizational measures for the adequate management of personal data security breaches. This can be easily inferred from the fact that, although all breaches involved unauthorized access to customer accounts, it was not until after the fifth breach (specifically, on October 30, 2023) that the decision was made to implement 2FA (with the sending of an OTP key) for logins to the eCommerce digital channel. Having this measure in place earlier would have most likely prevented all attacks on this channel, highlighting CARREFOUR's lack of diligence in fulfilling its duty to adopt appropriate measures to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

The implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) undoubtedly constituted a significant advance in protecting data security. However, this
progress came late at a reactive moment, after critical vulnerabilities had been revealed and up to five personal data breaches had occurred, with

wide-ranging effects and the same entry vector.

This circumstance reflects a clear failure by the controller to fulfill its duty of care to protect its customers' data, which reinforces and amplifies the
seriousness of the breach.

Article 76.2 b) LOPDGDD: "The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data"

The business activity of the investigated entity requires continuous processing of personal data. The company operates in a sector where trust and information security are essential, and therefore it has the
responsibility to more rigorously guarantee the data protection principles regarding the information it manages as part of this activity.

Considering the factors outlined above, the fine is assessed at €2,000,000 for violations of Article 5.1 f) of the GDPR.

VII
Obligation breached. Security of processing.

Article 32 of the GDPR, on data processing security, establishes the following:

“1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, which, where appropriate, includes, among others:
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 49/62

a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
b) the ability to guarantee the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services;
c) the ability to restore availability and access to personal data quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
d) a process of regular verification, evaluation, and assessment the effectiveness of the technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of the processing.

2. When assessing the adequacy of the level of security, particular account shall be taken of the risks posed by the processing of data, in particular as a result of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.

3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or a certification mechanism approved pursuant to Article 42 may serve as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.

4. The controller and the processor shall take measures to ensure that any person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to personal data only processes those data on instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law.

Recital 74 of the GDPR, reproduced above, states:

“The controller's responsibility should be established for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller or on its own behalf. In particular, the controller should be obliged to implement timely and effective measures and should be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this Regulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. Those measures should take into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.”

It should be noted that the GDPR does not establish a list of measures, nor of the security measures that must be applied according to the data being processed. Instead, it establishes that the data controller and the data processor shall apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk involved in the processing, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, and the risks of likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Likewise, security measures must be appropriate and proportionate to the risk detected, noting that the determination of technical and organizational measures must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymization and encryption, the ability to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience, the ability to restore availability and access to data after an incident, verification (not auditing) processes, evaluation, and assessment of the effectiveness of the measures.

In any case, when assessing the adequacy of the security level, the risks posed by data processing will be particularly taken into account, such as the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration of personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed, or the unauthorized communication or access to such data, which could cause physical, material, or immaterial damage.

In this same sense, Recital 83 of the GDPR states that:

“(83) In order to maintain security and prevent processing in breach of this Regulation, the controller or processor should assess the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate them, such as encryption. These measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of their implementation, in relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. When assessing the risk related to data security, the risks arising from the processing of personal data should be taken into account, such as the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or unauthorized disclosure of or access to such data, which may, in particular, cause physical, material or immaterial damage.”

CCC's liability is determined by the lack of security measures, as it is responsible for making decisions aimed at effectively implementing appropriate technical and organizational security measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk involved in protecting the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and ongoing resilience of the processing systems and services.

From the documentation in the proceedings, this lack of measures appropriate to the risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals can be inferred, given that the system allowed more than 7,000 different IP addresses from different network providers to be used for access, which led Carrefour to acquire a specific tool to detect anomalous patterns.

The lack of adequate measures is also evident in the Pentest audit reports, which confirmed deficiencies in the controls implemented in the information systems of the investigated entity, which compromised the confidentiality and integrity of the information, without implementing the recommendations contained therein.

The Pentest Report for the Carrefour website (Carrefour.es), conducted by ***EMPRESA.1, contains the following general recommendations and actions to be taken in the short term:

-(…).

Likewise, the Pentest Report for the Carrefour app for Android/iOS contains the following general recommendations on actions to be taken:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 51/62

“(…)”.

Specifically, in the audit conducted on the web channel (www.carrefour.es) between February 14, 2023, and March 3, 2023, (…).

The pentest report for the audit conducted on the web channel (www.carrefour.es) also includes the following vulnerabilities, among others:

(…)

The pentest report conducted on the Carrefour APP channel, between February 6, 2023, and February 9, 2023, includes the following vulnerabilities, among others:

 (…).

Regarding these three recommendations, Carrefour has stated that they were not implemented because “(…)”.

However, point 3 of the APP pentest report states that “(…)”.

Therefore, it follows from the foregoing that the technical and organizational security measures implemented by the entity do not constitute a level of security appropriate to the risk and are not adequate to prevent unauthorized access to customer data.

Consequently, the proven facts are considered to constitute an infringement, attributable to the entity under investigation, for violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, since it was aware of the existence of vulnerabilities that could compromise the integrity and confidentiality of personal data and did not adopt technical and organizational measures to prevent them. VIII
Classification and classification of the violation

The aforementioned violation of Article 32 of the GDPR entails the commission of the violations

classified in Article 83.4 of the GDPR, which, under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines," provides:

"Violations of the following provisions shall be sanctioned, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 10,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the total global annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

a) the obligations of the controller and the processor under Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39, 42, and 43; (...)"

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its Article 71 "Violations," establishes: that
"The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 52/62

5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute violations."

For the purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 73 "Infractions Considered Serious" of the LOPDGDD states:

"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular the following, are considered serious and will be subject to a two-year statute of limitations:

f) Failure to adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing, in accordance with the terms required by Article 32.1 of

Regulation (EU) 2016/679."

IX
Sanction

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:

“1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures provided for in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). When deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:

a) the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation that concerned, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them;

b) the intentionality or negligence of the breach;
c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects;
d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;
e) any previous breaches committed by the controller or processor;
f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate any adverse effects of the breach;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the breach, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the breach and, if so, to what extent;
i) where the measures referred to in Article 58(2) have been previously ordered against the controller or processor in question in relation to the same matter;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 53/62

compliance with such measures;

j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or to certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42;

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.

For its part, Article 76 "Sanctions and Corrective Measures" of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act) provides:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria established in section 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account:

a) The continuous nature of the infringement.
b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.

c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the infringement.
d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the commission of the infringement.
e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the acquiring entity.

f) The impact on the rights of minors.
g) Provide, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.
h) Voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.

According to the transcribed provisions, for the purposes of setting the amount of the penalty for a violation of Article 32 of the GDPR, the fine must be graduated taking into account:

The following are taken into account when graduating the penalty:

Article 83.2 a) GDPR: "the nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered";

Regarding the number of data subjects affected, the lack of security measures affects all customers of the Ecommerce web channel (carrefour.es) and the MiCarrefour application. This broad impact amplifies the severity of the violation, given that each customer is at risk of inadequate protection of their personal data.

Furthermore, regarding the duration of the violation, the lack of measures is understood to extend until November 8, 2024, the date of filing by Carrefour's response to the requested evidence, given that the technical or organizational measures necessary at least to resolve the detected problems had not been applied.

Article 83.2 b) GDPR: "Intentional or negligent infringement"

The Supreme Court has held that negligence exists whenever a legal duty of care is disregarded, that is, when the offender fails to behave with the required diligence. In assessing the degree of diligence, the professionalism of the individual must be especially considered. There is no doubt that, in the case now under review, when the defendant entity's activity involves constant and extensive handling of personal data, rigor and exquisite care must be emphasized to comply with the legal provisions. [Judgment of the National Court of 10/17/2007 (rec. 63/2006)].

The actions taken reveal insufficient existing security measures and a serious lack of diligence in managing the security of personal data.

This circumstance reflects a clear failure to comply with the data controller's duty to protect the security of its clients' data, which reinforces and amplifies the seriousness of the violation and, consequently, justifies the occurrence of this aggravating circumstance.

Article 76.2 b) LOPDGDD: "The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data"

The business activity of the investigated entity requires continuous processing of personal data. Furthermore, the company operates in a sector where trust and information security are essential, and for this reason, it has the responsibility to further guarantee the rigor of the data protection principles regarding the information it manages under this activity. The nature of this activity required greater rigor in the adoption of security measures, a requirement that was not met in the case at hand.

Considering the factors set forth, the fine is estimated at €1,000,000 for a violation of Article 32 of the GDPR.

X

Obligation breached. Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject.

Article 34 "Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject" of the GDPR establishes:

"1. Where a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the breach to the data subject without undue delay.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 55/62

2. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach and shall contain at least the information and measures referred to in Article 33(3)(b), (c) and (d).

3. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be required if any of the following conditions are met:

a) the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organizational protection measures, and those measures have been applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorized to access them, such as encryption;
(b) the controller has taken further measures to ensure that the high risk to the data subject's rights and freedoms referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialize;
(c) it entails a disproportionate effort. In this case, a public communication or similar measure shall be used instead, providing equally effective information to data subjects.

4. Where the controller has not yet notified the data subject of the personal data breach, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood that such a breach entails a high risk, may require the data subject to do so or may decide that one of the conditions mentioned in section 3 is met.

With regard to the first, second, and third personal data breaches, it should be noted that, although Carrefour has not proven that it notified the data subjects in accordance with the terms provided for in Article 34 of the GDPR, the potential breach, due to its absence, must be considered time-barred, pursuant to the provisions of Article 74 of the LOPDGDD.

Regarding the fourth and fifth personal data breaches, in the present case, it has been confirmed that a communication was sent on June 23, 2023, to 9,202 data subjects, and on September 11, 2023, to 10,959 affected, corresponding to the fourth and fifth security breaches, respectively.

Regarding the investigation carried out by this authority, the investigated entity itself states that it communicated via email, as well as through the push channel for customers available through this means. The content of the message sent was as follows:

"Dear customer:
To offer you better service, we have reset your password. To obtain a new one, request it at "Forgot your password?" when accessing the app or the website.

Regarding the content of this communication, Article 34.2 of the GDPR refers to Article 33 of the GDPR. Thus, the content is that contained in Article 33, paragraph 3, letters b), c), and d) of the GDPR, which establishes:

“3. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 must, at a minimum:

b) communicate the name and details of the data protection officer or other point of contact where further information can be obtained;
c) describe the possible consequences of the personal data breach;
d) describe the measures taken or proposed by the data controller to remedy the breach, including, where appropriate, the measures taken to mitigate any potential negative effects.”

In this case, the content of the communication sent does not meet the requirements set forth in Article 33.3 (b), (c), and (d) and Article 34.2 of the GDPR, since it refers to the fact that the password has been reset. This, for an average consumer reading the notice, may give an idea that there was a potential for a breach, but does not demonstrate a loss of confidentiality such as the one that occurred.

The wording of the communication does not adequately inform about the existence of a security breach, nor does it provide affected individuals with information about the nature of the security breach, the personal data affected, the consequences of the breach, measures taken or proposed to remedy the breach, measures to mitigate potential negative effects, or contact information for the DPO or other point of contact for additional information.

In this regard, it should be noted that Article 34.2 of the GDPR states that in The information provided to those affected will "describe the nature of the personal data breach in clear and simple language."

Consequently, the proven facts are considered to constitute an infringement, attributable to the entity investigated for violating Article 34 of the GDPR.

a) The continuous nature of the infringement.
b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.
c) The benefits obtained as a result of committing the infringement.
d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the commission of the infringement.
... e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the acquiring entity.
f) The violation of the rights of minors.
g) Having, when not mandatory, a data protection officer.
h) Voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, in cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.

The following factors are taken into account when graduating the penalty:

Article 83.2 a) GDPR: "the nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages and losses they have suffered";

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 59/62

The events have affected certain personal data, such as name, surname, email address, full postal address: postal code, stairway/floor/door, municipality, street name, street number, province, street type, Date of birth, the exposure of which increases the risk of misuse and fraud.

The number of affected data subjects is high, given that incomplete breach communications were sent on June 23, 2023, to 9,202 affected individuals, and on September 11, 2023, to 10,959 affected individuals, which

highlights both the scale of the incident and the considerable number of individuals whose
rights and freedoms were compromised. This widespread impact amplifies the
seriousness of the breach, given that each affected customer represents a potential
case of fraud, identity theft, or financial loss, exponentially multiplying the negative repercussions of the incident.

Furthermore, the breach is aggravated by the context in which it occurs, where
individuals trust the entity to securely handle their personal information,
having eroded the trust and expectations of those affected regarding the processing of their data. Personal data.

Article 83.2 b) GDPR: "Intentional or negligent infringement" - In compliance with its obligations under data protection regulations, Carrefour acted with gross negligence in providing the affected parties with all the information required by the aforementioned Article 34 of the GDPR, so that they could quickly take all necessary measures to protect themselves from the consequences of personal data breaches, taking into account, in addition, the considerable number of those affected, which constitutes an aggravating factor.

Article 76.2 b) LOPDGDD: "The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data"

The business activity of the investigated entity requires continuous processing of personal data. The company operates in a sector where trust and information security are essential, and for this reason, it has the responsibility to more rigorously guarantee the principles of data protection
regarding the information it manages under said activity.

Considering the factors set forth, the fine is estimated at €200,000 per violation of Article 34 of the GDPR.
