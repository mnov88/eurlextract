<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Authority (AEPD) against the telecommunication company Telefonica. The reasons on which the complaint was based were that the data subject's personal data had been used to contract, without knowledge or authorization, a Movistar service from March to October 2019 - when the line was cancelled due to non-payment.   
</p><p>The data subject indicated that they had been included in the credit information files for unrecognised debt. They also indicated that they had no relationship whatsoever with the contracted service or with the installation address of said services. Likewise, the data subject did not know how the debt collection company was able to locate them to their phone number.   
</p><p>During the investigation, the controller indicated that there was no copy of the documentation collected for the verification of the identity of the complainant, reason for which the cancellation was made of the contracted services, as well as the cancellation of all the invoices issued in the data subject's name.  
</p><p>Telefónica confirmed that this incident could possibly have been caused due to identity theft and that all necessary actions were carried out to regularise the situation proceeding to cancel the debt and request the exclusion of the complainant from the assets insolvency files in which it had been included. Telefónica advised that during 2020, it had implemented several organisational and technical measures in order to prevent recurrence of incidents of this type. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA alleged that the controller had not been diligent enough and had not implemented adequate measures to prevent identity theft. This had led to an impossibility, in this case, to exhibit proof of the calls with the initial contractor and the identification they provided.   
</p><p>Therefore, the DPA argues that the lack of diligence and the impossibility to present proof constitutes a breach of the accountability principle, and hence imply that there is no justification for the controller to process personal data without a legal basis, as the violation derives from a lack of diligence and the non-compliance with its proactive responsibility obligation. Therefore, the AEPD concluded that the controller had violated Article 6(1)GDPR, for processing personal data without a legal basis.  
</p><p>Hence, the AEPD decided to fine Telefónica for the violation of Article 6(1)GDPR €75,000, that were reduced to €45,000 for prompt payment and admission of responsibility.

                             FOUNDATIONS OF LAW




                                              I




        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate

and to solve this procedure.




                                              II



      The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the

treatment of personal data and mentions among them that of "legality, loyalty and
transparency". The precept provides:



      "1. The personal data will be:

         a) Treaties in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner with the interested party; "




        Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:



         "1. The treatment will only be lawful if it complies with at least one of the following
terms:


      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
      personal for one or more specific purposes;

      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
      pre-contractual;


      (…) "



      The offense for which the claimed person is responsible is typified in
Article 83 of the RGPD which, under the heading "General conditions for taxation
of administrative fines ”, it states:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/14










      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Eur or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:



      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "



       Organic Law 3/2018, on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions

considered very serious ”provides:



      "1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)

2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that one and, in
in particular, the following:




        (…)

       b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
       conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the

       Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "



       It must be taken into account that the documentation in the file
offers evidence that the defendant violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since
processed the personal data of the claimant without standing to do so.




       Well, the defendant recognizes the possible identity theft in a
hiring carried out on channel 1004. Now, he states that he does not have the
recording, nor does it contain a copy of the documentation collected for the
verification of the identity of the claimant.




       They also indicate that they have canceled the debt and requested the exclusion of the
insolvency files, and that they have adopted a series of measures aimed at improving
the identity verification system, some applied as early as 2020, and

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/14








others in development.



        The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the

Obligations imposed by the personal data protection regulations
It is thus evident. A diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the treatment
of third-party data requires that the person responsible for the treatment is in conditions
to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).






                                                III





      In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions

        applied by virtue of articles 25 and 32;

        e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
        treatment;

         f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to establish

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/14








        g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

        h) the way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement,
        in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such
        case, to what extent;


        i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
        previously ordered against the person responsible or the person in charge
        in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;

        j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or to mechanisms
        certification approved in accordance with Article 42, and

        k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the

        case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct
        or indirectly, through the infringement. "


              Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD,
        Article 76, "Sanctions and corrective measures", provides:

      "two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
         The following may also be taken into account:


        a) The continuing nature of the offense.

        b) The linking of the activity of the offender with the performance of treatments
        of personal data.

        c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the offense.

      assumptions in which there are controversies between those and any interested party. "

              In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results
      of the instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the sanction of
      fine to impose on the claimed person as responsible for an offense typified in the

      Article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, in an initial assessment, they are considered concurrent in the
      present case, as aggravating factors, the following factors:

      - The duration of the illegitimate treatment of the data of the affected party carried out by the
