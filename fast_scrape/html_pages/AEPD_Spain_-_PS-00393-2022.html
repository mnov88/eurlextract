<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 21 December 2021 a claim against INFINITY ECOM S.L. (the controller) was filed with the Spanish DPA, claiming that the company's privacy and cookie policy was not compliant. The Spanish DPA launched an investigation and confirmed the following facts:
</p><p>Firstly, the Privacy Policy of the company informed data subjects about their rights to access, alter, delete data and request information about processing and existence of data transfers to third countries. An email address to request this information was also provided. However, the privacy policy lacked information identifying the controller and did not inform data subjects about the possibility to file complaints.
</p><p>Secondly, the website imposed unnecessary performance and targeting cookies without the consent of the data subject. There was no Cookie Policy. Only an information banner, that the company uses Cookies was provided. It was therefore not possible to reject the use of non-technical cookies.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA held the controller to have infringed <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a> and Article 22.2 of the Law of Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce (<i>Ley de Servicios de la Sociedad de la Información y Comercio Electrónico – LSSI</i>). 
</p><p>First, the Spanish DPA found that the Privacy Policy to be insufficient and therefore violate <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR.</a> The policy did not adequately inform data subjects on the processing of their data nor provide proper identification of the controller. 
</p><p>Second, the Spanish DPA held that information banner on cookies infringed Article 22.2. of the LSSI. There was no possibility for data subjects to reject the non-essential cookies and insufficient information about their use was provided.
</p><p>The Spanish DPA imposed a fine of €5,000 for each infringment, resulting in an overall fine of €10,000. The controller was given a month to adapt the website and bring it into compliance.

                                   Administrative violation


Of the deficiencies detected, regarding the cookie policy, on the website in
issue: the use of third-party cookies that are not technical or necessary; the
impossibility of rejecting third-party cookies and the lack of information in the
“cookie policy”, could be assumed by the complainant, the commission of the
violation of article 22.2 of the LSSI, as it establishes that:


       “Service providers may use storage devices and
       data recovery on recipients' terminal equipment, provided
       that they have given their consent after they have been
       provided clear and complete information on its use, in particular on
       the purposes of data processing, in accordance with the provisions of the Law

       Organic 15/1999, protection of personal data.

       Where technically possible and effective, the consent of the recipient
       to accept the processing of the data may be facilitated through the use of the
       appropriate settings of the browser or other applications.


       The above will not prevent possible storage or access of a technical nature
       for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over a network of
       electronic communications or, to the extent strictly necessary
       necessary, for the provision of an information society service

       expressly requested by the recipient.”

This Infraction is classified as “minor” in article 38.4 g) of the aforementioned Law, which
considers as such: “Use data storage and recovery devices
when the information has not been provided or the consent of the
recipient of the service in the terms required by article 22.2.”, and may be

sanctioned with a fine of up to €30,000, in accordance with article 39 of the aforementioned
LSSI.

After the evidence obtained, it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed.
in accordance with the following aggravating criteria, established by art. 40 of the LSSI:


       The existence of intentionality, an expression that must be interpreted as
       equivalent to degree of guilt according to the Judgment of the
       National Court of 11/12/07 relapsed in Appeal no. 351/2006,
       corresponding to the reported entity the determination of a system of

       obtaining informed consent that is appropriate to the mandate of the LSSI.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 17/18
