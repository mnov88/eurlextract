<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>Due to formal reasons, the Spanish Data Protection Authority (AEPD) decided to admit a claim against Asturias Healthcare System (the controller) for not satisfying a data subject's access request to medical records of data subject’s deceased mother, but without any economic fine nor warning, because, during the AEPD's investigation process, such right of access was finally fulfilled by the public administration.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Might be a request of access considered as duly fulfilled by the controller when it was not attended in due time and proper course?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Spanish DPA held that the access request was properly fulfilled, in spite of being properly attended after claim admission, so it decided not to impose any fine nor warning to the defendant.
