<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen (the claimant) stating that he had requested his right to erasure to the defendant, but that he did not receive any kind of answer.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD requested the defendant to grant or to reasonably deny such right to erasure to the claimant within a period of ten days. The defendant did not answer any requirements of the AEPD, so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>Thus, the AEPD understood that the defendant has infringed Article 58(2) GDPR, as it did not give any answer to the claimant when he requested his right to erasure, nor it followed the request of the AEPD. Consequently, after considering some circumstances [(i) there is a wilful misconduct by the defendant, and (ii) basic personal data have been affected], the AEPD decided to impose a fine of € 2000  to the defendant.

                                                 III

       The RGPD deals in its article 58 with the powers of each control authority. The
section 1.a) provides:


       "1. Each supervisory authority will have all the powers of investigation indicated
then:


       a) order the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment and, where appropriate, the representative
of the person in charge or the person in charge, who provide any information required for the
performance of their duties.


       The offense for which the claimed entity is responsible is classified
in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading “General conditions for the imposition of
administrative fines ”, it states:

       "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the

section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of 20,000,000 Euros or, in the case of
a company, of an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total turnover
annual global of the previous financial year, opting for the highest amount:

treatment or suspension of data flows by the supervisory authority with

   to the claimed party, urging it to, within the following ten business days, send
   certification to the claimant stating that he has complied with the right to erasure
   exercised by the latter, or is reasonedly denied indicating the reasons for which the

   requested deletion, however, it has not been verified that any of the
   the two senses.

          It must be stated that the claim was transferred to the claimed party on
   January and April 4, 2019, with January 25 and April 5 as the acceptance date

   of the same year.

          On July 24, 2019, compliance with said
