<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The controller, a private entity, operated as a SARS-CoV-19 test station. The legal basis for the processing of personal data of individuals for the purpose of carrying out SARS-CoV-2 self-testing procedures is <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(c) GDPR</a> (the necessity to comply with a legal obligation) and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR" title="Article 9 GDPR">Article 9(2)(h) GDPR</a>, in conjunction with Article 14c of the Act on Databases in the Field of Healthcare (Zakon o zbirkah podatkov s področja zdravstvenega varstva - ZZPPZ).  
</p><p>While a contractual relationship existed between the data subject and the the person ordering the testing, the ZZPPZ establishes the obligation to transfer the data to the Central Register of Patients' Data (CRPP) for the purpose of carrying out the testing for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. According to Article 14č of the ZZPPZ, the information shall be transferred to the CRPP as soon as it arises or is received in the course of the provision of health care, but at the latest by the end of the working day. 
</p><p>The data subjects were not aware of these data transfers.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA held that by not informing data subjects of the data transfers, the controller had violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a>. Therefore, the DPA ordered the controller to provide all the information referred to in <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13(1)</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13(2) GDPR</a> in a concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible form and in clear and plain language. This should be done in the usual manner of notification, such as a general notice on a notice board at their premises or before entering the facility where the testing is carried out, or on the controller's website.
</p><p>The DPA also found that the controller had a legal basis to obtain the name, mobile telephone number and health card number or health insurance card details of each individual who came for a test, as it was required to provide this information to the CRPP. The DPA, however, found that the controller did not have a legal basis for collecting email addresses from all persons tested, but only from those who wanted to be contacted by email or for another purpose under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(a) GDPR</a>.

II. IP findings and reasons for ordering an inspection measure:

During the inspection procedure, the liable party was reminded that he had to tell the truth in the procedure before the IP. Following the explanations received from the taxpayer, in view of the established facts in the subject control procedure, IP finds that the taxpayer adequately ensured the security of personal data when conducting self-paid testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The legal basis for the processing of personal data of individuals for the purpose of conducting self-paid testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus is Article 6 (1) (c) of the General Regulation - processing is necessary to fulfill the legal obligation of the controller and point (h) Article 9 (2) of the General Decree in connection with Article 14č of the Health Care Databases Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 65/00, as amended, hereinafter: ZZPPZ). A contractual relationship is established between the liable party and the individual or client of the test to whom the liable party issues an invoice for the provided health service, but the ZZPPZ stipulates the obligation to provide data to the Central Register of Patient Data (hereinafter).&#160;: CRPP). In accordance with the fifth paragraph of Article 14c of the ZZPPZ, the data is transmitted to the CRPP as soon as it is generated or received during the provision of health care, but no later than the end of the working day.

The National Institute of Public Health has prepared instructions for testing providers Reporting the results of COVID-19 tests to the Central Register of Patient Data (CRPP), Methodological and technical instructions for users, which are published on the NIJZ website. The following information must be entered (page 15):

 ZZZS number of the insured person or EMŠO (in the case of a foreign insured person TZO or ZZZS number starting with 7), if the person does not have ZZZS number or EMŠO, the local identifier determined by the information system of the test provider is used;
 date of birth of the patient (can be filled in automatically from the source ZZZS or CRPP / RPPE),
 name and surname of the patient (can be filled in automatically from the source ZZZS or CRPP / RPPE),
 address and country of residence in the case of an alien,
 mobile number of the patient, if the patient provides it (optionally without a number only for justified cases, eg caregivers in social welfare institutions. NIJZ draws special attention to the importance of entering the correct number),
 indicator informing the patient through the national system: 1 - informing the patient, 2 - informing the patient
the entry point itself, 3 - the patient does not allow notification by SMS,
 test indication,
 date of sampling,
 presence of symptoms (in case of DA, the start date is also indicated),
 epidemiological history (close contact with an infected person in the last 14 days),
 type (type) of test.

All healthcare providers must submit the results to the CRPP. The taxpayer explained that the data collected from individuals for the purpose of conducting self-paid testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus using the PCR form (name, surname, e-mail address and mobile phone number) is stored for up to… hours, then cut and that with a special device it scans the card or the contents of the health insurance for entering data into the information system…, and then the data is transmitted to ... Data obtained by the taxpayer by scanning or on the basis of PCR form .

Based on the above, IP found that the taxpayer had a legal basis to obtain from each individual who came to the test, name and surname, mobile phone number and health card number or data from the health insurance card, because this information had to intervene in the CRPP. IP also found that the taxpayer did not have a legal basis for collecting e-mail addresses from all tested persons, but only from those who wanted to communicate the test results to them by e-mail or contact them for another purpose (legal basis for consent ( Article 6 (1) (a) of the General Regulation - the data subject has consented to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes).

The purposes of personal data processing were achieved when the data subject entered personal data in the CRPP and when the tested individuals were informed about the test results. It should be emphasized that the taxpayer no longer keeps or disposes of personal data of individuals after… hours, nor does he have the possibility to access the personal data of the individual after the testing procedure or the completion of the latter.

In the information on the processing of personal data, the data subject must clarify which personal data he collects on the basis of contract and law and which on the basis of consent and the purpose of their collection, the retention period and all other information under Article 13 of the General Regulation.

With regard to the above, the taxpayer will have to inform or supplement the content of the form guaranteeing the right to information in accordance with Article 13 of the General Regulation in such a way that the information will be granulated or broken down for personal data processing or data required by Article 13 of the General Regulation. , be included in that PCR form in such a way that all the information in accordance with Article 13 of the General Regulation, as described above, is visible.

The taxpayer may also be assisted by the form "Model notification to individuals regarding the processing of personal data (Article 13 of the General Regulation)", which can be found on the IP website: https://www.ip-rs.si/obrazci/varstvo-osebnih -data /.

The data subject must inform individuals about the rights to information in accordance with Article 13 of the General Regulation before collecting personal data (acquisition, access, transmission or any other processing of personal data), giving such notice by publishing it on the PCR form before entering the facility or on the debtor's website.

This means that the taxpayer must indicate as a legal basis for the collection of all data except the electronic address, Article 6 (1) (c) of the General Regulation - processing is necessary to fulfill the legal obligation applicable to the controller and point (h) of Article 9 2) General regulations in connection with Article 14č of the ZZPPZ.

However, in the case of the processing of an individual's e-mail address, the consent of the individual is required (Article 6 (1) (a) of the General Regulation - the data subject has consented to the processing of his personal data for one or more specified purposes). voluntary, specific, informed and unambiguous.
