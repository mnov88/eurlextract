<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>On 19/03/2019 the AEPD obtained knowledge from an amplification of a report from the Judicial Police Brigade, UDEV group, of a presumed crime of fraud, where two hundred and ninety-five photographs of contracts of companies and contract type forms were intervened. In this regard, a claim was sent to A.A.A for to provide information to the AEPD (clarifying aspects like legitimate cause of the data processing, purpose or aims of the processing, the origin of the personal data processed and the measures adopted to prevent the commission of an infringement of the data protection regulation).
</p><p>On 22//05/2019, A.A.A submitted a written reply to the request, stating that some of the alleged documentation (the one belonging to the companies Distritohogar and Grupo Confort Editorial) was being transported in his vehicle to be destroyed, in accordance with article 32.1 of the GDPR. In words of the written reply, the legitimacy of the data processing was supported by the execution of a contract and, in its absence, the unequivocal consent of the interested parties.  As regards to the purpose, the personal data was being processed for the management of orders of products. In relation with the origin of the data, it was stated that these were obtained from accessible sources to the public and the interested party itself. Finally, with regard to the security measures adopted, the controller stated that technical and organizational measures had been taken to ensure the appropriate use and processing of personal data (only the controller has access to the personal data, given his professional relationship with the companies as a self-employed freelancer).
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Can A.A.A’s actions constitute a violation of article 6 of the GDPR (lack of legal basis for the processing of personal data)?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>Firstly the AEPD decided to initiate a sanctioning procedure against the A.A.A for an alleged violation of article 6 of the GDPR typified as an infringement of basic principles for processing in article 83.5 GDPR.
</p><p>In determining the amount of the fine, the following aspects were taken into consideration: the merely local scope of the processing carried out by the A.A.A, the fact that numerous people have been affected by the infringing conduct, the fact that the actions were aimed at elderly people (whose defense capacity is minor), the negligent character of the actions and the fact that A.A.A is a natural person. These considerations led to the determination of the amount of the fine in EUR 6000.
</p><p>However, two attenuating circumstances of the Spanish Law on Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (Article 85) can be applied, which may respectively reduce the fine by 20%. The first mitigating factor is to acknowledge the responsibility within the time allowed for the submission of claims. The second mitigating factor is, at any time prior to the resolution of the proceedings, to make voluntary payment of the proposed penalty. 
In this sense, on 03//03/2020 A.A.A proceeded to pay the sanction in the amount of EUR 3600, applying therefore the two previously mentioned reductions. This implied the recognition of their responsibility and the resignation to any action or appeal in administrative channels against the sanction.  After these events, the AEPD decided to terminate the procedure.
