<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A package from Carrefour was to be delivered to the data subject's address. In case the data subject was not at home, they gave the permission to deliver their package to their neighbour. However, the package was delivered to someone else. 
</p><p>As the controller, Carrefour has a contract with a processor responsible for deliveries, Fourth Party Logistics SL. In this contract, it is established that the processor should notify the controller in case of contracting a subprocessor. Even though a subprocessor did the delivery, Carrefour was not notified of the existence of any subprocessor. 
</p><p>The processor (Fourth Party Logistics SL) explained that there were two subprocessors involved in the delivery, Envialiva World SL. and The Bee Logstics SL, however no contract between these parties was presented to the DPA. The processor Fourth Party Logistics SL did not comply with their contract with the controller and there were no formal agreements with the subprocessors.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA held that there was enough evidence to start a sanctioning procedure. Especially considering the lack of legally binding instruments between the processor and the subprocessors involved in the delivery of a package to the data subject. Considering that the subprocessor had to process personal data controlled by Carrefour, there was a breach of the GDPR. 
</p><p>With this, the Spanish DPA established that a possible fine of €90,000 could be imposed for the breach of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR" title="Article 28 GDPR">Articles 28(2)</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR" title="Article 28 GDPR">28(3)</a> of the GDPR. The data processor decided to finalize the procedure by paying the reduced fine of €72,000, which implies admitting the breach of the data protection rules.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>This case shows how processors (and not only controllers) can be held responsible for their failure to comply with Article 28 GDPR.

Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.


Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with a

                           Possible administrative violation.

Article 4 of the GDPR, points 7 and 8, specifies what should be understood by
responsible for the treatment and in charge of the treatment. So we have, like:


       “7) “responsible for the treatment” or “responsible” is the natural person or
       legal entity, public authority, service or other body that, alone or together with others,
       determine the purposes and means of the processing; If the law of the Union or of the
       Member States determine the purposes and means of the processing, the controller

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/15








       of the treatment or the specific criteria for its appointment may
       establish them by the law of the Union or of the Member States;


       8) "processor" or "processor" is the natural or legal person,
       public authority, service or other body that processes personal data for
       account of the person responsible for the treatment;..”

In short, the person responsible for the treatment is the natural or legal person or authority
public, which decides on the processing of personal data, determining the

purposes and means of said processing.

Under the principle of proactive responsibility, the data controller
must apply technical and organizational measures to, in response to the risk that
involves the processing of personal data, complying with and being able to demonstrate the

compliance.

For its part, the person in charge of the treatment is the natural or legal person, authority
public, service or other body that provides a service to the person responsible that entails
the processing of personal data on its behalf.


In this sense, the person responsible is the one who decides the “why” and “how” relative to the
personal data and the person in charge is the one who is responsible for carrying out the processing
position of the person responsible.

The figure of the person in charge of treatment in the RGPD is defined in its article 28, where

The requirements that must be met regarding data protection are established:
1.When treatment is to be carried out on behalf of a person responsible for the
treatment, this will only choose a manager who offers sufficient guarantees
to apply appropriate technical and organizational measures, so that the
treatment complies with the requirements of this Regulation and ensures the

protection of the rights of the interested party.
2.The person in charge of the treatment will not resort to another person in charge without prior authorization
in writing, specific or general, from the person responsible. In the latter case, the manager
will inform the person responsible of any planned change in the incorporation or
replacement of other managers, thus giving the person in charge the opportunity to oppose
to these changes.

3.The treatment by the processor will be governed by a contract or other legal act with
under the law of the Union or of the Member States, binding the person in charge
regarding the person responsible and establishes the object, duration, nature and
purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of interested parties, and the
obligations and rights of the person in charge. Said contract or legal act shall stipulate, in

particular, that the person in charge:

a) will process personal data only following documented instructions from the
responsible, including with respect to transfers of personal data to a
third country or an international organization, unless obliged to do so under

of Union or Member State law applicable to the processor; in
In such case, the person in charge will inform the person responsible of that legal requirement prior to the
treatment, unless such Law prohibits it for important reasons of interest
public;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/15









b) will ensure that the persons authorized to process personal data have
committed to respecting confidentiality or are subject to an obligation to

confidentiality of a statutory nature;

c) take all necessary measures in accordance with article 32;

d) will respect the conditions indicated in sections 2 and 4 to resort to another
treatment manager;


e) will assist the person responsible, taking into account the nature of the treatment, through
appropriate technical and organizational measures, whenever possible, so that this
can fulfill its obligation to respond to requests that are intended
the exercise of the rights of interested parties established in Chapter III;


f) will help the person responsible to ensure compliance with obligations
established in articles 32 to 36, taking into account the nature of the treatment
and the information available to the person in charge;

g) at the discretion of the controller, delete or return all personal data once

once the provision of treatment services is completed, and will delete copies
existing unless the retention of personal data is required under
of the law of the Union or of the Member States;

h) will make available to the person responsible all the information necessary to demonstrate

compliance with the obligations established in this article, as well as
to enable and assist in the performance of audits, including inspections, by
part of the person in charge or of another auditor authorized by said person in charge.

In relation to the provisions of letter h) of the first paragraph, the person in charge shall inform

immediately to the controller if, in their opinion, an instruction violates this
Regulation or other provisions on data protection of the Union or of
the member states.

4. When a person in charge of the treatment uses another person in charge to carry out
certain treatment activities on behalf of the person in charge, will be imposed on

this other person in charge, by means of a contract or other legal act established in accordance with the
Law of the Union or of the Member States, the same obligations of
data protection than those stipulated in the contract or other legal act between the
responsible and the person in charge referred to in section 3, in particular the provision
of sufficient guarantees of application of appropriate technical and organizational measures

so that the treatment is in accordance with the provisions of this
Regulation. If that other person in charge breaches his data protection obligations,
the initial processor will remain fully accountable to the controller

data protection, without prejudice to the control that may be carried out in relation to


C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/15








with compliance with the RGPD or the LOPDGDD by the person in charge or the
treatment manager.

In accordance with the provisions of article 28 GDPR, the person in charge and the person in charge
of data processing must regulate the processing of data in a contract or act

legal linking the person in charge with respect to the person in charge; that contract or legal act
must establish the object, duration, nature and purpose of the treatment, the
type of personal data and categories of interested parties, the obligations and rights of the
responsible etc

The person in charge of the treatment, in turn, may resort to another person in charge

(“sub-processor”) provided that you have the prior written authorization of the
responsible for the treatment, either a specific or general authorization. In these
cases, the person in charge is obliged to inform the person responsible for the
changes in the incorporation or substitution of other managers, so that said
person responsible can oppose such changes.


The relationship that links the person responsible for the treatment and the person in charge, or the latter and another
commissioned, must be formalized in writing, including in electronic format. In
Both cases must be imposed on the person in charge or “sub-processor” the same
obligations referred to in section 3 of article 28 transcribed.


In the present case, EW explains that:

“- Envialia World has a transport and courier contract with Fourth Party
Logistics. - Fourth Party Logistics subcontracts the services of Fourth Party Services.
- Envialia World puts its transportation network at the service of Fourth Party Services to
that carries out the provision of the service.

- Fourth Party Logistics has a verbal courier contract with The Bee Logistics,
company that it identifies as a "charging agency" and that would be responsible for the
delivery of the package.”

A copy of a service contract between SHOPPING CENTERS is provided
CARREFOUR SA with NIF A28425270 (as a client, although his signature does not appear) and

FOURTH PARTY LOGISTICS SL with NIF B86496007 (as carrier), for
delivery of goods at home, in whose section on data protection
declares that the first is responsible, and the second in charge, of the treatment of the
personal information.

Said contract expressly establishes that "...In those cases in which the

subcontracted service involves access or processing of personal data
owned by CARREFOUR by the subcontracted company on
CARRIER must guarantee that the subcontracting is carried out in
compliance with the provisions of the applicable legislation and, in particular, with the provisions
in the Personal Data Protection regulations.


In the event that authorized subcontractors have access to personal data
responsibility of CARREFOUR, will act as sub-manager of the treatment,
the following being applicable:


C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/15








• The CARRIER will notify CARREFOUR of the identity of the sub-manager before
to proceed with subcontracting;
• The processing of data by the sub-processor must comply with the
CARREFOUR instructions; and
• The CARRIER and the sub-manager will sign a contract/clause that

in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection regulations.

 The CARRIER will notify CARREFOUR of the execution of this contract with the
sub-manager and will provide you with a copy if you so request..."

EW states that between FOURTH PARTY LOGISTICS SL and THE BEE LOGISTICS SL

there is a verbal service contract, but it is not accredited.

It is evident that between ENVIALIA WORLD SL, FOURTH PARTY SERVICES SL and
FOURTH PARTY LOGISTICS SL there are contractual relationships; although it has not been
provided documentation thereof.


Consequently, FOURTH PARTY LOGISTICS SL, ENVIALIA WORLD SL, FOURTH
PARTY SERVICES SL, and THE BEE LOGISTICS SL would necessarily have to
also process personal data; although, FOURTH PARTY
LOGISTICS SL would do so in its capacity as data processor and ENVIALIA
WORLD S.L., FOURTH PARTY SERVICES SL and THE BEE LOGISTICS SL., as

sub-managers thereof.

Analyzing the relationship of the different participants, it is evident that the
subcontracting does not comply with the provisions of data protection regulations
in force, due to the lack of formalization of contracts or legal acts, as well as the
lack of authorizations prior to their formalization.


In accordance with the evidence available in this agreement of
initiation of the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction, it is considered that the known facts could constitute a
infringement, attributable to FOURTH PARTY LOGISTICS SL for violation of the
articles 28.2 and 28.3 of the GDPR.
