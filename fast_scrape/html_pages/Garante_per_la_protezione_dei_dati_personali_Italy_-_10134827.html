<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The Association of Psychologists of Lumbardy (the controller) suffered a data breach following a ransomware attack carried out by the criminal group NoEscape. The incident involved unauthorized access to the Order’s IT network, data encryption, and deletion of backups, which were later recovered. The attackers also managed to exfiltrate approximately 7 GB of data and published them on the dark web after the controller refused to pay the ransom. The published dataset included a broad range of data: in particular, it included personal details, payment details, documents covered by professional secrecy, data relating to criminal convictions and offences under Articles 10 GDPR, and a broad range of special categories of data under Article 9 GDPR.
</p><p>The controller notified the DPA of the breach, prompting an investigation.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA found that the absence of automated monitoring and alerting systems prevented the detection of suspicious activities (e.g., nighttime logins, logins from foreign IP addresses, and the deactivation of security measures). Furthermore, the Controller had not implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA), was using an outdated operating system, and did not adequately protect credentials.
</p><p>For the reasons above, the DPA found that the Controller had violated Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) GDPR by failing to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of data processing.
</p><p>Contrary to the controller's arguments, the DPA also held that economic constraints cannot justify insufficient safeguards: while costs may influence the choice of tools, they can never reduce the minimum level of protection required under the GDPR.
</p><p>The DPA fined the controller €30,000. In deciding the amount, the DPA considered that the breach was severe and involved very sensitive data such as personal identification numbers, data covered by Articles 9 and 10 GDPR, and other information covered by professional secrecy. However, the DPA also considered that the controller promptly reported the breach and later implemented more robust security measures.
</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="In_particular:_on_Agid_guidelines">In particular: on Agid guidelines</span></h5>
<p>One specific argument from the controller is of particular interest. In its defense, the controller pointed out that its security measures fulfilled the guidelines of Agid<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> (i.e. the Agency for Digital Italy, a government body tasked with promoting the adoption of digital technologies in both the public and private sectors). On this ground, the controller claimed that it complied with its security obligations.
</p><p>The DPA rejected the argument. In this regard, the DPA held Agid guidelines are, at best, a useful point of reference: following them does not, in and of itself, entail compliance with the GDPR's security obligations. Furthermore, the DPA pointed out that the specific guidelines invoked by the controller were quite outdated.

On October 19, 2023, the Order of Psychologists of the Lombardy Region (hereinafter, the "Order") notified the Authority, pursuant to Article 33 of the Regulation, of a personal data breach that occurred on October 3, 2023, concerning "unauthorized access to the computer network, data encryption on servers, and data deletion from NAS backups" (see notification of October 19, section F, point 8).

Subsequently, on November 20, 2023, the Order supplemented the aforementioned notification, declaring that it had been the victim of “a sophisticated ransomware attack by the criminal association NoEscape [which] resulted in unauthorized access to the Order’s IT network, data encryption and the subsequent deletion of backups which were however subsequently recovered […] on 10.10.2023 when the Owner became aware of the “malicious” source of the anomalies found in the previous days, […] following the receipt of an email from csirt@pec.acn.gov.it indicating the reference to a link on Onion which redirected to a page where the publication of 7GB of data was threatened […]. Subsequently, following the failure to pay the ransom, cybercriminals published the exfiltrated data on the dark web on October 18 and October 31, 2023.

The Order stated that it can "exclude any loss of data integrity and availability [since] all archives have been fully restored thanks to backups performed in [a provider's] cloud and the presence of backups on external USB drives stored in a safe. Furthermore, [...] the malicious agent was able to encrypt and exfiltrate only 6.9 GB (compressed to 4.5 GB): this amount is only a small amount compared to the overall size and volume of data contained in the Order's archives, which corresponds to hundreds of GB, which were not impacted. In fact, only a few folders containing files were impacted, not all of them. […] Furthermore, the Data Controller has no evidence that cybercriminals have accessed data other than that published on the dark web, and in their communications, these criminals have always referred solely to the data subsequently published on the dark web” (see notification of November 20, section F, point 7 and G, point 1.4).

The Order also stated that 3,000 data subjects were involved in the cyberattack and that the “impact of the breach […] is high, with exclusive reference to the data of [data subjects involved in] […] disciplinary proceedings and the persons cited in those proceedings, which represent only a very limited portion of the breached data”—quantifying such proceedings at 159, “most of which concern the last two years”—while “for other, older proceedings, the documentation concerns only the parties involved and the measure adopted.” The Order, however, held “with respect to the employees and the sole three collaborators of the Data Controller whose identity documents were exfiltrated, […] that the severity [was] medium” (see notification of November 20, 2023, section F, point 13, and G, point 3).

The documentation in the file shows that the breach involved approximately 15,000 records of personal data, including personal details, contact details, payment details, and information relating to identity/recognition documents covered by professional secrecy, as well as data belonging to special categories (see Article 9 of the Regulation and Article 2-sexies of the Code), such as data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, sexual life or sexual orientation, health status, as well as data relating to criminal convictions and offenses (see Article 10 of the Regulation and Article 2-octies of the Code). This resulted in the data subjects being exposed, as assessed by the Order and declared in the notifications of the breach, to risks of loss of control of the data, discrimination, identity theft, fraud, damage to reputation, and knowledge by unauthorized third parties. authorized and significant economic and social damages.

Regarding the measures in place at the time of the violation, the Order stated that it carried out "constant checks on updates to the operating systems of server and client workstations, the firmware of network devices [and that it adopted a] properly configured and monitored authentication system, antivirus software […] on all workstations, local backups on two NAS devices located at the two locations, a cloud backup […] no. 5 USB HDDs in a safe at the headquarters […] and two USB HDDs stored in a safe at the bank" (see notification dated October 19, 2023, section F, point 9). Furthermore, the Order "had adopted the following measures: (i) firmware for network devices, (ii) properly configured and monitored authentication system, (iii) antivirus endpoint reset on all workstations, (iv) local backups on two NAS devices located at the two locations, (v) a cloud backup with [a third-party provider], (vi) no. 5 USB HDs in a safe at the Owner's office and two USB HDs kept in a safety deposit box at the institution's bank [...]; a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for connecting to the Order's systems. All these measures were constantly monitored and updated." The Order detailed these measures in a note dated January 19, 2024 (pp. 2–4).

Regarding the measures adopted following the breach, the Order stated that it "took action to better understand what happened and recover the backup copies (physical and cloud) of the data residing on its servers [having] promptly involved [a third-party provider] in the restoration activities […] and proceeded to (i) disable all firewall rules that allowed external access to the terminal server machine XX containing the Register of Psychologists' software, (ii) block all active VPNs and add rules that blocked all traffic to and from the network from 9:00 PM to 7:00 AM, (iii) change the password starting from the domain server and then on the ESX servers containing the virtual machines. In the meantime, a new virtual machine had already been created on which backup software was installed […]. Once the operation was completed, the virtual server acting as Domain Controller was restored using a backup copy on a physical disk locked in a safe with a backup date of July 31, 2023. Thanks to some cloud backups at [a third-party provider] and some physical backup disks in a safe and in the safety deposit box at the Order's reference bank, the Owner was able to restore the data by recovering the deleted data thanks to the cloud and physical backups, bringing the situation back to the day before the attack. Therefore, the loss of data availability and integrity was only temporary thanks to the completed recovery activities. Furthermore, […] tests were [then] carried out in order to understand the anomalies found and the nature of the event [by installing] specific monitoring software on all machines, including its own servers. Subsequently, [we] proceeded to 1. successfully restore the data, also allowing the use of cloud applications; 2. restore the XX server, i.e. the Owner's file server; 3. realign the PCs of users who were not present in the previous days, recover the NAS backups present on site, change the passwords of new users; 4. after having obtained confirmation [from the third-party supplier] regarding the fact that, once all the data had been copied, the Owner could proceed with the deletion of the encrypted files, (i) delete the encrypted files from the server at the Casa della Psicologia after copying them to the NAS, and (ii) start the creation of a new virtual machine on the ESX server of the Casa della Psicologia. When the data were published on the dark web, the Data Controller carried out online verification activities, including on the dark web, attempting to identify the possible presence of data attributable to the archives subject to encryption and deletion and to reconstruct the impacted personal data” (see notification of 20 November 2023, section H, point 1).

In relation to the technical and organizational measures adopted to prevent similar violations in the future, the Order declared that "after having restored the data and deleted the encrypted copies [...] it implemented measures such as: (i) the creation of VPN accesses with certificates in place of the old local users, (ii) carrying out functional tests, and (iii) modifying the connection rules of VPN users on the Order's network, limiting their access to only the necessary servers. Furthermore, the new backup agent [...] was installed on the XX server and the backup was reconfigured both on the cloud [...] and on the 4 NAS [...] [.The Order] is adopting a new cloud application for managing the register of members of the order and is evaluating the purchase of an application that, in addition to collecting log files, also performs analysis functions and provides for the sending of alerts to the ADS [...] [.The] Data Controller's IT representatives have restored all the archives and are preparing a plan to optimize the appropriate measures that were already in place at the The Order's IT structure has been upgraded by adopting more stringent measures regarding sensitive data categories, such as the adoption of a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system and archive encryption. The adoption of monitoring software […to] identify potentially critical situations and alert the ADS, as well as a solution that ensures the integrity of on-site backups and rapid data recovery, in addition to the measures already adopted […]” (see notification dated November 20, 2023, section H, point 2).

Regarding the notification of the breach to the interested parties, the Order, in its supplementary notification, stated that it would communicate the breach to the interested parties “by November 24, 2023 […] for the whistleblowers/reported persons and individuals cited in the proceedings” and that it would also communicate the breach “for the benefit of the employees and the three collaborators cited above as a precautionary measure.” In particular, the Order stated its intention to send "an email communication with reference to the whistleblowers and those reported in proceedings from 2018 to date who can be reasonably traced" and declared that "the violation will be communicated directly to 334 data subjects (a number that includes the traceable individuals involved in disciplinary proceedings, 13 employees and 3 suppliers)", while "with regard to the other data subjects, the Data Controller will publish a public communication on its website since, in accordance with Article 34, paragraph 3, of the Regulation […] sending a communication to the data subject would require disproportionate efforts". In this regard, three types of communications were issued: "1. Individual communication for identifiable whistleblowers and those reported in disciplinary proceedings; 2. Communication published on the website for individuals to whom it is not possible to send a communication; 3. Individual communication for employees and the three collaborators whose identity documents were exfiltrated" (see notification dated November 20, 2023, section L, points 3 and 4).

Finally, the Order declared that it had notified the data subjects of the personal data breach, pursuant to art. 34 of the Regulation, "on 23 November 2023 – to data subjects who presented a high level of risk with regard to the Incident, i.e., those reported and those reporting in disciplinary proceedings, as well as the Order's employees" (see note dated 19 January 2024, p. 11), through an individual communication, and "in relation to other data subjects [through] a public communication on its website since, in accordance with Article 34, paragraph 3, of the Regulation […] sending a communication to the data subject would require disproportionate efforts" (see notification dated 20 November 2023, section L, point 3).

In relation to the personal data breach in question, two complaints pursuant to Article 77 of the Regulation and one report pursuant to Article 144 of the Code have been submitted to the Garante.

2. The investigation.

In response to a request for information from the Authority (note prot. no. 0168453/23 of December 21, 2023), the Order, in a note dated January 19, 2024 (prot. 0001441), supplemented the information regarding the technical and organizational measures implemented to prevent similar breaches in the future, stating that it had "adopted a plan" that includes the installation of a "software tool for detecting data security threats [...]; a] new network segmentation [to] strengthen its protection against cyber attacks [...], isolate potential attacks and prevent them from spreading across the network and infecting other servers and devices [...]; new backup procedures and air-gaps between production and backup," highlighting "the reliability of the 'multi-level' data backup system" in place at the time of the breach (see note dated January 19, 2024, pages 4-5).

Following a further request for information from the Authority (note prot. no. 0067836/24 of June 4, 2024), the Order, in a note dated June 19, 2024 (prot. no. 0009014), provided a copy of an analysis conducted by an external consultant, which revealed that "the NoEscape group published a 7zip archive divided into three parts on their leak site [...] [and that] the size of the five published data items totals 4.16GB and contains: Identity cards and passports; Confidential agreements; Contracts; Bank documents; Data related to its customers; Internal reports" (see Incident Response Report (IR) - v.1.1, attached to the note dated June 19, 2024, page 20 – hereinafter "incident report").

With a note dated October 16, 2024 (ref. no. 0120794), the Office, based on the information acquired, the checks carried out, and the facts emerging from the investigation, notified the Order, pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 5, of the Code, of the initiation of proceedings for the adoption of the measures referred to in Article 58, paragraph 2, of the Regulation, for having failed to adopt adequate measures to promptly detect personal data breaches and ensure their security, in violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter f), and 32, paragraph 1, of the Regulation. With the same notice, the aforementioned data controller was invited to submit written defenses or documents to the Guarantor or to request a hearing with the Authority (Article 166, paragraphs 6 and 7, of the Code, as well as Article 18, paragraph 1, of Law No. 689 of November 24, 1981).

In a letter dated November 15, 2024, the Order, through its lawyers, submitted a defense brief, declaring, in particular, that:

- "the Order - despite significant financial restrictions [...] - has implemented its security measures in compliance with the guidelines of the Agency for Digital Italy ("AgID") set forth in Circular No. 2/2017 of April 18, 2017 [...] relating to "minimum ICT security measures for public administrations" [...] [without prejudice to the fact that] the Order periodically updates these measures to ensure an adequate level of IT security in line with progressive technological developments";

- "The combined provisions of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter f) and 32, paragraph 1, of the Regulation provide […] does not [provide] a numerus clausus of measures that must be adopted peremptorily […]. On the contrary, the implementation of specific security measures depends on the level of risk posed by the specific processing, as well as on the technological evolution of the sector and the implementation costs and resources actually available for their implementation";

- "In the case of public administrations, however, an indication of the expected security measures is provided by the AgID Circular, which provides the following three security levels: "minimum" […]; "standard", which can be taken as a reference point for most public administrations; "high" […]";

- "The Order, as a non-profit public entity—and therefore a public administration pursuant to Legislative Decree 165/2001 subject to the jurisdiction of AgID—has adopted its own security measures in line with the provisions of AgID Circular, complying with the standard level referred to in letter b) [...]";

- "This level of security is deemed adequate given the actual risk level for the Order's systems, given the following circumstances: a) the activities performed by the Order do not fall within the definition of essential services for citizens as per AgID Circular; b) from an organizational perspective, the Order is not among the public administrations that, due to their size and financial capacity, present a high level of risk";

- “[…] the Order is a non-profit public entity with limited financial capacity, employing only 13 people. The Order does not receive state subsidies and its financial resources are derived solely from payments made by its members. Nonetheless, […] the Order has always paid particular attention to cybersecurity, allocating an average of 5-7% of its annual revenue to managing its technological resources and infrastructure […] in line with market standards […]”;

- “therefore, adopting higher-level measures would have placed a disproportionate burden on the Order […]”;

- “With regard to the failure to adopt a suitable alert mechanism for the timely identification of any anomalies in the Order's systems, it is specified […] [that…] the Order had already implemented [a] firewall […] to protect its corporate perimeter, which is capable of detecting logs and RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connection attempts from outside, including any attempts to gain unauthorized access to the company network.Specifically, the logs collected by the firewall were stored on the Order's infrastructure servers and sent to an archiving mechanism […] in order to have a duplicate copy of the logs. Furthermore, the control of these logs was entrusted to the Order's employees, who periodically monitored the firewall logs to identify any suspicious accesses”;

- “these measures were therefore, overall, suitable for promptly identifying a data breach for two main reasons [… being] in line with the AgID Circular which, for the timely identification of breaches, deems it sufficient to adopt – among other things – measures that include recording any anomalies compared to normal network traffic to allow for offline analysis. Indeed, according to AgID, the adoption of DLP (Data Loss Prevention) mechanisms capable of autonomously identifying suspicious situations and sending an alert is to be considered a high-level measure to which the Order is not required to comply. Furthermore, the adoption of a so-called A more advanced alert and log monitoring system would have required a disproportionate investment in terms of financial and manpower resources for the Order”;

- “[…] to ensure constant monitoring of detected alerts, the Order should also have sufficient qualified personnel to carry out this activity, including on weekends and at night”;

- “in any case, […] as soon as the data breach occurred, the Order initiated a process aimed at increasing the security level of its systems, within the limits of its available financial resources. In particular: […] software […] was installed that allows alerts to be received when Active Directory configurations change or when systems are accessed by specific users”;

- “[…] given the characteristics and methods of carrying out the attack […], the mechanism itself would not have been effective in preventing the breach from occurring […] and/or ensuring its more timely identification. For the alert mechanism in question to function, attackers must generate anomalous traffic due to the volume, geographic origin, or time period of the accesses. Without such anomalous traffic, the alert mechanism would be unable to identify suspicious situations.

- "[…] the attack on the Order [was] a brute force attack (i.e., the attackers repeatedly attempted to access the Order's IT resources using the login credentials of certain users) […]."

- "[…] no "outgoing traffic peaks" were recorded that would have triggered any alerts, given the following circumstances: a) the RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connection attempts from outside occurred on weekends or during the evening hours; b) the access attempts were not massive, but rather spaced out over time and avoided access from blocked countries; c) the attackers had access to sample files from the organization, which allowed them to access the systems with the Order's credentials; and d) the traffic generated by the attackers was sub-threshold, quantified at a maximum of 5 GB, spread over several days, while the average traffic on the Order's systems is between 10 and 20 GB, depending on the activities (including maintenance and updates) performed daily;

- "In fact, it is not uncommon for the Order to conduct activities and events that require access to its systems, even on weekends and in the evenings. Consequently, the mere presence of nighttime or weekend traffic, which is also sub-threshold, could not constitute evidence of illegitimate access, as it is plausible that legitimate users were connected to the Order's network." This is without considering that detecting anomalous traffic does not necessarily indicate an ongoing personal data breach, which could instead take some time to confirm—as in this case.

- "[…] thanks to the specific evasive techniques used in the attack, the attackers would still have been able to avoid any alert mechanisms […]";

- regarding the "failure to adopt a multi-factor authentication system, it should be noted that the Order, at the time the data breach occurred, had implemented a properly configured and monitored authentication system, in line with the provisions of the AgID Circular. In this regard, the AgID Circular requires the implementation of a two-factor authentication as a so-called "high" (not "standard") level measure only for privileged users and the assignment of administrative rights, considering the alternative measure of password strength, which […] was correctly adopted by the Order, as equivalent. Specifically, at the time of the events, the system used to authenticate the Order's users and access domain-certified systems (i.e., workstations and servers) was based on [company name]'s Active Directory, using [company name]'s VPN (Virtual Private Network) […] to ensure secure connections to the Order's systems. Furthermore, access to the user's PC required two steps: entering the disk encryption password and various domain credentials. Finally, specific credentials for use in IT authentication and authorization processes for data and email servers were assigned to the Order's employees. Furthermore, the assigned credentials had to meet the robustness requirements set forth in the AgID Circular. Specifically, passwords had to be 14 characters long and could not be reused multiple times. In fact, the system prevents users from reusing a password previously used to access the same computer system";

- "the Order has now added a dual authentication procedure based on: (i) use of a username and password (already present); (ii) a dual authentication certificate; and (iii) application of device trust";

- "in any case, cybercriminals' access to the computer systems did not occur through the theft of access credentials, but rather due to a system bug that was promptly fixed by the Order";

- regarding the "inadequate segmentation and storage of authentication credentials, there are no reasons why the segregation mechanism implemented by the Order should be considered inadequate, nor is there any specific role this system would have played in the context of the personal data breach." In fact, the AgID Circular merely requires the retention of credentials to "guarantee their availability and confidentiality" and, if digital certificates are used for authentication, to ensure adequate protection for private keys. These requirements are therefore met by the Order.

- "As a general rule, failure to segment passwords or inadequate password storage is primarily relevant when the attack occurs through the introduction of malware into the system. In this case, the lack of segmentation prevents the threat from being isolated, thus potentially leading to the malware's propagation throughout the entire IT infrastructure. In this case, however, the ransomware did not propagate to other systems, as the Order blocked the attack and encryption before it could extend to servers other than those targeted by the attack." Consequently, the lack of segmentation had no impact on the attack, and therefore its failure to be implemented cannot be considered questionable.

- "[…] following the Data Breach, the Order [has] nevertheless introduced a new network segmentation […which] will isolate any attacks [,] prevent them from spreading across the network and infecting other servers and devices […and] ensure that devices on the management network are not reachable from the LAN unless firewall rules are activated (only if necessary)."

- regarding the contested "failure to protect credentials with state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms […] it is […] essential to clarify that: (i) the email domain "opl.it" and the Active Directory domain used to access the Order's internal servers reside on different servers: the former on servers external to the Order (opl.it), while the latter on the Order's internal servers (opl.lan); (ii) the analysis conducted only covered the dark web and detected vulnerabilities only in the Order's external domain (opl.it); and (iii) the analyzed credentials refer exclusively to the email domain and do not in any way allow access to the Order's internal systems;

- therefore, "it is completely irrelevant that some of the aforementioned credentials were classified as "critical" and "high," since they belonged to email addresses that could not be used to access the Order's internal systems. Moreover, only 3 out of 12 users were employees of the Order, and none of them had a password classified as "critical" or "high." Many of the exposed credentials were, in fact, obsolete or invented [...]. Consequently, the alleged lack of encryption of these credentials appears completely unrelated to the dynamics of the attack."

- "[…] the credentials used to access the Order's internal systems were protected by state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms.Indeed, access to the servers was via Active Directory, which uses encryption by default. Finally, to introduce an additional layer of protection, the hard drives of users' computers were encrypted, requiring an additional initial password for access. These encryption measures are in line with the AgID Circular, which requires "analysis of data to identify those with particular confidentiality requirements (relevant data) and specifically those to which cryptographic protection should be applied."

- "It is appropriate to note the irrelevance of the reference made by this Authority to the Cryptographic Functions Guidelines – Password Conservation adopted with Order No. 594 of 7 December 2023 [web doc. No. 9962283], as they had not yet been adopted at the time the contested events occurred;

- "The Order is evaluating the adoption of an encryption system in line with the requirements set by the Guarantor, as well as by EU Directive 2022/2555."

- "The contested conduct […] (i) affected a small number of data subjects and personal data compared to those present in the Order's system (6.9 GB out of a total of 350 GB); (ii) created a high risk for a limited number of data subjects […] [and] the Order notified the data subjects impacted by a higher risk on an individual basis, while for the others it published a freely available notice on its website; (iii) resulted only in a loss of confidentiality, without affecting the integrity and availability of the data, the compromise of which was only temporary thanks to the measures taken by the Order to limit the negative effects and the presence of information backups; (iv) did not significantly impact the Order's systems […]”;

- “in order to improve breach detection and system security, as well as to prevent similar attacks in the future, the Order has: (i) created certified VPN access; (ii) adopted a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system; (iii) defined more stringent password policies; (iv) blocked nighttime access to the network; (v) disabled all server access and introduced stricter access rules; (vi) controlled the geolocation of external access; (vii) introduced further network segmentation […] to isolate potential new attacks and prevent them from spreading across the network and infecting other servers and devices; (viii) reconfigured existing network switches […]; (ix) limited remote access via VPN […]; (x) implemented new immutable backup systems […]; (xi) implement an air gap between the production and backup environments […] (xiii) modify VPN user connection rules, encrypt archives, and adopt a new cloud application for managing the Register”;

- “[…] the severity of the breach […] is high, with exclusive reference to the individuals to whom the exfiltrated disciplinary proceedings relate and the individuals cited in those proceedings, which represent only a very limited portion of the illicitly obtained data (i.e., 159 proceedings). Regarding the personal data of employees involved in the Data Breach, however, the only special categories of personal data impacted concern their union membership, due to the presence of only payment receipts for membership fees. Finally, with regard to the other categories of data subjects involved, particularly suppliers and other members of the Order not involved in disciplinary proceedings, the information affected by the personal data breach is predominantly in the public domain. In general, therefore, the data breach did not affect the most sensitive data processed by the Order.

During the hearing, requested pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 6, of the Code and held on December 2, 2024 (see minutes file no. 0141629 of the same date), the Order, represented by its lawyers, stated, in particular, that:

- "the attack […] was particularly sophisticated and elusive and, therefore, even adopting more advanced alert systems would not have been possible to detect it; In particular, the data exfiltration (approximately 5 GB) occurred progressively, at night and on holidays, without ever exceeding the average daily traffic threshold (approximately 10 to 20 GB)";

- "Although there is no specific evidence, the circumstances of the attack seem to suggest that it was aimed at obtaining specific data and documents and commissioned by unidentified individuals who had an interest in gaining possession of such data and documents or otherwise causing damage to the Order that would impact them. Moreover, the individuals in question likely had knowledge of the Order's IT systems (e.g., average traffic threshold)";

- "Regarding the measures adopted to ensure password security, which the Order believes were adequate, it must be emphasized that, given the above regarding the Order's small size and limited financial and organizational resources, the Order could not afford to carry out activities such as vulnerability assessments and penetration tests, or dark web checks aimed at preventively monitoring the possible loss of passwords. confidentiality of credentials”;

In response to a specific reservation made during the hearing, the Order, again through its lawyers, stated in a note dated December 11, 2024, in particular that:

- although in its defense brief, the Order stated that “the cybercriminals’ access to the computer systems did not appear to have occurred through the theft of access credentials, but rather due to a system bug that was promptly fixed by the Order […], it is appropriate to clarify that, from a purely technical IT perspective, the term “bug” was used in the brief to refer to a “vulnerability” in the systems that the cybercriminals exploited to gain illegitimate and easy access”;

- “specifically, the compromised vector used by the attackers appears to be the “XX server” – which exposed the Remote Desktop Protocol (“RDP”) service – from which external connections were made throughout the attack (i.e., from September 30, 2023 to October 3, 2023), with scans to detect any vulnerabilities. However, the first connection requests appeared to be failed RDP access attempts. The accesses, however, actually occurred during the final phase of the attack (i.e., from 11:12 PM on October 2, 2023 to 4:01 AM on October 3, 2023)”;

- “The RDP system is a system that allows remote access to a computer or server running on the same local network (LAN), allowing authorized users to view the screen and interact with the system as if they were physically present. However, to enable such remote connections, RDP requires open and publicly visible ports. This feature exposes RDP to external access by unauthorized parties”;

- “in this case, based on what emerges from the Incident Response Report […], it must be assumed that the attackers: (i) identified the vulnerability of the server that exposed the RDP service through active scans by automated agents or bots; and (ii) attempted to access the system using credentials presumably obtained from the dark web or through other automated tools used to make repeated login attempts that generate random username and password combinations until a valid one is identified (so-called brute force attack);

- "In any case, it is unlikely that the source of the Personal Data Breach is to be found solely in the exposed credentials relating to the "opl.it" domain […], as the stolen credentials refer only to the email domain and in no way permitted access to the Order's RDP system (which, however, is the system the cybercriminals actually accessed)";

- "The "opl.it" email domain and the Active Directory domain used to access the Order's internal servers reside on different servers […]; (ii) the analysis conducted revealed vulnerabilities only in the Order's external domain (opl.it); and (iii) the credentials used are email addresses that, in some cases, are not even associated with a valid account. In fact, only three out of twelve addresses were traceable to Order employees, while many of the exposed credentials were obsolete or invented [...], and in any case, unusable to access the RDP, which appears to be the system the attackers actually accessed.

- "The analysis of the data and logs made available by the organization's technical contact allowed us to identify the likely entry vector, specifically a server that exposed the Remote Desktop service."

- "In light of the above, access to the Order's IT systems occurred due to a vulnerability in an RDP access point on the Order's infrastructure, although the attackers attempted to use credentials that, in all likelihood, they already possessed (likely via the dark web) or generated through a brute force attack."

- "However, the stolen credentials did not allow access to the Order's network (i.e., the exposed RDP system). Therefore, even if the Order had adopted multi-factor authentication solutions, this would not have prevented the Personal Data Breach from occurring.

"In any case, the Order's financial situation did not allow it to sustain the cost of a dark web scanning service to identify stolen credentials and perform periodic vulnerability assessments and penetration tests."

3. Outcome of the preliminary investigation.

3.1 Personal data protection legislation.

Pursuant to Article 5, paragraph 1, letter (f), of the Regulation, the processing of personal data must be carried out in accordance with the principle of "integrity and confidentiality," according to which personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical and organizational measures.

Based on this principle, Article 32 of the Regulation requires the controller to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. The data controller is responsible for implementing these measures and must be able to demonstrate that the processing is performed in compliance with the Regulation (see Articles 5, paragraph 2, and 24 of the Regulation; see the "Guidelines 07/2020 on the Concepts of Controller and Processor Under the GDPR," adopted by the European Data Protection Board on 7 July 2021, especially point 41).

3.2 Failure to adopt adequate measures to detect personal data breaches.

As shown in the documents in the file, from "preliminary analysis of the logs of the Firewall [...] installed to protect the company perimeter, the following was discovered: during the period between September 30 and October 1, 2023, numerous RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connection attempts from outside were detected, addressed to the machines "XX" and "XX" [...] [and that] starting on October 2, RDP sessions were recorded in the evening hours that lasted until October 3, thus suggesting a persistent threat [...] it is therefore probable that the illegitimate activities [had] begun on September 30, 2023 and ended on the morning of October 3, 2023 with the execution of the Ransomware (see Incident Response Report (IR) - v. 1.1 attached to the note dated June 19, 2024, pages 8 - 9).

Only "on October 3, 2023, following the receipt of several reports "from users of the Order who reported an inability to access the network," the Order became aware of the encryption of some servers and the deletion of backup data, initially believing that this was due to a technical problem. Subsequently, only "following an in-depth analysis conducted by the System Administrator (ADS), concluded on October 10, 2023, was it possible for the Data Controller to understand that the Incident constituted a personal data breach pursuant to the Regulation (although the level of seriousness of the incident was not yet fully understood)" (Incident Response Report (IR) - v.1.1 attached to the note dated June 19, 2024, pages 8).

The Order had therefore not adopted any adequate measures to promptly detect personal data breaches based on anomalous behavior resulting from access to the company network (such as, for example, the time and frequency of access, which tended to occur at night, and the origin of IP addresses in countries (foreigners) and from operations performed with domain accounts with or without administrative privileges (such as, for example, deactivating security measures or terminating processes and services), also given that "to ensure constant monitoring of the alerts detected, the Order should also have sufficient qualified personnel to carry out this activity, including on weekends and at night" (note dated November 15, 2024, cited).

Regarding the defenses put forward by the Order following the administrative violation charge, it should be noted that, as recently reiterated by the Guarantor (see provisions of July 17, 2024, no. 444, web doc. no. 10057610), the fact that the Order had "adopted its own security measures in line with the provisions of the AgID Circular, complying with the standard level", does not, in general, exempt the data controller from the obligation to carry out a concrete assessment of the appropriateness of the measures adopted to ensure the security of the data. processing, taking into account the context in which it operates. In particular, the adoption of the measures indicated in the aforementioned guidelines – which constitute, moreover, the "minimum security measures for the Italian public administration, taking into account the enormous differences in size, mandate, types of information managed, exposure to risk, and so on that characterizes the over twenty thousand public administrations" – does not, in itself, guarantee compliance with security obligations. The aforementioned guidelines, in fact, aim to "indicate to public administrations the minimum ICT security measures that must be adopted in order to counter the most common and frequent threats to which their information systems are subject", drawing on "the set of controls known as SANS 20 [...] in version 6.0 of October 2015", and "ensure the minimum level of protection in most situations [...] taking into account the enormous differences in size, mandate, types of information managed, exposure to risk, and so on that characterizes the over twenty thousand public administrations", recommending that "each administration [...] identify [within itself] any subsets, technical and/or organizational, characterized by homogeneous security requirements and objectives, within which […] to homogeneously apply the measures suitable for achieving these objectives”. Specifically, the Guidelines, having been issued on the basis of the state of the art, technical knowledge and cyber threats present in 2015, could not take into account the worsening of cyber risk in recent years, also due to the spread and adoption, during the COVID-19 pandemic, of technological methods and tools to enable the performance of activities (work and otherwise) remotely. This change of scenario, also given the significant increase in attacks by cybercriminals, would have required a renewed assessment that weighed the new and much more serious risks associated with the processing for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the adequacy of the measures adopted. The aforementioned assessment, since it could not be crystallized and, therefore, concluded at the time the processing was designed, should have been periodically carried out over time, also in light of technological developments; this also aims to raise awareness of the need to mitigate the risks arising from personal data breaches. Therefore, the alleged compliance with the measures indicated in the aforementioned AgID Guidelines does not exhaust the data controller's obligation to adopt adequate measures based on its own risk assessment. Indeed, the Regulation, in accordance with the principle of accountability, requires the data controller to identify and adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing, which, in this case, were particularly high due to the nature of the data processed, the large number of data subjects, including vulnerable individuals, and, in the event of a breach, the potential negative consequences for the data subjects should the confidentiality of the data be compromised.

Furthermore, the defense argument put forward by the Order cannot be accepted, according to which, given the fact that the cyber attack in question was particularly sophisticated (progressive data exfiltration at night and on holidays, without ever exceeding the average traffic threshold), any Real-time alert mechanisms for the timely identification of any anomalies would have been ineffective in any case. Such automatic mechanisms, when properly configured and monitored, allow the detection of events that, precisely because of the particular precautions employed by attackers, may escape human control. This highlights certain events (e.g., traffic at night or on holidays, or on days when no scheduled maintenance is scheduled) even if they are not statistically significant (e.g., traffic in line with the average daily traffic threshold).

Nor is it relevant that, as argued by the Order, the adoption of the aforementioned automated alert systems would have entailed a high and disproportionate economic cost for the Order, given that it is a public body with limited organizational and financial resources.

In this regard, it should be noted that Article 32 of the Regulation mentions "implementation costs" only among the factors that the data controller must take into account for the purpose of identifying appropriate technical and organizational measures to address the risks that insist on the data being processed (see Article 24 of the Regulation). This factor "implies that the controller does not employ a disproportionate amount of resources where alternative, less expensive, but effective measures exist," noting that "the cost of implementation is a factor to be taken into account in implementing data protection by design, and not a reason for refraining from implementing it." Therefore, "the measures identified must [...] ensure that the processing activity envisaged by the controller does not involve the processing of personal data in violation of the Principles, regardless of the cost of such measures. Controllers must be able to manage the overall costs to be able to effectively implement all the principles and, consequently, protect rights” (European Data Protection Board, “Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 – Data protection by design and by default”, adopted on 20 October 2020, paras. 24 and 25; see also ENISA, “Guidelines for SMEs on the security of personal data processing”, December 2016, p. 12, which highlights that “the reference […] to implementation costs should not be interpreted as an excuse for inaction, but rather as an invitation to all stakeholders to simplify and reduce costs. In this sense, the approach to simplifying the notion of risk and the adoption of appropriate measures are crucial for the correct implementation of this Article”, i.e., Article 32 of the Regulation).

It follows that, even if the data controller decides to adopt less costly technical and organizational measures, these must still be equally effective in mitigating the risks posed to the data. As the Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) points out, "implementation costs cannot be considered a factor authorizing the data controller to lower the level of protection that the measures must adequately ensure; rather, they may constitute a factor to be taken into account when choosing between multiple solutions" (Provision No. 475 of July 17, 2024, web doc. No. 10057648).

In this case, the Order cannot, therefore, invoke the limitations of its organizational and financial resources to justify its failure to adopt adequate measures to address the risks arising from its processing. Furthermore, following the personal data breach in question, the Order decided to install a "software tool for detecting data security threats" (see note dated January 19, 2024, page 4), thus enabling the Entity to bear the financial cost of adopting this measure.

Data controllers are then required to consider the implementation costs along with the additional factors set forth in Article 32 of the Regulation, namely the "state of the art," the "nature, [...] scope, context, and purposes of processing," as well as the "risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons" (see Article 25 of the Regulation).

As for the "state of the art," it is "a dynamic concept that cannot be defined statically at a given point in time, but should be continuously assessed in the context of technological progress." It "imposes an obligation on controllers, when determining appropriate technical and organizational measures, to take into account current technological advances available on the market." Consequently, "controllers must be aware of technological advances and remain constantly updated on the data protection opportunities and risks for processing arising from such technologies, and on how to implement and update measures and safeguards that ensure effective implementation of the principles and rights of data subjects, taking into account the evolving technological landscape" ("Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 - Data Protection by Design and by Default," cited above, paragraphs 18-20).

Given, as mentioned above, the worsening cyber risk in recent years, the adoption of the aforementioned automated alert systems must be considered, in the context of the processing in question, an appropriate measure given the state of the art of technology and the current risk scenario. The "Guidelines 9/2022 on the Notification of Personal Data Breach under the GDPR," adopted by the European Data Protection Board on March 28, 2023 (hereinafter, the "Notification Guidelines"), highlight that "the ability to promptly identify, address, and report a breach must be considered an essential aspect" of the technical and organizational measures that data controllers and processors must implement, pursuant to Article 32 of the Regulation, to ensure an adequate level of personal data security (paragraph 41; see Decision No. 444 of July 17, 2024, web doc. No. 10057610).

Regarding the "nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing," the Order should have duly taken into account the fact that, in handling disciplinary proceedings, it may process personal data of vulnerable individuals (patients; minors), including special categories of data or criminal convictions or offenses.

Article 32(2) of the Regulation further specifies that, in assessing the appropriate level of security, particular account must be taken of the risks presented by the processing, which arise in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data. In this regard, too, the Order, in identifying the necessary technical and organizational measures, should have considered the significant risks to data subjects that could arise from any disclosure of the aforementioned sensitive information, in terms of the consequences for their economic and social relationships, particularly with regard to their family, school, or work environment, as is evident from the report and complaints received.

In light of the foregoing considerations, it must be concluded that the Order's failure to adopt the aforementioned technical and organizational measures constitutes a violation of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) of the Regulation.

3.3 Failure to adopt adequate measures to ensure the security of processing systems.

In partial rectification and clarification of the statements made during the preliminary investigation, the Order, supplementing the statements made during the hearing, stated that "access to the Order's IT systems occurred due to a vulnerability in an RDP access point on the Order's infrastructure, although the attackers attempted to use credentials that, in all likelihood, they already possessed (likely via the dark web) or generated through a brute force attack," specifying that "the stolen credentials did not allow access to the Order's network (i.e., the exposed RDP system)." Therefore, in the Order's opinion, "even if the Order had adopted multi-factor authentication solutions, this would not have prevented the personal data breach."

Recalling the points made in paragraph 3.2 above in relation to the provisions of Articles 24 and 32 of the Regulation, with particular regard to the impossibility of invoking implementation costs to justify the failure to adopt the necessary technical measures to protect data, and taking into account that the adequacy of the measures implemented by the data controller must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, based on the different criteria provided for by these articles and the data protection needs specifically inherent to the processing as well as the risks induced by the latter (see Court of Justice of the European Union, judgments C‑687/21, MediaMarktSaturn, of 25 January 2024, para. 38, and C‑340/21, Natsionalna agentsiaza prihodite, paras. 30 to 32), it must be noted that the processing carried out by the Order in the context in question would have required the adoption of appropriate technical and organizational measures according to the state of the art, in order to ensure the confidentiality of the personal data of the data subjects. As stated above, this is also true given the purposes of the processing (including those carried out in the context of disciplinary proceedings), the large number of data subjects, the sensitive nature of the personal data processed (including special categories and data relating to criminal convictions and offenses), and the potential risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, including vulnerable individuals (patients, minors, workers).

The investigation revealed, however, that the Order had not adopted adequate measures to ensure the security of its processing systems. Specifically, the Order had not adopted a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system, which could have prevented unauthorized access to the systems even if authentication credentials had been compromised. Only following the incident did the Order, in fact, deem it necessary to "adopt a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system" (see notification of November 20, 2023, section H, point 2 and note of January 19, 2024, pages 4-5).

It should also be noted that, although the Order stated that the credentials previously leaked and present on the dark web were not used for the attack in question, as they related to email, these credentials were not adequately protected by encryption. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the attackers attempted to use the same or similar credentials to carry out the attack.

Finally, the Order's statements show that the attack's entry vector server was running an obsolete operating system (XX), whose vulnerabilities (RDP service exposed on the default port) were exploited by the attacker to penetrate the Entity's infrastructure.

In light of the foregoing considerations, the failure to adopt adequate measures to ensure the security of processing systems at the time of the breach constitutes a violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter f), and 32, paragraph 1, of the Regulation.

4. Conclusions.

In light of the above assessments, it is noted that the statements made by the data controller during the investigation – the veracity of which may be held accountable pursuant to Article 168 of the Code – although worthy of consideration, do not address the concerns notified by the Office with the document initiating the proceedings and are insufficient to allow the dismissal of the present proceedings. Furthermore, none of the cases provided for by Article 11 of the Garante Regulation No. 1/2019 apply.

The Office's preliminary assessments are therefore confirmed and the Order is found to have violated Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter f), and 32, paragraph 1, of the Regulation.

Given that the violation of the aforementioned provisions occurred as a result of a single conduct (the same processing or related processing), Article 83, paragraph 1, of the GDPR applies. 3 of the Regulation, pursuant to which the total amount of the administrative pecuniary sanction does not exceed the amount specified for the most serious violation. Considering that, in this case, the most serious violation, relating to Article 5, paragraph 1, letter f), of the Regulation, is subject to the sanction provided for by Article 83, paragraph 5, of the Regulation, as also referred to in Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Code, the total amount of the sanction is to be quantified up to €20,000,000.

In this context, considering, in any case, that the conduct has exhausted its effects, given that, as highlighted above, the Order has declared that it has adopted appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent similar events in the future, the conditions for the adoption of further corrective measures pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, of the Regulation are not met.

5. Adoption of the injunction order for the application of the administrative pecuniary sanction and additional sanctions (Articles 58, paragraph 2, letters i) and 83 of the Regulation; Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code).

The Guarantor, pursuant to Articles 58, paragraph 2, letter i) and 83 of the Regulation as well as Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code, 166 of the Code, has the power to "impose a pecuniary administrative sanction pursuant to Article 83, in addition to the [other] corrective measures referred to in this paragraph, or in place of such measures, depending on the circumstances of each individual case." Within this framework, "the [Garante] Panel shall adopt the injunction order, by which it also orders the application of the additional administrative sanction, its publication, in full or in extract, on the Garante's website pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code" (Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Garante Regulation No. 1/2019).

In this regard, taking into account Article 83, paragraph 3, of the Regulation, in this case, violation of the aforementioned provisions is subject to the application of the pecuniary administrative sanction provided for in Article 83, paragraph 5, of the Regulation.

The aforementioned administrative fine imposed, based on the circumstances of each individual case, must be determined with due consideration of the factors set forth in Article 83, paragraph 2, of the Regulation.

Considering that:

Although the Order had not adopted real-time alert systems for the timely identification of any anomalies, it had at least implemented a firewall capable of detecting logs and external RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connection attempts, including any attempts at unauthorized access to the network, and assigned certain of its employees to periodically monitor them (see Article 83, paragraph 2, letter a), of the Regulation);

The data exfiltration occurred progressively, generating traffic volumes large enough to not arouse suspicion, at night and on holidays, without ever exceeding the average traffic threshold, which was evidently known to the attackers for unknown reasons (see Article 83, paragraph 2, letter a), of the Regulation);

The breach did not compromise the availability and integrity of the personal data processed by the Order (see Article 83, paragraph 2, letter a), of the Regulation);

The breach, however, affected a large amount of personal data ("approximately 15,000 records"; "6.9 GB"), including personal data, contact details, payment information, identity document data, special categories of data (i.e., data revealing ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, sexual life or sexual orientation, health status), criminal convictions and offences, and data covered by professional secrecy. Consequently, the numerous data subjects to whom they refer ("3,000", some of whom are involved in various capacities in 159 disciplinary proceedings), including vulnerable individuals (minors, patients, workers), were exposed to potential risks of discrimination, identity theft, fraud, reputational risks, and other economic and social harm (Article 83, paragraph 2, letters a) and g), of the Regulation);

Given the aforementioned risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, as well as the current high level of cyber risk and the state of the art in the IT security sector, the Order's conduct, consisting in its failure to adopt the aforementioned technical and organizational measures to protect the data, must be considered negligent. It is understood that the data exfiltration and dissemination are in any case attributable to malicious conduct by a criminal organization ("NoEscape"), using a ransomware program that has spread relatively recently (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter b), of the Regulation).

In this case, the seriousness of the violation committed by the data controller is considered high (see European Data Protection Board, "Guidelines 4/2022 on the calculation of administrative pecuniary sanctions under the GDPR" of 24 May 2023, point 60).

Given the above, considering that the data controller, despite having a limited organizational structure (thirteen employees), is a public body of regional importance, which manages numerous members (25,499; source: www.opl.it), it is believed that, for the purposes of quantifying the fine, the following circumstances must be taken into consideration:

The breach, which, given the nature of the data involved and the categories of data subjects to whom it refers, is particularly serious, occurred as a result of the failure to adopt adequate technical and organizational measures, for which the Order bears a high degree of responsibility (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter d), of the Regulation);

The Order notified the personal data breach to the Guarantor pursuant to Article 13 of the GDPR. 33 of the Regulation and has cooperated effectively with the Authority during the investigation, having also adopted new technical and organizational measures to strengthen the security of processing and prevent similar cyberattacks in the future (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter f), of the Regulation);

There are no relevant previous violations committed by the data controller (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter e), of the Regulation).

Based on the above factors, assessed as a whole, the fine is set at €30,000 (thirty thousand) for the multiple violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter f), and 32, paragraph 1, of the Regulation, as an administrative fine deemed, pursuant to Article 83, paragraph 1, of the Regulation, to be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

It is also considered that, pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Italian Data Protection Authority Regulation No. 1/2019, this chapter containing the injunction order should be published on the Italian Data Protection Authority's website. This, as highlighted above, is in light of the particularly sensitive processing context in which the breach occurred, both due to the nature of the personal data being processed and the subjective characteristics of the data subjects, including vulnerable individuals.

Finally, it is noted that the conditions set out in Article 17 of Regulation No. 1/2019 are met.

NOW WITHOUT PREJUDICE, THE ITALIAN DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITY

declares, pursuant to Article 57, paragraph 1, letter f), of the Regulation, that the processing occurred in violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter f), and 32, paragraph 1, letter f), of the Italian Data Protection Authority. 1 of the Regulations, within the timeframe set forth in the reasons;

WHEREAS

1. Introduction.

On October 19, 2023, the Order of Psychologists of the Lombardy Region (hereinafter, the "Order") notified the Authority, pursuant to Article 33 of the Regulation, of a personal data breach that occurred on October 3, 2023, involving "unauthorized access to the computer network, data encryption on servers, and data deletion from NAS backups" (see notification of October 19, section F, point 8).

Subsequently, on November 20, 2023, the Order supplemented the aforementioned notification, declaring that it had been the victim of "a sophisticated ransomware attack by the criminal organization NoEscape [which] resulted in unauthorized access to the Order's IT network, data encryption, and the subsequent deletion of backups, which were subsequently recovered [...] on October 10, 2023, when the Data Controller became aware of the "malicious" source of the anomalies encountered in the previous days, [...] following the receipt of an email from csirt@pec.acn.gov.it indicating a link on Onion that led to a page threatening the publication of 7GB of data [...]. Subsequently, following the failure to pay the ransom, the cybercriminals published the exfiltrated data on the dark web on October 18 and October 31, 2023."

In this regard, the Order stated that it can "exclude any loss of data integrity and availability [since] all archives have been fully restored thanks to backups made in [a supplier's] cloud and the presence of backups on external USB drives stored in a safe. Furthermore, [...] the malicious agent was able to encrypt and exfiltrate only 6.9 GB (compressed to 4.5 GB): this amount is only a small amount compared to the overall size and volume of data contained in the Order's archives, which corresponds to hundreds of GB, which were not impacted. In fact, only a few folders containing files were impacted, not all of them. [...] Furthermore, the Data Controller has no evidence that other data, other than that published on the dark web, was accessed by cybercriminals, and in their communications, the latter have always referred solely to the data subsequently published on the dark web" (see notification of November 20, section F, point 7 and G, point 1.4).

The Order also stated that 3,000 data subjects were involved in the cyberattack and that the "impact of the breach [...] is high, with exclusive reference to the data of [data subjects involved in] [...] disciplinary proceedings and the persons cited in those proceedings, which represent only a very limited portion of the breached data"—quantifying such proceedings at 159, "most of which concern the last two years"—while "for other, older proceedings, the documentation concerns only the parties involved and the measure adopted." The Order, however, considered "with respect to the employees and the sole three collaborators of the Data Controller whose identity documents were exfiltrated, [...] that the severity [was] medium" (see notification of November 20, 2023, section F, point 13, and G, point 3).

The documents in the file show that the breach affected approximately 15,000 records of personal data, including personal details, contact details, payment information, and information relating to identity documents/identification documents covered by professional secrecy, as well as data belonging to special categories (see Article 9 of the Regulation and Article 2-sexies of the Code), such as data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, sex life or sexual orientation, health, and data relating to criminal convictions and offenses (see Article 10 of the Regulation and Article 2-octies of the Code). This resulted in the data subjects being exposed, as assessed by the Order and declared in the breach notifications, to risks of loss of control of their data, discrimination, identity theft, fraud, damage to their reputation, access by unauthorized third parties, and significant economic and social damage.

With reference to the measures in place at the time of the violation, the Order stated that it carried out "constant checks on updates to the operating systems of the server and client stations, the firmware of the network devices [and that it adopted a] correctly configured and monitored authentication system, antivirus […] on all stations, local backups on two NAS located in the two offices, a cloud backup […] no. 5 USB HDs in a safe at the office […] and two USB HDs kept in a safe at the institution's bank" (see notification of 19 October 2023, section F, point 9). Furthermore, the Order "had adopted the following measures: (i) firmware on network devices, (ii) a properly configured and monitored authentication system, (iii) antivirus endpoint reset on all workstations, (iv) local backups on two NAS devices located at the two offices, (v) a cloud backup with [a third-party provider], (vi) five USB hard drives in a safe at the Owner's office and two USB hard drives stored in a safe at the bank [...]; a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to connect to the Order's systems. All these measures were constantly monitored and updated." The Order detailed these measures in a note dated January 19, 2024 (pp. 2–4).

With reference to the measures adopted following the violation, the Order stated that it "took action to better understand what had happened and recover the backup copies (physical and cloud) of the data residing on its servers [, having] promptly involved [a third-party supplier] in the restoration activities […] and proceeded to (i) disable all the rules on the firewall that allowed external access to the terminal server on the XX machine containing the software of the Register of Psychologists, (ii) block all active VPNs and add rules that blocked all traffic to and from the network from 9.00 pm to 7.00 am, (iii) change the password starting from the domain server and then on the ESX servers containing the virtual machines. In the meantime, [it had] already proceeded to create a new virtual machine on which [a] backup software was installed […]. Once the operation was completed, the virtual server acting as Domain Controller was restored, using a backup copy present on a physical disk locked in a safe with data backup July 31, 2023. Thanks to some cloud backups at [a third-party provider] and some physical backup disks in the safe and in the safety deposit box at the Order's reference bank, the Owner was able to restore the data by recovering the deleted data thanks to the cloud and physical backups, bringing the situation back to the day before the attack. Therefore, the loss of availability and integrity of the data was only temporary thanks to the completed recovery activities. Furthermore, […] tests were [then] carried out in order to understand the anomalies found and the nature of the event [, installing] a specific monitoring software on all machines, including its own servers. Subsequently, [we] proceeded to 1. successfully restore the data, also allowing the use of cloud applications; 2. restore the XX server, i.e. the Owner's file server; 3. realign the PCs of users who were not present in the previous days, recover the NAS backups present on site, change the passwords of new users; 4. after obtaining confirmation [from the third-party provider] about the fact that, once all the data had been copied, the Data Controller could proceed with deleting the encrypted files, (i) deleting the encrypted files from the Casa della Psicologia server after copying them to the NAS, and (ii) starting the creation of a new virtual machine on the Casa della Psicologia ESX server. When the data was published on the dark web, the Data Controller conducted online verification activities, including on the dark web, attempting to identify the possible presence of data attributable to the archives subject to encryption and deletion and to reconstruct the impacted personal data” (see notification of November 20, 2023, section H, point 1).

In relation to the technical and organizational measures adopted to prevent similar violations in the future, the Order declared that "after having restored the data and deleted the encrypted copies [...] it implemented measures such as: (i) the creation of VPN accesses with certificates in place of the old local users, (ii) carrying out functional tests, and (iii) modifying the connection rules of VPN users on the Order's network, limiting their access to only the necessary servers. Furthermore, the new backup agent [...] was installed on the XX server and the backup was reconfigured both on the cloud [...] and on the 4 NAS [...] [.The Order] is adopting a new cloud application for managing the register of members of the order and is evaluating the purchase of an application that, in addition to collecting log files, also performs analysis functions and provides for the sending of alerts to the ADS [...] [.The] Data Controller's IT representatives have restored all the archives and are preparing a plan to optimize the appropriate measures that were already in place at the the order's IT structure by adopting more stringent measures with reference to special categories of data, such as the adoption of a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system and archive encryption. The adoption of monitoring software […to] identify potentially critical situations and alert the ADS and a solution that allows for the integrity of on-site backups and rapid data recovery to be guaranteed, in addition to the measures already adopted […]” (see notification of 20 November 2023, section H, point 2).

Regarding the notification of the breach to data subjects, the Order, in its supplementary notification, stated that it would notify data subjects "by November 24, 2023 [...] for the whistleblowers, those reported, and individuals cited in the proceedings" and that it would also do so "for the benefit of the employees and the three collaborators mentioned above as a precautionary measure." Specifically, the Order stated its intention to send "an email notification regarding the whistleblowers and those reported in proceedings from 2018 to date who can be reasonably traced" and stated that "the breach will be communicated directly to 334 data subjects (a number that includes the traceable individuals involved in disciplinary proceedings, 13 employees, and 3 suppliers)," while "with regard to the other data subjects, the Data Controller will publish a public notice on its website since, in accordance with Article 34, paragraph 3, of the Regulation [...] sending a notification to the data subject would require disproportionate efforts." In this regard, three types of communications were issued: "1. Individual communication for identifiable whistleblowers and those reported in disciplinary proceedings; 2. Communication published on the website for individuals to whom it is not possible to send a communication; 3. Individual communication for employees and the three collaborators whose identity documents were exfiltrated" (see notification dated November 20, 2023, section L, points 3 and 4).

Finally, the Order declared that it had notified the data subjects of the personal data breach, pursuant to art. 34 of the Regulation, "on 23 November 2023 – to data subjects who presented a high level of risk with regard to the Incident, i.e., those reported and those reporting in disciplinary proceedings, as well as the Order's employees" (see note dated 19 January 2024, p. 11), through an individual communication, and "in relation to other data subjects [through] a public communication on its website since, in accordance with Article 34, paragraph 3, of the Regulation […] sending a communication to the data subject would require disproportionate efforts" (see notification dated 20 November 2023, section L, point 3).

In relation to the personal data breach in question, two complaints pursuant to Article 77 of the Regulation and one report pursuant to Article 144 of the Code have been submitted to the Garante.

2. The investigation.

In response to a request for information from the Authority (note prot. no. 0168453/23 of December 21, 2023), the Order, in a note dated January 19, 2024 (prot. 0001441), supplemented the information regarding the technical and organizational measures implemented to prevent similar breaches in the future, stating that it had "adopted a plan" that includes the installation of a "software tool for detecting data security threats [...]; a] new network segmentation [to] strengthen its protection against cyber attacks [...], isolate potential attacks and prevent them from spreading across the network and infecting other servers and devices [...]; new backup procedures and air-gaps between production and backup," highlighting "the reliability of the 'multi-level' data backup system" in place at the time of the breach (see note dated January 19, 2024, pages 4-5).

Following a further request for information from the Authority (note prot. no. 0067836/24 of June 4, 2024), the Order, in a note dated June 19, 2024 (prot. no. 0009014), provided a copy of an analysis conducted by an external consultant, which revealed that "the NoEscape group published a 7zip archive divided into three parts on their leak site [...] [and that] the size of the five published data items totals 4.16GB and contains: Identity cards and passports; Confidential agreements; Contracts; Bank documents; Data related to its customers; Internal reports" (see Incident Response Report (IR) - v.1.1, attached to the note dated June 19, 2024, page 20 – hereinafter "incident report").

With a note dated October 16, 2024 (ref. no. 0120794), the Office, based on the information acquired, the checks carried out, and the facts emerging from the investigation, notified the Order, pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 5, of the Code, of the initiation of proceedings for the adoption of the measures referred to in Article 58, paragraph 2, of the Regulation, for having failed to adopt adequate measures to promptly detect personal data breaches and ensure their security, in violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter f), and 32, paragraph 1, of the Regulation. With the same notice, the aforementioned data controller was invited to submit written defenses or documents to the Guarantor or to request a hearing with the Authority (Article 166, paragraphs 6 and 7, of the Code, as well as Article 18, paragraph 1, of Law No. 689 of November 24, 1981).

In a letter dated November 15, 2024, the Order, through its lawyers, submitted a defense brief, declaring, in particular, that:

- "the Order - despite significant financial restrictions [...] - has implemented its security measures in compliance with the guidelines of the Agency for Digital Italy ("AgID") set forth in Circular No. 2/2017 of April 18, 2017 [...] relating to "minimum ICT security measures for public administrations" [...] [without prejudice to the fact that] the Order periodically updates these measures to ensure an adequate level of IT security in line with progressive technological developments";

- "The combined provisions of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter f) and 32, paragraph 1, of the Regulation provide […] does not [provide] a numerus clausus of measures that must be adopted peremptorily […]. On the contrary, the implementation of specific security measures depends on the level of risk posed by the specific processing, as well as on the technological evolution of the sector and the implementation costs and resources actually available for their implementation";

- "In the case of public administrations, however, an indication of the expected security measures is provided by the AgID Circular, which provides the following three security levels: "minimum" […]; "standard", which can be taken as a reference point for most public administrations; "high" […]";

- "The Order, as a non-profit public entity—and therefore a public administration pursuant to Legislative Decree 165/2001 subject to the jurisdiction of AgID—has adopted its own security measures in line with the provisions of AgID Circular, complying with the standard level referred to in letter b) [...]";

- "This level of security is deemed adequate given the actual risk level for the Order's systems, given the following circumstances: a) the activities performed by the Order do not fall within the definition of essential services for citizens as per AgID Circular; b) from an organizational perspective, the Order is not among the public administrations that, due to their size and financial capacity, present a high level of risk";

- “[…] the Order is a non-profit public entity with limited financial capacity, employing only 13 people. The Order receives no state subsidies and its financial resources are derived solely from payments made by its members. Nonetheless, […] the Order has always paid particular attention to cybersecurity, allocating an average of 5-7% of its annual revenue to the management of its technological resources and infrastructure […] in line with market standards […]”;

- “Therefore, adopting higher-level measures would have placed a disproportionate burden on the Order […]”;

- "With regard to the failure to adopt a suitable alert mechanism for the timely identification of any anomalies on the Order's systems, it is specified […] [that…] the Order had already implemented [a] firewall […] to protect its corporate perimeter, which is capable of detecting logs and RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connection attempts from outside, including any attempts at unauthorized access to the corporate network. Specifically, the logs collected by the firewall were archived on the Order's infrastructure servers and sent to an archiving mechanism […] in order to obtain a duplicate copy of the logs. Furthermore, control of these logs was entrusted to the Order's employees, who periodically monitored the firewall logs to identify any suspicious access."

- "these measures were, therefore, overall suitable for promptly identifying a data breach for two main reasons [..., being] in line with the AgID Circular which, for the timely identification of breaches, deems it sufficient to adopt – among other things – measures that include recording any anomalies compared to normal network traffic to allow for offline analysis. Indeed, according to AgID, the adoption of DLP (Data Loss Prevention) mechanisms capable of autonomously identifying suspicious situations and sending an alert is to be considered a high-level measure to which the Order is not required to comply. Furthermore, the adoption of a more advanced alert and log monitoring mechanism would have required an investment, in terms of financial and human resources, that was disproportionate for the Order";

- "[...] to ensure constant monitoring of detected alerts, the Order should also have sufficient qualified personnel to carry out this activity, even on weekends and at night";

- “in any case, […] as soon as the Data Breach occurred, the Order initiated a process aimed at increasing the security level of its systems within the limits of the economic resources at its disposal.Specifically: […] software was installed […] that allows alerts to be received when Active Directory configurations change or when systems are accessed by specific users”;

- “[…] given the characteristics and methods of carrying out the attack […], the mechanism itself would not have been effective in preventing the breach […] and/or ensuring its more timely detection. In fact, for the alert mechanism in question to work, the attackers must generate anomalous traffic due to the volume, geographic origin, or time period of the accesses. Where such anomalous traffic is missing, the alert mechanism would therefore be unable to identify suspicious situations”;

- “[…] the attack on the Order [was] a brute force attack (i.e., the attackers repeatedly attempted to access the Order's IT resources using the login credentials of certain users) […]”;

- “[…] no "outbound traffic spikes" were recorded that would have triggered any alerts, given the following circumstances: a) the RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connection attempts from outside occurred on weekends or during the evening hours; b) the access attempts were not massive, but rather spaced out over time and avoided access from blocked countries; c) the attackers had access to "sample" files from the organization that allowed them to access the systems with the Order's credentials; and d) the traffic generated by the attackers was below the threshold, as it was quantified at a maximum of 5 GB, spread over several days, while the average traffic on the Order's systems is between 10 and 20 GB, depending on the activities (including maintenance and updates) performed daily;

- "In fact, it is not uncommon for the Order to conduct activities and events that require access to its systems, even on weekends and in the evenings. Consequently, the mere presence of nighttime or weekend traffic, which is also below the threshold, could not constitute evidence of illegitimate access, as it is plausible that legitimate users were connected to the Order's network." This is without considering that detecting anomalous traffic does not necessarily indicate an ongoing personal data breach, which could instead take some time to confirm—as in this case.

- "[…] thanks to the specific evasive techniques used in the attack, the attackers would still have been able to avoid any alert mechanisms […]";

- regarding the "failure to adopt a multi-factor authentication system, it should be noted that the Order, at the time the data breach occurred, had implemented a properly configured and monitored authentication system, in line with the provisions of the AgID Circular. In this regard, the AgID Circular requires the implementation of a two-factor authentication as a so-called "high" (not "standard") level measure only for privileged users and the assignment of administrative rights, considering the alternative measure of password strength, which […] was correctly adopted by the Order, as equivalent. Specifically, at the time of the events, the system used to authenticate the Order's users and access domain-certified systems (i.e., workstations and servers) was based on [company name]'s Active Directory, using [company name]'s VPN (Virtual Private Network) […] to ensure secure connections to the Order's systems. Furthermore, access to the user's PC required two steps: entering the disk encryption password and various domain credentials. Finally, specific credentials for use in IT authentication and authorization processes for data and email servers were assigned to the Order's employees. Furthermore, the assigned credentials had to meet the robustness requirements set forth in the AgID Circular. Specifically, passwords had to be 14 characters long and could not be reused multiple times. In fact, the system prevents users from reusing a password previously used to access the same computer system";

- "the Order has now added a dual authentication procedure based on: (i) use of a username and password (already present); (ii) a dual authentication certificate; and (iii) application of device trust";

- "in any case, cybercriminals' access to the computer systems did not occur through the theft of access credentials, but rather due to a system bug that was promptly fixed by the Order";

- regarding the "inadequate segmentation and storage of authentication credentials, there are no reasons why the segregation mechanism implemented by the Order should be considered inadequate, nor is there any specific role this system would have played in the context of the personal data breach." In fact, the AgID Circular merely requires the retention of credentials to "guarantee their availability and confidentiality" and, if digital certificates are used for authentication, to ensure adequate protection for private keys. These requirements are therefore met by the Order.

- "As a general rule, failure to segment passwords or inadequate password storage is primarily relevant when the attack occurs through the introduction of malware into the system. In this case, the lack of segmentation prevents the threat from being isolated, thus potentially leading to the malware's propagation throughout the entire IT infrastructure. In this case, however, the ransomware did not propagate to other systems, as the Order blocked the attack and encryption before it could extend to servers other than those targeted by the attack." Consequently, the lack of segmentation had no impact on the attack, and therefore its failure to be implemented cannot be considered questionable.

- "[…] following the Data Breach, the Order [has] nevertheless introduced a new network segmentation […which] will isolate any attacks [,] prevent them from spreading across the network and infecting other servers and devices […and] ensure that devices on the management network are not reachable from the LAN unless firewall rules are activated (only if necessary)."

- regarding the contested "failure to protect credentials with state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms […] it is […] essential to clarify that: (i) the email domain "opl.it" and the Active Directory domain used to access the Order's internal servers reside on different servers: the former on servers external to the Order (opl.it), while the latter on the Order's internal servers (opl.lan); (ii) the analysis conducted only covered the dark web and detected vulnerabilities only in the Order's external domain (opl.it); and (iii) the analyzed credentials refer exclusively to the email domain and do not in any way allow access to the Order's internal systems;

- therefore, "it is completely irrelevant that some of the aforementioned credentials were classified as "critical" and "high," since they belonged to email addresses that could not be used to access the Order's internal systems. Moreover, only 3 out of 12 users were employees of the Order, and none of them had a password classified as "critical" or "high." Many of the exposed credentials were, in fact, obsolete or invented [...]. Consequently, the alleged lack of encryption of these credentials appears completely unrelated to the dynamics of the attack."

- "[…] the credentials used to access the Order's internal systems were protected by state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms. Indeed, access to the servers was via Active Directory, which uses encryption by default. Finally, to introduce an additional layer of protection, the hard drives of users' computers were encrypted, requiring an additional initial password for access. These encryption measures are in line with the AgID Circular, which requires "analysis of data to identify those with particular confidentiality requirements (relevant data) and specifically those to which cryptographic protection should be applied."

- "It is appropriate to note the irrelevance of the reference made by this Authority to the Cryptographic Functions Guidelines – Password Conservation adopted with Order No. 594 of 7 December 2023 [web doc. No. 9962283], as they had not yet been adopted at the time the contested events occurred;

- "The Order is evaluating the adoption of an encryption system in line with the requirements set by the Guarantor, as well as by EU Directive 2022/2555."

- "The contested conduct […] (i) affected a small number of data subjects and personal data compared to those present in the Order's system (6.9 GB out of a total of 350 GB); (ii) created a high risk for a limited number of data subjects […] [and] the Order notified the data subjects impacted by a higher risk on an individual basis, while for the others it published a freely available notice on its website; (iii) resulted only in a loss of confidentiality, without affecting the integrity and availability of the data, the compromise of which was only temporary thanks to the measures taken by the Order to limit the negative effects and the presence of information backups; (iv) did not significantly impact the Order's systems […]”;

- “in order to improve breach detection and system security, as well as to prevent similar attacks in the future, the Order has: (i) created certified VPN access; (ii) adopted a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system; (iii) defined more stringent password policies; (iv) blocked nighttime access to the network; (v) disabled all server access and introduced stricter access rules; (vi) controlled the geolocation of external access; (vii) introduced further network segmentation […] to isolate potential new attacks and prevent them from spreading across the network and infecting other servers and devices; (viii) reconfigured existing network switches […]; (ix) limited remote access via VPN […]; (x) implemented new immutable backup systems […]; (xi) implement an air gap between the production and backup environments […] (xiii) modify VPN user connection rules, encrypt archives, and adopt a new cloud application for managing the Register”;

- “[…] the severity of the breach […] is high, with exclusive reference to the individuals to whom the exfiltrated disciplinary proceedings refer and the individuals cited in those proceedings, who represent only a very limited portion of the illicitly obtained data (i.e.,159 proceedings). Regarding the personal data of employees involved in the data breach, however, the only special categories of personal data impacted concern the union membership of these employees, due to the presence of only payment receipts for membership fees. Finally, with regard to the other categories of data subjects involved, particularly suppliers and other members of the Order not involved in disciplinary proceedings, the information affected by the personal data breach is predominantly in the public domain. In general, therefore, the data breach did not affect the most sensitive data processed by the Order.

During the hearing requested pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 6, of the Code and held on December 2, 2024 (see minutes, file no. 0141629 of the same date), the Order, represented by its lawyers, stated, in particular, that:

- "the attack […] was particularly sophisticated and elusive and, therefore, even adopting more advanced alert systems would not have been possible to detect it; In particular, the data exfiltration (approximately 5 GB) occurred progressively, at night and on holidays, without ever exceeding the average daily traffic threshold (approximately 10 to 20 GB)";

- "Although there is no specific evidence, the circumstances of the attack seem to suggest that it was aimed at obtaining specific data and documents and commissioned by unidentified individuals who had an interest in gaining possession of such data and documents or otherwise causing damage to the Order that would impact them. Moreover, the individuals in question likely had knowledge of the Order's IT systems (e.g., average traffic threshold)";

- "Regarding the measures adopted to ensure password security, which the Order believes were adequate, it must be emphasized that, given the above regarding the Order's small size and limited financial and organizational resources, the Order could not afford to carry out activities such as vulnerability assessments and penetration tests, or dark web checks aimed at preventively monitoring the possible loss of passwords. confidentiality of credentials”;

In response to a specific reservation made during the hearing, the Order, again through its lawyers, stated in a note dated December 11, 2024, in particular that:

- although in its defense brief, the Order stated that “the cybercriminals’ access to the computer systems did not appear to have occurred through the theft of access credentials, but rather due to a system bug that was promptly fixed by the Order […], it is appropriate to clarify that, from a purely technical IT perspective, the term “bug” was used in the brief to refer to a “vulnerability” in the systems that the cybercriminals exploited to gain illegitimate and easy access”;

- “specifically, the compromised vector used by the attackers appears to be the “XX server” – which exposed the Remote Desktop Protocol (“RDP”) service – from which external connections were made throughout the attack (i.e., from September 30, 2023 to October 3, 2023), with scans to detect any vulnerabilities. However, the first connection requests appeared to be failed RDP access attempts. The accesses, however, actually occurred during the final phase of the attack (i.e., from 11:12 PM on October 2, 2023 to 4:01 AM on October 3, 2023)”;

- “The RDP system is a system that allows remote access to a computer or server running on the same local network (LAN), allowing authorized users to view the screen and interact with the system as if they were physically present. However, to enable such remote connections, RDP requires open and publicly visible ports. This feature exposes RDP to external access by unauthorized parties”;

- “in this case, based on what emerges from the Incident Response Report […], it must be assumed that the attackers: (i) identified the vulnerability of the server that exposed the RDP service through active scans by automated agents or bots; and (ii) attempted to access the system using credentials presumably obtained from the dark web or through other automated tools used to make repeated login attempts that generate random username and password combinations until a valid one is identified (so-called brute force attack);

- "In any case, it is unlikely that the source of the Personal Data Breach is to be found solely in the exposed credentials relating to the "opl.it" domain […], as the stolen credentials refer only to the email domain and in no way permitted access to the Order's RDP system (which, however, is the system the cybercriminals actually accessed)";

- "The "opl.it" email domain and the Active Directory domain used to access the Order's internal servers reside on different servers […]; (ii) the analysis conducted revealed vulnerabilities only in the Order's external domain (opl.it); and (iii) the credentials used are email addresses that, in some cases, are not even associated with a valid account. In fact, only three out of twelve addresses were traceable to Order employees, while many of the exposed credentials were obsolete or invented [...], and in any case, unusable to access the RDP, which appears to be the system the attackers actually accessed.

- "The analysis of the data and logs made available by the organization's technical contact allowed us to identify the likely entry vector, specifically a server that exposed the Remote Desktop service."

- "In light of the above, access to the Order's IT systems occurred due to a vulnerability in an RDP access point on the Order's infrastructure, although the attackers attempted to use credentials that, in all likelihood, they already possessed (likely via the dark web) or generated through a brute force attack."

- "However, the stolen credentials did not allow access to the Order's network (i.e., the exposed RDP system). Therefore, even if the Order had adopted multi-factor authentication solutions, this would not have prevented the Personal Data Breach from occurring.

- "In any case, the Order's financial circumstances did not allow it to sustain the cost of a dark web scanning service to identify stolen credentials and perform periodic vulnerability assessments and penetration tests."

3. Outcome of the investigation.

3.1 Personal data protection legislation.

Pursuant to Article 5, paragraph 1, letter f), of the Regulation, the processing of personal data must be carried out in accordance with the principle of "integrity and confidentiality," according to which personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical and organizational measures.

Based on this principle, Article 32 of the Regulation provides that the data controller, taking into account the state of the art and the costs implementation, as well as the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. The data controller is responsible for implementing such measures and must be able to demonstrate that the processing is performed in compliance with the Regulation (see Articles 5, paragraph 2, and 24 of the Regulation; see the "Guidelines 07/2020 on the Concepts of Controller and Processor Under the GDPR," adopted by the European Data Protection Board on 7 July 2021, especially point 41).

3.2 Failure to adopt adequate measures to detect personal data breaches.

As shown in the documentation, "preliminary analyses of the logs of the Firewall […] installed to protect the company perimeter, the following was detected: during the period between September 30 and October 1, 2023, numerous external RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connection attempts were detected, addressed to the “XX” and “XX” machines […] [and that] starting from October 2nd, RDP sessions were recorded in the evening hours and continued until October 3rd, thus suggesting a persistent threat […] it is therefore probable that the illegitimate activities [had] begun on September 30th, 2023 and ended on the morning of October 3rd, 2023 with the execution of the Ransomware (see Incident Response Report (IR) - v.1.1 attached to the note dated June 19th, 2024, pages 8 - 9).

Only "on October 3, 2023, following the receipt of several reports from Order users reporting the inability to access the network," did the Order become aware of the encryption of some servers and the deletion of backup data, initially believing that this was due to a technical problem. Subsequently, only "following an in-depth analysis conducted by the System Administrator (ADS), concluded on October 10, 2023, was it possible for the Data Controller to understand that the Incident constituted a personal data breach pursuant to the Regulation (although the level of seriousness of the breach was not yet fully understood)" (Incident Response Report (IR) - v.1.1 attached to the note dated June 19, 2024, pages 8).

The Order had therefore failed to adopt adequate measures to promptly detect personal data breaches based on anomalous behavior resulting from access to the company network (such as the time and frequency of access, which tends to occur at night, and access from IP addresses in foreign countries) and from operations performed with domain accounts with or without administrative privileges (such as deactivating security measures or terminating processes and services). This was also due to the fact that "to ensure constant monitoring of detected alerts, the Order should also have sufficient qualified personnel to carry out this activity, including on weekends and at night" (note dated November 15, 2024, cited).

Regarding the defenses put forward by the Order following the administrative violation charge, it should be noted that, as recently reiterated by the Guarantor (see Decision No. 444 of July 17, 2024, web doc. No. 10057610), the fact that the Order had "adopted its own security measures in line with the provisions of the AgID Circular, complying with the standard level," does not, in general, exempt the data controller from the obligation to conduct a concrete assessment of the appropriateness of the measures adopted to ensure the security of processing, taking into account the context in which it operates. In particular, the adoption of the measures indicated in the aforementioned guidelines—which, moreover, constitute the "minimum security measures for the Italian public administration, given the enormous differences in size, mandate, types of information handled, exposure to risk, and so on that characterize the more than twenty thousand public administrations"—does not, in itself, guarantee compliance with security obligations. The aforementioned guidelines, in fact, aim to "indicate to public administrations the minimum ICT security measures that must be adopted in order to counter the most common and frequent threats to which their information systems are subject", starting "from the set of controls known as SANS 20 […] in version 6.0 of October 2015", and "ensure the minimum level of protection in most situations […] keeping in mind the enormous differences in size, mandate, types of information managed, exposure to risk, and anything else that characterizes the over twenty thousand public administrations", recommending that "each administration […] identify [within itself] any technical and/or organizational subsets, characterized by homogeneous security requirements and objectives, within which […] to homogeneously apply the measures suitable for achieving these objectives". Specifically, the Guidelines, having been issued based on the state of the art, technical knowledge, and cyber threats present in 2015, could not take into account the worsening cyber risks in recent years, also due to the spread and adoption, during the COVID-19 pandemic, of technological methods and tools to enable remote work and other activities. This change in scenario, given the significant increase in cybercriminal attacks, would have required a renewed assessment that weighed the new and far more serious risks associated with processing for the rights and freedoms of data subjects against the adequacy of the measures adopted. This assessment, since it could not be crystallized and, therefore, concluded at the time the processing was designed, should have been conducted periodically over time, also in light of technological developments. This also aimed to raise awareness of the need to mitigate the risks arising from personal data breaches. Therefore, the alleged compliance with the measures indicated in the aforementioned AgID Guidelines does not exhaust the data controller's obligation to adopt adequate measures based on its own risk assessment. Indeed, the Regulation, in accordance with the principle of accountability, mandates the data controller to identify and adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks posed by the processing, which, in this case, were particularly high given the nature of the data processed, the large number of data subjects, including vulnerable individuals, and, in the event of a breach, the potential negative consequences for data subjects should the confidentiality of the data be compromised.

Furthermore, the Order's defense argument that, given the particularly sophisticated nature of the cyber attack in question (progressive data exfiltration at night and on holidays, without ever exceeding the average traffic threshold), any real-time alert mechanisms for the timely identification of any anomalies would have been ineffective in any case, cannot be accepted. Such automatic mechanisms, when properly configured and monitored, allow the detection of events that, precisely because of the particular precautions employed by attackers, may escape human control. This can highlight certain events (e.g., traffic at night or on holidays, or on days when no scheduled maintenance is scheduled) even if they are not statistically significant (e.g., traffic in line with the average daily traffic threshold).

Nor is it relevant that, as the Order argued, adopting the aforementioned automated alert systems would have entailed a high and disproportionate financial cost for the Order, given that it is a public body with limited organizational and financial resources.

In this regard, it should be noted that Article 32 of the Regulation mentions "implementation costs" only among the factors that the data controller must take into account when identifying appropriate technical and organizational measures to address the risks posed by the data being processed (see Article 24 of the Regulation). This factor “implies that the controller does not employ a disproportionate amount of resources where alternative, less expensive but effective measures exist”, without prejudice to the fact that “the cost of implementation represents a factor to be taken into account in implementing data protection by design, and not a reason to refrain from implementing it”; Therefore, "the measures identified must […] ensure that the processing activity envisaged by the controller does not result in the processing of personal data in breach of the Principles, regardless of the cost of such measures. Controllers must be able to manage the overall costs in order to effectively implement all the Principles and, consequently, protect rights" (European Data Protection Board, "Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 - Data Protection by Design and by Default", adopted on 20 October 2020, paragraphs 24 and 25; see also ENISA, "Guidelines for SMEs on the security of personal data processing", December 2016, p. 12, which highlights that "the reference […] to implementation costs should not be interpreted as an excuse for inaction, but rather as an invitation to all stakeholders to simplify and reduce costs. In this sense, the approach to simplifying the notion of risk and the adoption of appropriate measures are essential for the correct implementation of this Article", or Article 32 of the Regulation).

It follows that, even if the data controller decides to adopt less costly technical and organizational measures, these must still be equally effective in mitigating the risks to the data. Indeed, as the Garante has highlighted, "implementation costs cannot be considered a factor that authorizes the data controller to lower the level of protection that the measures must adequately ensure; rather, they may constitute a factor to be taken into account when choosing between multiple solutions" (Provision No. 475 of July 17, 2024, web doc. No. 10057648).

In this case, the Order cannot, therefore, invoke the limitations of its organizational and financial resources to justify its failure to adopt adequate measures to address the risks arising from its processing. Furthermore, following the personal data breach in question, the Order decided to install a "software tool for detecting data security threats" (see note dated January 19, 2024, page 4), thus enabling the Entity to bear the financial cost of adopting this measure.

Data controllers are then required to consider the implementation costs along with the additional factors set forth in Article 32 of the Regulation, namely the "state of the art," the "nature, [...] scope, context, and purposes of processing," as well as the "risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons" (see Article 25 of the Regulation).

As for the "state of the art," it is "a dynamic concept that cannot be defined statically at a given point in time, but should be continuously assessed in the context of technological progress." it “imposes an obligation on controllers, when determining appropriate technical and organizational measures, to take into account current progress in technology available on the market”, with the consequence that “controllers must be aware of technological progress and remain constantly updated on the opportunities and risks for processing, in terms of data protection, arising from technologies and on how to implement and update measures and safeguards that ensure effective implementation of the principles and the rights of data subjects taking into account the evolution of the technological landscape” (“Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 - Data protection by design and by default”, cit., paragraphs 18-20).

Given, as mentioned above, the worsening cyber risk in recent years, the adoption of the aforementioned automated alert systems must be considered, in the context of the processing in question, an appropriate measure given the state of the art of technology and the current risk scenario. The "Guidelines 9/2022 on the Notification of Personal Data Breach Under the GDPR," adopted by the European Data Protection Board on March 28, 2023 (hereinafter, the "Notification Guidelines"), highlight that "the ability to promptly identify, address, and report a breach must be considered an essential aspect" of the technical and organizational measures that the data controller and processor must implement, pursuant to Article 32 of the Regulation, to ensure an adequate level of personal data security (paragraph 41; see Decision No. 444 of July 17, 2024, web doc. No. 10057610).

Regarding the "nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing," the Order should have duly taken into account the fact that, in handling disciplinary proceedings, it may process personal data of vulnerable individuals (patients; minors), including special categories of data or criminal convictions or offenses.

Article 32(2) of the Regulation further specifies that, in assessing the appropriate level of security, particular account must be taken of the risks presented by the processing, which arise in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data. In this regard, too, the Order, in identifying the necessary technical and organizational measures, should have considered the significant risks to data subjects that could arise from any disclosure of the aforementioned sensitive information, in terms of the consequences for their economic and social relationships, particularly with regard to their family, school, or work environment, as is evident from the report and complaints received.

In light of the foregoing considerations, it must be concluded that the Order's failure to adopt the aforementioned technical and organizational measures constitutes a violation of Articles 5(1)(f) and 32(1) of the Regulation.

3.3 Failure to adopt adequate measures to ensure the security of processing systems.

In partial rectification and clarification of the statements made during the preliminary investigation, the Order, supplementing the statements made during the hearing, stated that "access to the Order's IT systems occurred due to a vulnerability in an RDP access point on the Order's infrastructure, although the attackers attempted to use credentials that, in all likelihood, they already possessed (likely via the dark web) or generated through a brute force attack," specifying that "the stolen credentials did not allow access to the Order's network (i.e., the exposed RDP system)." Therefore, in the Order's opinion, "even if the Order had adopted multi-factor authentication solutions, this would not have prevented the personal data breach."

Recalling the points made in paragraph 3.2 above in relation to the provisions of Articles 24 and 32 of the Regulation, with particular regard to the impossibility of invoking implementation costs to justify the failure to adopt the necessary technical measures to protect data, and taking into account that the adequacy of the measures implemented by the data controller must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, based on the different criteria provided for by these articles and the data protection needs specifically inherent to the processing as well as the risks induced by the latter (see Court of Justice of the European Union, judgments C‑687/21, MediaMarktSaturn, of 25 January 2024, para. 38, and C‑340/21, Natsionalna agentsiaza prihodite, paras. 30 to 32), it must be noted that the processing carried out by the Order in the context in question would have required the adoption of appropriate technical and organizational measures according to the state of the art, in order to ensure the confidentiality of the personal data of the data subjects. As stated above, this is also true given the purposes of the processing (including those carried out in the context of disciplinary proceedings), the large number of data subjects, the sensitive nature of the personal data processed (including special categories and data relating to criminal convictions and offenses), and the potential risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, including vulnerable individuals (patients, minors, workers).

The investigation revealed, however, that the Order had not adopted adequate measures to ensure the security of its processing systems. Specifically, the Order had not adopted a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system, which could have prevented unauthorized access to the systems even if authentication credentials had been compromised. Only following the incident did the Order, in fact, deem it necessary to "adopt a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system" (see notification of November 20, 2023, section H, point 2 and note of January 19, 2024, pages 4-5).

It should also be noted that, although the Order stated that the credentials previously leaked and present on the dark web were not used for the attack in question, as they related to email, these credentials were not adequately protected by encryption. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the attackers attempted to use the same or similar credentials to carry out the attack.

Finally, the Order's statements show that the attack's entry vector server was running an obsolete operating system (XX), whose vulnerabilities (RDP service exposed on the default port) were exploited by the attacker to penetrate the Entity's infrastructure.

In light of the foregoing considerations, the failure to adopt adequate measures to ensure the security of processing systems at the time of the breach constitutes a violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter f), and 32, paragraph 1, of the Regulation.

4. Conclusions.

In light of the above assessments, it is noted that the statements made by the data controller during the investigation – the veracity of which may be held accountable pursuant to Article 168 of the Code – although worthy of consideration, do not address the concerns notified by the Office with the document initiating the proceedings and are insufficient to allow the dismissal of the present proceedings. Furthermore, none of the cases provided for by Article 11 of the Garante Regulation No. 1/2019 apply.

The Office's preliminary assessments are therefore confirmed and the Order is found to have violated Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter f), and 32, paragraph 1, of the Regulation.

Given that the violation of the aforementioned provisions occurred as a result of a single conduct (the same processing or related processing), Article 83, paragraph 1, of the GDPR applies. 3 of the Regulation, pursuant to which the total amount of the administrative fine does not exceed the amount specified for the most serious violation. Given that, in this case, the most serious violation, relating to Article 5, paragraph 1, letter f), of the Regulation, is subject to the sanction provided for by Article 83, paragraph 5, of the Regulation, as also referred to in Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Code, the total amount of the fine is to be quantified up to €20,000,000.

In this context, considering, in any case, that the conduct has exhausted its effects, given that, as highlighted above, the Order has declared that it has adopted appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent similar events in the future, the conditions for the adoption of further corrective measures pursuant to Article 58, paragraph 2, of the Regulation are not met.

5. Adoption of the injunction order for the application of the administrative pecuniary sanction and additional sanctions (Articles 58, paragraph 2, letters i) and 83 of the Regulation; Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code).

The Guarantor, pursuant to Articles 58, paragraph 2, letters i) and 83 of the Regulation as well as Article 166 of the Code, has the power to "impose a pecuniary administrative sanction pursuant to Article 83, in addition to the [other] corrective measures referred to in this paragraph, or in place of such measures, depending on the circumstances of each individual case." Within this framework, "the [Garante] Panel shall adopt the injunction order, by which it also orders the application of the additional administrative sanction, its publication, in full or in extract, on the Garante's website pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code" (Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Garante Regulation No. 1/2019).

In this regard, taking into account Article 83, paragraph 3, of the Regulation, in this case, violation of the aforementioned provisions is subject to the application of the pecuniary administrative sanction provided for in Article 83, paragraph 5, of the Regulation.

The aforementioned administrative fine imposed, based on the circumstances of each individual case, must be determined in amount taking into account the factors set forth in Article 83, paragraph 2, of the Regulation.

Considering that:

Although the Order had not adopted real-time alert systems for the timely identification of any anomalies, it had at least implemented a firewall capable of detecting logs and external RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connection attempts, including any attempts at unauthorized access to the network, and assigned certain of its employees to periodically monitor them (seeArt. 83, paragraph 2, letter a), of the Regulation);

The data exfiltration occurred progressively, generating traffic volumes large enough not to arouse suspicion, at night and on holidays, without ever exceeding the average traffic threshold, which evidently, for unknown reasons, was known to the attackers (see Art. 83, paragraph 2, letter a), of the Regulation);

The breach did not compromise the availability and integrity of the personal data processed by the Order (see Art. 83, paragraph 2, letter a), of the Regulation);

The breach, however, affected a large amount of personal data ("approximately 15,000 records"; "6.9 GB"), including personal data, contact details, payment information, identity document data, special categories of data (i.e., data revealing ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, sexual life or sexual orientation, health status), criminal convictions and offences, and data covered by professional secrecy. Consequently, the numerous data subjects to whom they refer ("3,000", some of whom are involved in various capacities in 159 disciplinary proceedings), including vulnerable individuals (minors, patients, workers), were exposed to potential risks of discrimination, identity theft, fraud, reputational risks, and other economic and social harm (Article 83, paragraph 2, letters a) and g), of the Regulation);

Given the aforementioned risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, as well as the current high level of cyber risk and the state of the art in the IT security sector, the Order's conduct, consisting in its failure to adopt the aforementioned technical and organizational measures to protect the data, must be considered negligent. It is understood that the data exfiltration and dissemination are in any case attributable to malicious conduct by a criminal organization ("NoEscape"), using a ransomware program that has spread relatively recently (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter b), of the Regulation).

In this case, the seriousness of the violation committed by the data controller is considered high (see European Data Protection Board, "Guidelines 4/2022 on the calculation of administrative pecuniary sanctions under the GDPR" of 24 May 2023, point 60).

Given the above, considering that the data controller, despite having a limited organizational structure (thirteen employees), is a public body of regional importance, which manages numerous members (25,499; source: www.opl.it), it is believed that, for the purposes of quantifying the fine, the following circumstances must be taken into consideration:

The breach, which, given the nature of the data involved and the categories of data subjects to whom it refers, is particularly serious, occurred as a result of the failure to adopt adequate technical and organizational measures, for which the Order bears a high degree of responsibility (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter d), of the Regulation);

The Order notified the personal data breach to the Guarantor pursuant to Article 13 of the GDPR. 33 of the Regulation and has cooperated effectively with the Authority during the investigation, having also adopted new technical and organizational measures to strengthen the security of processing and prevent similar cyberattacks in the future (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter f), of the Regulation);

There are no relevant previous violations committed by the data controller (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter e), of the Regulation).

Based on the above factors, assessed as a whole, the fine is set at €30,000 (thirty thousand) for the multiple violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter f), and 32, paragraph 1, of the Regulation, as an administrative fine deemed, pursuant to Article 83, paragraph 1, of the Regulation, to be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

It is also considered that, pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Italian Data Protection Authority Regulation No. 1/2019, this chapter containing the injunction order should be published on the Italian Data Protection Authority's website. This, as highlighted above, is in light of the particularly sensitive processing context in which the breach occurred, both due to the nature of the personal data being processed and the subjective characteristics of the data subjects, including vulnerable individuals.

Finally, it is noted that the conditions set out in Article 17 of Regulation No. 1/2019 are met.

NOW WITHOUT PREJUDICE, THE ITALIAN DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITY

declares, pursuant to Article 57, paragraph 1, letter f), of the Regulation, that the processing occurred in violation of Articles 5, paragraph 1, letter f), and 32, paragraph 1, letter f), of the Italian Data Protection Authority. 1 of the Regulations, within the timeframe set forth in the reasons;
