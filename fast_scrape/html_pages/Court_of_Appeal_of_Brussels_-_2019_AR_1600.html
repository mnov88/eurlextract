<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>In August 2018, the DPA received a complaint from a customer (the data subject) regarding a liquor store (the controller). According to the complaint, the store had required this person to let them scan their electronic ID in order to issue a customer card. After an investigation, the DPA concluded that the controller had breached the GDPR. More specifically, according to the DPA the controller:
</p><p>1. Did not have a valid legal basis for processing. Consent was not freely given because no alternative was offered to the complainant, in violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a>; 
</p><p>2. Did not provide the complainant with enough information prior to the processing, in violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a>;
</p><p>3. Processed more personal data than necessary, including national ID number, date of birth and gender, in violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(c) GDPR</a>. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>The appeal against the DPA's decision was based on 9 points, among which was the claim that the DPA violated <a href="/index.php?title=Article_52_GDPR#1" title="Article 52 GDPR">Article 52(1)</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_54_GDPR#2" title="Article 54 GDPR">Article 54(2)</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR#2" title="Article 82 GDPR">Article 82(2) GDPR</a>. Most importantly, the controller challenged two of the three findings of the DPA, which had led to the fine: the absence of a valid legal basis for personal data processing and the breach of the data minimization principle. They did not contest the lack of information.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Court annulled the DPA’s decision as it was insufficiently reasoned and based on a legislation that was not applicable at the time of the complaint. The Court did not have the power to order the DPA to pay back the fine, as that falls outside of its jurisdiction, but it did quash the decision imposing the fine.
</p><p>The Court held that, first, the DPA had no evidence to support the finding that the controller was actually processing the national ID number of the data subject. Second, the controller was not obliged to give the data subject an alternative way of creating a discount card because the relevant provision of the e-ID law was not applicable at the time. Thirdly, the Court found that no personal data processing took place because the complainant had refused to have her e-ID scanned. Fourth, the Court considered that the DPA’s finding that the data subject’s date of birth was not used to verify their age, was a mere assumption. Fifth, the DPA should not have assumed that the data subject would have suffered an undeniable disadvantage by missing out on discounts available via the client card. The Court found that this is not a disadvantage because only potential benefit was lost in this case.
</p><p>Hence, the Court upheld the appeal against and annulled the DPA's decision.

       family business with more than 40 years of experience. It has offices at ______, _____ and
       _____.


        2.     In the past, the Apellant used paper loyalty cards in order to obtain benefits.
       know to customers. Recently, the appellant has switched to an electronic

       Cash register software system that also allows the electronic identity card (elD card}
       of a customer to be read electronically using the barcode and on this basis

       granting advantages on purchases.

       The present case concerns the administrative procedure launched by the GBA.

       against the appellant following the complaint of a (1} client of the appellant. The name of
       this customer is otherwise irrelevant and is therefore not mentioned. The customer is hereinafter referred to as

       referred to as 'person concerned'.


       3.     On 28 August 2018, the party concerned lodged a complaint with the
       Data protection authority because she did not want her elD card to be read in
       to grant discounts on its purchases (section A.1}. The complaint was as follows:


              Presentation of the facts
              On Friday 8 June, I went to buy drinks from the appellant,___________.

              __________________________. With a few bottles of spirits it was a high
              amount. At the checkout - arrived they asked me if I would not like a loyalty card.
              I wish. I<i>ia "They asked my identity card to read it in. l</i>
              replied that I didn't want to give my identity card, but that I would feel free to give the
              the data needed to create a loyalty card on paper for a short while
              wanted to put. I was refused the loyalty card - they only make

              customer cards by reading the identity card.

              This/this scenario happened again on Saturday 30 June - this time in the shop
              of drinks trade appellant at ________________________. Because that day we
              having a BBQ with a grate group, the bill for booze was again a hefty

              amount. When I arrived at the checkout they asked me if I would not like a loyalty card.

                                                              �

              I said 'yes'. They asked me to read my identity card and I answered.

              dot I didn't want to give my identity card, but dot I feel free to give the data that I need
              wanted to put the goods on paper before creating a loyalty card. The
              customer card was refused to me - one creates enke/ k/anten cards by
              of reading the identity card. At dot moment there were
              different people at the deck mass. One of them also made the remark
              dot it cannot dot for a customer's card the identity card must be read in/receive
              warden. The lady at the checkout said dot she had nothing to do with this and now dot this

              was a mani�on of work.

              Maybe a k/eine remark: I'm 51 years old and I really don't look like a/s anyone
              of 16 years of age:)

       In other words, the person concerned agreed to the processing of her personal data

       information by the appellant to receive a loyalty card. However, it did not wish these
       Processing took place by means of reading her elD card.

2018. This law is therefore not applicable to the facts giving rise to the current dispute.
since the complaint dates from 28 August 2018.

At the time of the complaint, the text was as follows:
       "Any automated check of the card by optical or other/eesprocessing means must
       be the subject of a royal decree, no opinion of the sectoral committee of the

       National Register referred to in section 15 of the Act of 8 August 1983 on the regulation of an
       National Register of Natural Persons, ..,

The motives of the inspectorate - which the GBA states serve as a basis for the
decision - are unlawful. A law that was absolutely inapplicable at the time of the complaint and
a "recommendation" which has no legal force cannot serve as a basis for the

assessment of conduct as contrary to the legislation in force.

It has not been demonstrated, nor has it been conclusively proven, that at the time of the complaint a
The alternative had to be offered.

The contested decision is also under consideration:

       "The Chamber of Disputes also notes the processing of customer data.

       of the opinion that the infringement of Article 5.1. c)AVG has been proven.

No EID card was offered by the complainant in this case, so there is no processing at all
of its data. Therefore, the GBA does not show any actual infringement in relation to

personal data.





             I PAGE 01- 00001582885-0027-0033-01-01-�



             L _JCourt of Appeal Brussels 2019/AR/1600-p. 28





At that time, the complainant was not (yet) legally obliged to offer alternatives. This is different since
23 December 2018, but that regulation could not have been applied retroactively by the GBA.

In addition, the Dispute Carner is wrongly based on a number of unsubstantiated assumptions:
- that a loyalty card of a beverage company would not have been used to check the

    a ban on the sale of alcohol to minors;
- that the complainant would suffer an undeniable disadvantage as a result of the creation of a

    loyalty card, discounts would run riot. This is not a disadvantage because only a
    possible additional advantage is lost (the Court emphasises). The situation is different when the EID card
    request a legal or contractual right (e.g. the right to a guarantee) to

    to be shortened or retained.


A breach of Article 5.1. c)AVG has not been proven in this specific case.


The appellant's sixth plea is well-founded on this point.

8.2. Infringement opart. 6.1. AVG:

The GBA shall further base its decision on a breach of Article 6.1. AVG, namely that the

the lawfulness of the processing is subject to the data subject's consent for the
softening of his personal data for one or more specific purposes or the processing thereof
is necessary in order to safeguard the legitimate interests of the
controller or of a third party, except where interests or fundamental rights
and fundamental freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data,

outweigh those interests, especially when the person involved is a single child.

The GBA states:
       "Contrary to what the defendant argues, there can be no
       there is consent a/s legal basis for the processing, as the consent

       within the defendant's current modus operandi, cannot in any way be regarded as a
       free consent within the meaning of Article 4.11. AVG, in the absence of an alternative system dot
       Allow/allows the creation of a loyalty card without the use of the electronic identity card,
       which makes it possible for the person concerned to benefit from discounts even in such cases.


       In this context, the Dispute Settlement Chamber also refers to the Group 29 Guidelines on
       authorisation in accordance with Regulation 2016/6792 stating that the element
       implies "free" work/rich choice and control for those involved. As a general rule, the

       can benefit from discounts by m_ ddel of their electronic identity card, and by the
       the defendant is not offered any alternative to the creation of a loyalty card

9.     The sanction


In addition to the fact that the contested decision does not contain an adequate statement of reasons (see point 8.3.
for this), the penalty imposed, namely a fine of €10,000, is in turn inadequate
motivated.

lndien with the GBA may have argued that it is not every possible sanction of Article 83.2 AVG
it should be overflowing and it should not justify why some sanctions were not considered,

this does not detract from the fact that the choice of the sanction imposed is adequate
must be substantiated. When determining the sanction in concrete terms, the following should be taken into account
general criteria should be leading:

     the seriousness of the infringement;
     the duration of the infringement;

     the necessary deterrent effect to prevent further infringements.

The GBA shall determine the manner in which it considers that a sanction is appropriate.

However, as stated above, a decision of the GBA with regard to (the amount of) an
financial penalty is not binding on the Market Court.


The Market Court shall assess the extent of a possible sanction in such a way that, on the one hand, in
is appropriate to the circumstances and proportionate to the infringement found
and to the capacity of the party committing the infringement.


The mere statement that the infringement relates to a fundamental legal principle of
Data protection is not enough. The nature and seriousness of the infringements constitute a

elements of the dossier (e.g. whether it is a one-off infringement or not,
what the impact is generally considered to be in legal life, or any intention or intent by virtue of

of the il'.l offender is demonstrated,.....) and where - in the absence of a clear

concrete facts - at least a justification must be given as to why a sanction less far-reaching than
the imposition of a fine of€ 10 000 could not be of such a nature as to deter the infringements
to put an end to it. Only if these requirements of sufficient, clear and transparent

criteria of effectiveness and proportionality

defendant in the absence of an a/ternative for the creation of the c/antic file on grand of the

data processing" and from . the data of the dispute it appears that the plaintiff has never given her
has made identity information available to her, so that she cannot suffer any personal disadvantage
and the fact that no alternative was available was not a valid legal basis on
the moment of the complaint, it follows that oak is the sanction in itself (oak even if infringements have been proven)
have been) illegal.


For that reason alone, the contested decision should be annulled. Oak the Eighth
middeI of the appellant is well-founded.

The reasons currently put forward by the GBA in conclusion (No 106) to post factum the imposed and
sanctions implemented cannot be taken into account. The

the offender must be informed of the nature of the sanction before the imposition of a sanction
which is under consideration and of its scale (where a fine is contemplated). The
the offender must be warned (with a view to avoiding unnecessary sanctioning)
and have the opportunity to defend themselves on the issues proposed by the Dispute Settlement Chamber

10.    The publication.

To the extent that the sanctioning of infringements of the AVG and the GBA Act should be of a nature to
should be partly dissuasive, the Market Court recommends that the GBA recommends that the present judgment
publish on its website omitting the identification details of the person concerned
