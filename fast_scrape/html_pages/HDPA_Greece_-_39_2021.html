<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A bus driver ("X") working for the Municipal Transport Company of Rhodes ("RODA") was dismissed following a controversial incident. After having been dismissed, X asked RODA to provide him with a certificate of service. According to the applicable Greek law, such certificate should indicate the identity of the individual concerned, the type of occupation, as well as the period of employment. RODA however delivered a certificate which also included, in addition to the legally required information, the fact that X had been fired because of a criminal act. X considered that adding this information on the certificate was disproportionate and could cause him prejudice.
</p><p>Exercising his right to access under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15 GDPR</a>, X requested RODA to provide him with a copy of the video-tape from the bus camera in order to verify what had happened on the day of the controversial incident. In accordance with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12(3) GDPR</a>, RODA had the obligation to answer that request within one month upon receipt. RODA however never replied to X's request. 
</p><p>X considered that by acting this way, RODA had infringed the GDPR. He therefore lodged a complaint with the Greek DPA. During the procedure, RODA explained that it had orally informed X of the fact that the video-tapes of the bus were systematically deleted after 7 days. X, however, denied having received that information.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>After considering all the facts of the case, the Greek DPA found that RODA had breached <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1) GDPR</a> (principle of data minimisation), as well as <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12(3)</a> <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">and 15 GDPR</a> (right of access by the data subject - obligation to reply within a month). In particular, the Greek DPA considered that, by adding on the certificate of service an information that was unnecessary and which could cause prejudice to the data subject, RODA had infringed the principle of data minimisation. Furthermore, by not replying to X's request to be provided with a copy of the video-tape, RODA had infringed its obligation with respect to access requests. The Greek DPA therefore decided to impose on RODA a fine of 5,000 EUR for breach of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12(3)</a> <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">and 15 GDPR</a>, and a fine of 3,000 EUR for breach of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(c) GDPR</a>.

                                                               No. Prot.2001



                              DECISION 39/2021

                                    (Department)

   The Personal Data Protection Authority

Department at its headquarters on 26.05.2021 at the invitation of its President,

in order to examine the case referred to in the background hereof.

Attended by the Vice President G. Batzalexis, disabled by the President

of the Authority K. Menoudakou, the regular members of the Authority S. Vlachopoulos and K.

Lambrinoudakis, as rapporteur and the alternate member of the Authority G. Tsolias,

to replace the regular member Ch. Anthopoulos, who, although summoned
legally in writing, did not attend due to disability. You were present without right

K. Karveli, Specialist Scientist-Lawyer, as Assistant Rapporteur,

who left after the discussion of the case and before the conference and the

decision making and E. Papageorgopoulou, employee of the administrative department

Affairs of the Authority, as Secretary.



   The Authority took into account the following:

   With the no. prot. Γ / ΕΙΣ / 1084/20 and Γ / ΕΙΣ / 2648/20 his complaints to the
Authority, A complains to the Municipal Transport Company of Rhodes "RODA" for not

legal processing of his personal data.

   Specifically with the no. prot. Γ / ΕΙΣ / 1084/20 his complaint complains that

following his dismissal from the Municipal Transport Company of Rhodes

"RODA", asked for a certificate of previous service that he worked in the company, which

granted, but adding in breach of the principle of proportionality

that he was fired for a criminal act, thereby provoking, as

claims, damage to his interests.
