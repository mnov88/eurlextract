<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>In September 2019, an individual filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against a boating club regarding the publication of a non-redacted judgment containing their personal data by the club on its website and Facebook page.
</p><p>In January 2020, after receiving a notice informing it of the investigation, the boating club responded that it removed the link to the judgment from the relevant pages, but argued that it nonetheless considered the publication to have been lawful due to the legitimate interest (per <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(f) GDPR</a>) it pursued.
</p><p>However, in June 2020 the claimant provided evidence to the AEPD that the judgment was still available on the website if one entered its name into Google search. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3><p>
In light of the above, the Spanish DPA held that the boating club unlawfully published the copy of the judgment containing the personal data of the individual, as it could not base such processing on a valid legal basis under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a>. It rejected the argument of the boating club that the publication was lawful under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(f) GDPR</a>, citing the judgment in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=190322&amp;doclang=EN">C-13/16 (‘Rīgas satiksme')</a> as the appropriate test to be followed to determine whether processing can be based on legitimate interest: </p><blockquote><p>"first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed; second, the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued; and third, that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned by the data protection do not take precedence.</p></blockquote><p>After a balancing of the public's right to information against the complainant's fundamental right to the protection of their data, the AEPD held that the public benefit in publishing the judgment was insufficient to base the publication on legitimate interest per <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1#f" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1)(f) GDPR</a>.
</p><p>As such, the AEPD imposed a fine of €6000 on the boating club for its infringement of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6(1) GDPR</a>.

The RGPD defines in its article 4:


1) "personal data": any information about an identified or identifiable natural person
("the interested"); An identifiable natural person shall be deemed to be any person whose identity

can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as

  7) “controller” or “controller”: the natural or legal person, authority

These facts suppose the commission of the defendant of an infraction of article 6.1 of the

RGPD that indicate the legitimate bases for the treatment:
"one. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following conditions is met:


a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data for one
or several specific purposes;

b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party is
part or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;


c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation applicable to the
data controller;

d) the treatment is necessary to protect the vital interests of the interested party or another
Physical person;


e) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers vested in the data controller;

f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued by the

responsible for the treatment or by a third party, provided that said interests are not
prevail the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the interested party that
require the protection of personal data, in particular when the interested party is a child.”

The defendant, a party to the civil judicial proceeding, establishes the technical and
organizational and decides as responsible to enable access to the judgment in full with
all personal data when adding it to your website and on FACEBOOK. Probably
was not properly deindexed and is accessible through search engines,

throwing the same literal as when the links existed. The sentence treats the data of the
claimant in relation to the challenge of the disciplinary sanction imposed by the
claimed, sports association. The (...) of the Club that succeeded that of the claimant, detected
a series of irregularities and initiated the aforementioned disciplinary file. The judgment reviews
the actions of the imputed claimant reproaching him for his conduct in the management of the

Club affairs. It refers to the right of association and the private disciplinary sphere and the
application and statutory legitimacy of the Club.

The defendant is the one who exposed it in the open, not only for the partners, the sentence.

 He argues in the transfer of the claim that there was in his day, as a legitimizing basis, the

article 6.1.f) of the RGPD considering that your right to information and
has a legitimate interest in communicating the facts to the general public, (...), adding that
days before several written media outlets had echoed the news
identifying the claimant with the facts.

To be legitimate data processing based on legitimate interest, three must be fulfilled:
cumulative requirements, namely, first, that the data controller or third party
zero or third parties to whom the data is communicated pursue a legitimate interest; second
Firstly, the need to process personal data to satisfy the legitimate interest

fundamental rights of the interested party (judgment of May 4, 2017, Rīgas satiksme, C-
13/16, EU:C:2017:336, paragraph 28).

In this case, the concurrence of two fundamental rights recognized in the
Constitution: the fundamental right to the protection of personal data of the
people whose data appear collected in the judicial resolutions, mainly the

claimant and the fundamental right to freedom of information of the association, the Club
that publishes collide and the defendant considers that he has the right to the aforementioned
exposition. However, the relevance of the position and responsibility of the claimant is not

It is not a criminal matter either, but a civil matter that concerns the members of the Club, and it must be
question whether said purpose of informing can be feasible without exposing personal data

contained in a sentence in which one has been a claimed party and at the same time
disciplinary instructor, and if this is in accordance with the principle of proportionality and
adequacy in the use of the data.

On the other hand, this prevalence among rights must be based on exceptions to the
application of data protection regulations “only to the extent that they result

necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing the freedom of
expression and information. In this sense, and expressing ourselves in the terminology
established in the LOPDGDD, the exceptions to the application of said rule must
be understood as manifestations of the principle of proportionality, enshrined in the
Article 5.1 c) of the Organic Law, according to which "Personal data will only be
may collect for treatment, as well as submit them to such treatment, when they are

adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the scope and purposes
determined, explicit and legitimate for which they have been obtained”. Does this mean that
The disclosure of information containing personal data should be considered lawful.
in the cases and areas in which said disclosure is adequate, pertinent and
not excessive in relation to the free exercise of freedom of information. In this way, the
information to be disclosed should be that which is necessary so that information

are relevant to the interests of the association can be known by their
members, understanding public relevance as that which serves the general interest in the
information and does so by referring to a public matter such as facts or events that
affect all citizens.

However, this is not about expressing information or communicating facts that are not

discussed are real, but a document, the sentence integrates in open, with all the
details, not aspects or comments of it, which are exposed outside the circle of
Club members, to whom the Statutes are applicable, and in pdf format which means more
versatility in sending, downloading and forwarding. The information of the management of the association,
the loss of their property or assets affects the 900 associated with said entity, by
circle to which the management of those interests reaches and they could have been informed of the

sense of it. The respondent indicates that since many of the partners do not reside in the
municipality, and that the integrated publication contributes to the objectivity of the information, being
reasons for exposure. It is not disputed that it may be important and that they are the
partners who must be informed and could have had knowledge, although it could be

the prevalence of the legitimate interest in the open exhibition of the

civil sentence integrates and its possible consultation in the search engine.

On the other hand, the fact that the judicial proceedings are public does not justify that these data
were revealed in an area other than the judicial process, and that they are exposed in addition to

the performances of the (...).

Knowledge of the sentence integrates with the data of the claimant. For this, the claimed
associated the sentence to its website, considering that the automated treatment by which

offers on its website and through the search engine, obtaining the sentence is a treatment of
data.

In the present case, moreover, the judgment was not final, his appeal was pending.
The respondent treats the claimant's data exposing the entirety of the sentence in its
open web, not restricted to its partners. In this case, the information exercise of the
claimed is only related to the faculties it represents, its associates and the

management related to them. The prevalence of the right to freedom of information
on the right to data protection must be interpreted consistently with what is
provided in the data protection regulations, considering this exception to the
application of data protection regulations only to the extent that they result
necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing the freedom of
expression and information. In this sense, to inform, in this case the sentence

integrates, completely dealing with everything related to the matter in an irrelevant way
and excessive by an entity that represents the interests of a group, individuals, a
association not of a public nature, and treating the data for all people by having
universal access on its website, not being a criminal matter but an internal disciplinary one,
considering that the treatment that takes place through the incorporation and

automation of the consultation on its website, does not respond to the scheme of article 6.1.f) of the
RGPD, since the right to know the full sentence does not prevail by any person,
on the affected party's right to privacy, given the broad terms in which it is

of the associates. The ***POSITION.1 represents the institution, both in public spheres

as private, against individuals or legal entities, private or public, which does not mean
that is or holds in itself a public representation as claimed by the defendant. The right
of the claimant, so that their data is not used either in a surprising way, or in
social networks, or web associated with an integral sentence with access for third parties must
then prevail over the general exposure obtained from the search.

Therefore, the allegation of the defendant of legitimacy of data processing is not upheld.

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, in order to set the amount of the sanction of a fine
to impose in the present case for the infringement of article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, of which
holds the claimed party responsible, they are considered concurrent as aggravating
following factors that reveal greater unlawfulness and/or culpability in the conduct of the
reclaimed:

account the nature, scope or purpose of the treatment operation in question as well
such as the number of interested parties affected and the level of damages they have suffered.
suffered.


Originally, the entire sentence, despite the possibility of being able to appeal, appeared
exposed at the same time in two links, the web and the FACEBOOK page, not implementing
ultimately an effective data removal mechanism.

-Article 83.2.b) GDPR. “Intentionality or negligence in the infringement”: Aspect that

relates the execution of the action to the subject, in the sense of not only imputability of
the infraction to its responsible, but the fact of being able to aggravate or reduce the sanction according to the
degree of guilt. Regarding the imputability to the responsible subject, the principle of
guilt, prevents the admission in the sanctioning administrative law of the
strict liability, although it is also true that the absence of intentionality
It is secondary since this type of infraction is normally committed by a

guilty or negligent action which is sufficient to integrate the subjective element of the
guilt. What is valued in this section is its analysis for the graduation of the sanction (art.
40 LRJPAC), observing the specific diligence displayed in the action by the
responsible, which excludes the imposition of a sanction, solely based on the mere
result, that is to say to the principle of strict liability. The succession in the (...)s does not exempt

of the administrative responsibility for the actions produced in the preceding ones, nor
may suppose an eventual change, a blur in the enforceability of behaviors that have been
produced and recognized. Having the claimed the possibility of having acted
differently than you did, the claim was moved and not all links were removed
to the sentence, proving lack of diligence.


-Article 83.2.c) “any measure taken by the data controller or data processor

to alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties” Failing to eliminate
of the data, it follows that it did not have adequate and effective measures to eliminate the
data.


Considering the exposed factors, the valuation reached by the fine for the im-
putada is 6,000 euros, without prejudice to what results from the instruction of the procedure.
