                RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

to the following


                                  BACKGROUND

FIRST: On 03/08/2022, a claim was entered into this Agency
presented by A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complaining party) for a possible

non-compliance with the provisions of the data protection regulations
staff.

The statement of claim is a reproduction of a complaint filed by the
complaining party in which it states the following:


“Complaint for massive dissemination of video recorded without the consent of the victim, in
social networks (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) and WhatsApp.

[…]


FIRST.- On January 6, 2022, around 3 a.m., he was in the
***ADDRESS.1, with his dog (…). My client (…) found himself quite
unwell due to the probable ingestion of alcoholic beverages, for which reason it was
To stop (…).


SECOND.- Subsequently and due to the video that we will now indicate, apparently a
unknown person approached with his vehicle driving and with his cell phone from the
driver's seat, without the consent of my client, recorded on the aforementioned route
public to my represented during a recording period of 1 minute and 35
seconds (…).


In it, it is clearly observed how the driver of the vehicle approaches with the
vehicle and records my client with evident bad faith, to such an extent that he tells him (he
transcribes part of what is said in the video).

In the image it is clearly observed how my client was in very

poor physical condition as described above, holding on to the trash can.

We understand that the attitude of the person who records the video is completely inconsiderate and
disproportionate, laughing and mocking D.A.A.A., without any cause, and not even
offers to help you in such a situation, omitting all possible help.


In the video it is evident that the face of my client can be seen, being
perfectly recognizable. My client is not a public person.
