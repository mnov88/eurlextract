<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by the Spanish cooperative company Digitorium Sociedad Cooperativa Pequeña (the claimant), stating that the defendant had obtained the personal data of its members from the preliminary proceedings of an upcoming trial, and had used such data to send those members an individual letter requesting the extrajudicial payment of an amount of money related to the court issue (an Intellectual Property matter).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>The defendant answered to the first AEPD investigation requests stating that the claimant's members are the alleged offenders of the rights of its client, and that, on grounds of procedural economy and good faith, it is quite common for lawyers to try a friendly solution before starting court proceedings; besides, it stated that the judicial authority had already judged that the legal claim of such client was appropriate, and that there was a legitimate interest in processing those personal data for the purpose of defending its rights. The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure, and the defendant answered admitting that, although it is true that the members of the claimant had not been informed on all the points of Art. 14 GDPR when the letters were sent, it had already updated its draft letter for communications with third parties, and it attached a sample of such letter.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>Thus, the AEPD understood that the defendant has infringed Article 14 of the GDPR, as, although the processing activity could be perfectly based on its legitimate interest, it had not provided the members of the claimant with all the legal information. Consequently, after considering some circumstances [(i) the defendant had already amended its information clause; (ii) there are no previous infringements of the law by the defendant, (iii) the hypothetical imposition of an administrative fine would be disproportionate, considering that the main activity of the defendant is not directly related to the processing of personal data] the AEPD decided to impose a warning to the defendant.

The communication took place in the framework of a civil judicial procedure of
claim of intellectual property rights, but the producer, CRYSTALIS

ENTERTAINMENT UG, has used it to send letters to IP holders
requesting the extrajudicial payment of an amount.

SECOND: The present claim was transferred to the defendant on August 21,
2019, requiring you to send this Agency within a month,
information on the response given to the claimant for the facts denounced, as well as

as the causes that have motivated the incidence and the measures adopted.

In response to said request, the defendant stated that the claimants are
the alleged infringers of the rights of our client, whose identity and other
Contact details have been disclosed by express order of the Commercial Court no.

*** COURT. 1, first by Order of September 3, 2018 (by which

adequate for their protection that the Law also provides when regulating the specific
preliminary diligence adopted.


Indeed, according to art. 258.1 LEC, the measure is only agreed "If the court
I will appreciate that the diligence is adequate to the purpose that the applicant pursues and that
just cause and legitimate interest concur in the request ".

Therefore, the competent judicial body has already determined that in my claim
The client has a legitimate interest and that they have the data of the alleged

offenders is a claim appropriate to the purpose pursued by him, which is no other
that the protection of their intellectual property rights.

For this reason it considers that none of the specific precepts that in
The claim is considered violated:

                                             III

In the present case, it is stated in the first place that the respondent, once he has
of customers' personal data, instead of using the personal data that

has achieved in the Preliminary Proceedings procedure to obtain
exclusively the jurisdictional protection as required by art. 259.4 of the LEC sends them
a letter demanding a sum of money from them.

Therefore, the complainant considers that the data has been used by the complainant

personal for purposes other than those specifically provided for in the regulations,
causing a violation and violation of data protection regulations.



C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/10








In this sense, this Spanish Agency for Data Protection considers that, in
relationship with the lack of legitimacy for the processing of personal data of the
Euskaltel customers, it is necessary to take into account the response of the head of the Court

of the Mercantile nº *** COURT.1, in the order nº *** AUTO.1 of January 8, 2019, at
Euskaltel's opposition to the provision of personal identification data
holders of the requested IPs.


In the SECOND Legal Reasoning, section 8 it is stated: “8. Application

unnecessary information. The operator alleges that information is requested (landline,
mobile, email) that is part of the privacy of users and exceeds
necessary for the intended purposes.


The Judge does not share Euskaltel's assessment. The data referred to is the necessary

to contact users and be able to file a legal claim against them or,
in his case, extrajudicial. "


Furthermore, in section 9 the Magistrate states the following: “9.1. Legality. Alleges the
operator that the report is the result of interference by a foreign company

in the personal data and content of the communications that constitutes a
infringement of the European Data Protection Regulation. (…)


In this case, there is no evidence that the program for the protection of the rights of

intellectual protection data other than the IP address has been obtained and it is
being used to claim before the civil courts for the infraction of
such rights. Therefore, both the obtaining of the data and the
its use.



In this sense, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 establishes as principles relating to the
treatment, the collection of data for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes to
be treated in accordance with these purposes, and the limitation of the data to what is necessary in
relationship with the purpose for which they are treated (art. 5.1. b and c), and article 6 considers
lawful treatment necessary to satisfy legitimate interests pursued

by the person responsible for the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said
interests do not prevail over interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In
Regarding the fundamental right to confidentiality of communications, it is not affected
for the ‘obtaining the data relative to the IP address.”



                                            IV


In this case, it is taken into account that the respondent must provide the information
indicated in article 14 of the RGPD, when personal data has not been
obtained from the interested party.

The defendant, in particular, on October 5, 2020, has stated in response to the
requirement of this Agency that the information currently offered in the
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/10








communications sent by this professional office is, verbatim, the
next:

"Your personal data are processed for the exclusive purpose of exercising the rights of
CRYSTALIS ENTERTAINMENT UG claimed by this communication.

Your data will be kept for five years from the resolution of this
conflict (understood as judicial or extrajudicial satisfaction), with the exception of
the identification data essential to fulfill the eventual commitment not to
to claim again or not to address you again.

We inform you that you have the right to request access to your personal data
object of treatment, its rectification, the limitation of its treatment and portability
of the same (without allowing in this case the deletion, opposition or a limitation

treatment that prevents the satisfaction of the legitimate interest pursued by our
client).

For the exercise of your rights you can direct communication, attaching a copy of your
DNI or equivalent document, to *** EMAIL.1 or to LVCENTVM LEGAL S.L. in the
address at the bottom of this letter.

Likewise, and especially if you consider that you have not obtained full satisfaction in the
exercise of your rights, you may file a claim with the national authority
of control by contacting the Spanish Agency for Data Protection "


                                            V


By virtue of the provisions of article 58.2 of the RGPD, the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, as a control authority, has a set of
corrective powers in the event of an infringement of the precepts of the

RGPD.


Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following:

“2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following corrective powers
listed below:

(…)
b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with warning

when the treatment operations have infringed the provisions of this
Regulation;"

(...)
“D) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of

treatment are in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified time; "
“I) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition to or instead of

the measures mentioned in this section, according to the circumstances of each
particular case;"



C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/10








Article 74.a) of the LOPDGDD, under the heading “Infractions considered minor
has:

 "They are considered minor and will prescribe a year the remaining offenses of character
merely formal of the articles mentioned in sections 4 and 5 of article 83
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, in particular, the following:

a) Failure to comply with the principle of transparency of information or the right
of the data subject for not providing all the information required by the articles
13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "



In accordance with the facts presented, the defendant has violated article 14 of the
RGPD, the infringement of which is penalized with a warning, in accordance with article
58.2.b) of the RGPD, when collecting through said form basic data of the
users and consider that the administrative fine that may be incurred in accordance with

provisions of article 83.5.b) of the RGPD would constitute a disproportionate burden
for the claimed, whose main activity is not directly linked to the
processing of personal data, since there is no evidence of the commission of any infringement
above regarding data protection.


                                            SAW

On the other hand, article 83.7 of the RGPD provides that, without prejudice to the
corrective powers of the control authorities pursuant to art. 58, paragraph 2,
Each Member State may lay down rules on whether and to what extent it is possible to
impose administrative fines on authorities and public bodies established in

that Member State.

The defendant has proceeded to resolve the facts that are the subject of this proceeding
sanctioning, since currently in the communications sent presents the
following communication:

"Your personal data are processed for the exclusive purpose of exercising the rights of
CRYSTALIS ENTERTAINMENT UG claimed by this communication.

Your data will be kept for five years from the resolution of this
conflict (understood as judicial or extrajudicial satisfaction), with the exception of
the identification data essential to fulfill the eventual commitment not to

to claim again or not to address you again.
We inform you that you have the right to request access to your personal data

object of treatment, its rectification, the limitation of its treatment and portability
of the same (without allowing in this case the deletion, opposition or a limitation
treatment that prevents the satisfaction of the legitimate interest pursued by our
client).

For the exercise of your rights you can direct communication, attaching a copy of your
DNI or equivalent document, to *** EMAIL.1 or to LVCENTVM LEGAL S.L. in the
address at the bottom of this letter.

Likewise, and especially if you consider that you have not obtained full satisfaction in the
exercise of your rights, you may file a claim with the national authority
of control by contacting the Spanish Agency for Data Protection "
