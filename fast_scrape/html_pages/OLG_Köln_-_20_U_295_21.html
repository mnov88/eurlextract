<p>The Higher Regional Court of Köln held that an access request of an insurance holder aimed to verify the lawfulness of premium increases - and not the lawfulness of the data processing - cannot be considered excessive under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12(5) GDPR</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject has a health insurance contract with the controller. The controller increased the premiums during the contract. The data subject payed the increased premiums for a while but then filed a lawsuit against the controller demanding a refund as well as access to all supplements to the insurance policy and all notification letters sent to him during the contractual relationship under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15 GDPR</a>.
</p><p>The court of first instance, the Regional Court of Aachen (Landgericht Aachen – LG Aachen), ruled in favour of the data subject.
</p><p>The controller appealed this decision arguing that the right to access under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15 GDPR</a> does not grant a right to access to documents but its only purpose is to make the processed data transparent. Moreover, it argued that granting the access to such a wide extent would amount to an inadmissible discovery of evidence which is contrary to the civil procedural principle that each party must bring forward its evidence itself. Lastly, the controller also invoked the excessiveness of the request under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#5" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12(5) GDPR</a> alleging that the data subject uses <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15 GDPR</a> only to verify the validity of the premium increases and not to verify the lawfulness of the processing.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Higher Regional Court of Köln (Oberlandesgericht Köln – OLG Köln) rejected the arguments of the controller and upheld the lower court’s judgement.
</p><p>First, the court referred to case law by the German Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof – BGH decision from 15.06.2021, case no. VI ZR 576/19) to establish that personal data under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#1" title="Article 4 GDPR">Article 4(1) GDPR</a> means information which by virtue of its content, purpose or effects, is linked to a specific person. The court then concluded that the supplements to the insurance policy as well as the notification letters meet these requirements. For the supplements the court found that they show the content and conditions of the insurance cover provided to the data subject by the controller. Regarding the notification letters the court reasoned that they are also sufficiently linked to the data subject because they inform the respective policyholder of a change in his insurance contract on a certain date.
</p><p>Second, the court found that the right to a copy under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15(3) GDPR</a> is independent from the right to access under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15(1) GDPR</a> and is to be construed extensively. Consequently, the court held that <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15(3) GDPR</a> gives the data subject a right to a copy of the data in its raw form.
</p><p>Third, the court rejected the arguments of the controller. It concluded that the controller was neither under <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__242.html">§ 242 BGB (German Civil Code)</a> nor under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#5" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12(5) GDPR</a> allowed to reject the request as excessive. It also rejected to limit the scope of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15(3) GDPR</a> teleologically, only because the request was aimed at verifying the lawfulness of premium increases and not at verifying the lawfulness of the data processing. It reasoned that the overall purpose of the GDPR is to protect all rights and freedoms of the individual against harm and risks arising from the processing of personal data, and not only the rights and freedoms enshrined in data protection law. Therefore, the court concluded that the data subject pursues a recognizable legitimate interest when using <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15(3) GDPR</a> to reduce an asymmetric level of information between himself and the controller in order to protect his rights. Moreover, the court found that there is no way to verify that the data subject is indeed only interested in the copy of his data to check the validity of the premium increases and is not also concerned about the protection of his data. Consequently, the court noted that it is unreasonable to make the right to access dependent on an unverifiable assertion about the inner motivation of a data subject. The court also rejected the controller's argument that granting the access would amount to an inadmissible discovery of evidence, because the inadmissibility of discovery is a procedural concept which cannot be transferred to a material claim such as <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15 GDPR</a>.
</p><p>Lastly, the court allowed the appeal to the Federal Court of Justice (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/EN/Home/homeBGH_node.html">Bundesgerichtshof</a> - BGH), Germany’s highest court of civil and criminal jurisdiction, because of the fundamental importance of the legal matter and the inconsistency of case law on this matter [<i>see Comment section</i>].

<p>The decision of the Higher Regional Court of Köln stands in contrast to several other decision by German courts which restricted the right to access in similar cases (see <a href="/index.php?title=OLG_Dresden_-_4_U_1905/21" title="OLG Dresden - 4 U 1905/21">OLG Dresden - 4 U 1905/21</a>; <a href="/index.php?title=OLG_N%C3%BCrnberg_-_8_U_2907/21" title="OLG Nürnberg - 8 U 2907/21">OLG Nürnberg - 8 U 2907/21</a>; <a href="/index.php?title=LG_Krefeld_-_2_O_448/20" title="LG Krefeld - 2 O 448/20">LG Krefeld - 2 O 448/20</a>). However, the present decision by the OLG Köln is, in my (<i>inital contributor Heiko</i>) opinion, conclusive and persuasive. As stated by the OLG Köln, making the right to access under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15 GDPR</a> dependent on the inner motivation of the data subject is not a reasonable approach. This is also in line with the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2022-01/edpb_guidelines_012022_right-of-access_0.pdf">EDPB's guidelines on access</a> where it is stated in para 13 that "[...] controller should not assess "why" the data subject is requesting access, but only "what" the data subject is requesting [...]". 
</p><p>On other points the decision, however, is not in line with the guidelines on access. The guidelines state in para 23 that the right to a copy "is not to be understood as an additional right of the data subject, but as [a] modality of providing access to the data" and in para 131 that "[...] under some circumstances it could be appropriate for the controller to provide access through other ways than providing a copy [...] [like] oral information, inspection of files, onsite or remote access without [the] possibility to download". However, in my (<i>inital contributor Heiko</i>) opinion, at least the second statement contradicts with the wording of sentence 1 of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15(3) GDPR</a> which expressly and clearly states that "[t]he controller <i>shall</i> provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing."

 Standards: § 203 VVG; Art. 15 GDPR


 Tenor:
                               The appeal of the defendant against the 24.11.2021

                               announced judgment of the district court Aachen - Az. 9 O 488/20 -
                               is rejected.

                               The defendant bears the costs of the appeal proceedings.

                               This judgment and the contested judgment are provisional
                               enforceable. The defendant may request enforcement by the

                               Plaintiff with regard to the assessed payment obligation
                               through a security deposit of 110% of the due
                               Judgment enforceable amount and with regard to

                               The revision is for the defendant with regard to the question of
                               existence and content of the right to information.



 Reasons: 1


 I. 2

 The parties argue about the effectiveness of the contribution increases in the case of the defendant 3
 the plaintiff's private health insurance existing under insurance number X1
 and a related request for information. For the details, reference is made to the facts of the first instance judgment.

The district court found that the increases

- in the plaintiff's tariff A from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2020 in 5
amount of EUR 43.29,


- in the tariff D existing for Mrs. B C from 04/01/2017 to 03/31/2019 in 6
Amount of EUR 4.80

- and in the tariff F existing for Mr. E C from 04/01/2017 to 03/31/2018 in 7
Amount of EUR 20.22


were ineffective and the plaintiff failed to pay the increase contribution 8
had been obliged. Furthermore, it ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff 1,916.28
EUR plus interest and found that the defendant handed over to the plaintiff
is obligated to the uses that they have drawn from the premium share up to February 11, 2021
have, which the plaintiff paid for the invalid contribution increases. About that

In addition, it ordered the defendant to provide the plaintiff with information about all premium adjustments

Insofar as it is still relevant for the appeal, the district court has the following reasoning: 9

The right to information derived in this way and to this extent is not 15
barred. According to its nature, it is solely due to the deletion that may have occurred and a
justified refusal due to partial information already provided or as an exception
restricted due to excessive use of the right to information, which in the present case
however, are also not visible. The defendant last with a brief dated

The information submitted on November 5th, 2021 would make the specific request for information clear
not fulfill.

With its appeal, the defendant is pursuing its desire for the full dismissal of the complaint 16
further.

The basis for the calculation is insurance benefits. The further explanations can also
the policyholder understand only so. The notification of the relevant reasons

also do not require the indication that a threshold has been exceeded; result in something else
also not from the more recent case law of the Federal Court of Justice.

There is no legal basis for the asserted right to information. 18
In particular, this cannot be based on Art. 15 GDPR. Let this one

not derive. The purpose of the provision is to enable the person concerned to
to check the legality of the processing of his data and to exercise his right as a data subject. To do this, the processed data would have to be made transparent.
However, a claim for the release of documents is not justified. In addition, there is
the suspicion of investigation, which is why the handing over of documents is not in
come into consideration. A comprehensive right to a copy of all documents would also be contained in

Contradiction to the principle of delivery. As far as the BGH explained that the data
of insurance policies and supplements not categorically from the scope of the
Art. 15 DS-GVO are excluded, this cannot be done on a contribution adjustment letter
be extended. These are used in a variety of cases

identical declarations, so that it is necessary to link the communicated

obviously excessive application within the meaning of Art
is aimed at checking the lawfulness of the processing of the data collected, but
to obtain the information in the simplest and most convenient way possible

would be required to bring an action for reimbursement of contributions paid
to be able to prepare.

Other bases for a claim are also not available. Art. 3 para. 3 VVG come 19
out of the question in this respect because this only protects the policyholder from difficulties in providing evidence

should protect with regard to the conclusion of the contract and therefore the policyholder
only a right to the issuance of a new insurance certificate is granted.
In any case, a request for information based on § 3 para. 3 VVG is abusive,
because the mere naming of the increase contributions to substantiate a possible lawsuit
not sufficient; the cover letters requested with the request for information

and the policyholder does not receive leaflets about § 3 para. 3 VVG. § 3 paragraph 4
According to its wording, the VVG is limited to declarations that
policyholder gave up.

Art. 7 para. 4 VVG is not applicable because the documents are already in writing 20
were communicated and the meaning and purpose of the provision is anyway only to the

to provide the policyholder with evidence of the concluded contract.

A corresponding claim does not result from § 242 BGB either. Here it is already missing at 21
the condition that the person requesting information cannot reasonably be expected to
can obtain the information and the person obliged to provide information can easily provide it

because it can be assumed that all documents are in the plaintiff's possession
located. It can be expected that the contractual documents will be properly processed
had been managed. Even in the event of a loss, however, there is a lack of the
required excusability. The requested retrospective information is for the defendant
and compilation of documents involved immense effort.


§ 666 BGB does not apply because the 22nd
Health insurance contract for no service contract, which is an agency for
have an object, act.

§ 810 BGB is not applicable in addition to § 3 VVG, but is also only available for inspection 23

in documents and not aimed at making copies. It's also missing
required legitimate interest.

In any case, any repayment claims are in any case up to and including 2016 24
statute-barred, with the result that claims for information would no longer be considered.

                                                                                               25, The defendant requests that

The plaintiff claims that the district court was right in assuming that the 29th
disputed letter of notification would not have satisfied the requirements.

In particular, there is no indication that there is a predetermined threshold 30

the disputed contribution increase already confirmed.

Finally, the regional court also correctly assumed that the 31st
Request for information from Art. 15 DS-GVO result. This is just not on data
limited, which are not yet known to the person concerned. The fixed premium is also

a personal characteristic. In addition, the right to information also arises
from § 242 BGB.

For all further details, reference is made to the written submissions of the parties, the 32nd
documents submitted by them for the files as well as the minutes of the oral

Negotiation of 03/25/2022 referred.

II.33

1. The defendant's appeal is admissible, but has no success in the matter. 34

a. ah. The regional court rightly assumed that the premium increases in 35
tariffs A, D and F were ineffective as of April 1st, 2017.


As the contested judgment correctly states, the premium adjustments are 36
already as formally ineffective because the letter of notification from February 2017
does not meet the formal requirements of Section 203 (5) VVG.

In principle, the following applies: According to the case law of the Federal Court of Justice (cf. only BGH, judgment 37
dated 16.12.2020, Az. IV ZR 294/19 - quoted from juris) requires notification of the

now also OLG Celle, judgment of January 13, 2022, Az. 8 U 134/21 - quoted from juris).

The letter regarding the increase on April 1, 2017 (Annex I 6, Bl. 371 ff. LG) is sufficient for these 38
requirements not. It says in part:


"(...), 39

With this or at least an almost identical letter of notification including attachments, 47

according to juris), which an appeal against the decision of the 9th civil senate of July 7th, 2020,
Az. 9 U 227/19 (cited according to juris), employed and stated (margin no. 25 ff.),

in particular not from the attachments to the notification letters (cf. also OLG Köln,
9. Civil Senate, Az. 9 U 227/19, Rn. 43 ff. - quoted from juris). There, too, only

but not. Rather, the notice states unequivocally, clearly and unequivocally
point out which changed basis of calculation for the specific one in question
premium increase was decisive. This is missing here.

Based on this, the regional court also correctly assumed that the 48th

- about the underlying assumption of the ineffectiveness of the
Contribution adjustment beyond - rightly not attacked by the appeal.

b. The district court also rightly ordered the defendant to provide the plaintiff with information 50
to issue all contribution adjustments that they made in the years 2011 to 2016
made by submitting the information sent to the plaintiff for this purpose

Information in the form of cover letters and supplements to the insurance policy of the years
2011 to 2016.

ah. However, there is no corresponding right to information in the present case 51
from § 242 BGB.


From the point of view of good faith, § 242 BGB, the 52
Policyholders have a right to information against the insurer if
he is in an excusable way uncertain about the existence and scope of his right
and the insurer can easily obtain the information required to eliminate the uncertainty
(cf. only BGH, judgment of 01.06.2016, Az. IV ZR 507/15 - quoted from juris).

The scope and content of the information to be provided depend on which information
the policyholder needs in order to be able to assert his claim, insofar as
which are not opposed by reasonableness aspects or other limits.

In any case, in the present case, a right to information based on Section 242 of the German Civil Code 53 is excluded
in the opinion of the Senate, however, because the plaintiff merely submitted that

he did not have the requested documents. Substantiated lecture to the fact that he this about
have not kept or what efforts he claims to have made to keep them
to be found, was not possible despite a corresponding notice from the Senate dated March 11, 2022.
Even if the right to information according to § 242 BGB is not limited to the case that the

Claimant lost the documents through no fault of his own (cf. OLG
Stuttgart, judgment of November 18, 2021, Az. 7 U 244/21; different, however, probably OLG Munich,
Notice resolution of November 24th, 2021, Az. 14 U 6205/21), but demand it in good faith
in any case not, to the person seeking information effort at the expense of the person obliged to provide information
spare


bb However, the right to information arises – of which the regional court correctly 54
assumed - from Art. 15 Para. 1, 3 DS-GVO.

                                                                                              55, According to Art. 15 Para. 1 DS-GVO, every data subject, according to Art. 4 No. 1 DS-GVO
person identifiable or identified by personal data, the right of
to request confirmation from the person responsible as to whether they are concerned
personal data are processed; if this is the case, it has i.a. A right to

Information about this personal data. According to Art. 15 Para. 3 DS-GVO, the
Controller a copy of the personal data that is the subject of the processing
are to provide.

The term "personal data" according to Art. 4 DS-GVO is broadly defined 56

(Federal Court of Justice, judgment of June 15, 2021, Az. VI ZR 576/19 - quoted according to juris; cf. also our
Judgment of July 26, 2019 in case 20 U 75/18). He is not particularly sensitive or
private information, but potentially includes all types of information
both objective and subjective, provided that it is
Information about the person in question (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of June 15, 2021, Az.

VI ZR 576/19 – quoted from juris). The latter requirement is met if the
Information because of its content, purpose or impact with a
is linked to a specific person (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of June 15, 2021, Az. VI ZR 576/19 - cited
according to law). It is not required that the information be "significant biographical information"

acts that are "in the foreground" of the document in question (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of
June 15, 2021, Az. VI ZR 576/19 – quoted from juris).

As part of its judgment of June 15, 2021 (Az. VI ZR 576/19 – quoted from 57
juris) expressly clarified that in particular neither data of the insurance policy
nor the past correspondence between the policyholder and the insurer

are categorically excluded from the application report of Art. 15 GDPR. the
Letters from the insurer to the policyholder are intended to support the right to information
Rather, insofar as they contain information about the policyholder according to the
criteria shown.

In the present case, after the partial rejection of the 58th

more extensive right to information asserted in the first instance only
about a right to information about those made in the years 2011 to 2016
Contribution adjustments by submitting the information transmitted for this purpose in the form of
Cover letter and supplements to the insurance certificate.


First of all, the 59
supplements to the insurance policy; because from these results, with what content
and under what conditions for the policyholder from the insurer
insurance coverage exists.

However, the letters sent for this purpose also show the necessary link; 60

because it regularly follows from these (the defendant does not submit anything else) that the
Policyholders under a specific date of any change regarding
informed of his insurance contract. They pose regularly at the same time
letter of justification according to § 203 para. 5 VVG, for which the link follows,

that it can be inferred from these that and to what extent changes for what reasons in
have taken place according to a tariff existing for the policyholder.

Whether also with regard to supplementary sheets sent with the letter of justification, the 61st
necessary connection is to be affirmed, can be left open in the present case. Because that's the extent of it
Claim for information has been legally rejected by the district court.


                                                                                                62, Whether the relevant information is already known to the policyholder (which
should be assumed here, since the plaintiff did not receive the original transmission
denies) and whether he still has the documents or, for which we can be excused, no longer have them, is for
the right to information under data protection law is irrelevant. The BGH has expressly

clarified that the fact that letters are known to the policyholder
do not exclude the right to information under data protection law (judgment of June 15, 2021,
Az. VI ZR 576/19 – quoted from juris). This can also repeatedly request information.

As far as the defendant says, in any case only copies of the data obtained, which are the subject of the 63rd

processing are to be made available, but not copies of the data concerned
Files or documents, it is not clear on the basis of your presentation how
a provision of copies of the data at issue here on your part -
if not by means of a copy of the documents. In any case, the mere notification
the fact that there was an adjustment letter with a supplementary sheet is to fulfill the right to information

obviously not suitable.

Although a claim for the release of copies of documents is partially (cf. OLG 64
Stuttgart, Urt. June 16, 2021 – 7 U 325/20) on the grounds that no, according to the wording
of Art. 15 Para. 3 S. 1 DS-GVO, the data subject has a right only to the

Copy of the personal data being processed. The Senate
shares the opinion of the Munich Higher Regional Court (judgment of October 4th, 2021, Az. 3 U 3906/29 - cited
after juris; so also Schmidt-Wudy in: BeckOK data protection law, 39th edition, stand
01.11.2021, Art, 15 para. 85 with further references; Koreng, NJW 2021, 2692), according to which the concept of
Data copy within the meaning of Article 15 (3) GDPR, which has an independent claim in addition to Article 15
