<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject, an employee of the Municipality, filed a complaint with the AEPD because of a video surveillance system that recorded employees and citizens actions within the Municipality's premises, even though no proper authorisation was requested and granted. Moreover, since the cameras could also record audio, personal conversations of employees and visitors could be recorded. Lastly, although there was a sign that informed visitors and employees of the presence video surveillance cameras, it was unclear for which purpose these cameras were installed. The AEPD informed the Municipality (hereafter: respondent) regarding the complaint but never got a reply. Hence, it agreed to process the complaint. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The AEPD upheld the complaint.
</p><p>First, the recording of personal conversations is an invasion of privacy. This is therefore strictly forbidden and can lead to a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(c) GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>Second, the cameras must be limited to the purpose for which they are intended. Also, the way of capturing and processing this data must be proportionate in relation to this purpose (surveillance/security).
</p><p>Third, the AEPD recalls that, in order to comply with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR" title="Article 12 GDPR">Article 12 GDPR</a>, a clear sign must be placed in a visible area (e.g. access door) indicating that it is a video-surveilled area, and it must indicate: 
</p>
<ul><li>the existence of the processing.</li></ul>
<ul><li>the identity of the data controller.</li></ul>
<ul><li>the possibility of exercising the rights provided for in Articles 15 to 22 GDPR.</li></ul>
<p>If there is not a clear sign informing employees of the video-surveillance area, which provides this information, this leads to a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">Article 13 GDPR</a>. Respondent had failed to install and show a clear sign that provided this information. Moreover, the purpose of security had not been known to the legal representatives of all the public employees of the aforementioned entity, although they must be aware of the purpose(s) of the images obtained. Hence, this constituted an infringement, attributable to the respondent, for violation of Articles 5(1)(c) and 13 GDPR. 
</p><p>Therefore, the AEPD (1) imposed a warning on the Municipality and (2) ordered respondent to:
</p>
<ul><li>Place information signs duly approved to the current GDPR at the main entrances to the Town Hall within one month of the decision.</li>
<li>Inform all public employees of the measures adopted, in particular those related to the purpose(s) of the processing.</li>
<li>To place the entrance camera so that it is used for the security function of the Town Hall, but avoids capturing the work area of the employees exclusively, disabling the audio option if necessary.</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>1. In its decision, the AEPD mentioned <i>"exception of prior judicial authorisation and recordings made by persons competent to do so in "exceptional" situations"</i> as grounds for exception to the prohibition of the recording of personal conversations. However, this was not further explained.
</p><p>2. It is likely, however, that the AEPD referred to Article 5 <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1997-17574">Ley Orgánica 4/1997, de 4 de agosto, por la que se regula la utilización de videocámaras por las Fuerzas y Cuerpos de Seguridad en lugares públicos</a>.

     Procedure No.: PS / 00377/2021

                RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE


Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on
to the following

                                       FACTS


FIRST: Mrs. A.A.A. (* hereinafter, the complaining party) dated April 17,
2021 filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
claim is directed against CITY COUNCIL OF *** LOCALIDAD.1 with CIF
P4626100D (hereinafter, the claimed part). The reasons on which the
claim are the following, as collected in your writing,


       “On March 12, video surveillance cameras were installed in the City Hall.
location of *** LOCALIDAD.1 (Valencia). These cameras were installed at the entrance to the
Town Hall and at the counter, from where they record employees and citizens
damages that enter the municipal offices (...)


       On several occasions I showed my disagreement to the mayor and the secretary
on these aspects. I called the Government Delegation to check if there was
granted authorization for its installation in accordance with the provisions of the Decree
596/1999 and Organic Law 4/1997, and there was no such authorization, but it is that neither if-

want it had been requested ”.

       “I have not been informed about the installation of the system (…) I can only think
that I have been recorded without prior notice of the camera's start-up, that's why
They are knowledgeable about my private conversations held in these dependencies
(…) ”.


       Together with the claim, it provides documentary evidence (photograph No. 1) that
It accredits the presence of the poster even though it is not filled in in its essential aspects.

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5

December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
hereinafter LOPDGDD), said claim was transmitted to the claimed party in fe-
cha *** DATE.1, so that it could proceed with its analysis and inform this Agency in the
period of one month, of the actions carried out to adapt to the prerequisites
