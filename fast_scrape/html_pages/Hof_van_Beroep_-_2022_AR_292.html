<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>IAB Europe (“IAB”, short of <i>Interactive Advertising Bureau</i>) is an association of undertakings active in the field of digital advertising such as publishers, ecommerce and marketing companies and intermediaries, including major international players such as Microsoft and Google. IAB is established in Belgium and operates on a European level.
</p><p>IAB developed the “Transparency &amp; Consent Framework” (“TCF”). The purpose of the TCF is to make the processing of personal data for online advertising compliant with data protection requirements. To this end, the TCF provides a set of technical standards and rules (in the form of contractual obligations) for companies in the sector. In particular, the TCF specifies how publishers, advertisers, and intermediaries should use the OpenRTB protocol, a widely used Real Time Bidding (“RTB”) system. 
</p><p>RTB consists in the instant and automated online auction of users profiles for the purpose of selling and purchasing advertising space online. When an internet user visits a webpage where advertising space is available, the server sends the user’s data to a platform where advertisers automatically and instantly place bids. Advertisers place their bids based on some characteristics of individual users visiting the page (such as their location, marketing profiles, and browsing history). The bid winner displays their customer's advertising in that specific advertising space. The whole process involves a mass exchange of personal data. 
</p><p>For this operation to be possible, users are (in principle) asked to express their advertising preferences when they first visit a publisher’s website. These preferences are collected by websites (more specifically, by each website's Consent Management Platform) and stored in a string called Transparency and Consent string (‘TC string’). The TC string is subsequently shared with advertisers and data brokers, in order to inform them of the user's preferences. 
</p><p>At the same time, the CMP writes a cookie called euconsent-v2 on the user’s device. In combination with the TC string, the euconsent-v2 cookie can reveal the user’s IP address. 
</p><p>In 2019 a number of complainants, including several non-profits, filed complaints with different DPAs against the TCF. 
</p><p><b>The DPA decision</b>
</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=APD/GBA_(Belgium)_-_21/2022">The Belgian DPA, as lead supervisory authority, ruled</a> that IAB was acting as a joint controller (along with the TCF participants) in relation to the TC string. The DPA also considered that this processing influenced the OpenRTB protocol and that IAB was therefore a joint controller in relation to the OpenRTB as well. It also found several breaches of the GDPR. 
</p><p>As a result, the DPA fined IAB €250,000. The decision was adopted pursuant to the cooperation procedure under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_60_GDPR" title="Article 60 GDPR">Article 60 GDPR</a>, in the context of which 21 supervisory authorities agreed with the DPA’s draft decision during the procedure.
</p><p><b>IAB challenged the DPA decision</b>
</p><p>IAB challenged the decision before the Court of Appeal of Brussels (hereafter the Court). In particular, IAB claimed that the TC string did not constitute personal data, and that even if it did, IAB was not a controller for the processing in relation to the TC strings. In particular, it claimed that by creating the TCF, it merely set a standard for processing personal data across the organizations handling TC strings. In IAB's view, this did not amount to actually processing data.
</p><p><b>Request for preliminary ruling</b>
</p><p>The Court of Appeal referred several questions to the CJEU. In 2024 the CJEU issued <a href="/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C-604/22_-_IAB_Europe" title="CJEU - C-604/22 - IAB Europe">a preliminary ruling</a> in which it confirmed (i) that TC strings were personal data<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> and (ii) that IAB was a joint controller for the processing in relation to the TC strings<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>, along with the other recipients of the string.
</p><p>The CJEU specified that its findings about IAB’s qualification as a controller, did not extend to the entire data processing happening through the OpenRTB protocol. In other words, IAB was a controller for the TC string processing, but it did not necessarily follow that it was a controller for the broader processing of personal data in the OpenRTB protocol for the purpose of targeted advertising.
</p><p>The Court resumed the proceedings after the preliminary ruling of the CJEU.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p><b>On the nature of the TC string</b>
</p><p>Further to the preliminary ruling, the Court observed that IAB members - who were recipients of the TC strings - held data that could identify the data subject when combined with the TC string. This implied that the TC string qualified as personal data, irrespective of the possibility for IAB to actually identify users.
</p><p>The Court then examined if IAB could actually identify users. It held that under IAB's internal policies, which are binding for the other participants in the TCF, IAB could require to access data which, in combination with the TC string, could identify users. The Court concluded that as IAB could require such information, it had reasonable means to identify the users.
</p><p>For these reasons, the Court held that TC strings were personal data in the meaning of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR" title="Article 4 GDPR">Article 4(1) GDPR</a>.
</p><p><b>On the processing of personal data</b>
</p><p>The Court then confirmed that once created, the TS strings are then structured and organized by IAB, which qualifies as a processing operation within the meaning of the GDPR.
</p><p><b>On IAB’s controllership</b>
</p><p>The Court then examined if IAB qualified as a controller under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR" title="Article 4 GDPR">Article 4(7) GDPR</a>.
</p><p>The Court noted that IAB shares a purpose with other participants in the TCF: that users preferences are captured in a structured way and the shared with other participants. Given its overriding control over the TCF, the Court found that IAB held clear decision making power both over the purposes and means of the processing.
</p><p>Regarding the joint controllership, the Court distinguished between the processing in relation to the TC String and the processing in the context of the OpenRTB protocol. For what concerns the TC Strings, the Court confirmed that IAB was jointly responsible, with the TCF participants, for storing data subject's consent preferences in the TC string. It therefore qualified as a joint controller.
</p><p>For the processing in relation to the OpenRTB, the Court however refused to follow the DPA's reasoning. It considered that the scope of the litigation was limited to the processing within the TCF and that the DPA did not sufficiently prove that IAB was a joint controller in the context of the OpenRTB protocol. 
</p><p>The Court therefore found that IAB's claim was founded only to the extent that the DPA decision considered that IAB acted as a joint controller in the context of the OpenRTB protocol.
</p><p><b>On other violations</b>
</p><p>The Court mostly upheld the DPA’s findings and confirmed that IAB violated Articles <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">5(1)(a)</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR" title="Article 5 GDPR">5(1)(f)</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">6</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR" title="Article 13 GDPR">13</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR" title="Article 14 GDPR">14</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR" title="Article 24 GDPR">24</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR" title="Article 25 GDPR">25</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_30_GDPR" title="Article 30 GDPR">30</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">32</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR" title="Article 35 GDPR">35</a>, and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR" title="Article 37 GDPR">37</a> GDPR.
</p><p>In particular, the Court confirmed that:
</p>
<ul><li>IAB had no legal basis under the GDPR to process TC strings. In particular, the Court confirmed the DPA's findings on the legal basis of legitimate interest: IAB failed to correctly balance its legitimate interest with that of the end users and, therefore, could not invoke legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing the TC string.</li>
<li>IAB failed to inform website visitors about the processing of personal data, in violation of the controller's transparency obligations;</li>
<li>the TCF did not meet GDPR standards for data protection by design and default;</li>
<li>IAB failed to appoint a data protection officer and carry out a data protection impact assessment.</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p><p><b>Conclusion</b>
</p><p>In conclusion, the Court upheld most of the DPA reasoning and confirmed the €250,000 fine imposed. 
</p><p>The only part of the DPA decision that was not confirmed was the extension of IAB's controller quality to the full OpenRTB protocol. The Court did not specifically decide on the matter but considered that it was out of scope of the present proceeding and that the DPA did not sufficiently justify its reasoning.
</p><p>The Court also specified that the case would not be sent back to the DPA.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h2>
<p>It is worth noting that the Court of Appeal assessed the case based on how TC strings were processed at the time of the complaints, under the now-outdated version 2 of the TCF.

   I.   Factsandproceduralpredecessors

 1.

 IAB Europe is a Belgian-based international non-profit association representing companies in the
digital advertising and marketing sector at the European level. IAB Europe's members are both
companies in this - such as publishers, ecommerce and marketing companies and intermediaries

- and national associations, including the national IABs (Interactive Advertising Agencies), which in
turn include companies in that sector. IAB Europe counts among its members, among others,
companies that significant revenues from the sale of advertising space on Internet sites or

applications.



IAB Europe has the Transparency &amp; Consent Framework hereinafter&#160;: "TCF"], being a "standard"'
consisting of guidelines, instructions, technical specifications, protocols and contractual obligations

that enable both Internet site or application providers and data brokers or advertising platforms
to processpersonaldataofInternetsiteorapplicationusers.


3.
The TCF aims to promote compliance with the AVG when those companies use the so-called
OpenRTB protocol, one of the most widely used protocols uoor Real nice Biddiny, that is, a

 onlineauctionofuserprofilesforsellingandpurchasingadvertisingspaceontheInternet(hereinafter

 system of mass exchange of personal data to user profiles, IAB Europe proposed the TCF as a

 In particular, from a technical standpoint, when a user visits a website or an application that
contains advertising space, ad technology companies, including data brokers and advertising
platforms, thousands of advertisers, can instantly bid on that advertising space behind the

 4.
 However, in order to display such targeted advertising, the consent of that user must first, in

principle, be obtained. Accordingly, when the user concerned first visits a particular website or
application, a consent management platform - a so-called Consent Management Platform
(hereinafter&#160;: "CMP") - will appear that enables him to grant the provider of the Internet site or

application permission to collect and process his personal data for predetermined purposes -
such as marketing or advertising in particular - or to share such data with certain providers, as

well as to object to various types of processing of such data ot their sharing on the grounds of the
legitimate interests invoked by providers within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f) of the AVG. These
personaldatarelateinparticulartothe'slocation,age, search history and recent purchases.


5.
In this regard, the TCF provides a framework for the processing of personal data on a large scale and

facilitates the recording of users' preferences through the CMP. These preferences are then
encrypted and stored in a letter and character string that IAB Europe calls the Transparency and
Consent String (hlerna&#160;: "TC Strlng "j, which is with personal data brokers and advertising platforms

participating in the OpenRTB protocol, so that they know what the user has consented to or objected
to. The CMP also places a cookie (euconsent-v2) on the users device. In combination, the TC String
and the euconsent-v2 cookie can be linked to the user's IP address.

  According to IAB Europe this was changed in the Iatest version 2.2 of the TCF, is not under here.

 TheTCFplaysaroleintheoperationoftheOpenRTBprotocol,asit            provides theabilityto transcribe
 preferences in order to communicate them to potential vendors, as well as to achieve various
 processing purposes, the provision of advertisements. The TCF purportedly aims assure personal

 databrokersandadvertising platforms through the TC String that the AVG has been complied with.


 D'e GBA has received is 2019 complaints against IAB Europe (most of the complaints are from

 other member states, one concerns that of Mr. Pierre Dewitte from Belgium) that concerned the
 compliance of the TCF with the AVG.


 The GBA investigated certain complaints (with an initial report from the inspectorate dated July
 13, 2020) and then triggered the cooperation and coherence mechanism to reach a joint
 decision approved by the (21*) national supervisory authorities in that mechanism.


 8.
 Thus, by a decision dated February 2, 2022 (hereinafter&#160;: "Ruling"), the GBA Disputes Chamber
held that IAB Europe was acting as a data controller with respect to the registration of the consent
signal and of the objections and preferences of individual users by means of a TC String, which the

GBA Disputes Chamber found to be linked to an identifiable user. In addition, in that decision, the
GBA Dispute Chamber ordered IAB Europe, pursuant to Article 100, 4 1, 9", WOG, to bring the
processing of personal data in the of the TCF into compliance with the AVG, and imposed several

corrective measures as well as an administrative fine (EUR 250,000.00) on it.

 Market Court currently has no jurisdiction (see further below).



 11.

 Before the Market Court, IAB Europe stated that TC Strings are not personal data to it since IAB
 Europe itself cannot trace the data back to an individual. It is only the other participants of the

 system that can do so. For the same reason, IAB Europe would also not be a responsible party as

OnSept.7,2022,theMarketCourthandeddownaninterlocutoryjudgmentinwhich,amongother
things,itreferred two preliminary questions to the Court of Justice that can be summarized as

follows&#160;:

        1. ShouldaTCStringbeconsideredpersonaldata?


        2. Should IAB Europe be considered a controller? If so, does this also apply to subsequent

        processing by other organizations?

13.

On March 7, 2024a, the Court of Justice issued a judgment (C-604/22j (hereinafter&#160;: the
"Prejudicial Arresr").


Init,theCourtofJusticeruledasfollows:

        "TheCourt(FourthChamber)declaresforjustice:


        Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27

       and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data
       Protection Regulation) must be interpreted as meaning that a letter and character string

       such as the TC string (Transparency and Consent String), which contains the preferences
       of an internet user or an application user as regards his consent to the processing of his
       personal data by internet site or application providers, as well as by personal data brokers

       and advertising lotteries, constitutes personal data within the meaning of that provision,
       inasmuch as that string makes it possible to identify the user concerned when it can linked
       by reasonable means to an identifier such as, in particular, the IP address of that user's

       device. The fact that a sectoral organization in possession of this string of characters

         rules, also contains rules which' specify in detail how personal data relating to such consent
         are to be stored and disseminated, is to be regarded as a 'joint controller' within the meaning

         of those provisions if, having regard to the specific circumstances of the case, it' exercises, for
         its own purposes, an influence over the relevant processing of personal data and thus
         determines, together with its members, the purposes and means of that processing. The fact

         that such a sector organization does not itself have direct access to the personal data

         joint controller of TC Strings and related data.


         EIGHTH GRIEF&#160;: The Contested Decision wrongly concludes that (IAB Europej requires a

OnbehalfoftheGBA:

        first grievance - Your Court has exhausted its jurisdiction (defense to IAB Europe's first
        grievance),

        relates to changes made to bicycle TCP after the 8-stage decision.

         FIFTH DEFENSE&#160;: In context of the TCF, personal data are processed (defense       against
                         the         fifth     grievance   of          IAB       Europe).

        and other data (defense to IAB Europe's seventh grievance).


        EIGHTTH GROUND&#160;: IAB Europe must have a valid legal basis for processing TC Strings
        and OpenRTB data but no such legal basis exists (defense to IAB 's eighth grievance).

        TtFNDE GROUND&#160;: IAB Europe violates its obligations regarding security, integrity and data

        ELFTH DEFENSE&#160;: Defense against IAB Europe's eleventh to fourteenth grievances: Impact
        assessment is required (Art. 35 AVG), Data Protection Officer is required (Art. 37 AVG),

        Register of processing activities is required (Art. 30 AVG) and IAB Europe must facilitate
        the exercise of data subjects' rights (Arts. 15-22 AVG)


Onbehalfofvoluntarilyinterveningpartiesorcomplainants:

        FIRST MIDDLE&#160;: The   wiie on which the GBA handled the proceedings does not violate     its

        duties and powers as a data protection authority under the WOG and the AVG. It does not
        violate IAB Europe's rights of defense, nor does it disregard the principle of due
        diligence. Indeed, the WOG contains both inquisitorial and adversarial proceedings, and

        the Dispute Chamber may also rely on a complainant's submissions and evidence without
        having to have all the facts and allegations in a complainant's submissions examined by

        the Inspectorate. Neither Articles 63 and 94


                     PAGE      01-0000438413fi-001q-0071-02-01-4Court oAppeals Brassel -2027/AR/292 - p.

        NeitherWOGnorArticle57.1.fAVGrequiretheDisputeChambertohaveallfactsand
       allegationsina complainant's claims examined by the Inspectorate before a decision.
       Article .1.f AVG has 2even no direct effect, so IAB Europe cannot derive any rights from it.

       The only relevant test is whether theequalityofarmsandtherightsofdefenseofthe
       defendant respected.This is the case when (1) the defendant knows, before its final
       conclusion, which facts and which articles of law have been violated, (2) it is the last party

       to have been able to submit a written opinion on the matter, so that it the last word, and
       (3) the Dispute Resolution Chamber bases its decision solely on the pleas and arguments
       contained in the parties' pleadings and documents and/or the report of the Inspection

       Service. In that case, the defendant has been able to defend itself against all the factual
       and legal pleas and arguments contained in the Complainant's Opinion and/or the
       Inspectorate's Report, and a posteriori judicial review by the Market Court of the decision
       in relation to the pleas and arguments contained in the 's Opinion is possible. In the

       present case, those conditions have been , so that the equalityofarmsandIABEurope's
       rightofdefense beenrespected.Forthesereasons,IAB Europe's first grievance is
       unfounded and IAB Europe's claim to annul the decision of the Disputes Chamber based

       on that grievance must be dismissed.

      SECOND MIDDLE&#160;: IAB Europe's allegation that its right to a fair trial and the principles of

      equality and non-discrimination have been violated because the context of the case "on "
      before Your Court would have been completely different from the "first instance" before
      the Dispute Chamber is completely false. After all, in an appeal against a decision of the
      GBA Dispute Chamber, Your Court does not sit on appeal but at first and only instance. In

      any event, the context of the case in this appeal is in no way changed from the
      proceedings before the Dispute Chamber. For these reasons, IAB Europe's third grievance
      is unfounded and IAB Europe's claim to annul the decision of the Disputes Chamber on

      thatgrievancemust bedismissed.

      THIRD MIDDLE&#160;: The Dispute Chamber correctly found that the processing of the TC String

      constitutes "processing" of "personal data" within the meaning of Articles 4.1 and 4.2
      AVG, as clearly confirmed by the Court of Justice. Indeed, the user preferences collected
      in the TC String are information "about" a natural person who can be identified by online
      identifiers, in particular the IP address. These personal data are then processed, i.e.

      collected, structured, organized, disseminated and made available in accordance with
      the mandatory requirements of the TCF. Accordingly, IAB Europe's claim that the decision
      of the Dispute Resolution Chamber should be set aside on the grounds that there are no

      personal data (fourth grievance) or that it does not involve the processing of personal data
      (IAB 's fifth grievance) must be rejected.



                  PAGE     01-00004384135-0015-O071-02-01-W



              L JBrusselsourtofAppeal-2022/AR/292-p.16






        FOURTH MIDDLE&#160;: IAB Europe is the controller of the processing of personal data in the .
       Indeed, the TCF itself, for which IAB Europe expressly declares that it responsible,
       obliges participants to process personal data for the alleged purpose of bringing the

       underlying processing of personal data through the OpenRTB auction system in line with
       the AVG. In doing so, IAB Europe determines the purpose as well as the essential means
       of processing personal data. Moreover, IAB Europe is jointly responsible for these
       processing operations of personal data in the TCF with the other participants, namely the

       CMPs, Publishers and Vendors who intervene, albeit later in the processing chain.
       Therefore, IAB Europe's claim to annul the decision of the Dispute Resolution Chamber
       on the grounds that it is not a data controller for the processing of personal data in the

       TCF (sixth grievance of IAB Europe) or is not a joint controller with the participants in that
       TCF (seventh grievance of IAB Europe) must be rejected.


       FIFTH MIDDLE&#160;: IAB Europe's processing operations violate the basic principle of purpose
       limitation, proportionality and necessity. Indeed, IAB Europe's processing operations are
       not collected for legitimate purposes and result in the sharing on an immense scale of
       personal data with all kinds of recipients, without such sharing being in any useful to the

       processing operations the OpenRTB auction system into compliance with the AVG.
       Consequently, IAB Europe also violates its accountability and obligation to develop the TCF
       in a way that ensures data protection by design (violation of Articles 5 and 25 AVG).

       Accordingly, IAB Europe's claim to annul the decision of the Dispute Resolution Chamber
       on the grounds that IAB did not breach its obligations regarding data protection by design
       and defaultsettings(partofIAB'stenthgrievance)must be dismissed.


       SIXTH MIDDLE&#160;: IAB Europe's processing of personal data in the TCF violates the basic
       principle of proper, lawful and transparent processing. Indeed, it does not have any legal
       basis for the processing, has obtained the personal data in misleading way, and does not

       provide either the complainants or any other data subjects with the legally required
       information on the personal data processing operations it carries out. (violation of Articles
       5, 6, 12, 13 and 14 AVG) Therefore, IAB Europe's claim to annul the decision of the Dispute

       Resolution Chamber on the grounds that it does not need a legal basis for the processing
       of personal data in the TCF (eighth grievance of IAB Europe) and on the grounds that it did
       not violate the obligation of transparency (ninth grievance of IAB Europe) must be

       rejected.





                    PAGE     01-000D4384135-0016-0071-02-01-



              L                                                     -.J        SEVENTH PLEA&#160;! IAB Europe violates the principle of integrity and confidentiality because
        it shares personal data within the TCF with an indefinite number of recipients without

        verifying whether those recipients actually provide the necessary safeguards to protect
        the personal data from unauthorized or unlawful processing. Accordingly, IAB Europe's
        claim to annul the decision of the Dispute Resolution Chamber on the grounds that IAB

        Europe did not breach its obligations of security, integrity and confidentiality (part of IAB 's
        tenth grievance) must be dismissed.

        EIGHTH MIDDLE IAB Europe violates the conditions for transfers of personal data to third

        countries, as it has set up the TCF in such a way that personal data such as the TC String
        are systematically transferred to numerous third countries without adequate protection
        for these transfers. (violation of Article 44 AVG). Therefore, IAB Europe's claim to annul
        the decision of the Dispute Chamber on the grounds that IAB Europe did not violate its

        obligations regarding the transfer of personal data to third countries (part of IAB 's tenth
        grievance), should be rejected.

2025, of the conc(usion of Advocate General Spielmann in Case C-413/23 P (European Data

 17.
 In the present case, the considers that the Advocate General's Opinion does indeed qualify as

 new. Indeed, the opinion was published only after the case had already been for some four
 weeks. Nonetheless, the Court is not convinced that the content of the Advocate General's
 Opinion, however interesting, is of predominant importance.


 That the notion of "personal data" is a relative concept is stated, inter alia, in margin number 26 of
 the AVG. In , this margin number clarifies that, as far as the notion of identifiability of a natural
 person is concerned, one must take into account all means that can reasonably be expected to be

 used by the controller or by another person to directly or indirectly identify the natural person.
 The Court of Justice also made reference to this reasonableness/relativity test in the Prejudicial
 Judgment of March 7, 2024, placingthefinalassessmentinthisregardwiththeMarketCourt.


Moreover, in the conclusion in question, the Advocate General himself expressly* makes the link
to the Court of 's Preliminary Ruling of March 7, 2024 and reasons that case did involve personal

data because IAB Europe had reasonable means of indirectly accessing the identifying data.

18.
The Market Court does not consider the document to be of predominant importance and the

request to reopen the debates is therefore denied for that reason.

 Positionsofparties


 According to IAB Europe, the way the Dispute Chamber handled the proceedings is contrary to
 its duties and powers as Data Protection Authority under the WOG and the AVG, violates IAB
 Europe's rights of defense and disregards the principle of due diligence as a principle of good
 administration.


 Invariably, according to IAB Europe, the Dispute Chamber failed to provide or provide adequate
 reasons for the Contested Decision. Among other things, IAB Europe refers to the interlocutory
 judgment of September 7, 2022 (no explanation of the one-stop shop rule).


 The GBA posits that the Market Court has no jurisdiction to rule again on these grievances
 because it has already ruled on them in the interlocutory judgment of September 7, 2022. It also
 argues that the established violation of the duty of care and the duty to state reasons should not

 leadtotheannulmentoftheContestedDecision.

Judgment of the Market

Court19.


The first and second grievances from IAB Europe's November 15, 2024 summary judgment, come
correspond respectively to IAB Europe's seventh and eighth grievances assessed by the Court in
the interlocutory judgment of Sept. 7, 2022.


In other words, the interlocutory judgment has already ruled on IAB Europe's due diligence plea.
Specifically, the Interlocutory Judgment found that the Contested Decision itself does not make
sufficiently clear on the basis of which factual findings it is considered that TC Strings are
personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) AVG. The Court held that the Disputes Chamber,

by processing, with respect to the TC String's qualification, the Complainants' additional
complaints and allegations, without more, after the hearing, did not conduct a proper
investigationandfact-finding.


Further, in the interlocutory judgment, the Court held that the Contested Decision was not adequately
reasonedinsofarasitconsiderstheGBAtobetheleadingappropri2ateauthority.

 20.


 On the other hand, the interlocutory judgment considers that IAB Europe's rights of defense
 have been respected and    rejects the violation of Articles 57(1) and S8(1) AVG and of Article 94
                     judgment
 WOG. Indeed, the              emphasizes that the Dispute Chamber did have the right to choose
 to investigate the additional facts or complaints itself. The lnspectorate did not have to be .

 It follows that the Court has already done justice on the points of law mentioned in the first two

 grievances and to that has exhausted its jurisdiction. Therefore, the Court lacks jurisdiction to rule
 againonthesepointsoflaw.

 2L


 By contrast, the interlocutory judgment has not yet ruled on the legal consequences to be
 attached to the procedural pleas found to be partially well-founded. The Court has not yet

 assessedwhetherandtowhatextentthepartiallyfoundedproceduralpleasshouldleadtoannulment
 or reform of the Contested Decision. However, in view of the request of all parties "to assess the
 substance of the present case", the Court has decided in its interlocutory judgment to proceed to an

 assessment of the substance of the pending . It is precisely to facilitate this exercise that the
 interlocutory judgment referred several questions of interpretation to the Court of Justice.

 In the operative part of the present Final Judgment, the Court sets aside the Contested Decision for

the above-mentioned proceduralJ reasons insofar as the Disputes Chamber finds (without
conclusive investigation and fact-finding in this regard) that TC Strings are personal data within
the meaning of Article 4, point 1, AVG and insofar as it considers the GBA to be the leading

supervisoryauthoritywithoutspecificreasoninginthe Contested Decision in that .

22.


The legislative history of Article 108, § 1, of the Act of December 3, 2017 establishing the Data
Protection Authority shows that the Market Court adjudicates with full jurisdiction in the context
of an appeal against a decisionofthePlaintiff'sLitigationChamber.


This implies that, within the limits of the devolutive effect of the appeal, the Markets Court will
rule on all questions of law and fact as they were by the Data Protection Authority's Disputes
Chamber.'


Hee Market Court can thus in principle substitute itself entirely the Data Protection Authority in
its assessment.Itcannotreviewthedecisionappealedagainst.

  only destroy, but  also reform. It can then make a decision that supersedes the challenged
  decision.




 23.


 Now,   using its full jurisdiction and taking into account the 's Prejudicial Judgment, let the Court
 itself assess whether the elements in the administrative file can support the qualification of the

 TC Strings as personal data, the existence of at least one cross-border processing and the
 appointment of the GBA as the leading supervisory authority.

 24.


 It should be noted that the Market Court is in no way obliged by the AVG or under national to
 organize a European consultation procedure as IAB Europe wrongly posits in (the body ) its

 conclusion.

 As to the characterization of TC Strings as personal data, the Market Court refers to what follows

 in assessing IAB 's fourth grievance.

 The existence of at least one cross-border processing and the appointment of the GBA as the
 lead supervisory authority are assessed by the Market Court as part of the analysis of IAB 's fifth

 grievance.

 THIRD GRIFF IAB Europe&#160;: The fact that the context of the case has changed completely on violates

[IAB Europe's] right to a fair trial as well as the principle of equality and non-discrimination.


S and u   and an a     and

According to IAB Europe, the GBA deprived it of an effective remedy and violated its right to

dissent. IAB Europe says it must "defend itself for the first time on appeal against a completely
changed context. She argues that any party but herself is entitled to her case fully tried twice.
She says there are violations of both Article 6 ECHR and Articles 10 and 11 of the Constitution.


According to the GBA, it is evident that the changes allegedly made by IAB Europe to the TCF not
relevant in assessing the legality of the Contested Decision. "Indeed, as a general rule, the legality of a

decisionmustbeassessedatthetimeitwasmade"and

'   SeeCass.Dec.12,2019,C.18.0250.N,cl.R.Mortier,atwwwuportaI.be.

 "based on the data as they were available at the time (they) were taken." Just as IAB Europe

 emphasizes that no admission to its detriment can be inferred from the adjustments made to the TCF,
 neither can it be inferred from these adjustments that the Dispute Resolution Chamber's assessment

 of the TCF (as it was before the Dispute Resolution Chamber at the time of the Contested 8 Decision)
 would wrong.


 JudgmentoftheMarketCourt

 2S.

 In an appeal against a decision of the Disputes Chamber of the GBA, the Court does not sit in
 appeal but in first and only instance (Article 108 CPC). In this sense, the objective

 contentiousness with which the Market Court was charged differs from the subjective
 contentiousness handled by the "ordinary" courts appeal.


 26.
 In any event, the context of the case in this story is in no way changed from the proceedings

before the Dispute Chamber. The Court reviews the TCF not in the amended version but in the
version submitted to the Dispute Chamber. The Market Court does not even have jurisdiction over
TCF version 2.2, because it is caught on the Contested Decision and that deals only with TCF

version 2.0.


The notion of full jurisdiction arising from Article 108 WOG coupled with Article 78 AVG is v'ilar from
the notion concerning the devolutive power of appeal (Article 1068 Ger. W.) and both cannot be used
interchangeably. In light of the broad powers available to a supervisory authority, according to the

ECJ, the requirement of effective judicial protection is not met if the decisions of a supervisory
authority are only subject to limited judicial 2ouden review. Therefore, the Court considers that such

a decision must be subject to full judicial review. The essence of that full judicial review is that the
parties can, within the limits of the devolutive effect of the appeal, put forward a comprehensive
defense before the Market Court, also with respect to facts dTe were not or insufficiently addressed

in the Contested Decision (obviously to the extent that these facts predate the Contested Decision
itself).


27.
Therefore, no violation of Article 6 ECHR or Articles 10 and 11 of the Constitution is demonstrated.

 GRIEVANCESOFIABEUROPEREGARDINGTHEMERITSOFTHECASE


 Prior

 28.

 1. In the case before it, the Market Court was called upon by the GBA and the complainants to

    rule on both the substantive and procedural issues in dispute between the parties, and this,
    in order to ensure the full and effective effect of the AVG in the internal legal order. In the
    interlocutory judgment, the Market Court held that the Contested Decision certain (purely)
    procedural defects. In order to the full and effective effect of the AVG in the internal legal
    order, it seems appropriate - also in view of the Preliminary Judgment of the Court of Justice -

    that the Market Court should also rule on merits of the infringements of the AVG withheld
    by the Litigation Chamber (at least the extent that those merits are disputed by IAB Europe
    and thus are the subject of the opposing debate before the Market Court). In doing so, the
    Market Court systematically the correctnessofthematerialgroundsoftheContestedDecision,

    followingPrejudicialJudgment,andcompletes or replaces them where necessary or useful.

 2. Article 5.2 AVG states that the data controller must be able to demonstrate compliance with
    the principles of the AVG (accountability). To the extent that IAB Europe qualifies as a data

    controller (see below), it bears the burden of proving compliance with the AVG and cannot
    invokeArticle870Ger.W.toshift thatburdenofproofto the GBA or the complainants.

FOURTH and FIVE GRIEF IAB Europe&#160;: IAB Europe seeks the annulment of the Contested

Stand unte va a e

In its fourth grievance, IAB Europe argues that the Contested Decision violates Article 4(1) AVG
and the substantive duty to state reasons by qualifying the TC String as personal data within the
meaning of the aforementioned provision.


In its fifth grievance, IAB Europe argues that the Contested Decision failed to demonstrate that IAB
Europe itself processes personal data within the meaning of Article 4(2) AVG. Merely
demonstrating

 That "in the context of the TCF" personal data are processed is not   sufficient, according to IAB
        .Until it is shown that IAB Europe itself processes TC Strings, it could nobe considered  a
 Europe
 data controller, nor could the TC Strings bepersonaldata.

 The
     GBA, supportedinthis bythecomplainants, argues that theTCString personal dataandthat the
TC String   is processed as it captures a user's preferences through automated processes
(even if the user refuses everything) and IAB   determines  its storage and  dissemination.


Judgment of the Market Court


0thContestedDecision


29.
TheContestedDecisionfinds(marginnumbers302etseq.):


        "302. Although the Litigation Chamber understands that it has not been conclusively
        established that the TC String, due to the limited metadata and values contained therein, in
        itself allows for direct identification of the user, the Litigation Chamber finds that when the

        consent pop-up is requested by means of a script from a server managed by the CMP, it
        inevitably also processes the user's IP address, which is explicitly classified as personal data in
        the AVG.


        303. Indeed, peripheral number 30 AVG provides that notuurliy individuals can be linked to

       online identi/icotors through their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as Internet
       Protoco/ (IP) addresses, identification cookies, or other identifiers such as radio frequency
       identifier logs. This can leave traces that, especially when' combined with unique identifiers

       and information received by the servers, can be used to create profiles of natural persons and
       recognize notational persons.


       304. Once a CMP stores or reads the TC String on a user's device using a euconsent-v2
       cookie, consent or objection to processing based on a legitimate interest, as well as that
       user's preferences, can be linked to the IP address of the user's device. In other words, CMPs

       have the technical means to IP addresses (as indicated in their pop-up) and combine all
       information related to an identifiable person. The ability to combine the TC String and the IP
       address means that this is information from an identifiable user.





                    PAGE     01-00009384135-0025-0071-02-01-4  Court oAppeals Brussels2022/AR/292 - p26




          305. Moreover, an identï/ication of the user is possible by linking to other data  that can be

         by participating organizations within the TCF, but also in the context of OpenRTB. 0e Dispute
         Chamber underlines in that respect that to
         are not any parties, but participating or 9ni aSies - CMPs and vendors- which, examined in

         more detail below, are required to disclose information with which
         they can identify users, to communicate to the defendant, upon its simple request.


         306. Accordingly, the Dispute Chamber finds that the Respondent has reasonable resources
         at its disposal that it can employ with respect to registered organizations participating in the

         TCF, which enable the Respondent to directly or indirectly identify the naturalIy person behind
         a TC String.


         307. The Litigation Chamber also understands that the TCF inherently aims and therefore
         storing a combination of preferences from each user in the form of a unique string in the TC
         String, in order to communicate these preferences to a large number of adtech vendors.


         308. Indeed, the Dispute Chamber finds, based on the inspection reports, that the adtech

         vendors as well as other participants within the broader OpenRTB ecosystem lend the signal
         stored in a TC String to determine whether they' have the required legal basis for processing
         a users personal data for the purposes to which the user has consented.


        309. In this regard, the Litigation Chamber emphasizes that it is sufficient that certain
        information is used in order to individualize a natural person (single outJ to be able speak of

        personal data. Also, the purpose of the TC String, in particular the purpose of capturing the
        preferences of a well-defined user, leads de facto to the TE String being considered as

        personal data."

ThePrejudicialJudgment


30.
TheCourtofJusticeconsidersasfollows:


        "42. In the present be" noted that a letter and character string such as the TC String contains

        the preferences of an Internet user or a user of an application regarding foË his consent
        to the processing by third parties of his personal data or of data about the objection he may
        have made to the processing of his personal data for an alleged legitimate interest as referred

        toinArticle6(1)([) AVG.



                      PAGE      01-00004384135-0026-0071-02-01-4



                 L JBrusselsourtoAppeals-2022/4R/292-p.27






       43      Even if a TC String would not by itself contain data byeans of which   the data
       subject can be directly i'dentified, it' contains to begin with thesonal preferences of
       a specific user with regard to his consent to the processing of his personal data, where it

       goot beinformation"about a(...) natural " within the meaning of Article 4, point 1, AVG.

       44     In addition, it is also certain that linking the information contained in a TC String

       to an idenfificaror such as, in particular, the IP address of the device of the user in
       question can make it possible to draw up a profile of this user and to actually identify the

       person to whom that information specifically refers.

       45     Since a user can be'i'dentified by linking a letter and character string such as the T6

      String with additional data, such as, in particular, the IP address of that user's device or other
      identifiers, it should be considered that the TC String contains information about an
      identifiable user and thus personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) AVG, which is by

      marginal 30 of the AVG, whichexplicitlyrefers tosuchasituation.


      46      This interpretation is not altered by the mere circumstance that IAB Europe
      couldnot itself linktheTCStringtotheIPaddressof apebruiyer'sdeviceandhasnodirect
      accesstothedataprocessedwithintheTCFbyitsmembers.


      4F    Indeed, as the case law recalled in paragraph 40 of this judgment shows, that
      circumstance 9"oes   not prevent a TC String from being considered as "personal data

      "withinthemeaningofArticle4(1)AVG.

      48      Moreover, it appears from the file in the Court's possession - and in particular

      from the decision of February 2, 2022 - that the members of IAB Europe are obliged
      to provide that organization, at request, with all the information that would enable it to

      identify users whosedataarestoredinaTCString.

      49     Thus, subject to the verifications to be out by the verwljzende rechter In this

          50      It follows from the foregoing that a TC String constitutes personal data within the
         meaning of Article 4(1) AVG. Itis' irrelevant in this regard that withoutexternal cooperation,
         which it may require, such a sector organization does not have access to the data that its

 ReviewbytheMarketCourt

 TCStringaspersonaldata


 31.
 The definition of personal data in Article 4(1) AVG includes essentially four elements, which are

 cumulatively important for judging whether or not certain information should be considered
 personal data. These are (i) any information (ii) about (iii) an identified or identifiable (iv) natural
 ."


 32.
 In addition, a person is considered identifiable if he or she can be "identified, directly or indirectly, in
 particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data,

 an online identifier or to one or more elements characterizing the physical, physiological, genetic,
 mental,economic,culturalorsocialidentityofthatnaturalperson."Fringenumber30oftheAVGclarifies
 that natural persons can also be linked to online identifiers, as found in IP addresses and

 identificationcookies.

33.

The first condition for talking about personal data is "information." Data are described as objective
facts. Once they acquire meaning, information arises. The nature and content of the information is
. The form of the information or the medium is also . Some data have a dual nature in that they

both provide information about a person and allow a natural person to be identified.

34.

The second condition states that information must concern or be about a natural person. The
GBA implicitly states, followed therein by other supervisors, in the aforementioned margin number
309 of the Contested Decision, that in order to speak information concerning a natural , (only) one

of the three following elements

used with I t the purpose of assessing a person) as personal data or result data (data that have

potential effects on a person's rights or interests) as personal data. This position of the supervisors
is not followed by everyone in the legal doctrine, and hence the importance of the Prejudicial
Judgment."


35.

This second condition therefore plays an important role when the Dispute Chamber or the
Market Court has to adjudicate (relatively) new technologies such as TC Strings. Sometimes, as
in the present case, information (contained in the data) is in the form of a character and letter

string and not persons. In that case, the information is deemed to be only indirectly persons.

 personal preferences of a specific user in relation to his consent to the processing of his personal
 data, where it is information 'relating to a (...) natural person'within the meaning of Article 4(1) of
 theAVG."


 43.

Also with regard to the fourth condition, the Prejudice/Arresc provides interpretation in the aforementioned
 marginal numbers.


44.
However, in order to finally decide whether a TC String is personal data within the meaning of

Article 4(1) of the AVG, it is necessary, in accordance with the Prejudice Judgment, ufor the
Market Court to examine whether IAB Europe has reasonable means to identify a particular
natural person by means of a TC String.

47.
It is indisputable from all the aforementioned articles that, thanks to the information that its

members and other organizations participating in the TCF are required to provide to it, IAB Europe
has at its disposal resources that it and/or the participating organizations can reasonably be
expected to use(orcoulduse)to(in)directlyidentifyanatural.

 48,

 However, the fact that IAB Europe itself would not have the reasonable means to proceed with

 Identification because it cannot make the link between a TC String and the IP address and would
 not have direct access to the personal data, is in itself irrelevant. This is explicitly confirmed by
 the Court of Justice in margin numbers 46 and 47 of the Prejudicial Judgment as quoted above.


 It follows from the foregoing that a TC String is personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1)
 AVG.


 Isthereanyprocessingofpersonaldata?


 49.
 Article 4(2), AVG defines a "processing operation" as "any operation or set of operations which is
upon personal data or sets of personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as

collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval,
consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available,
alignmentorcombination,blocking,erasureordestruction."


50.

The TC Strings, once created, are then processed, i.e. collected, structured, ordered, distributed
and made available in accordance with the binding rules of the TCF. IAB Europe as management
organization and central figure in the digital ecosystem thereby determines the storage and

dissemination of the TC String.

The Contested Decision, by establishing in margin numbers 317-321 that at least the vendors collect,

process, store and share personal data - what Article 4(2) AVG calls "providing by means of
transmission" - has legally justified the processing of personal data within the             of the
aforementioned provision.




According to the TCF Technical Specifications, sharing the TC String with CMPs is done in two ways&#160;:


       a.    storing the TC String in a shared global consent cookie on the
             consensu.orginternetdomainofIABEuropeor

       b.    storing the TC String in a storage system chosen by the CMP if it is a

             service-specificconsentsignalconcerns.



                    PAGE     01-00004384135-0D33-0071-02-01-U  BrusselsCourtofAppeals-2022/4R/292-p34




 In both cases,   personal data are processed. Of course, IAB Europe's intervention in the
 processing was all the more consequential in the shared global consent cookie hypothesis.

 Indeed, that shared global consent cookie in which the TC String is stored refers to the
 consensu.org domain from which CMPs can access and update the gedee(the TC String. This
 domain was registered and managed by IAB Europe.


 Both this causing the TC String to be stored in a shared cookie, and making the TC String
 available to TCF participants via this central consensu.org domain, were clearly processing of
 personal data within the meaning of the AVG.


 52.

 Regardless of the g/oja/ consent cookie and the consensu.org domain, there is processing of

 personal data in the TCF managed by IAB Europe&#160;:


                O   user preferences are collected through a CMP and the CMP also gets the 's IP

                    address at that time&#160;;
                0   userpreferencesarestructuredandorderedinaTCString;

                0   the TC String is retained, distributed and made available to participants in
                    the TCF.


53.

Contrary to what IAB Europe states, this is not merely a theoretical conclusion, but a concrete

conclusion based documents (see, among others, documents C1 to C4 of the complainants&#160;:
bailiff's and/or notary's records of processing operations' . Nor is it merely a "standard" that
would not in itself constitute processing as IAB Europe argues: the TCF is a framework that

makes certain processing happen in a certain way, otherwise the would not work at all.
Obviously, the participants themselves choose whether they want to participate, but as soon as
they join, they are obliged to process the personal data (the user preferences and corresponding

identifiers) within the . After all, the TCF includes, as

 contained therein are additionally by IAB Europe.


 Isthereanycross-borderprocessingofpersonaldata'

 54.

 Asannouncedabove,theMarketCourtalsoexercisesfulljurisdictionhere:

 Data flows to countries within the European Union do occur within the system described above

 (TCF). This appears from paragraphs 5 to 11 of the Contested Decision and the documents from
 the administrative file as submitted by the GBA. However, it does not appear from the documents
 submitted to the Court that, as far as IAB Europe is concerned, there is a transfer to third

 countries within the meaning of Article 44 AVG.

 Account must therefore be taken of Article 1, point 3, AVG, which provides that the free

movement of personal data in the Union may neither be restricted nor prohibited for reasons
connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.


Article 423) AVG clarifies the concept of cross-border processing in following terms&#160;:

        "(a) processing of personal data in the course of the activities of establishments in more than

        one Member State of a controller or of a processor in the Union which is in more than
        one Member State; or (b) processing of personal data in the of the activities of one
        establishment of a controller or of a processor in the Union which materially affects orislikely

TheGBAastheleadsupervisoryauthority


Asannouncedabove,theMarketCourtalsoexercisesfulljurisdictionhere:Peripheral Number 11 of


the Contested Decision states&#160;:


       "The defendant has its sole registered office in Belgium, but its activities have a significant
       impact on interested parties in several Member States, including the complainants in

       Ireland, Poland and the Netherlands, as well as in Belgium." The Dispute Chamber draws its
       jurisdiction on a combined reading of Articles 56 and 4(23)(b) of the GBA. The GBA was
       caught by the Polish, Dutch and Irish data protection authorities following a

 inspection report (Exhibit A133 GBA) showing (page 8 and following) that the GBA can only       act

 astheleadsupervisoryauthoritywithrespecttoIABEurope'°andlimitedtor           the TCF.

 The lnspectorate justifies this on pages 10 and 11 of its report as follows&#160;: (EMPHASIS MARKETSHOF)


         The registered office of IAB Europe is located Place Robert Schuman No. 11 in 1040 Brussels

        7.2776, location confirmed in its "privacy policy" (piece No. 41 of file DOS-2019-01377).

        According to Article S6 § 1 of the AVG, the GBA is therefore the main supervisory
        authority for the Transparency and Framework.


         IAB Europe is the data controller for the Transparency and Consent Framework, as
         describedabove.


        IAB Europe developed a Transparency and Consent Framework (Exhibits Nos. 30 to

SIXTH and SEVENTH GRIEF IAB Europe&#160;: The Contested Decision erroneously concludes that IAB

 Through its sixth grievance, IAB Europe challenges the Dispute Resolution Chambers

 characterization of IAB Europe as a data controller with respect to personal data that might be
 processed by TCF participants. IAB Europe argues that even if it were deemed to have some
 degree of control over the resources, that does not necessarily make it a data controller.


 Regarding its seventh grievance, IAB Europe claims that the reasoning of the Contested Decision
 is unclear and incoherent and that the Dispute Resolution Chamber fails to clearly establish who is
 a (joint) controller or processor for which processing operations. The assessment of IAB Europe's

 joint (joint) processing responsibility with the CMPs, publishers and vendors is seriously flawed,
 according to IAB Europe.

 Both cases, according to IAB Europe, involve a manifest error of judgment on the part of the

 GBA.

 The GBA argues that IAB Europe responsible for the processing of TC Strings under the TCF as it

exercises (within its own agenda as Managing Organisation) decisive influence on the processing
through the framework it has set up. The real purpose of the framework is to enable and
promote the purchase and sale of online advertising space. IAB Europe establishes the essential
means by bindingly prescribing, among other things through the TCF, how CMPs should capture

users' consent or objections in a TC String. Finally, the Dispute Chamber is mindful that IAB
Europe also participates in determining the purpose and means of processing personal data
under the OpenRTB.


Regarding IAB Europe's seventh grievance, the GBA reiterates that IAB Europe is a joint data
controller. Both CMPs and publishers and Adtech vendors are joint data controllers. However,
this joint processing responsibility cannot detract from IAB 's responsibility.


The complainants argue that IAB Europe is a controller of the processing of personal data in the TCF
itself given its overriding control over the operation of the . It is IAB Europe as the authoritative
industry organization that organizes, coordinates and promotes the processing operations within

the TCF, while the participants in the TCF merely perform what IAB Europe has prescribed. The
participants in the TCF are joint controllers with IAB Europe&#160;: IAB Europe decides on the general

 59.
 Thereasonforthisisthreefold.


 First, the framework set up by IAB Europe - the TCF - plays a decisive role in the collection,
processing and dissemination of users' preferences, consents and objections, regardless of
whetherIABitselfcomesintocontactwiththese(marginal330ofthe Contested Decision).


Second, the documentation accompanying the TCF shows that the purpose ("why") of the TC String

and of its processing within the TCF was defined by IAB Europe. According to this documentation,
the TCF was developed to capture, document and transmit Internet users' transparency and consent
data in a standardized manner (marginal 338 of the Contested Decision). However, it is clear from

the list of objectives contained in the TCF that the real purpose of this framework is to enable
and promote the purchase and sale of online advertising space (edge number 336 of the Contested
Decision).


Third, the Contested Decision considers that IAB Europe has also defined the essential means of
processing TC Strings (i.e., "whose data, what data, how Iang and by whom are they

processed"¦). Indeed, it is IAB Europe that the TCF prescribes in a binding manner how CMPs
should capture users' consent or objections in a TC String, how vendors can access the TC
managed by the CMP in a standardized manner, how this TC String should be stored in a cookie,

which CMPs and

ThePre)udicialJudgment

60.

TheCourtconsidersthefollowing:(EMPHASISMARKETSCOURT)

      "60
          In view of the foregoing, it must be assumed that the first part of the second preliminary
           question seeks to determine whether a sectoral orgaization such as IAB Europe can be
           classifiedasajointcontrollerwithinthemeaningof Articles 4(7) and 26(1) AVG.

      61
           To that end, therefore, it must be assessed whether that organization - given the
           particular circumstances of the case - influences for its own purposes the processing
           uan personal data such as the TE string and determines together with others the
           purpose of and the means for that processing/ng.


      62   As,first,thepurposeofsuchprocessingofpersonaldata,itappears
           - subject to the checks to be carried out by the referring court - from the file in the

           Court's possession, as in paragraphs 21 and 22 of this judgment, that the TCF
           drawn up by IAB Europe is a standard intended to ensure compliance with the AVG
           whenthepersonal dataof users of an Internet site or application are processed by

           certain companiesparticipatingintheonlineauctioningofozonespace.

     63    Thus, the TCF is essentially designed to promote and enable the sale and purchase of

           advertising space on the Internet by those companies.


     64    Therefore, subject to the verifications to be carried out by the referring court, it can be
           assumed that IAB Europe, for its own purposes, influences the processing uan personal

           data at issue in the main proceedings and thereby, together with its members,
           determines the purpose of such processing.


     65   Secondly, as regards the means for such processing of personal data, it is clear from the
          file in the Court's - to checks to be carried out by the referring court - that the TCF is a
          standard which the members of IAB Europe are expected to if they" wish to" join" that
          association. In particular, IAB Europe - as it confirmed at the hearing before the Court -

          may, with regard to one of its members that the



                   PAGE    D1-00004384135-0039-0D71-02-DI-4



             L  Brussels Court of Appeals - 2022/AR/292 - p40





             rules of had TCF not complied with, take a suspension decision for non-compliance that
             may result in the member concerned w'or being excluded from the TCF and,
             consequently, for the processing of personal data it performs through TC-strings, not

             being able to rely on the AVG compliance guarantee that this system is supposed to
             provide.

        66   In addition, from a practical point of view - as mentioned in paragraph 21 of this

             judgment - the TCF prepared by IAB Europe contains technical specifications for
             processing the TC string. In particular, those specifications describe precisely how CMPs
             should record the preferences that users have regarding the processing of their

             personal data, and how those should be processed in order to a TC string. Furthermore,
             it also lays down precise rules on the content of the TC string as well as on the storage
             and sharing uan that .


       67    Thus, the decision of February 2, 2022 shows that IAB Europe prescribes in these ,
             among other things, thestandardizedwayinwhichthevarious parties involvedin' the
             TCF can consult the preferences, objections and consents listed in the TC string  .


       68   Therefore, subject to the findings to be made by the referring court, it must be
            assumed that a sectoral body such as IAB Europe influences, for its own
            purposes, the processing of personal data at issue in the main proceedings and

            thus determines, together with its members, the means of those processing
            operations. It follows that, in accordance with the case-law recalled in paragraph 57
            of this judgment, it' must be regarded as a 'joint uer processing controller' within the

            meaningof Articles 4(7) and26(1) of the AVG."

             Policies from time to time as it' reasonably deems necessary to the
             continued success of the Framework."


63.
IAB Europe thus acknowledges to be responsible for the Policies, the Specifications as well as the list
of Vendors allowed to participate in the TCF. It goes without saying that the organization thus

managing and administering the TCF is also 'responsible for it, including any processing of
personal data imposed and organized by the 7CF. Indeed, it is IAB Europe that enforces these
processing of personal data on the other participants.

 64.

 IAB Europe essentially argues that it would only be a small industry organization that wishes to

 players in the digital marketing ecosystem a standard or even a code of conduct for possible
 processing of user preferences.

 65.

 In its decision, the Dispute Chamber correctly found that IAB Europe does process personal data
with the TCF (marginal numbers 317-321 of the Contested Decision). The Board of IAB Europe
includes several of the largest Vendors and Publishers in the world, including Microsoft, Google,
etc. (Complainants' Exhibit E.5). Thus, this is indeed a central body that with decisive influence

makes certain processing of personal data happen.

IAB Europe's essential raison d'être is indisputably to represent the interests of the digital
advertising industry. It therefore exerts an influence on the processing of personal data for its

own purposes.

66.
In edge number 330 of the Contested Decision, the Dispute Chamber indicates that it considers

IAB Europe to be a data controller for the collection, processing and dissemination of users'
preferences, consents and objections and therefore for the processing operations in within the
TCF.

    b) On determining the purpose and means of these processing operations, IAB Europe

        indeed exercises a decisive influence

67.

        consultation with all other EU regulators.

    c) The qualification of IAB Europe In the Contested Decision as joint controllers

JointresponsibilityexistsunderArticle26AVG:

        "Where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing,

        they shall be joint . They shall determine in a transparent manner their respective
        responsibilities for compliance with the obligations under this Regulation, in particular as
        regards the exercise of the rights of the data subject and their respective obligations to

        provide the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14, by means of an arrangement
        between them, except if and to the extent that the respective responsibilities of the

        controllers are determined by a provision of Union or Member State law applicable to the
        controllers. The scheme may a contact point for data subjects.

       content of the arrangement shall be made available to the data subject.


       3. Notwithstanding the terms of the arrangement referred to in paragraph 1, the data
       subject may exercise his rights under this Regulation in relation to and against any

       controller."

 69.
 The Contested Decision finds in section B.3 that IAB Europe together with the TCF participants
 (CMPs,  publishers, vendors) are jointly responsible for the processing of personal data in the

 context of the TCF and of the OpenRTB.




 70.
 In edge number 544 of the Contested Decision, the Dispute Chamber does not find that IAB
 Europe is solely responsible for the processing of personal data under OpenRTB. The proportion of

 the TCF participants' respective responsibilities varies depending on the stage of processing (TCF
 versusOpenRTB)anddependingonwhethertheyactinsideoroutsidetheTCF.

 71.

 IAB Europe denies that it qualifies as a joint data controller with publishers, CMPs and adtech
 vendors for the processing of personal data under the TCF and OpenRTB.


 It should be generally pointed out that the Dispute Chamber's finding in the Contested 8
Decision, that a party other than IAB Europe also exercises influence over the purposes and means
of , in no way implies that IAB Europe not.


72.
No document submitted to the Market Court shows how IAB Europe and the TCF participants have
agreed on a mutual and transparent arrangement regarding their respective responsibilities as

requiredbytheaforementionedarticleoftheAVG.

73.
The Court of Justice, subject to verifications to be made by the referring court, ruled in the

Prejudicial Judgment that IAB Europe is a joint data controller with respect to the processing of
personal data it carries out jointly with its members through TC strings within the TCF (Prejudicial
Judgment,marginnumber68).


However, the Court of Justice also ruled the following in the Prejudicial Judgment&#160;:
(NADRUKKEN MARKTENHO£)


      "70. In addition, in response to the doubts of the dissenting judge, it must be held that any
      joint responsibility of that sector organization does not automatically extend to subsequent
      processingofpersonaldatabythirdparties,suchas

      onlineadvertising.


      71.      In this regard, it should first be noted that the "processing" of personal data is defined

      in Article 4, point 2, AVG as "any operation or set of operations which performed upon
      personal data or sets of personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as
      collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval,

      consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available,
      alignment or combination, blocking, erasureor destructionof data."


     72.       Thisdefinitionmakesit clear that theprocessingof personal datamayconsist of one
     ormoreoperations,eachofwhichrelatestoadifferentstageofthatprocessing.


     73.       Second, it follows from Articles 4(7) and 26(1) of the AVG - as the Court has already
     held - that a natural oy legal person can be regarded as jointly responsible for the processing of

     personal data only if it" determines jointly with others the purposes and means of that
     processing. Accordingly, that natural or legal person - without prejudice to any civil liability
     provided for by national law in this regard - cannot be regarded as being responsible, within

     the meaning of those provisions, for processing operations which take place earlier or later
     in the processing chain and for which, respectively, he' does not determine the purposes and

     means (see  , by analogy, judgment of 29 July 2019, Fashion ID, C-40/J7, EU.'C.'2019:629,
     paragraph74).


     74.      In the present case, a distinction must be made between, on the one hand, the
     processing of personal data by the members of IAB Europe - namely, Internet site or
     application providers and data brokers or advertising platforms - when" storing the

     consent preferences of the users concerned in a TC string according to the standard
     established in the TCF and, on the other hand, the processing of personal data that

     these companies and ¢ferrfen subsequently carry out on the basis of those preferences,
     for example, by forwarding those to third parties or personalized advertising offers to those
     users.


     75.      Subject to the verifications to be carried out by the referring court, IAB Europe
     does not appear to involved in such subsequent processing, so that it must be

     considered that such an organization is not automatically jointly responsible with those
     companies and third parties for the processing of personal data on the basis of the information
     containedinthepersonal dataof theapplicant.

     basedonthepreferencedatastoredinaTCstringfortheaffectedusers.

    76.       Therefore, an industry organization such as IAB Europe can only              be

              deemedresponsiblefor suchsubsequent processingonly if it is establishedthat it has
     influence

        themainproceedings."


 Thus,itmustfirstbeconsideredhowtheContestedDecision'sco-responsibility
 ofIABEuropeforprocessingpersonaldatainthecontextofTCFjustified.






 74.


 Step-by-step and reasoned, the Dispute Chamber states why and for what IAB Europe is responsible, as
 well as with whom&#160;:


         •      personal data are processed within the TCF (margin number 321 of the Contested
                Decision)&#160;;

        •       the purpose for processing personal data within the TCF, with in particular the TC
                String, is defined by IAB Europe in its TCF Policies (margin number 338 of the
                Contested Decision)&#160;;

        •       IAB Europe determines the means of processing personal data within the TCF, with
                in particular the TC String (marginal 360 of the Contested Decision)&#160;;

        •       IAB Europe is responsible for the processing of personal data within the TCF, with
                particular reference to the TC String (margin number 361 of the Contested
                Decision);

        •       Moreover, IAB Europe is jointly responsible for the processing of personal data
                within the TCF, with in particular the iC String (marginal 402 of the Contested
                Decision), together with&#160;:


                    o   theCMPs(marginalnumbers382and38JoftheContested8decision};

                    o   thePublishers(marginnumbers392-394oftheContestedDecision)and


                    o   theVendors(marginnumber399oftheContestedDecision).

75.


The above demonstrates that in the Contested Decision, the Dispute Chamber has established the
limits IAB Europe's responsibility. The "offering" or obligation by IAB Europe of a "standard" or
framework (TCF) for AVG compliance must in the present case and in light of the above-mentioned

documents in the file actually be considered a processing purpose in itself


                     COVER 01-0000438P135-0046-0071-02-D2-1  BrusselsCourtofAppeals-Z022/AR/29Z-p47




  considered for which IAB Europe is equally responsible as its members. fAB Europe is therefore in
 a position to safeguard the rights of data subjects and to comply with the obligations by the
 AVG.


 IAB Europe is thus jointly responsible with TCF participants for storing the consent preferences
 of the affected users in the TC String.

 TheContestedDecisioniscorrectlyreasonedonthispoint.


 Next, it must be considered how the Contested Decision justified IAB Europe's co-responsibility
 for the processing of personal data In the context of OpenRTB.

 76.


 ftTB stands for real-time bidding. RTB is a way to buy and sell ads through real- time auctions,
 meaning transactions are made in the time it takes for a Web page to load.

 77.


 When an Internet user visits a Web site, his or browsing habits on that Web site are (often)
tracked to enable personalized advertisements. Personal information regarding the user is then

matched with available advertisers and a real-tïme auction takes place between advertisers that
meet certain criteria. A distinction must be made here between data processing by the providers of a
websiteorapplication and subsequent data processing by third parties. A simple example&#160;: a user
visits a website offering organic dog food, but does not buy anything. The next moment, that same

user visits a news website and suddenly sees ads about organic dog food. These ads are placed
usingreal-timebidding.


78.
The ECJ states that the joint responsibility of IAB Europe and its members for the processing of
consent preferences in a TC string must be distinguished from the processing of personal data

based on those preferences (in the context of Open RTB). The CJEU also notes that IAB Europe
does not IAB Europe appear to be involved , and thus does not IAB influence, such subsequent
processing,suchas,forexample,theprovisionof personalized advertising offers to users.


79.

Thus, with respect IAB Europe's co-responsibility for further processing under OpenRTB, following
the Pre-Judgment, the Market Court must itself assess whether IAB


                  PAGE     DI-0 0 00 0 38 # 13S-00 # 7-0071-0 E-OK- #



              L BrusselsCourtofAppeals-2022/AR/292-p48




 Europe with the TCF "influences" the further processing of personal data under OpenRTB.
 Indeed, that assessment was not yet made by the Court of Justice as the GBA correctly notes In

 its conclusions.

ThecomplainantsargueinBandNo.T77oftheirconclusions:


        "Thiscaseconcerns theprocessingofpersonal datain thecontextofthe.WhileOpenRTBis

        processing of personal data that takesplaceinOpenRTB."


The GBA defends a slightly different view&#160;: 2it tries to argue in the Contested Decision that the
TCF does not stand alone but serves OpenRTB (edge number 370 of the Contested Decision),

that acts / subsequent processing of CMPs, of publishers and of TCF vendors outside theTCFareof
interest and lead to IAB Europe co-responsible for them. It refers for that purpose to what is
described in margin numbers 367 and following of the Contested Decision&#160;: (NADRUK

MARKTENHOF)

        "367. Both in its conclusions and during the hearing, IAB Europe emphasized that the T€F and

       the OpenRTB system are completely independent of each other, in the sense that adtech
       vendors, even without participating in the TCF, can freely process personal data within the
       framework of the OpenRTB. Complainants, on the other hand, have always mentioned the

       inherent interconnectedness between OpenRTB and the TCF, which the defendant itself
       confirms - according to complainants - in the TCF Implementation Guidelines.


       368. The Litigation Chamber finds that the defendant's argument cannot be followed, given
       that the defendant, on the one hand, repeatedly states in its conclusionthat the very reason

       for the existence of the TCF is to bring the processing of personal data based on the OpenRTB
       protocol in conformity with the applicable regulations,including the AVG and the ePrivacy
       Directives. While the Litigation Chamber understands that the TCF may be used for other

       applications by publishers, whether or not incollaboration with CMPs, it is equally certain that
       the TC£ was never intended to be stand-alone,onayhankelif'kecosystem.


       369. On the contrary, the Litigation Chamber finds that the Transporency and Consent
       Framework includes policies and technical specifications that should enable publishers of
       websites and applications (publishers) and adtech partners that support the torgeting,

       delivery and measurement of advertising and content (vendors) to obtain consent or
       establish objections, transparently disclose their processing purposes, and establish a valid

       legal basis for processing personal data for the provision of digital advertising.

         370. Thus, the Litigation Chamber finds that the decisions translated by IAB Europe into, on
        the one hand, the provisions uan the policies and technical speci)ications uan the TEL and, on
        the other hand, the means and purposes determined by the participating organizations with

        respect to the processing - whether in the framework of OpenRTB or not - of    users' personal
        data, should be considered as convergent decisions          . Indeed, IAB Europe d/edf an

        ecosystem within which users' consent, objections and preferences          are collected and
        exchanged    not for their own purposes or self-preservation      , but to facilitate further

        processing by third parties (i.e. publishers and adtech vendors) re.

        371. Consequently, the Litigation Chamber finds that IAB Europe and the respective

        participating organizations should be considered as joint controllers  for the collection and
        subsequent "dissemination of users' consents, concerns and preferences, as well as for the

        related processing of their personal data, without, however, the responsibility of participating
        CMPs and adtech vendors detracting from the responsibility of IAB Europe."

        "495. Although the Litigation Chamber has already ruled in this decision on the processing
        operations carried out in the OpenRTB and concluded that these processing operations do not

        comply with the fundamental principles of purpose limitation and data minimization (since no
        guarantee is provided to ensure that the personal data collected and disseminated in the that
        the personal data collected and disseminated within the framework of the OpenRTB are

        limited to in/ormotions strictly necessary for the purposes envisaged), the Dispute Resolution
        Chamber again stresses that the complainants have indicated in their conclusions that they

        limit the scope of their allegations to the processing operations within the TCF. Also, the
        Inspectorate has clarified in its report that IAB Europe does not act as data controller for the
        processing operations carried out entirely under the OpenRTB protocol.





        544. Wot the nature and purpose of the processing, and more the nature of the data, the
       Dispute Chamber notes that the TC String, as an expression of users' preferences regarding

       the processing purposes and potential adtech vendors offered through the CMP interface, is
       the cornerstone of the TCF.  Although the scope of this decision is the TCF and its TC Sfr/ng, and
       the sanction imposed on the Respondent relates solely to that framework, the compliance of

       OpenRTB with the AVG is assessed as part of a holistlsche

         Europe plays a central role with respect to the OpenRTB, without beinga data in that
         context."


 IABEuropeconcludesinthepresent(marginal39etseq.ofitsbriefs):

         "By extending the scope of the decision to OpenRTB and its stakeholders, the Dispute

         Resolution Chamber lost the ability to clearly distinguish the roles of the parties and their
         corresponding responsibilities, for the various data processing operations. Very often it is
         unclear what data the Dispute Chamber is talking about, whose interests it's' into account

         andwhoitconsidersresponsibleforwhat."

 80.


 TheMarketsCourtfindsthattheContestedDecision thusinconsistentlyreasonedonthispoint.

 The Market Court further considered that in their briefs, the plaintiffs indicated that they limited

 the scope of this lawsuit to the processing operations within the TCF.

 Moreover, the Court notes that the lnspectorate itself clarifies in its report that IAB Europe does
not act as a data controller for the processing operations carried out entirely under the OpenRTB

.

 In any event, none of the documents submitted to the Court indicate that IAB Europe is acting as

a (joint) data controller for the processing operations carried out entirely under the OpenRTB
protocol.


Based on the foregoing, IAB Europe's sixth grievance is unfounded and IAB Europe's seventh
grievance is only well-founded to the extent that the Contested Decision suggests, but does not
show, that IAB Europe is acting as a (joint) controller for the processing operations carried out

entirely under the OpenRTB .

GRIEVES RELATING TO THE ADOPTION OF THE INFRINGEMENT ON THE AVG IN THE DECISION


81.
TheContestedDecisionestablishesthefollowingviolations:


        "The Dispute Chamber found in the Contested Decision that IAB Europe infringed the
        following articles:


                    PAGE      01-00009384135-0DS0-0071-02-02-Brusselsourt oAppeals- 2022/AR/29Z- p.

        • Articles 5.1.a and 6 AVG - The current TCF does not provide a legal basis for processing

       users' preferences under the form of a TC String. Moreover, the Dispute Chamber notes
       that the TCF offers two bases for the processing of personal data by participating adtech

       vendors, but finds that neither can be used. First,   data subjects'consent  is currently not
       given in a sufficiently specific, informed and granular man. Second, thelegitimateinterest of
       the organizations participating in the TCF does not outweigh the interests of data subjects,

       given the large-scale processing of their TCF preferences under the OpenRTB and the
       impact it may have on them. Since none of the grounds for lawfulness listed in Article 6
       AVG apply to this processing, as explained above, the Defendant is in breach of Articles

       5(1)(a) and 6 AVG.







       Noting that the respondent itself no longer has any factual or technical control over the TC
       Strings once they have been generated by the CMPs and stored on users' cfpporots,
       the Dispute Resolution Chamber considers that it cannot oblige the respondent to

       remove a posteriori all TC Strings generated to date. More , it is the responsibility of the
       CMPs and publishers implementing the TCF to take appropriate measures in accordance

       with Articles 24 and 25 of the AVG to that personal data collected in violation of Articles 5 and
       6 of the AVG are no longer processed and are also deleted. To the extent that IABEurope is
       still storing TC Strings derived from the no longer available globally scoped consent cookies,

       the Dispute Chamber also considers that the Defendant should take the necessary
       measures to ensure that thesenolonger necessarypersonal dataareperm¢entlydeleted.


       • Articles J2, J3, and 14 AVG - The way the information is provided to data subjects does
      not meet the requirement of a "transparent, understandable and easily accessible form."
      Users of a website or opp/icoty participating in the TCh do not receive sufficient information

      about the categories of personal data about them and, moreover, cannot determine in
      advance the scope and consequences of the processing. The information provided to

processing&#160;; consequently, at least the shouldalso be heldresponsible forheepossiblelackofalegal

 seek consent from the data subject to record their consent, objections and preferences. IAB Europe
 draws the conclusion that the Contested Decision cannot find that consent has not been obtained.

 Finally, IAB Europe considers the balancing of interests regarding the (lack of a) legitimate interest
 within the meaning of Article 6, first point (f) AVG (margin numbers 421-423 of the Contested
 Decision)tobewrong.


 The GBA argues that IAB Europe, in its capacity as a data controller, requires a legal basis for the
 processing of TC Strings by CMPs, but there is no such legal basis. IAB Europe therefore violated
 Article6AVG.


 According to the complainants, IAB Europe's processing of personal data in the TCF violates the
 basic principle of fair, lawful and transparent processing. Indeed, it does not have any legal basis
 for the processing, has obtained the personal data in a misleading way, and does not provide

 either the complainants or any other data subjects with the legally required information about the
 processing of personal data it carries out (violation of Articles 5, 6, 12, 13 and 14 AVG).


 Judgment of the Market

 Court82.

 Article 5(1)(a) AVG states that all processing of personal data must be carried out in "a manner
 which lawful, decent and rronsporont in relation to the data subject."


The "rechtfmot/g" nature of a processing operation essentially means that it must meet àll legal
requirements, in particular having a legal basis.


Since IAB Europe does not provide any information about the processing of personal data to data
subjects, data subjects are left guessing as to which legal basis provided for in Article 6 AVG IAB
EuropewouldinvokeforitsprocessingofpersonaldataintheTCF.


However, it cannot on any legal basis under Article 6 AVG for the processing of the TC String in the
TCF. Moreover, the Litigation Chamber correctly states that IAB Europe cannot suffice merely by
to subsequent notifications that might be made to data subjects by Publishers or Publishers.


83.

IAB Europe cannot rely on the consent of complainants and other data subjects (Article 6(1)(a)
AVG), as it never sought, let alone obtained, such consent. Also nowhere in the TCF Policies,
Technical Specifications or General Terms and Conditions is a mechanism

 cited where IAB Europe would ask "data subjects permission to cure a uniquely-identifying string

 that shares their privacy preferences with a very large number of recipients. This lack of consent
 is even more egregious when those data subjects indicate in a CMP that they do not want to
 share personal data with anyone.


 The Disputes Chamber was correct to find in the Contested Decision that nowhere does IAB
 Europe obtain consent to process the personal data in the TCF, with in particular the TC String

 (edge number 407 of the Contested Decision).

 84.

 IAB Europe also cannot rely on the necessity of the processing of the TC String within the TCF for
 the performance of a contract with the Complainants and other data subjects (Article 6(1)(b)
 AVG), as there is no contract at all between them and IAB Europe. Therefore, the Dispute

 Chamber correctly established this in the Contested Decision (margin number 408 of the
 Contested Decision).


 85.
 Nor can it rely on the necessity of the TC String's processing operations within the TCF to comply
 with a legal obligation incumbent upon it (Article 6(1)(c) AVG), or protect the vital interests of

 the complainants and other data subjects (Article 6(1)(d) AVG), or in the performance of a task
 carried out in the public interest (Article 6(1)(e) AVG), as none of these justifications are present in
 the matter.


 86.
Finally, Zi) also cannot rely on the necessity of the TC String's processing operations within the

TCF to protect its legitimate interests, or those of a third party (Article 6(1)(f) AVG). Indeed, the
Dispute Chamber did the balancing of interests in the Contested Decision and rightly found that
the conditions for an application of Article 6(1)(f) AVG are not met. IAB Europe - on whom the

burden of proof of lawful data processing rests - did not provide sufficient insight into the
considerations it made and the factual data relevant in this respect. The conclusion is therefore
that it has not been established that the processing of personal data within the TCF is necessary

for a legitimate interest of IAB Europe or its members. IAB Europe does not sufficiently
recognize that users have a right to and an interest in the protection of their privacy and personal
data, and that the processing of personal data for advertising purposes may this. Furthermore, as a

data controller, it must take into account the reasonable expectations of data subjects. No
document submitted to the Court showed that IAB Europe actually so.

 The analysis related to the g lack of a legal basis in the Contested Decision is not incoherent as
 IAB Europe argues. Moreover, the Dispute Chamber did not make its analysis in the abstract but
 rather applied it in a concrete manner.


 The Contested Decision is correctly reasoned as to the lack of a legal basis on the part of IAB

 NinthdefenseGBA,partsixthpleacomplainants.


 Summaryviewsofparties

 IAB Europe disputes the Dispute Chamber's opinion in the Contested Decision according to which it
 violates the transparency obligation in Articles 12, 13 and 14 AVG. First, the Contested Decision

 would not have investigated and identified the defective disclosure on its own. Second, any
 information not provided by IAB Europe could and should be supplemented by the CMPs and
 publishers. Third, IAB Europe opposes the finding that the large number of third-party recipients
 makes it impossible for data subjects to give informed consent to processing and thus violates the

 principleoftransparency.

According to the GBA, the lack of disclosure was convincingly demonstrated by the complainants

and additionally relies on the Technical Report of the Inspection Service.

As for the obligation to compliance with the obligation of transparency, this rests on the data
controller, being IAB Europe and cannot be passed on to the CMPs and publishers. The Dispute

Chamber's factual assessment does not appear manifestly unreasonable. It is irrelevant whether
the consent preferences were already encoded in a TC String or encoded, given that also the
making available of such personal data qualifies as processing according to Article 4 AVG and the

data subject must therefore be informed about it.

Where the Contested Decision establishes a breach of the obligation of transparency, the
lawfulness of the Contested Decision cannot be affected if the reasoning were incorrect. Indeed,

the violation rests on several findings, only one of which is by IAB Europe. In any event, even if
the TCF is only a minimum framework, it must still be in compliance with the AVG.

 According to the Complainants, IAB Europe has breached its duty of transparency as a data

 controller, and the Dispute Resolution Chamber correctly relies for this conclusion on a thorough
 analysis of IAB Europe's own TCF documentation (e.g., margin numbers 467-473 of the
 Contested Decision).

IAB Europe's own privacy policy on its website (piece B.18 complainants) cannot remedy this.

Indeed, IAB Europe makes it clear that its privacy policy applies to only a limited number of data

        registered members ("Members") to which it provides services as further specified in the

        OrinDutch(noofficialtranslationknown):

        "IAB Europe respects the privacy of visitors to its websites ("Websites") ("Users"), of its

        registered members ("Members") to whom it provides services as further specified in the

None of the categories of data subjects mentioned in this quote relates to data subjects whose

personal data is processed in the TCF when they express certain preferences through a CMP and a
TC String is generated for them. Consequently, the2nd privacy policy is not relevant in this case
and cannot be considered in assessing whether IAB Europe has complied with its transparency

obligation.

Accordingly, IAB Europe violates Article 5(1)(a), Article 12 and Article 14 AVG, as the Dispute

Chamber was entitled to find in the Contested Decision.

IAB Europe did not inform data subjects prior to the processing operations. At the same time, it
cannot invoke any of the exceptions provided for in Article 14S) AVG in order not to have to provide
this information, since '

 In subordinate order, IAB Europe argues that, even if it were accepted that it is a joint data

controller with publishers and vendors, the AVG does not require it to supervise what are, in that
caseco-controllers. In addition, it accuses the Dispute Resolution Chamber of failing to provide
evidence that the TCF's security is inadequate and does claim to so-called validation.


The GBA argues that IAB Europe, as a data controller, is subject to the obligations In Article 24(1)

obligation.


Also according to the complainants who support the GBA's position, IAB Europe does not have
an adequate protection mechanism. For example, IAB Europe does not specify how it would
then ensure that CMPs effectively do not cooperate with Publishers who do not comply with the
agreements made. All it claims is that the "mechanisms for compliance in the TCF would ."

However, how this is supposed provide real protection is a to complainants. Indeed, none of the
mechanisms are based on real, proactive monitoring of TCF compliance. It is totally unclear to the
complainants how IAB Europe could guarantee the security of the processed TC String at all when

shared with the thousands of receiving companies.

 91.
 The Market Court refers to what precedes and the correct assessment by the Dispute Resolution

 Chamber in the Contested Decision of IAB Europe as (joint) controller of personal data processing
 in the context of TCF.

 92.

 The starting point is that in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects and the
 responsibility and liability of data controllers, it is necessary that the responsibilities established by
 the AVG be allocated in a clear manner (the mutual arrangement to be adopted by joint

 controllers under Article 26 AVG, which is not before us in the present case). The allocation of
 responsibilities is thus a matter for the joint controllers themselves, taking into account, on the
 one hand, the need for full compliance with the AVG and, on the other hand, the undesirable
 complexity (which could lead to a breach of the principles of lawfulness and transparency from

 Article51)AVG).

 The Market Court has already held above that the absence of a mutual arrangement or evidence

 thereof and the fact that both IAB Europe and the parties processing personal data with it under
 the TCF are all large or significant personal data processors (and thus by no means small entities
 with little influence over processing operations), implies equal convergent responsibility hero in
 this particular case.


This is appropriately expressed by the Dispute Chamberin the Contested Decision at margin number
 371in the following manner&#160;:


        "Accordingly, the Dispute Resolution Panel finds that IAB Europe and the respective
        participating organizations should be regarded as jointly responsible for the collection and
        subsequent dissemination of users' consents, objections and preferences, as well as for

        the related processing of their personal data, without, however, the responsibility
        participating CMPs and adtech vendors detracting from the responsibility of IAB    Europe."

As already held above, IAB Europe does qualify as a (joint) controller of TC Strings' processing

under the TCF.

Consequently, it has both an accountability obligation (Article 24(1) |uncto Article 5(2) AVG) and a

security obligation (Article 32 AVG |uncto Article 5(1)(f) AVG).

              L                                                       -J Brussels Court of Appeals - 2022/AR/292 - p61




 93.
 IAB Europe is also a data controller with respect to TC Strings that would be by CMPs outside the

 EEA. On this point, IAB Europe argues that the TCF was explicitly not developed for international
 transfers by publishers, vendors and CMPs. However, that is not a relevant criterion under the
 AVG. IAB Europe has been identified as a controller of TC Strings under the TCF because it

 appears to determine the purposes and means of processing the personal data contained in the
 TC Strings. As a controller, it, like the processor(s), is obliged under Article 44 AVG to comply with
 the conditions in Chapter V of the AVG before transferring these personal data to a third

 country.

 94.

 IAB Europe further maintains that the TCF itself is contractual in nature. But this contractual

 nature does not at all prevent IAB Europe from requiring, in accordance with Article 24(1) AVG,
 "appropriate technicalandorganizationalmeasures(to)ensureandbeabletodemonstratethat the
 processing is carried out in accordance with (the AVG)." it goes without saying that if the

 existence of an agreement between joint controllers were sufficient to escape this obligation,
 Article 24(1) AVG would be deprived of any useful effect.

 The Contested Decision does provide evidence of a lack of security. It substantiates this by

reference to a recent academic paper which IAB Europe claims one of the complainants contributed
to" and further deduces this from the fact that the TCF Policy does cite the possibility of
falsification or alteration of the TC Strings but merely stipulates that such manipulation is not .

Accordingly, it fell to IAB Europe to produce before the Dispute Resolution Chamber or the Market
Tribunal any relevant document that could demonstrate the contrary, quod non.


IAB Europe claim to provide a so-called validation, but it is a one-time, prior validation of the
software used by CMPs to generate the TC Strings. This validation primarily prevents CMPs from
generating unreadable, incorrect or non-TCF-compliant TC Strings.


The Contested Decision, on the other hand, correctly points out the lack of validation of
individual TC Strings. Only such validation can prevent vendors from (potentially) falsifying user
consent.

controller, it in no way requires that a person have access to the personal data in question. Nor
does it argue that Articles 30, 35 and 37 AVG make this a condition for the obligation to conduct a
data protection impact assessment or appoint an officer. Without the TCF, according to the GBA,

the processing of personal data in the context of RTB would simply be prohibited, as no consent
can be obtained or demonstrated for these (lightning-fast) processing operations. For that reason
alone - the GBA argues - it is "mischievous" to claim that the TCF protects Internet users, rather

than exposes them to the mass exchange of their personal data.

 Having reviewed the Contested Decision and documents submitted to it (including the reports of
 the Inspectorate, document A133 file GBA), the Market Court cannot follow IAB Europe's
 argument that it can benefit from the exceptions to the obligation to a register of processing

 activities provided in Article 30(S) AVG. Since IAB Europe's register of processing activities does
 not contain any processing operations in relation to the TCF, except for the management of the
 teden as well as the administration of the TCF, although IAB Europe, as Managing Organization
 or management organization, can access the records of consent (as above), the Dispute Chamber

 correctly finds a violation of Article 30 AVG in the Contested Decision. This was rightly expressed
 much earlier by the Inspectorate as follows&#160;:


         "The Inspectorate considers that ter non communication by IAB Europe of its register of
         processing activities following its request of 04/06/2019 (Exhibit No. 18 of file DOS-2019-
         01377) is in contradiction with the provisions of Article 30(4) of the AVG. Moreover, IAB
         Europe's position that it" does not have to keep records of processing activities" is in srryd mel

         orti#e/ 30(5) von the AVG and with let position of the ECGB."

 96.

Considering the large number of data subjects who (may) come into contact with websites and
applications the TCF, as well as organizations in the TCF, on the one hand, and the impact of the
TCF on the large-scale processing of personal data in the OpenRTB Protocol, on the other hand,
the Dispute Chamber rightly finds in the Contested Decision that IAB Europe wrongfully failed to

conduct a comprehensive data protection impact assessment with respect to the processing of
personal data within the .


About the obligation to wiiien a data protection officer (Art. 37 AVG).

97.
Because of the large-scale, regular and systematic observation of identifiable users that the TCF

entails, and given the role of IAB Europe, as Managing Organization, the Dispute Resolution
Chamber correctly finds in the Contested Decision that IAB Europe should have appointed a Data
Protection Officer (DPO). By failing to do so, IAB Europe violated Article 37 AVG. This was also
substantiated in the Inspectorate's report (Exhibit A133 file GBA):


        "The Inspection finds that IAB Europe has not complied with the obligations of Article 24(1)
        of the AVG. 0e reasons for this vostste/ling are the 'following: In its replies oon the

        inspectorate dated 26/06/2019 (Exhibit No. 22) and 20/08/20J9 (Exhibit No. 29), IAB
        Europe states that "IAB Europe is a professional association whose main activities are the
        provision of information and tools to stakeholders (in particular companies) active in the
        digitaladvertisingsector,aswellastheprovisionofinformation



                    PAGE 01-00D04384135-0063-0071-02-02-

         to the general public to verbalize their knowledge and inform them about the value that
        digital advertising for the market. Since IAB Europe did not meet the conditions referred to
        in Article 37 §1(b) of the AVG, it" did not appoint a data protection officer."

        According to the lnspectorate, IAB Europe's approach set out above is not by the facts. The
        conditions of Article 37(1)(b) of the AVG are , since IAB Europe develops and manages the
        TCF in its capacity as " Managing Organization " Exhibits 32 and 38 of file DOS-2019-01377)

        and pursuant to page 7 of the terms and conditions for the IAB Europe Transparency &amp;
        Consent Framework of IAB Europe ("Terms and ConditionsJ ("General Terms and

        any information by the organizations inthisecosystem,statedinits"PrivacyPolicy."


In so far as the Contested Decision rules on the breach by IAB Europe of the obligations on data
protection impact assessment, on the appointment of a data protection officer and on the

maintenance of a register of processing activities, as regards its processing of personal data in the
TCF, it is correctly reasoned.


98.
This is also the case for the following passage in the Contested Decision that deals with the alleged
violations regarding the rights of data subjects (Articles 15 to 22 AVG):


        "504. First of all, the lnspectorate notes in its report that certain complainants have
        alleged that it is impossible for those concerned to exercise their rights, although the
        investigation conducted by the Inspectorate did not these violations. In the absence von

        bewiys von an infringement, the Dispute Chamber limits its reasoning to general
        commentsregardingtheexerciseoftherightsofdatasubjects.


        505. Second, the Dispute Chamber refers to the scope of the Complainants' written
        submissions, in which they" specifically limited their grievances tof the processing of the
        Complainants' personal data by the Respondent in the specific context of the TCF. Bj
        "consequence, the Disputes Chamber will niec adjudicate the circumstances in which data

        subjects can exercise their rights with respect to the processing of personal data in the "bid
        requests" vis-à-vis the adtech vendors, since this processing is carried out entirely in
        accordance with the OpenRTB protocol.


       506. With respect to the current version of the TCF, however, the Dispute Chamber finds
       that the TCF does not appear to facilitate the Exercise of Data Subjects' rights, in that users

       cannoteasilyandatalltimes theCMPinterface,sothat


                    PAGE 01-00004384135-0064-0071-02-02-4




              L CourtofAppealsBrussels-2022/AR/292-p65




         they can change their preferences and request the identity of the adtech vendors with whom
        their personal data have been shared through a bid request, in accordance with the OpenRTB

        protocol. In this regard, the Litigation Chamber underscores the importance of proper
        implementation and enforcement of the interface requirements set forth in the TCF Policies

        so that data subjects can effectively exercise their rights vis-à-vis each of the joint processing
        responsibilities, and notes" that the shared responsibility for this lies primarily with the CMPs
        and publishers. Based on the govensroonde, the Disputes Chamber is not In a position to find

        a breach uast of Articles 15-22 AVG."

IAB Europe's 11 , 12 , 13 ' and 14th grievances are therefore


unfounded. THE ORDERS AND FINE !N THE CONTESTED


99.
IABEuropedoesnotdevelopaseparategrievanceinitsconclusionregardingtheinjunctionsimposed
onitandthe administrative fine.


100.

In margin number 353 of its conclusions, IAB Europe states&#160;:

        "S53. Destruction of the fine - In addition, it should be emphasized that in calculating the fine

        in the Contested Decision, no distinction is made between the various alleged breaches of the
        AVG and their impact on the amount of the fine for [IAB Europe]. However, it is clear from the
        CJEU Judgment that they/s the Contested Decision as such does not contain sufficient

        justification for a huge proportion of the alleged infringements. As indicated earlier, five of
        the six infringements in the Contested Decision are based on (IAB Europe's) alleged
        processing responsibility for subsequent processing. However, it is clear from the CJEU

        Judgment that there is no processing responsibility on the part of [IAB Europe] for subsequent
        processing by third parties. This means that at least B0% of the Contested Decision is based on
        an erroneous assessment of the factual and legal facts of the case.


        This already suffices as a circumstance to substantially reduce the fine (should a fine be
        justified - quod non, as further explained below).


        Moreover, in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice    ,an administrative fine
        can only be imposed "if it is established that the , which is both a legal person and an
        undertaking, has intentionallyornegligently an  infringementreferredto   inparagraphs   4to6

        ofthatArticle(83AVG)."





                    PAGE      D1-D00D4384135-0D65-0071-02-02-4



              L                                                     y         In this case, [IAB Europe] certainly was not and cannot be accused of intentional wrongful
         conduct. Even in the Contested Decision, negligence was only alleged but not
         demonstrated and then only with respect to the integrity of the TC String (§547 Contested
         Decision). In light of the above-mentioned case law, only a can be imposed in proportion

         to the negligence established. In practice, [IAB Europej has already taken the necessary
         steps öithin the limits of its role - as a non-processing responsible party - to promote
         compliance with the AVG by TCF participants.

        The lack of negligence (and deliberate unrec/itmoric behavior) is all the more obvious

        since fundamental questions to the CJEU have been raised on which the entirety of the
        case depends, even if it was first proposed to your Court by the Litigation Chamber itself.
        Asking questions to the CJEU clearly shows that a certain legal question is pertinent and

        thatthereisnouniqueandmanifestlyclearanswer(yet).


        Consequently,theimpositionofanadministrativefinewasnotjustified."


 The GBA and the complainants' briefs no longer address the injunction and the administrative
 fine imposed.

 Article 58(2) AVG provides the power for supervisory authorities to take one or more corrective
 measures against controllers or processors.


Under Article 58(2)(i) AVG, a supervisory authority may, depending on the circumstances of
each case, impose an administrative fine in addition to or instead of the aforementioned
corrective measures.


102.
In this regard, Article 83(1) AVG requires that an administrative fine imposed by an authority must
effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each case. Article B32) AVG contains a number of

criteria that must be duly taken into account in a concrete case.AsanctiontobebytheGBAinthe
form of an administrative fine must be adequately justified, whereby the size of this sanction must,
on the one hand, be in line with the circumstances and, on the other hand, be proportionate to the

breach identified and to the capacity of the offending party to bear the costs.

 To determine whether or a sanction is criminal in nature within the meaning of Article 6 ECHR,

 The three criteria are not cumulative. Even if a sanction does not have the qualification of
 criminal sanction under domestic law, it may still have a criminal under the second or third

 criteria."

 In order for an administrative fine to have a preventive and punitive purpose, it is required that it

 essentially seeks to prevent and punish an act or omission deemed illegal by the legislature and
 thatthefinethuscausessufferingtotheperpetratorofthatactor omission.         20


 104.
 When the Market Court is asked to review an administrative fine that is punitive in nature within

the meaning of Article 6 ECHR, it may examine the legality of that sanction and, in particular,
whether it is reconcilable with the mandatory requirements of international treaties and

domestic law, including general principles of law.

In particular, this right of review should allow the Court to consider whether the penalty is not

disproportionate to the infringement, so that it may examine whether a fine of such magnitude
could reasonably be imposed.


This right of review does not mean that the Market Court may, based on a subjective
appreciation of what it deems reasonable, for mere expediency and against statutory rules,

remit or reduce a fine."

 106.

 On October 11, 2021 (document A179 file GBA), the Dispute Resolution Chamber of the GBA
 made clear to IAB Europe its intention to impose an administrative fine and, in accordance with
 the indications of the Market Court, asked IAB Europe to submit its reaction in this respect. IAB

 Europe therefore had the opportunity to specifically defend itself with regard to the fine, which it
 did (document A180 file GBA).


 107.
 Indeterminingthefine,theGBAconsideredthefollowingcircumstances(Exhibit A179 file GBA) '


    •   "IAB Europe is a trade association whose main activities are said to be the provision of
        information and tools to stakeholders (in particular companies) active in the digital
        advertising sector in the European Union as well as the provision of information to the

        general public to improve their knowledge and inform them of the value of digital advertising
        to the market. The defendant therefore has a leading role in relation to its members as well
        as to the wider digital marketing and advertising sector in the European Union."

    •   "IAB Europe is part of the IAB Global Network as well as von the lnteractive Advertising
        Bureau (IAB) consortium, based in New York."

    •   "IAB Europe's TCF, in its current version, aims to be used in an increasing number of
        websites and applications, which means that more and more data subjects will be confronted
        with the TCF and the associated processing of their personal data."


It also took into account the following criteria&#160;: a) nature of the infringement, b) seriousness of
the infringement, c) duration of the infringement and d) the necessary deterrent effect to

prevent further infringements.

108.

IAB Europe essentially accuses the GBA of failing to consider the lack negligence (and intentional wrongful
conduct).


109.
However, in the Contested Decision (margin number 547), the Dispute Chamber specifically and
pertinently responds to this point that is now being raised again by IAB Europe before the

Market Court&#160;:




                   PAGE     01-00004384135-0068-0D71-02-02-'|



              L Brussels Court of Appeals - 2022/AR/292 - p, 69




         "Article 83.2.b AVG requires the Data Protection Authority to take into account the

         intentional or negligent nature of the breach. Since the defendant, in its capacity as a
         management organization, was aware uan the risks associated with non-compliance with
         the TCF, in particular mer with respect to the integrity of the TC String and the
         encapsulated choices and preferences of users, and given the impact of the TC String on

         subsequent processing in the context of the OpenRTB, the Dispute Resolution Chamber
         finds that IAB Europe has negligent in' adopting the measures to implement the current
         version of the TCF."


 TheContestedDecision(s)iscorrectlyreasonedonthispoint.

 After review, the Court considers that, in view of the foregoing, the GBA Disputes Chamber could

 reasonably impose a fine of EUR 250,000.00.

 In conclusion, while the contested decision is admittedly procedurally flawed as set out in the
Interlocutory Judgment, IAB Europe's substantive grievances against the contested decision are

unfounded, except to the that the contested decision holds that IAB Europe acts as a (joint)
controller of the processing operations that take place entirely under the OpenRTB protocol.
The Market Court also confirms the sanctions imposed on IAB Europe by the Contested Decision

that relate solely to processing operations within the TCF. It is not necessary to refer the case
back to the Dispute Resolution Chamber, nor is it legally required for the Market Court to
proceed with a European consultation procedure.
