<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>A data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA because a courier, United Parcel Service (UPS) (the controller) had delivered a parcel addressed to them to a neighbour without any prior consent.   
</p><p>The courier firstly tried to exclude its responsibility in subjective terms. The controller submitted that there was a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.ups.com/assets/resources/webcontent/es_ES/terms_carriage_es.pdf">contract</a> in place with Media Markt and that they were acting as service providers, following their instructions and acting according to the contract. They also alleged that clause 10 of the contract specified that parcels may be left with neighbours when the addressee cannot be found; and clause 11 specified that it was Media Markt who should inform their customer about the processing of their data.  
</p><p>In its decision, the DPA had to determine who the controller was and what GDPR provisions might have been breached by the incident.  
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>According to the Spanish DPA, with reference to EDPB's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-07/eppb_guidelines_202007_controllerprocessor_final_en.pdf">Guidelines 07/2020</a>, in order to determine the roles of controllers and processors, what must be taken into account is the actual activity of both of them (i.e., the factual elements or circumstances of the case).
</p><p>In this case, there was merely a services contract in place between the retailer and the controller. A contract that sets out precise instructions for the processing (i.e., 'the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller'), as per <a href="/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR#3" title="Article 28 GDPR">Article 28(3) GDPR</a>, was lacking.
</p><p>Additionally, the DPA highlighted that such contract should also define the obligation to respect the confidentiality of the data and the measures laid out in <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a>. Therefore, as the obligations were not clearly defined, the controller could not qualify as a processor and was responsible for the incident due to actual control over the means of processing the personal data. 
</p><p>The DPA found a breach of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a> since the personal data of the data subject were disclosed to a third person without their consent. For this violation, the DPA fined the controller €50,000. The DPA also found a violation of <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32 GDPR</a> since the controller did not implement the measures necessary to prevent such disclosure. For this violation, the DPA fined the controller €20,000.

The entity claimed as a supplier of MEDIA MARKT has no proof that

in the specific shipment to the complainant, it would have had to proceed in a way
specific or different from what was agreed with MEDIA MARKT.

Therefore, if the Agency decided not to admit the initial claim filed by the
complainant against MEDIA MARKT in which the complainant expressly referred

which should proceed equally in the case at hand, since the entity
claimed has acted as agreed with its client MEDIA MARKT.

In this way, it is MEDIA MARKT itself, as the sender of the product, which
should have excluded the possibility of delivery to a neighbor of the delivery, since UPS
expressly informed him that in the absence of this exclusion this was possible.


Therefore, the respondent entity considers that it has acted in accordance with the
contract signed with MEDIA MARKT, being MEDIA MARKT itself as
data controller who had the obligation to inform the
claimed entity that could not deliver through a neighbor.


In view of everything that has been done, by the Spanish Data Protection Agency
In this proceeding, the following are considered proven facts:

                                            III

Security in the processing of personal data is regulated in article 32 of the
RGPD where the following is established:

Article 73.f) of the LOPDGDD, under the heading "Infringements considered serious
has:


“According to article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, they will be considered serious and
Infractions that suppose a substantial violation will prescribe after two years.

                                           IV

It is considered that the claimed party has transferred the data of the claimant to a third party,

without your consent.

According to Guidelines 07/2020 of the European Committee for Data Protection (CEPD)
on the concepts of data controller and manager in the RGPD, the
concepts of person in charge and person in charge are functional and have to be assigned

the legal relationship established between the parties.

In this specific case, the respondent has provided the terms and conditions that
govern the contract signed with MEDIA MARKT to claim that it has acted in
in accordance with said contract for the provision of services, according to which it must be

MEDIA MARKT who requests the consent of his client when he requests the
product delivery service by courier. However, UPS has not credited
meet the necessary requirements to be considered in charge of the
treatment, since it has not been proven that MEDIA MARK and UPS have signed
the contract that must govern the relations between the person in charge and the person in charge of the

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/10








processing of personal data as established in article 28.3 of the RGPD
where the precise instructions for the processing of personal data are detailed
given by the person in charge.


In this sense, it should be noted that article 28.3 b) and c) of the RGPD, regarding the
responsible for the processing of personal data establishes the following:

“The treatment by the person in charge will be governed by a contract (…) that binds the
manager with respect to the person in charge.


Said contract or legal act shall stipulate, in particular, that the person in charge:

b) will guarantee that the persons authorized to process personal data have
committed to respecting confidentiality or are subject to an obligation of

confidentiality of a statutory nature;

c) take all necessary measures in accordance with article 32;

Therefore, the fact of having signed a contract with MEDIA MARKT does not

exempt UPS from liability, in this case the claimed company, because it was not
has specified whether we are dealing with a service contract or a contract entered into
between the controller and the controller of personal data, being in this
second case, it is compulsory to comply with all the guarantees required
in accordance with article 28 of the RGPD.


Thus, the known facts constitute an infraction, attributable to the
claimed party, for violation of precept 5.1 f) of the RGPD, in accordance with the
established in the foundation of law II.

This Agency also considers that we are facing a violation of the

article 32 of the RGPD, since the security measures of the claimed entity do not
are adequate and must be improved after it has been verified that they have not
have been sufficient to prevent the events denounced.

For all these reasons, this Agency considers that the claimed entity has infringed the

articles 5.1 f) and 32 of the RGPD, by violating the principle of integrity and confidentiality, as well
such as not adopting the necessary security measures to guarantee the protection of
the personal data of its clients.

                                           v


Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following: "Each control authority will have
of all the following corrective powers indicated below:
