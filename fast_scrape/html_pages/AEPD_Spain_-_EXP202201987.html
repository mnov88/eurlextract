<p>The Spanish DPA ordered a mobile network operator to comply with a request to access and erase the data of a deceased family member pursuant to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Articles 15</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR" title="Article 17 GDPR">17 GDPR</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject's e-mail address was associated with a mobile phone line contracted by their aunt with a mobile network operator (the controller). After receiving an e-mail addressed to their deceased aunt, the data subject informed the controller about the passing away and requested access and subsequent deletion of their aunt's data. 
</p><p>In response, the controller asked for a copy of the death certificate, which was provided by the data subject. A few days later, the data subject received information that there was a possible identity theft incident because the controller had not sent out any commercial information by electronic means to the data subject's aunt. Allegedly, someone was trying to impersonate the controller. Eventually, the request to access and erase the personal data in question was not fulfilled despite the time limit for a reponse having passed. 
</p><p>Consequently, the data subject directed a complaint to the Spanish DPA in order to have their rights exercised.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>First, the Spanish DPA reiterated the importance of safeguarding data subject rights, especially the right of access under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" title="Article 15 GDPR">Article 15 GDPR,</a> in a timely manner as well as in clear and transparent form. 
</p><p>Second, the DPA looked at the right to erasure under <a href="/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR" title="Article 17 GDPR">Article 17 GDPR</a>, which allows data subjects to have their personal data deleted after balancing the different interests at stake. In the present case, it was also important to consider Article 3 of the LOPDGDD, the Spanish data protection law, which allows family members of deceased persons to request deletion of their data from the controller or processor. 
</p><p>The DPA took into account the controller's argument that it did not comply with the request because it did not have any information on the service contracted by the deceased. The DPA concluded that in case of doubts about the identity of the requesting party, the controller should have requested more information from the data subject, rather than leave the request unanswered. Therefore, the controller had no valid reason to not comply with the access request and request for erasure. 
</p><p>The DPA officially called the controller to comply with the data subject requests in a timely manner.

     File No.: EXP202201987



                           RESOLUTION No.: R/00772/2022

Considering the claim made on January 31, 2022 before this Agency by Mr.
A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claimant party), against PEPEMOBILE. SL (hereinafter, the

claimed party), for not having been duly attended to their right of suppression.

Carrying out the procedural actions provided for in Title VIII of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the following have been verified



                                       FACTS

FIRST: The email address of the complaining party is associated with
a mobile line contracted by his aunt with the claimed party.


After receiving an email addressed to his aunt, he contacted the claimed entity
by the same means informing him of the death of the same, and requesting the
deletion of your data.


The respondent replied requesting a copy of the death certificate, which was
submitted by the claimant on November 30, 2021.

A few days later, given the lack of response, he contacted the
claimed, which replies indicating that the file you sent them is damaged and

They need me to send it back, I send the claimant the same day, December 3
of 2021.

Subsequently, the claimant has received an email from the entity
claimed, addressed to her aunt, informing her that they are suffering possible
identity theft.


SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of the LOPDGDD, which has provided for a
mechanism prior to the admission to processing of the claims that are formulated before
the AEPD, consisting of transferring them to the Data Protection Delegates
designated by those responsible or in charge of the treatment, for the purposes foreseen

in article 37 of the aforementioned rule, or to these when they have not been designated,
transferred the claim to the claimed entity so that it could proceed with its
analysis and respond to the complaining party and this Agency within a
month.


The representative of the respondent states that "(...) the interested party does not provide
any information related to the owner of the line, or identifying data or
contracted line, so we cannot meet the right based on the information
provided in this claim without such information.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/7









However, we have moved the information about email attachments in the
claim to our customer service department to try to locate the

case and review what could have happened.

Regarding the sending of commercial communications, my client does not send
commercial information of any nature by policy or by electronic means or

responsible entity to proceed with its analysis, respond to this Agency

within a month and prove that they have provided the claimant with the due response,
in the event of exercising the rights regulated in articles 15 to 22 of the
GDPR.

The result of said transfer did not allow to understand satisfied the claims of the

claiming party. Consequently, on April 30, 2022, for the purposes
provided for in article 64.2 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to admit the submitted claim for processing. Saying
agreement of admission to procedure determines the opening of the present procedure of
lack of attention to a request to exercise the rights established in the
articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD, regulated in article 64.1 of the LOPDGDD, according to the

which:

administrative that must be purged in a sanctioning procedure and, in
consequently, the decision on its opening, not existing obligation to initiate a
procedure before any request made by a third party. Such a decision must

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/7








"4. If the person in charge of the treatment does not process the request of the interested party,
will inform without delay, and no later than one month after receiving the
request, the reasons for its non-action and the possibility of presenting a

claim before a control authority and to exercise legal actions.”

SEVENTH: In the case analyzed here, it has been proven that the claimant
requested the deletion of the data of her deceased aunt, having provided a copy of the
death certificate.


During the processing of this procedure, the entity claimed, has indicated
that it has not fulfilled the right requested given that it does not have any information on the
deceased or the service contracted by the same.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, from the examination of the documentation provided, it is clear that the

The claimant submitted, twice, a copy of the death certificate of the deceased aunt.

Moreover, in the event that the claimed entity had doubts about the data to be
delete or the identity of the applicant, should have requested that information, and not
leave the exercise presented unanswered.


Consequently, given that there is no evidence that the respondent party attended the
right requested, or denied reasoned the same, it is appropriate to estimate the
claim that gave rise to this proceeding.

Considering the aforementioned precepts and others of general application,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
