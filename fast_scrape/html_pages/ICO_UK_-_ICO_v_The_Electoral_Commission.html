<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The Electoral Commission (“the controller”) servers were accessed by an unknown threat actor on 3 separate occasions. As a result of the incident, the personal data of individuals in the electoral register were affected which contained the names and home addresses of approximately 40,000,000 data subjects.
</p><p>During the course of this incident, three separate clusters of activity were identified:
1. 24 August 2021, hacker gained access to an on-premise Microsoft exchange server using a security flaw known as the ProxyShell vulnerability chain. The hackers then pretended to be a legitimate user, which allowed them to install hidden programs (web shells) on the server. These programs were used again on 16 September 2021, 13 June 2022 and 02 August 2022. Beginning 14 March 2022, the hacker also installed hidden access points (backdoors) on the system.
2. On 14 March 2022, another hacker exploited the vulnerabilities in the ProxyShell. It could not be determined at this point if the hacker retained the previous access or re-compromised the system again. 
3. On 28 October 2021, an employee reported that spam emails were being sent from the controllers server but they were not in the individuals sent items folder on Outlook. 
</p><p>Following the third incident, the server was shut down and scrubbed before being restarted.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The ICO held that, on a basic level, the controller did not have an appropriate patching regime at the time of the incident, which led to a number of vulnerabilities being present on their exchange server. In addition, a report produced during the incident highlighted a further 8 vulnerabilities which could have been exploited by a hacker. This represented a lack of compliance with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f" title="Article 5 GDPR">Article 5(1)(f) GDPR</a>. 
</p><p>Contrary to <a href="/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1b" title="Article 32 GDPR">Article 32(1)(b) GDPR</a>, it was also held the controller did not have an appropriate password management policy in place. It’s acceptable use policy only referenced the notion that passwords should not be revealed or written down. During an audit, it was discovered that 1 of the user accounts were still utilised a password they were provided during account allocation. 178 users utilised passwords that were identical or similar to the passwords provided by the service desk upon creation or password reset. There were an additional 33 deactivated accounts with similar passwords. 
</p><p>In light of the incident, the controller implemented the following steps:
- Implementation of a multi-factor authentication for all users;
- New password policy control;
- A solution which supports threat and vulnerability programs;
- Implementation of a system/software which monitors all servers, firewalls and internet traffic;
- Implemented a technology modernisation plan and onboarded an individual/company to provide. Managed infrastructure support service.
</p><p>These remedial steps were considered and welcomed by the ICO. 
</p><p>In light of the above, the ICO decided to issue a reprimand.

                                  REPRIMAND

To: The Electoral Commission

Of: 3 Bunhill Row, London, EC1Y 8YZ

1.3 The personal data affected by this incident relates mainly to the Electoral
Register, which contains the names and home addresses for approximately

40,000,000 data subjects.

1.4 During the course of this incident, three separate clusters of Threat Actor

activity were identified.              investigated Clusters one and two, and
        investigated Cluster three. A summary of each Cluster is below.


   2. Cluster 1

2.1 On 24 August 2021, an unknown Threat Actor gained access to an on-
premise Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 via the ProxyShell vulnerability chain.

The vulnerability chain consisted of the following vulnerabilities: CVE-2021-
31207, CVE-2021-34523 and CVE-2021-34473. A user account was

impersonated during the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, which led to web
shells being created on the system.

    14 March 2022, backdoors in the form of                 were also installed on
    the system.
       3. Cluster 2

    3.1 On 03 October 2021, a second Threat Actor successfully exploited the
    ProxyShell vulnerabilities and deployed a web shell to the server. This web shell

    was quarantined and deleted by

    3.2 On 14 March 2022, a scheduled task was created on server
                  were unable to determine whether the Threat Actor retained
    access to the Exchange Server or if they re-compromised it in March 2022. The
    scheduled task was configured to download and execute a
    payload, the IP address for these actions was the same as the one used in
    October 2021.


    3.3 The last observed threat activity occurred via a connection from a host to
                                    did not identify any follow-on activity associated
                            malware.

       4. Cluster 3

    4.1 On 28 October 2021, an alert was raised when an employee reported that
    spam emails were being sent from The Electoral Commission's Exchange
    Server. Emails from the sent items queue in Exchange Server were being sent
    from the server, but were not in the individual's visible sent items in Outlook.A
                        scan was carried out on the on-premise Exchange Server
    which showed that it had been injected with malware                           .
                                                                                 )

    4.2 Following this, the Exchange Server was shut down and scrubbed using
                       , before being restarted. A new scan showed that the virus
    had been removed. At this stage,- were engaged to support initial
    remediation and carry out a penetration test.

    4.3 The Electoral Commission also advised the National Cyber Security Centre
    (NCSC) about this incident. The NCSC raised concerns about the incident being

    similar to activity which was discussed in a Microsoft biog in March 2021. The
    NCSC strongly recommended that a wider investigation into The Electoral
    Commission's IT systems should be carried out by a CIR accredited company.
    At the time, The Electoral Commission considered that the incident was isolated
    and as they were moving closer to migration to the Cloud, remedial action withICO.

    the old servers was limited. The Electoral Commission stated that they were
    aware of the problems with out-of-date infrastructure.


        5. The reprimand

     5.1 The Commissioner has decided to issue a reprimand to The Electoral

    Commission in respect of the following alleged infringements of the UK GDPR:

       •   Article 5(1)(f) which states that personal data shall be "Processed in a
           manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including

           protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against
           accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or

           organisational measures"

           Article 32(l)(b) which states "Taking into account the state of the art, the

           costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of
           processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the
           rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor

           shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to
           ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as

           appropriate:

           b. the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability

           and resilience of processing systems and services."

    5.2 The reasons for the Commissioner's findings are set out below.


    5.3 Our investigation found infringements in relation to the security
    requirements of the UK GDPR and these are set out below.

        6. Article 5 (1) (f)


       •  The Electoral Commission were not ensuring the security of personal data

           as per Article 5(1)(f).

    6.1 The Electoral Commission did not have an appropriate patching regime in
    place at the time of the incident. This led to a number of vulnerabilities being
    present on their on-premise Exchange Server. The ProxyShell vulnerabilityICO.
InformatioiCo'miss onersOffice

    chain was utilised on several occasions during this incident and the patches for

     these vulnerabilities were released in April and May 2021.

     6.2 Furthermore, a report produced during this incident highlighted a further
    eight vulnerabilities which were also present on the servers. Although not

     utilised on this occasion, any one of them could have been exploited by a
     Threat Actor whilst they existed on the relevant systems.


     6.3 The NCSC and NIST have both produced extensive guidance on patching
     which highlight the importance of having an appropriate patching plan in place

    as well as the actions organisations can take.

    6.4 This failing is a basic measure that we would expect to see implemented in

    any organisation processing personal data - regardless of potential severity of
    risk or size of organisation.


       7. Article 32 (1) (b)

        •  The Electoral Commission were not ensuring the ongoing confidentiality of

           its processing systems as per Article 32(1)(b).

    7.1 The Electoral Commission did not have appropriate password management

    policies in place at the time of the incident. During the Electoral Commission's
    investigation, they discovered that one of the compromised accounts was still

     using a password which was allocated to the account upon creation. Following
     this,              were instructed to perform an audit of user passwords in The

     Electoral Commission's Active Directory.

    7.2                were able to rapidly crack 178 active accounts using

    passwords identical or similar to the ones provided to users by the Service Desk
     upon account creation or password reset. An additional 33 deactivated accounts

     with similar password were also found. Following their audit,
    stated that this practice of reusing passwords makes The Electoral

     Commission's passwords highly susceptible to password guessing.

    7.3 The Electoral Commission did not have a dedicated password management

    policy in place at the time of the incident. The policy (Acceptable Use) which
     was in place did not contain any specific password management guidance, the only
    reference to passwords stated 'do not reveal or write down passwords'.

                   4           5
    7.4 The NCSC     and NIST have produced guidance on passwords which

     highlight the importance of staff training as well as password length and other
     mitigations like rate limiting.

     7.5 This failing is a basic measure that we would expect to see implemented in

     any organisation processing personal data - regardless of potential severity of
     risk or size of organisation.

       8. Remedial steps taken by The Electoral Commission

    8.1 The Commissioner has also considered and welcomes the remedial steps

     taken by The Electoral Commission in the light of this incident. In particular:

        •  Implemented a Technology Modernisation Plan;
        •  Onboarded           to provide a Managed Infrastructure Support Service;
        •  Implemented                               which monitors all servers,
           firewalls and i

        •  Implemented                        solution which supports Threat and
           Vulnerability programs;
        •  Implemented password policy controls within their Active Directory;
        •  Implemented Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users.


     9. Decision to issue a reprimand

    9.1 Taking into account the circumstances of this case, including the remedial

     steps, the Commissioner has decided to issue a reprimand to The Electoral
     Commission in relation to the infringements of Articles S(l)(f) and 32(1)(b) of
                                  6
     the UK GDPR set out above.























    6
     The Electoral Commission has had an opportunity to make representations to the Commissioner in
    responseto the Notice of Intent regarding this reprimand. The Electoral Commission accepted the
    Notice ofIntent and the Commissioner's findings.
