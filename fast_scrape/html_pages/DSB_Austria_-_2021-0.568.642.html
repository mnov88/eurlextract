<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The subject matter of the complaint is whether the respondent violated the first and second complainants' right to confidentiality (under §1(1) DSG) by obtaining their "most personal" data - which the Austrian DPA understood to mean their address data, specifically title, name, date of birth and address - from the customer and prospect file systems of other address and direct marketing companies.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The respondent argued that it had the commercial authority of an address publishing and direct marketing company, and therefore lawfully processed the complainant's personal data. They supported this claim by handing over declarations of the data providers to the Austrian DPA.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The Austrian DPA assessed the documents the respondent provided, and held that the processing of the complainant's address data was lawful because (i) the respondent had a valid trade licence "for the exercise of the trade of address publishers and direct marketing companies", (ii) only obtained the relevant data for advertising purposes, (iii) processed the data in line with the principle of proportionality per §151(3) Trade Regulation Act 1994.

Evaluation of evidence: The findings on points C.1. and C.2. are based on the information submitted by the complainant to initiate the proceedings as well as the copy of the information letter submitted, the authenticity and correctness of which was never questioned by the respondent.
3. With submissions dated December 8, 2019 (ha. Received on December 9, 2019), the complainants submitted complaints to the data protection authority.
Evidence assessment: The statement on point C.3. results from the files.
4. The Respondent has had since * 5. June 19 ** about a valid trade license to practice the trade of address publishers and direct marketing companies.
Evidence assessment: The statement on point C.4. based on an extract from the Austrian Business Information System (GISA,) requested by the data protection authority on September 28, 2021, GISA number: * 47 ** 361 **.
5. The complainant's address data, specifically salutation, first and last name, date of birth and address, were made available to the respondent from a customer and prospect file system of Marketing *** XY AG and / or W *** Direkt GmbH.
Evaluation of evidence: The findings under point C.5. are based on the respondent's statements as well as the information letters submitted by the complainant in the context of the initiating submissions.
6. Marketing *** XY AG has declared to the respondent within the meaning of § 151 Paragraph 5 GewO that the collection of address data, in particular salutation, name, date of birth and address, will be carried out for marketing purposes in a suitable manner in accordance with § 151 GewO and there was no prohibition on the part of those affected (declaration of no objection). This document was requested in accordance with Section 17 (3) AVG excluded from inspection of files.
7. W *** Direkt GmbH has declared to the respondent within the meaning of § 151 Paragraph 5 GewO that the collection of address data, in particular salutation, name, date of birth and address, will be carried out for marketing purposes in a suitable manner in accordance with § 151 GewO and there was no prohibition on the part of those affected (declaration of no objection). This document was requested in accordance with Section 17 (3) AVG excluded from inspection of files.
Evaluation of evidence: The findings on points C.6. and C.7. result from the files.
8. The consent of the first complainant and the second complainant to the processing of the items listed under points C.1. and C.2. The data sets listed were not available at any point in time. There was also no prohibition of processing for the purpose of direct marketing by the complainants.
9. After the information was provided by the Respondent on April 2, 2019 or May 2019, the items listed under points C.1. and C.2. cited data sets and these are no longer passed on to third parties for the purpose of direct marketing since then.
Evidence assessment: The information relating to points C.8. and C.9. The findings made are based on the Respondent's submissions, which were undisputed by the Complainants.
D. From a legal point of view, it follows:
D.1. On the admissibility of "secret evidence"
1.) Pursuant to Section 45 (3) AVG, the parties are to be given the opportunity to take note of and comment on the result of the taking of evidence (principle of allowing the parties to be heard, see VwGH March 27, 1990, 89/08/0250).
2.) In exceptional cases, however, the admissibility of a statement of reasons based on evidence that is excluded from inspection of the files, based on the decision of the Constitutional Court of October 10, 2019, E 1025/2018, according to which the interests of the parties to the proceedings for access to proceedings-relevant Information compete with the interests of parties to the procedure for the protection of confidential information and trade secrets.
3.) Specifically, the Administrative Court stated (emphasis added by the data protection authority):
“Neither the fundamental right of access to procedural files guaranteed by Art. 6 ECHR within the framework of the principle of equality of arms nor the fundamental right to secrecy of trade and business secrets protected by Art. 8 ECHR can establish an absolutely protected legal position. Rather, in administrative proceedings or in administrative court proceedings, the right of access to information relevant to the decision must be weighed against the right of other parties to the proceedings to protect their confidential information and their business secrets. The principle of the protection of confidential information and trade secrets must be designed in such a way that it is consistent with the requirements of effective legal protection and the observance of the procedural rights of those involved in the proceedings and that it is ensured that the right to a fair trial is observed overall.
[...]
Against this background, the fact that individual parts of the files are excluded from inspection of the files in accordance with Section 17 (3) AVG does not necessarily mean that this is accompanied by a violation of the right to be heard by the parties within the meaning of Section 45 (3) AVG if the authority nevertheless uses the relevant file components. It is true that it represents the principle of every official procedure regulated by the rule of law that there may be no secret evidence (so in each case VwGH 17.6.2004, 2003/03/0157; 25.9.2014, 2011/07/0006). In certain, exceptional cases, however, it may be necessary to withhold certain information from the parties in order to safeguard the fundamental rights of a third party or other party involved in the proceedings or to protect important interests of the general public, as long as it is ensured that both the authority and the administrative court appealed against dispose of all documents relevant to the decision in full (see ECJ February 14, 2008, case C-450/06, Varec SA; furthermore Hanslik, op. cit., 139 ff.). The information withheld from the parties to the proceedings is to be limited to the extent that is absolutely necessary and all possibilities are to be exhausted to limit the basis for decision-making in such a way that information to be withheld does not have to be used to make a decision. The authority or the administrative court must clearly justify the balancing of their procedure between the right to confidentiality and the right to inspect files and thus transparency of the basis for the decision, so that the parties to the proceedings are subject to administrative judicial control or an appeal to the
In principle, effective legal protection (VfSlg 13.699 / 1994) and effective complaints (Art. 13 ECHR) are guaranteed on the basis of Section 17 AVG. "
4.) In the present case, the findings in C.6. and C.7. The documents mentioned ("clearance certificates") or the (detailed) information contained therein are excluded from inspection of files or submission to the complainant due to a corresponding request by the respondent in accordance with Section 17 (3) AVG. The consideration of this information by the data protection authority was necessary insofar as the existence of a written "clearance certificate" is an essential legality requirement for the processing within the meaning of § 151 GewO (see point D.2.).
5.) It would not have been possible to pass on the evidence excluded from inspection of the files or from the hearing of the parties to the complainants without disclosing information about their business relationships with third parties (trade secrets) that was covered by the Respondent's interest in secrecy.
6.) At the same time, the complainants' interest in knowing the entire content of the document proves to be reduced to the extent that the complainants are aware of the fact that the declarations are available and thus the withholding of detailed information does not constitute a significant restriction on the procedural transparency that is relevant for the complainant . Incidentally, the legal assessment of the declarations had to be carried out officially by the data protection authority.
7.) A weighing up of these conflicting interests in the present case therefore led to the fact that this evidence could not be made available to the complainants.
D.2. On the subject of the complaint and the legality of the data processing (point 1)
8.) The complainants alleged a violation of the right to secrecy because the respondent unlawfully obtained her “most personal” data from a former employment relationship or bank account contract.
9.) On the basis of this submission, the data protection authority assumed that the complainants primarily complained about the illegal processing of address data - salutation, name, date of birth and address - and that the subject of the examination was consequently limited to this data category. The authority's obligation to conduct an official investigation of the truth does not go so far that it would have to carry out investigations in every conceivable direction; give (VwGH 04/04/2002, 2002/08/0021).
10.) As can be seen from the findings, the Respondent has a valid trade license to practice the trade of address publishers and direct marketing companies. In addition to the GDPR and the DSG, § 151 GewO also meets additional commercial regulations on the use of personal data for third-party marketing purposes by those authorized to practice the business of address publishers and direct marketing companies. As a "special data protection law" (cf. Risz in Ennöckl / N. Raschauer / Wessely, GewO § 151 Rn. 9 mwH), the provision contains regulations on the conditions under which address publishers and direct marketing companies may determine and use personal data.
11.) The direct advertiser must have data on the selected target groups in order to be able to achieve his corporate purpose. This is also in the interests of traders who commission a direct advertising company to carry out advertising campaigns. The flow of data between the trader and the direct advertising company must therefore be enabled, in both directions, but with the restriction that the transmission of data is always linked to the purpose of carrying out advertising campaigns (cf. Gruber / Paliege-Barfuß, GewO7, Section 151, marginal number 6)
12.) If - as in the present case - the data subjects (Art. 4 Z 11 GDPR) have not given their consent to the transmission of their data for third-party marketing purposes, address publishers and direct marketing companies may only use the data listed in Section 151 (5) first sentence of the GewO from a Identify a third party customer and prospect file system. A further requirement is that the owner of the file system has given the trader a written and safe declaration that the data subjects have been appropriately informed about the possibility of prohibiting the transmission of their data to third parties for marketing purposes and that no prohibition has been made (declaration of no objection).
13.) As a trader, the respondent received the complainant's address data from the customer and prospect file system of "Marketing *** XY AG" or "W *** Direkt GmbH". Since the declarations of no objection required for lawful processing are also available - as stated - the processing of the address data - salutation, name, date of birth and address - within the scope of marketing purposes, even without express consent, proved to be permissible and the complaints proved to be unfounded as a result (cf. also the decision of April 18, 2019, GZ: DSB-D123.986 / 0003-DSB / 2019).
14.) It was therefore to be decided according to the ruling.
D.3. To reject the applications for a claim for the damage incurred (point 2 of the ruling)
15.) The complainants also applied for appropriate compensation for the damage they (allegedly) suffered.
16.) Pursuant to Section 29 (1) GDPR, every person concerned who has suffered material or immaterial damage as a result of a violation of the GDPR or the GDPR is entitled to compensation from the person responsible under Art. 82 GDPR.
17.) It should be noted, however, that according to Section 29 (2) DSG, the regional court entrusted with exercising jurisdiction in civil law matters is responsible in the first instance for claims for damages.
18.) Due to the incompetence of the data protection authority, a decision had to be made according to the ruling.
