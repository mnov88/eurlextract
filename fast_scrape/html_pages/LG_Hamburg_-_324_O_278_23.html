<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>In 2022 the Berlin Administrative Court issued a ruling. The ruling included statements about the plaintiff (the data subject). In particular, the ruling stated that they were in arrears with the payment for their pension plan and that they received unemployment benefits for a while.
</p><p>Non-profit legal database OpenJur (the controller) provided a free digital legal database. In the context of this activity, the controller published the ruling of the Administrative Court in its database. The controller did not remove the data subject's name from the ruling before publishing.
</p><p>The data subject found the ruling on the database and requested the controller to remove it. The controller anonymized the ruling by removing the data subject's name but refused to remove the ruling.
</p><p>The data subject filed a lawsuit with the Regional Court of Hamburg. They claimed for damages and sought an injunction for the controller to remove the ruling from the database.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>First, the Court clarified that the controller's activities were journalistic in nature and, therefore, fell within the scope of Art. 85(2) GDPR (national exemptions for journalistic activities) and the relative German laws[1]. In this regard, the Court noted that the controller did not simply publish rulings. On the contrary, the controller carried out an editorial activity by choosing the decisions to publish, requesting unpublished decisions from courts, and providing summaries for the decisions.
</p><p>Then, the Court clarified that the controller's activities were lawful under national law. In particular, the Court noted that the Berlin Administrative Court was a "privileged source" of information. The Hamburg Court held that in relying on such a source, the defendant acted justifiably and was under no obligation to conduct subsequent research[2]. For these reasons, the Court dismissed both the damage claim and the request for injunctive relief.

Order

The value in dispute is set at €31,000.
Facts

The parties are disputing claims related to a court decision published by the defendant in a case law database.

The plaintiff is a lawyer admitted to the Berlin Bar Association. The defendant operates a freely accessible case law database at www.openjur.de, where it documents case law in full. It is a recognized non-profit organization based in Hamburg. The defendant's corporate purpose includes, among other things, the promotion of education, science, and research.

The case law database operated by the defendant is partly fed by automated court decisions, for example, from a case law database of the State of Berlin operated by juris GmbH. Secondly, the defendant specifically requests previously unpublished decisions from courts or third parties, selects which decisions submitted by third parties are published, drafts its own guiding principles and keywords for decisions, highlights decisions on its homepage and via the defendant's social media accounts, and publishes references to press reports on legal and social topics. For details of such non-automated activities, reference is made to the defendant's written submission of June 14, 2024.

The plaintiff appeared as the applicant in interim injunction proceedings before the Berlin Administrative Court. The proceedings, directed against the pension fund for lawyers in Berlin, concerned, among other things, the plaintiff's default in paying his pension benefits, which is why the pension fund initiated enforcement proceedings against him. A decision in the matter was issued on May 5, 2022. No oral hearing took place. It is unclear whether the decision was publicly announced. Among other things, the decision contains statements regarding the plaintiff's former job, the fact that he received unemployment benefit 1 for a certain period, and the fact that he was in arrears with contributions to the professional pension fund. The decision also contains information regarding the plaintiff's financial situation. Further details can be found in Exhibit K 2.

The defendant published this decision on the website openjur.de, for which it is responsible, citing the plaintiff's real name, which was included in paragraph 27 of the decision.

The decision in dispute, published by the defendant, was subsequently indexed by common internet search engines. The parties are in dispute as to whether – as the plaintiff argued – the defendant's publication appeared as one of the first hits when the plaintiff's first and last name was entered into a search engine.

On May 5, 2023, the plaintiff demanded that the defendant cease further dissemination of the decision, provide information in accordance with data protection law, and reimburse costs and pay damages. The defendant rejected the asserted claims by email on the same day, but immediately removed the plaintiff's name from the decision published on its website and informed the plaintiff that the decision of the Berlin Administrative Court had been automatically imported from the official database of the State of Berlin.

The plaintiff claims that by publishing the disputed decision in a non-anonymized form, the defendant made his personal data and private circumstances accessible to the public worldwide. This resulted in an unreasonable loss of control for the plaintiff, which also had a concrete damaging effect on his reputation and potentially significantly hindered his professional advancement. Potential clients are reluctant to engage a lawyer who has been unemployed for a certain period of time, has been unable to meet his payment obligations on time, and has requested the waiver or deferral of such claims, citing particular hardship. Furthermore, the plaintiff remains unclear about the exact extent of the violation of his rights.

Due to the publication, the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction pursuant to Sections 823 (1) and 1004 (1) Sentence 2 of the German Civil Code (BGB) in conjunction with Article 2 (1) and Article 1 (1) of the Basic Law (GG). The non-anonymized publication violated the plaintiff's right to informational self-determination. The plaintiff's real name constitutes personal data within the meaning of Article 4 (1) of the GDPR. There is no discernible overriding interest on the part of the defendant in naming his name. In particular, the content of the resolution did not provide any reason to disclose the plaintiff's name. Contrary to the defendant's opinion, its liability is not exempted because it assumes that it was not responsible for the publication. In any case, it acted negligently in publishing the decision. It adopted the decision of the Berlin Administrative Court and made it accessible to a new public without first carrying out the required anonymization in each individual case and removing all personal information from the decision.

The plaintiff also did not himself make the circumstances published by the defendant public. He merely exercised his right to take legal action. He also did not tolerate the publication of his name without objection, but only became aware of it in March/April 2023. Furthermore, the plaintiff could not file a motion for exclusion from the public because the decision in question was issued without an oral hearing.

After the plaintiff initially denied, claiming ignorance, that the defendant had automatically retrieved the disputed decision of the Berlin Administrative Court in a non-anonymized form from the case law database of the State of Berlin, and the defendant subsequently provided further details regarding the technical details related to the publication of the decision in written submissions and through its managing director at the oral hearing on April 26, 2024, the plaintiff no longer maintained his denial. The plaintiff, for example, in a written submission dated November 8, 2024, undisputedly stated that the decision was retrieved automatically and in a non-anonymized form from the database of the State of Berlin. However, the plaintiff took the position that such an automated retrieval did not constitute an editorial or scientific activity that could justify privileged treatment of the defendant.

There was no discernible interest in the defendant's naming the plaintiff that outweighed the plaintiff's interests. The defendant denies, on the grounds of ignorance, that the Berlin Administrative Court conducted a balancing process in order to publish the plaintiff's real name.

The asserted claim for damages is also well-founded. The concept of damage in Article 82 GDPR, as an autonomous concept under European law, is to be interpreted, particularly in light of the objectives of the GDPR, and does not require the damage incurred to be particularly significant. The initial publication of the non-anonymized text of the decision already caused significant harm to the plaintiff. It is obvious that the defendant acted negligently. It is consistent with the obligation when publishing data potentially relevant to personal rights to review such data before publication and, where necessary, to anonymize it. Furthermore, the defendant's fault is presumed under Article 82 (1) GDPR. This presumption has not been refuted.

The plaintiff originally also asserted a right to information against the defendant based on Article 15 GDPR. The defendant, who argued that any possible right to information on the part of the plaintiff had already expired prior to the court proceedings, provided the plaintiff with information in Exhibit B4, which was attached to the statement of defense. The party representatives subsequently unanimously declared the motion for information to be settled at the oral hearing on March 28, 2025.

The plaintiff has most recently requested:

1. The defendant is ordered to refrain from publishing the plaintiff's personal data in connection with the decision of the Berlin Administrative Court of May 5, 2022, in case no. VG 12 L 25/22, on the internet or making it publicly available, as was done with the publication of the non-anonymized text of the decision of the Berlin Administrative Court (case no. VG 12 L 25/22) in the defendant's case law database, which is available until May 5, 2023, at https://openjur.de/u/2395992.html and as shown in Exhibit K 2.

2. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff reasonable damages for pain and suffering, but at least a total of €5,500, plus interest at a rate of 5 percentage points above the base interest rate from the date the case was filed.

3. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff pre-trial legal fees in the amount of €1,375.88, plus interest at a rate of 5 percentage points above the base interest rate from May 27, 2023.

The defendant requests that

the action be dismissed.

It relies on the fact that the plaintiff himself made the circumstances contained in the decision public by initiating an administrative dispute before the Berlin Administrative Court and making the circumstances of his employment and income the subject of his statements without requesting that the decision be excluded from public view. The plaintiff thus relinquished control of the circumstances concerning him and waived his right to confidentiality. The Berlin Administrative Court publicly announced its decision, and the Senate Department for Justice and Consumer Protection made a version of the decision freely available online in the Berlin case law database at gesetze.berlin.de. The plaintiff's name was included in the reasoning section of the decision. The defendant adopted this publication unchanged. The plaintiff accepted the publication in the Berlin Senate Administration's database for over a year before seeking to have his name deleted. The plaintiff's naming in the publication of the decision suggests that the Senate Administration prioritized the public's interest in full access to the decision over the plaintiff's interest in confidentiality. The fact that the plaintiff initiated the proceedings himself and presented the circumstances concerning him himself may also have played a role.

The decisions of the Berlin Senate Administration are freely accessible. Anyone can access the case law database and thus access the court decisions contained therein. These decisions from the database are also indexed by Google, so they appear in search results. Therefore, the decision concerning the plaintiff from the case law database of the State of Berlin should also have been discoverable on Google.

The defendant also receives court decisions from third parties or courts. If this is the case, it performs manual anonymization before publication. However, it did not receive the decision in dispute from a court or third party, but rather acquired it from the case law database of the State of Berlin through an automated comparison of the docID. It does not perform any manual review during such an acquisition.

After receiving the plaintiff's warning letter on May 5, 2023, at 6:07 p.m., the defendant – which is undisputed – removed the plaintiff's name from the decision it had published at 6:25 p.m. The defendant then requested re-indexing by Google and removal from Google's cache entries and informed the plaintiff of the steps taken that same evening. The defendant's technical precautions prevent further publication of the decision in the defendant's database, as it is designed in such a way that each court decision can only be published once.

The injunction application is unfounded. The plaintiff argues that there is no violation of the right to informational self-determination alleged by the plaintiff. This manifestation of the general personality right is not relevant from the outset. At most, the manifestation of the general personality right relating to freedom of expression could be relevant. However, this must be considered secondary when weighed against the defendant's freedom of expression and freedom of the press.

The defendant's case law database is protected by freedom of the press. It compiles German and European court decisions and makes them accessible to an indeterminate group of people on the website openjur.de as a media distribution channel. In the balancing of interests to be carried out, the plaintiff's interests in preventing publication must be considered secondary. The plaintiff's general right of personality is of only minor importance, since the decision of the Berlin Administrative Court was already widely accessible before the plaintiff's notification of May 5, 2023. Furthermore, he himself disclosed the circumstances concerning him. He waived his right to confidentiality when the decision was announced. Furthermore, he accepted the decision's availability online in the case law database of the State of Berlin for almost a year. Publication in the defendant's database did not significantly expand the circle of recipients. Furthermore, only true facts from the plaintiff's social sphere were disseminated.

In this case, there is a particular public interest in compiling and bundling the largest possible number of court decisions, as the defendant does. The defendant cannot offer a freely accessible and comprehensive case law database if it has to individually review each decision for suspected violations of law. Furthermore, given the discretion enjoyed by judicial authorities when publishing decisions, it is virtually impossible to understand the considerations underlying the decision. Therefore, it cannot be required to conduct a case-by-case review. According to the case law of the Federal Constitutional Court, the defendant may use facts appearing in publicly accessible databases in good faith, as long as they are not recognizably outdated or revoked.

There is also no risk of repetition for the injunctive relief. The defendant acted in reliance on the legality of the publication by a state authority. Increased trust may be placed in the announcements of official bodies. This also applies to the publication of court decisions in the state case law databases. The defendant was entitled to assume that the State of Berlin's decision to publish the plaintiff's name in the reasons for the decision was lawful. This trust was only shaken by the plaintiff's notice of May 5, 2023, to which the defendant responded immediately.

The plaintiff is also not entitled to the asserted claim for damages. Payment of monetary compensation is out of the question due to the defendant's lack of fault. The defendant relied on the State of Berlin's publication. Furthermore, it acts in a non-profit capacity and for the common good. The plaintiff is also not entitled to reimbursement of costs.
Reasons

The action is admissible but unfounded.

I. The plaintiff is not entitled to the asserted claim for injunctive relief against the defendant, neither under Article 17 GDPR nor under national law.

1. There is no claim for injunctive relief under Article 17 GDPR.

The defendant's activities in connection with the publication of court decisions in the case law database operated by the defendant fall under the scope exception of Article 85 (2) GDPR. As a result, the question of whether the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction against the defendant is not governed by the provisions of the GDPR, but by the relevant national law.

a) Pursuant to Article 85(2) GDPR, Member States shall provide for derogations or exceptions from Chapter II (Principles), Chapter III (Rights of the Data Subject), Chapter IV (Controller and Processor), Chapter V (Transfer of Personal Data to Third Countries or to International Organizations), Chapter VI (Independent Supervisory Authorities), Chapter VII (Cooperation and Consistency), and Chapter IX (Provisions for Specific Processing Situations) for processing carried out for journalistic purposes or for scientific, artistic, or literary purposes, if this is necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with freedom of expression and information.

The concept of journalistic purpose is to be interpreted autonomously under EU law. It is to be understood broadly. This follows from Recital 153, p. 7 of the GDPR, which states: "In order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in a democratic society, concepts such as journalism, which refer to that freedom, must be interpreted broadly."

According to the case law of the ECJ, the purpose of the publication is the most important factor. It depends on whether the publication aims to disseminate information, opinions, or ideas to the public. However, the ECJ also states that not all information published online falls under the definition of journalistic activity (ECJ GRUR 2019, 760 para. 59 – Buivids). However, the professional pursuit of the activity (professional journalist) is just as irrelevant as the connection to a newspaper or broadcasting editorial office (BeckOK InfoMedienR/Cornils, 47th Ed. 1 February 2021, Art. 85 GDPR para. 70, beck-online).

The classification of intermediaries that do not publish their own texts or content, but instead disseminate third-party content, is assessed in a differentiated manner: In the case of a doctor rating portal, the Federal Court of Justice ruled that the media privilege under Art. 85 (2) GDPR did not apply because the ratings lacked journalistic and editorial processing (BGHZ 202, 242 para. 13 – Doctor Rating II; BGHZ 217, 340 para. 10 – Doctor Rating III). This met with criticism because the portal operator in the Doctor Rating III case had indeed intervened in the presentation of the doctor profiles (cf. BGHZ 217, 340 para. 18) and thus abandoned its position as a neutral information intermediary (BeckOK InfoMedienR/Cornils, 47th Ed. 1 February 2021, Art. 85 GDPR para. 75.1, beck-online). Privileging information intermediaries is considered possible if they perform a minimum level of processing (BeckOK DatenschutzR/Lauber-Rönsberg, 50th Ed. November 1, 2024, Art. 85 GDPR para. 21, beck-online).

b) According to this standard, the conditions for the exception for journalistic purposes are met here, because the defendant is engaged in activities related to the operation of the case law database in a manner that justifies classification as editorial activity.

For example, the defendant specifically requests the publication of previously unpublished court decisions. This applies, for example, to the decision of the Higher Regional Court of December 6, 2021, Ref. No. 3 Ws 250/21, which was widely discussed in the media, on the discontinuation of the data protection fine proceedings against the company Deutsche Wohnen, or the historic verdict in the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial. In 2023, approximately 300 court decisions were requested and published for the first time in this way (see selection in Appendix B 8). The defendant also requests decisions from third parties. This applies, for example, to the judgment of the Munich I Regional Court in the so-called bathtub case, which the defendant requested and received from the attorneys in the proceedings there after its request for transmission was rejected by the President of the Regional Court. The defendant also pursues legal recourse to obtain decisions, for example, when courts refuse to send decisions or charge fees for their transmission. To the extent that third parties submit decisions, the defendant selects which of these decisions to publish. The defendant writes its own orientation statements on decisions and keywords decisions. It highlights decisions on its homepage and via the defendant's social media presence and presents individually selected, particularly relevant, and newly published case law on its homepage under the heading "Current."

This activity differs significantly from simply collecting data or simply distributing third-party content, as occurs, for example, on review portals. A key difference lies in the fact that the defendant also specifically requests court decisions, which gives its activity an editorial and opinion-forming character. Furthermore, the defendant also provides a minimum level of processing by selecting decisions for prominent publication and providing a description of the decisions.

c) The defendant's activities in connection with the case law database it operates are also subject to the area exception. This also applies in view of the fact that the judgment publication in question – like many other judgment publications by the defendant – is an automated decision taken without modification from case law databases.

It is crucially important that the defendant's decision database, which is at the core of the defendant's activities, contains a mixture of decisions that the defendant actively requests, decisions that the defendant provides with its own guiding principles, and decisions that – like the one at issue – have not been processed by the defendant. Since the defendant's activity consists precisely in maintaining the database as a whole, the area exception to be recognized must refer to the publication of all content and not only to those contributions to the database that, even when viewed in isolation, for example, due to the formulation of a guiding principle or active research after the decision, are already classified as editorial activity.

This remains unchanged even if – as the plaintiff points out – the majority of the decisions that the defendant includes in its database are imported automatically, while the decisions that the defendant processes individually or undertakes special research to obtain are available in smaller numbers. To the extent that the Federal Court of Justice (BGH) states that the opinion-forming effect may be a defining component of the offering and not merely a "decorative accessory" (BGH, judgment of June 23, 2009 – VI ZR 196/08 –, BGHZ 181, 328-345, para. 21 – spickmich.de, still on the area exception in the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), the editorial modifications carried out by the defendant here do not merely constitute "decorative accessories." Rather, they are inextricably linked to the other, automated processes within the framework of the uniformly offered database. It is therefore not the case that the defendant merely provides its offering with "decorative accessories" of such additional information, current news, or third-party opinions, which, especially in the online world, are generally possible without major effort thanks to simple programming techniques and linking options (cf. Kühling/Buchner/Buchner/Tinnefeld, 4th ed. 2024, Art. 85 GDPR para. 25, beck-online). Rather, the defendant's editorial effort is a defining component of the completion of the decision database it operates, so that neither the specific relationship between automated and "manual" activity nor whether the individual decision, in this case the specific decision at issue, was retrieved automatically or its content was edited is relevant. Even if the majority of the decisions held in the database were retrieved automatically, the importance of the defendant's editorial work for maintaining the case law database is by no means completely negated.

d) Without this being relevant, the exception for processing for scientific purposes would also likely apply. The term "scientific research" encompasses any scientific activity and thus any activity that, in terms of content and form, can be regarded as a serious, planned attempt to determine the truth (Kühling/Buchner/Buchner/Tinnefeld, 4th ed. 2024, Art. 85 GDPR para. 21, beck-online with further references).

In the present case, there is some evidence that the defendant can claim scientific purposes. This applies, for example, to the fact that legal publications frequently cite court decisions via the defendant's database (see Appendix B 12 for a literature search using the keyword "openjur" in the Beck-Online database). Furthermore, the defendant is also a partner in the "OpenRewi" initiative, an association of legal scholars dedicated to the use of freely accessible information for legal research.

2. If, for the assessment of the plaintiff's request for an injunction, the applicability of national law remains, which claims to apply instead of the provisions of the GDPR due to the area exception, the plaintiff is not entitled to an injunction in this respect either. In particular, there is no claim for an injunction under Sections 823 (1), 1004 (1) sentence 2 of the German Civil Code (BGB), Article 2 (1), and Article 1 (1) of the Basic Law (GG).

a) Admittedly, the publication of the decision with the plaintiff's real name, as a result of balancing the defendant's freedom of information and media rights, impairs the plaintiff's general personality rights because there is no overriding public interest in the plaintiff's professional and financial situation and in the fact that the Lawyers' Pension Fund has initiated enforcement measures against him. This also applies if one considers that these circumstances concern (only) the plaintiff's social sphere. This is because it concerns information that is likely to harm the plaintiff's professional advancement. There are no apparent reasons that indicate an overriding public interest in the plaintiff's person. The outcome of this balancing of interests remains unchanged even if, as the defendant argues, the decision in the administrative court's summary proceedings concerning the plaintiff was publicly announced. This is true simply because the public nature of court proceedings is different from that of the internet.

b) However, the defendant acted in the pursuit of legitimate interests and thus justifiably in publishing the decision.

The pursuit of legitimate interests in connection with a statement constitutes a justification under Section 193 of the German Criminal Code (StGB). According to the case law of the Federal Court of Justice, the justification under Section 193 of the German Criminal Code is considered as an expression of the fundamental right to freedom of expression when examining a violation of general personality rights and is recognized with regard to the function of the press in a democratic state (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of December 22, 1959 – VI ZR 175/58 –, BGHZ 31, 308-321, para. 9).

One application of the pursuit of legitimate interests is so-called privileged sources. Increased trust may be placed in statements from privileged sources (Federal Court of Justice NJW 2014, 2029 para. 30, beck-online). In addition to the fact that official bodies are bound by fundamental rights and must therefore conduct a balancing of legal interests before issuing a statement, the special treatment of privileged sources is also based on the fact that, in the interest of ensuring the broadest possible plurality, media providers should be enabled to report on topics that – measured by the available human and financial resources – lie beyond their own "research radius" (see Korte PresseR, 2nd ed. 2019, § 2, para. 241).

The decisions published by the case law database of the State of Berlin constitute such a privileged source. As long as the defendant had no concrete doubts that publishing a decision in its database in the identical form as it had already been published in the case law database of the State of Berlin would violate the rights of third parties, the defendant acted justifiably and was not subject to any obligation to conduct further research (see Korte, ibid., para. 244). Such doubts could not have arisen for the defendant until the plaintiff's request. The defendant acted immediately and removed the plaintiff's name from the decision.

II. The plaintiff is not entitled to damages with regard to the processing of personal data through the publication of the plaintiff's name.

1. A claim for damages under Art. 82 (1) GDPR is not applicable. In this respect, Art. 82 GDPR is already inapplicable because the principles of data processing regulated in Chapter II of the GDPR and the rights of the data subject regulated in Chapter III of the GDPR are not applicable to the present case due to the scope exception in Art. 85 GDPR. According to the case law of the Federal Court of Justice, it is "obvious that a claim for damages under Art. 82 (1) GDPR cannot be based on the violation of data protection provisions through journalistic activity if the provisions do not apply to the activity at all." It is also irrelevant that the opening clause in Article 85(2) GDPR does not explicitly cover the provision of Article 82(1) GDPR contained in Chapter VIII of the Regulation (Federal Court of Justice GRUR 2022, 735 para. 18, beck-online).

2. Since the publication of the name is justified under national law due to the protection of legitimate interests, a claim for monetary compensation under Section 823(1) of the German Civil Code (BGB) is also not applicable.

III. The plaintiff is also not entitled to damages with regard to the information that the plaintiff complained was provided too late.

1. However, Article 82 GDPR is applicable in this respect. This is because if a right to information exists in principle under Article 15 GDPR, a claim for damages may also exist under Article 82 GDPR in the event of a violation of this right to information. The right to information is assessed in this case, also in view of the area exception under Article 85 (2) GDPR, under Article 15 GDPR. It is not apparent that there is a provision under national law that could exclude a right to information under Article 15 GDPR because this would be necessary, as required by Article 85 (2) GDPR, to reconcile the right to protection of personal data with freedom of expression and freedom of information.

2. The plaintiff was originally entitled to a right to information under Art. 15 (1) GDPR, because by publishing the decision containing the plaintiff's name and the information concerning him, the defendant processed the plaintiff's personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 (1) GDPR.

3. In the present case, the information may also have been provided late. Pursuant to Art. 12 (3) GDPR, the controller shall provide the data subject with information on the measures taken on a request pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 without undue delay, and in any event within one month of receipt of the request; this period may be extended by a further two months if necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of requests. In this case, the plaintiff requested information on May 5, 2023. The defendant responded on the same day and provided some of the information – for example, with regard to the origin of the data, stating that the decision had been automatically imported from the official database of the State of Berlin – but otherwise referred to the general data protection information. The defendant only provided further and, in the defendant's view, complete information during the course of the legal proceedings in its statement of defense dated October 20, 2023 (Exhibit B 4 therein), thus approximately five months after the request for information.

From a legal perspective, it is controversial whether the fact that information was provided late can even give rise to a claim for damages. Some argue that Art. 82 GDPR only covers damages caused "by processing that does not comply with this Regulation" and that, therefore, violations of the obligation to provide information under Art. 12 (3) or Art. 15 GDPR cannot serve as a basis for a claim for compensation (Düsseldorf Regional Court, judgment of November 28, 2023 – 3 Sa 285/23 –, para. 31, juris; Düsseldorf Regional Court, judgment of October 28, 2021 – 16 O 128/20; dissenting opinion Cologne Higher Regional Court NJW-RR 2023, 564 para. 14, beck-online).

4. Whether the information was provided late and whether such a delay can justify a claim for damages can remain open here. This is because there is no conclusive demonstration of (non-material) damage suffered by the plaintiff precisely as a result of the delayed provision of information.

The concept of non-material damage must be defined autonomously under EU law. According to the case law of the ECJ, a mere violation of the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation is not sufficient to establish a claim for damages (see ECJ, judgment of June 20, 2024 – C-590/22 –, para. 24, juris). However, damage does not have to reach a certain degree of gravity or significance (see ECJ, judgment of June 20, 2024 – C-590/22 –, para. 26, juris). Even the loss of control over personal data – even temporary – can constitute non-material damage, without this definition of "non-material damage" requiring proof of additional, tangible negative consequences (ECJ, judgment of October 4, 2024 – C-200/23 –, paras. 145, 156 in conjunction with 137, juris). According to the case law of the Federal Court of Justice, the mere loss of control over personal data constitutes non-material damage within the meaning of Art. 82 (1) GDPR (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024, VI ZR 10/24, paras. 27-45).

The plaintiff argued that he suffered non-material damage as a result of the refusal to provide information, as he was uncertain about which and how exactly his personal data was and is being processed by the defendant. The plaintiff's resulting, even more profound loss of control over the handling of his personal data, as well as the concrete risk of reputational damage and impairment of his professional advancement, is unreasonable, noticeably unpleasant, and emotionally highly distressing for the plaintiff. After the defendant provided further information in its defense, the plaintiff argued that he had suffered specific non-material damage as a result of the months of non-disclosure, as he had always been uncertain about which and how his personal data was and was being processed by the defendant. The plaintiff's resulting loss of control over the handling of his personal data, as well as the concrete risk of reputational damage and impairment of his professional advancement, is unreasonable, extremely unpleasant, and emotionally highly distressing for the plaintiff.

It is not clear from the statement to what extent the plaintiff suffered non-material damage solely due to the fact that the information was provided late. This is all the more true given that a crucial part of the information – namely, the origin of the data – was already answered on the day of the request for information, and the plaintiff was informed by email dated May 5, 2024, that the decision had been imported in this form from the official decision database of the State of Berlin. The plaintiff was also able to identify which personal data the defendant had published and to whom it was addressing with this publication, namely the entire internet public. Therefore, the mere delay in providing complete information does not constitute a greater loss of control than that which had already occurred due to the insufficiently anonymized publication of the decision.

The case is also significantly different from the decision of the Cologne Higher Regional Court cited by the plaintiff, in which compensation of €500 was awarded for the delayed provision of information. In that case, the plaintiff demanded that a lawyer hand over the files relating to her case. The plaintiff in that case had been left in the dark by the lawyer regarding the future fate of the case for a considerable period of time and was unable for months to access the case file, obtain knowledge of the content of the data stored there, and advance the proceedings concerning her with the new attorney (Higher Regional Court of Cologne, judgment of July 14, 2022 – I-15 U 137/21 –, para. 26, juris).

IV. There is also no claim for reimbursement of pre-trial legal costs under Section 823 (1) of the German Civil Code (BGB). To the extent that the plaintiff, through his attorney, requested the defendant to cease and desist, to provide information, and to pay damages in a letter dated May 5, 2023, there are no claims for injunctive relief or damages, so that there can be no claim for reimbursement of legal costs in this respect either. With regard to the request for information, at the time the lawyer became involved, there was no delay on the part of the defendant in providing the information due to the lack of a prior request, which is necessary for reimbursement – even in the absence of a contractual relationship between the parties.

V. The decision on costs is based on Sections 91, 91a, and 92 (2) No. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO). To the extent that a claim for information originally existed with regard to the application for costs, which was unanimously declared settled, the costs incurred would in principle be borne by the defendant, since the claim for information was only fulfilled and extinguished pursuant to Section 362 of the German Civil Code (BGB) when the defendant responded to the plaintiff's request for information by submitting Exhibit B4 with the statement of defense. However, according to the legal principle of Section 92 (2) No. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the value of the information is not significant compared to the remaining value of the claim, which relates to injunctive relief and damages.

The decision on provisional enforceability is based on Section 709 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO).

The determination of the value in dispute is based on Sections 3 and 48 (2) of the Civil Code (GKG). Following the plaintiff's out-of-court valuation in the letter dated May 5, 2023, the Chamber set the value of the injunction claim at €25,000, the value of the damages claim at €5,500, and the value of the information claim at €500.
