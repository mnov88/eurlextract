<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>After ceasing her notary activity, the applicant engaged in a liquidation dispute with her former business partner and their accounting office. 
</p><p>This dispute arose as the accounting office (1) failed to fulfill several ethical obligations and (2) transferred files containing personal data about the applicant to the former partner (without the applicant’s consent).
</p><p>The Litigation Chamber of the Data Protection Authority declared the applicant’s complaint admissible, but dismissed it for the following opportunity reasons:
</p>
<ul><li>the complaint did not contain any grievances that a have a “broad social impact”;</li>
<li>another complaint was pending with the competent authority with regard to the ethical and professional mistakes&#160;;</li>
<li>taking into account the resources available, the DPA should make choices regarding the type of files it will follow up on grants.</li></ul>
<p>The applicant subsequently appealed to the Market Court of the Brussels Court of Appeal against the aforementioned dismissal decision of the DPA.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Should Article 57.1, f) GDPR be read as such that supervisory authorities may not dismiss complaints but should instead review the full substance of the allegations in each complaint? 
</p><p>In other words, does the data subjects' right to lodge a complaint under Article 77 GDPR equals the right to claim a full substantive investigation and a full substantive assessment by the supervisory authority?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>Article 57 GDPR provides that the supervisory authority must "examine the content of the complaint" only "to the extent that is appropriate". There is therefore no absolute obligation but a discretionary power for the supervisory authority to make a full substantive investigation and a full substantive assessment of the complaint. 
</p><p>If the supervisory authority considers that a treatment of the case on substantive merits is not appropriate (due to policy considerations, for example), it is authorized to dismiss the complaint. The option to dismiss is indeed one of the consequences that can be given to a complaint in accordance with Article 95 §1, 3° WOG.
</p><p>But when the supervisory authority decides to dismiss a complaint, it must <b>motivate this decision formally and substantively</b>. A decision based on incorrect or legally unacceptable motives reveals an overstep of power and is therefore voidable.
</p><p>In this case, the Market Court of the Brussels Court of Appeal considered that the decision of the Litigation Chamber of the DPA was not properly motivated as it didn't explain why there was no "broad social impact", neither how and to what extent the deontological complaint lodged with the competent authority had the same object as the complaint to the DPA. The motive establishing that there are insufficient financial resources at the disposal of the DPA was not judged conclusive neither as it was not supported by any data. Morover, <i>"[the DPA] is at the service of the citizen and must ensure that it spends its resources properly"; "the citizens should not and should not be the victims".</i> 
</p><p>The Market Court therefore ordered the DPA to issue a new decision regarding the complaint within a reasonable period.

X gives the following account of the facts:


       A. Departments

        1.      Until 8 December 2017, the applicant was a notary public with his registered office in [...], jn
       association with civil-law notary W. The association took the form of a partnership. The applicant
       exercised her notarial activity in the partnership through her company X BVBA,

       currently established in [...].


       2.      The applicant has had to cease her activities as a notary for health reasons.

       As a result, the applicant and Mr W have been involved in a dispute for some years.
       a dispute. The dispute concerns, inter alia, harassment and verbal aggression by Mr W
       and the liquidation of the partnership under which the association was exercised. This

       partnership still exists today for the purpose of its liquidation.

        3.     The accountancy firm of X BVBA was Z BVBA, [...], of which Mrs. V is one of the
       directors (piece 8). Z is also the accounting firm of the partnership between the applicant and

       Mr Wen is in that capacity very well informed about the dispute.

              L _JJCourt of Appeal Brussels -2020/AR/329 -p. 5





       4.     Due to the non-compliance of several deontological obligations by Z BVBA
       X BVBA decided in May 2019 to change its accounting firm and from now on to rely on the accounting firm U BVBA, [...].
       U BVBA, [...].


       B.nbreaches of the AVG by Z BVBA


       5.     In the context of this transfer of files to the accounting firm U BVBA, Z BVBA sent an e-mail to the applicant, Ms U1 and Mr U2 on 15 July 2019.
       On 15 July 2019, Z BVBA sent an e-mail to the applicant, Ms U1 and Mr U2
       of the accounting firm U BVBA, and to the applicant's counsel Mr. U3 enclosing

       32 attachments {document 1, attachment 3). Although Z BVBA is very well aware of the dispute
       between the applicant and Mr W, Z BVBA sent a copy{c} of that email with all the attachments.
       copy{cc) to Mr W.


       6.     Some of those annexes contained personal data concerning the applicant, such as her
       income, information about her pension plan, etc. Moreover, since the applicant
       formerly as a notary and now as a legal adviser, carries on her entire activity through her company
       company X BVBA and is the sole shareholder in that company, those annexes give

       provide comprehensive insight into the applicant's affairs.

       the applicant's request or consent. Z BVBA purposely sent that email to him

       because that email was not a response to an existing email in which he was already in

       W, with whom the applicant has been involved in a dispute for several years, Z
       BVBA committed blatant infringements of Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament

       C. Complaint biide GBA on 26 November 2019 for breaches of the AVG

       9.     By e-mail of 26 November 2019, the applicant complained to the GBA about the aforementioned blatant
       violations of the AVG to the GBA {document 1). In view of the fact that

       As enquiries made by telephone to the GBA showed that the GBA had not received the email of 26 November 2019, the applicant submitted the complaint by way of an email to the GBA.

       Following further communication regarding the receipt of the complaint (documents 4 and 5), the
       First Line Service of the GBA declared the complaint admissible.

       D. Dismissal of the complaint by the Dispute Resolution Chamber of the GBA on 29 ianuary 2020

       10. However, on 29 January 2020, the Dispute Resolution Chamber of the GBA decided to dismiss the complaint
       (reference DOS-2019-06201} (Exhibit 6). That decision, which is contested by the applicant in these
       This decision, which the applicant is appealing in these proceedings, was based on two grounds:


       [..].

       E. Complaint lodged with the Institute of Accountants and Tax Consultants on 22 February 2020
          for violations of the ethics of accountants

       11. In the context of the dispute between the applicant and Mr W (not only the

       email of 15 July 2019 but much more broadly) Z BVBA was also guilty of
       violations of several deontological rules of accountants, such as the duty to be
       practice of the profession with integrity, honesty and dignity, the duty of
       independence, duty of discretion and professional secrecy, etc. On 22 February 2020

       the applicant filed a complaint in that regard with the Institute of Accountants and
       Tax Consultants (document 7)."


The GBA summarises as follows:


       1.     The applicant, Ms X, is a 100% shareholder in a personal private limited company and, with this company, is a 50% partner in the Partnership W-X, an associated company.
       with this company 50% of the partners in the partnership W-X, associate
       notaries (hereinafter 'the Partnership'). The latter Partnership has since been dissolved

       (but not yet liquidated) because Ms X and her former business partner (Mr W) no longer
       no longer work together.


       2.      By e-mail dated 26 November 2019, Ms X filed a complaint with the
       Data Protection Authority (the defendant) against the accountancy firm Z bvba {India
       1).


       This complaint was filed for two reasons:

              Z bvba refused to disclose its personal data.

              information data. Mrs V of Z bvba allegedly refused Ms X in particular access to accounting documents of the
              to give access to accounting documents of the Partnership because, according to Ms V, the former business partner of Ms X
              the Partnership because, according to Ms V, the former business partner of Ms X
              (Mr W) must give his consent.

              Z bvba is alleged to have been guilty of the unauthorised distribution of 'particularly extensive and very detailed
              very extensive and very detailed' personal information to third parties.

              In particular, V of Zbvba would have sent information about (the limited liability company of) Mrs X to both

              business partner (Mr W), while the latter should not have received this information.
              receive this information.


       In the explanation of the complaint, Ms X also mentioned the following
       (SAMPLE 1, p. 1):

              "It is hereby explained that the deontological and professional errors that were

              committed by Mrs. V are the subject of another complaint which will be filed with the competent
              competent authority on the matter. Consequently, the following complaint
              relates exclusively to the violation of my privacy,


       3.     On 7 January 2020, the First-line Service of the Data Protection Authority
       (ELD) determined that the complaint was admissible (per se), and the complaint was transferred to the

       Dispute Resolution Chamber (STUK2).

       4.     At the meeting of the Dispute Resolution Chamber on 28 January 2020, the

       Dispute Resolution Chamber then decided to dismiss the complaint, due to the following
       (opportunity) reasons (PV no 2 of 28/01/2020 concerning file 005-2019-06201)
       (STUK3}:

              First Line Service has been declared admissible. On the basis of the information currently available to the

2019 and is also mentioned on the website of the GBA.



    6. The assessment: the right to lodge a complaint - Article 77 AVG (first plea of X).


In its first ground of appeal, X seeks the annulment of the decision on the ground that it disregards

of its right of complaint. She submits that Article 77 AVG 2, interpreted in the light of Articles 1, 51(1) and
57 AVG, recitals 7, 10 and 141 AVG, Article 8 Charter and Article 16 TFEU, is infringed by the right of the defence which it establishes to the right of the defence to be heard.
by unlawfully restricting the right of a data subject to lodge a complaint, as provided for therein, to complaints which 'do not relate to the protection of personal data'.
erroneously limit the right of a data subject to lodge a complaint to complaints having 'a wide-ranging impact in society' and that limitation is contrary to
is contrary to the interpretation which must be given to Article 77 TFEU.


In conclusion, the GBA does not put forward any defence to this plea.

It is apparent from the file documents submitted, and in particular from document 2 in the file of the GBA, that the
GBA declared X's complaint admissible. On 7 January, the First-line Service (ELD) sent

2020, the file was sent to the Dispute Resolution Chamber with the following explicit reference: "ELD examined the admissibility of the
admissibility of the complaint in the file mentioned above; ELD finds that the complaint is admissible;
consequently, this file is transferred to you for further action".

personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing
Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter "AVG").

             L _JCourt of Appeal Brussels-2020/AR/329- p. 12




X confuses the admissibility of a complaint with the assessment of its merits.

X's right to lodge a complaint was not called into question by the contested decision, let alone infringed by any other decision of the GBA.
X's right to lodge a complaint was not called into question by the contested decision, let alone infringed by any other decision of the GBA.


To the extent that X then draws a grievance from 'Article 77AVG, interpreted in the light of Articles
1, 51.1 and 57AVG, recitals 7, 10 and 141AVG, Article 8 of the Charter and Article 16 TFEU,' the plea in law is without
plea in law.




    7. The assessment: the right to complain - Article 47 HGEU (second plea in law, put forward by X)


     In its second plea, X:


           a. As recital 1 AVG states, the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right.
              processing of personal data is a fundamental right. as guaranteed by Article 8,
              paragraph 1 of the Charter. Article 47 Charter provides that judicial remedies available in the

              respect of the rights guaranteed in the Charter shall be 'effective'.
              guaranteed in the Charter must be 'effective'. They must therefore be capable of
              be effective.


           b. One such judicial remedy created by the legislator is
              the right to lodge a complaint with the GBA, as provided for in a77iAVG and
              Article 58 GBA Act. In view of Article 47 of the Charter, this complaint must be effective

              be able to be exercised effectively, it must be able to achieve its goal. The legal doctrine also states that
               "the obligation under the AVG includes the examination of the facts, the assessment
              the merits of the case and deciding whether to comply or not,

              ultimately, enforcement activities and/or sanctions if non-compliance is
              established. (...) The national procedural rules for supervisory authorities
              should be suitable for carrying out all these tasks in a way which guarantees an effective remedy for data subjects.

these tasks in a way which guarantees an effective remedy to data subjects;<i>(W. KOTCHY,</i>

This plea -lacks factual basis to the extent that - as stated above - the complaint submitted
declared admissible by the ELD of the GBA (and also by the Dispute Resolution Chamber). The plea
fails in law in so far as it seeks to apply Article 47 HGEU in respect of the decisions of the
the Dispute Resolution Chamber of the CBA in so far as that article relates to the effective remedy of a dispute.

which can be brought before a court of law. The Dispute Resolution Chamber of the GBA is not an administrative
judge but only a (non-autonomous) body of an administrative authority. Although it is of course
recommended that all those who judge the legal subjects - even if they are an organ of an administrative authority - comply with the rules of legal protection and of
administrative authority - would spontaneously comply with the rules of legal protection and respect for fundamental rights, the
fundamental rights, this legal protection by the subject of the law is only legally enforceable by a judge.
legally enforceable only before a judge (who is a member of the judiciary) who is

is the only one who judges independently and impartially on the rights sensu fata of the
legal subjects). The legal possibility to appeal/recover to the Market Court
The legal possibility to lodge an appeal/recourse before the Market Court is intended to provide the litigant with the guarantee of Article 6.1 of the ECHR and more specifically of the remedy provided for in
and more specifically of the remedy provided for in Article 47 HGEU. A judge of the judicial order must be the
last see to it that, when imposing sanctions (sensu fata) by (bodies of) administrative

authorities, the protection of the citizen/lawyer guaranteed by supranational legislation is not violated.
citizen/petitioner is not infringed. This judge (in this case the Market Court) must
be able to rule on the decision of the administrative authority with full jurisdiction
and must be able, not only to reverse the decision by annulling it, but also to
but must also have the power to amend the substance of the decision by
taking its own decision and substituting it for the decision of the

administrative authority.


    8. T he assessment: violation of Article 57.4 AVG (third plea in law from X).

X submits that the decision violates Article 57.4 of the AVG where this provision is concerned:


       "Where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular due to their
       repetitive nature, the supervisory authority may charge a reasonable fee based on the administrative costs or refuse to comply with the request.
       charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to comply with the request.
       It is for the supervisory authority to prove the manifestly unfounded or excessive nature of the request.
       of the request.


The plea lacks factual basis. The ELD of the GBA 'acted' on the complaint because
it declared the complaint admissible and forwarded it to the Dispute Chamber for further action (see above).
Dispute Chamber (see above).


The dismissal decision is a consequence that can only be given to an admissible complaint.

The decision to dismiss is separate from Article 57.4 of the AVG. The possibility of dismissing a complaint is one of the
consequences that can be given to a complaint pursuant to Article 95 and 100 § 1, 1) WOG.




4 As far as the Dispute Resolution Chamber is concerned, at least implicitly so, because one of the consequences reserved for a complaint by article 95
95 WOG reserves for a complaint was applied by the Disputes Chamber, namely a dismissal.
a dismissal.

             L _JJustice of Appeal Brussels -2020/AR/329-p. 14




X does, however, rightly assert that the fact that it is up to the Disputes Chamber of the GBA
to prove the manifestly unfounded or excessive nature of the request implies that also

the decision to close the case must be substantiated (see below, point 9).


    9. The assessment: infringement of the duty to state reasons by the fact that the decision is not well-founded

           (fourth plea in law ofX).

9.1.

Yet by invoking such unlawful motives, it is invoking improper motives."

9.2.
The contested decision is based on the following considerations:


        "Mrs. X files a complaint against ZBVBA.
       The Complainant is a 100&#160;% shareholder in a personal private limited company and with this company he is a 50&#160;% partner in the partnership W-X, associated notaries.
       50&#160;% partner in the partnership W-X, associated notaries (hereinafter 'the Partnership').
        Partnership'). The latter Partnership has since been dissolved (but has not yet been liquidated).

       because the Plaintiff and her former business partner (Mr W) no longer work together.

       The complainant filed a complaint against the accountancy firm Z BVBA for two reasons:


               1. "Refusal to provide access to "personal information data". Mrs V of Z BVBA allegedly refused her access to her personal data.
               V of Z BVBA would have refused her access to
               documents concerning the Partnership's accounts because, according to her, the complainant's former business partner
               According to her, the former business partner of the complainant (Mr W) had to give his consent.
               must give his consent.


               2. 'Unauthorised disclosure of particularly voluminous and detailed personal data to third parties'.
               2. 'Unauthorised dissemination of very extensive and very detailed personal data to third parties'. Mrs. V of Z BVBA sent in an email
               information about the (BVBA of the) complainant to both the complainant and her former business partner, while the latter did not have this information.
               while the latter did not have this information.

               should have received this information.

       Pursuant to art. 95, §1, 3 of the Act of 3 December 2017 establishing the
       Data Protection Authority, the Litigation Chamber decides to dismiss the present complaint.
       dismissed. Based on the information available to the Litigation Chamber at this time,

       it does not consider it appropriate at this stage (1) to pursue the matter further,
       as the complaint does not contain any grievances that have a wide social impact.
       In addition, the complainant states that with regard to "the deontological and professional errors committed by
       V" a complaint is pending with "the competent authority" and the Dispute
       authority" and the Litigation Chamber wishes to avoid a possible double investigation.
