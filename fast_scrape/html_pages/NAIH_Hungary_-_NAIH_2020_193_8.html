<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="English_Summary">English Summary</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The complainant filed a complaint with the Hungarian DPA against his former employer for registering a property as his temporary residential address despite that facts having ceased to be true in June 1999. The complainant claims to have asked his former employer by email to delete this data several times since 1999. The complainant further objected to the processing of his personal data without his consent. 
</p><p>The employer stated that according Section 6(4) Act I of 2012 on the Labor Code the complainant had a duty to inform the employer of any changes in personal information, including change in address. The employer claimed that the complainant had failed to do so until he filed the complaint before the Hungarian DPA. Any requests by email to delete the information mentioned by the complainant are inaccessible as they are deleted after 90 days. 
</p><p>The employer also stated that the complainant forwarded, on the employer’s Internet interface, his name, tax identification number, mother's name, place and date of birth and permanent residence in 2018 because of a change in the taxation rules. Therefore, the employer argued that this data transfer was on the legal basis of consent. However, the statement of consent was never signed by the complainant as the employment relationship terminated soon after. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute">Dispute</span></h3>
<p>Did the complainant’s former employer breach various articles of the GDPR by failing to delete the complainant’s out-of-date address upon request and by processing personal data without the complainant’s consent?
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>With regards to the registered address, the Hungarian DPA stated that it only had the power to examine the complainant’s alleged series of emails sent after May 2018 as the GDPR was not in force prior to that date. Only the email sent by the applicant in September 2018 was addressed by the Hungarian DPA. In relation to that email, the Hungarian DPA held that the out-of-date address should have been deleted by the employer upon request pursuant to Article 16, Article 17 and Article 5(1)(d) GDPR (inaccuracy of personal data). Therefore, the employer was in breach of those articles by failing to do so.
</p><p>Additionally, the Hungarian DPA held that the employer did not take action within the deadline when the complainant requested for his personal data to be deleted. Therefore, the employer was also in breach of Article 12(1) to Article 12(4) GDPR. 
</p><p>With regard to the personal data transferred in relation to the taxation rule change, the Hungarian DPA held that this data could not be processed on the basis of legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) as claimed by the employer. This was in part because the legitimate interest of facilitating administration work for the employee (the complainant in this context) could not be considered the legitimate interest of the data controller (the employer in this context). 
</p><p>In addition, the Hungarian DPA established that as a general rule, voluntary consent cannot be considered valid in the context of an employment relationship. This is the case unless the processing of personal data on the basis of consent would benefit the employee with no possible detriment. Therefore, the personal data transferred in the context of the taxation rule change could be based on consent as a legal basis as it the processing could not detriment the complainant. However, the Hungarian DPA held that the employer transferred the complainant’s personal data without a legal basis as the personal data was processed without the consent of the complainant. Therefore, the employer was in breach of Article 6(1) GDPR.
</p><p>Finally, the Hungarian DPA held that the employer did not provide adequate information to the complainant in relation to the processing of his personal data in relation to the taxation rule change. Therefore, the employer was in breach of its obligation to provide information to the data subject pursuant to Article 13 GDPR.  
</p><p>Therefore, the Hungarian DPA issued the employer a fine of 600,000 HUF (1,728 EUR) to be paid within 30 days.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

I. Procedure and clarification of the facts

I. 1. By letter received on 18 November 2019, the Applicant applied to the Authority, alleging, on the one hand, that his former employer, the Applicant, was registering the property [...] as a temporary residential address despite the fact that the 1999 ceased in June.

According to its statement, the Applicant indicated to the Applicant on several occasions that his temporary residential address had expired, therefore, in his opinion, the Applicant would have had the opportunity to delete this data several times. According to the Applicant's Statement, he first indicated the change in the summer of 1999, when his temporary residential address actually ceased to exist. Subsequently, at the Applicant's June 2007. In connection with this, there was a change in the legal relationship of the Applicant, so in the opinion of the Applicant, the Applicant should have canceled the terminated temporary residential address even then. Furthermore, according to the Applicant's statement, from March 2014, during the agreement on the use of the car authorized for him and its annual renewals, the Applicant was aware of the termination of the Applicant's temporary home address, so he should have deleted this data. and on the 28th, by e-mail concerning the inspection of gas meters, he also informed the Applicant's staff member [...] that his previous temporary home address had expired.

In an e-mail sent to the CEO of the Applicant on 25 September 2018, the Applicant also indicated, in addition to his other non-data protection complaints, that
According to this letter, he referred to his e-mail of 27 and 28 September 2016 to the Applicant regarding the inspection of gas meters, according to which he said that he had moved out of the property under number [...] in June 1999, which fact was also reported to the Applicant's Personnel Department.

In the Applicant's application, he objected, inter alia, to the transfer of his personal data to the [...] without his consent.

The Applicant asked the Authority to establish that the Applicant had committed an infringement in connection with the registration of his / her personal data and to instruct the Applicant to keep a record of the Applicant's personal data. The Applicant further requested that the Authority establish that the Applicant had committed an infringement in connection with the transfer of his personal data to [...] without his consent.

I. 2. In its order, the Authority notified the Applicant of the initiation of the data protection authority procedure and invited it to make a statement and provide information in order to clarify the facts.

According to the Applicant's statement, Section 6 (4) of Act I of 2012 on the Labor Code (hereinafter: Mt.) stipulates as a general rule of conduct that the parties in the employment relationship are obliged to inform each other of any facts, data, circumstances or changes thereto. to inform, which is essential for the establishment of the employment relationship and for the exercise of the rights and fulfillment of the obligations specified in the Mt. According to the Applicant, it is therefore the Applicant's responsibility to notify the Applicant of any data changes. However, according to the Applicant's employment records, the Applicant did not announce the termination of his temporary home address to the Applicant as an employer, therefore no evacuation was transferred, his temporary home address was not deleted. However, in the light of the Applicant's submissions, after the Authority's request, the Applicant took action to delete the Applicant's temporary residential address from the labor registers2020. on January 17.

In connection with the Applicant's e-mails sent on September 27, 2016 and September 25, 2018, the Applicant stated that the log file of his mail system will be automatically deleted after 90 days, therefore he cannot retrieve the e-mails referenced by the Applicant. The e-mails in question could be contacted by the Applicant if the Applicants specify the recipients, however, if these recipients have already left the Applicant, their mailbox will be deleted. No document is available to the Applicant in this regard.

According to the Applicant's statement, the Applicant forwarded his name, tax identification number, mother's name, place and date of birth and permanent residence to [...] via its Internet interface on 12 October 2018.

According to the statement of the Applicant, the reason for the data transfer was that in 2018 the tax rules on fringe benefits changed, as a result of which the taxation of all cafeterias other than the Széchenyi Pihenő Card (hereinafter: SZÉP Card) increased. As a result, it was expected that employees who did not have a SZÉP Card before would benefit from this benefit in the future. The rules for applying for the SZÉP Card also changed in the current semester. The previous 55/2011 on the rules of issuing and using the Széchenyi Pihenő Card. (IV. 12.) of the Government, it was the employer's task to order the SZÉP Cards, however, the new 76/2018 on the rules of issuing and using the Széchenyi Resting Card. (IV. 20.) of the Government, the employee already had to contract directly with the fund provider. However, at the time of the data transfer, there were a number of uncertainties surrounding this process, the previous systems were still in place, but the final procedures on the cashier's side had not yet been established. Until January 4, they will be able to register new employees on the Portal in the usual way and order the card for them. We can only send a contract offer to those employees who have been registered and given an e-mail address by 28 December 2018. ”From the referenced and similar previous information, it follows from the Applicant that in order to ensure a smooth transition, SZÉP You need help with the card application process.

According to the Applicant's statement, the purpose of the data management was for the Applicant to initiate the application process for employees who did not have a SZÉP Card before. In practice, this meant that the personal data requested by the fund service provider was uploaded by the fund service provider via its own account and generated an application form, which was handed over to the employees. following an application process for this purpose.

According to the Applicant's statement, during the relevant period, the Applicant's expectation was that its employees without a SZÉP Card would opt for this benefit in the future. The legislation on applying for the SZÉP Card changed at that time, and there was a lot of uncertainty on the part of the fund service provider about the transition to the new rules and technical administration. If the Applicant had not provided any assistance to the employees, the employees would not have been able to apply for the SZÉP Card on time or at the cost of disproportionate efforts. It arose from the Applicant's legitimate interest to provide this fringe benefit smoothly to its employees as of January 1, 2019, and from the employees to facilitate the administration on their side. In view of this, the Applicant has decided to proceed as described above.

According to the Applicant's statement, the process was carried out by the Applicant's Human Customer Service, which has direct and daily contact with employees. There was also a central communication to the employees about the changes related to the SZÉP Card and the fringe benefits. In addition, employees were entitled to ask questions, make complaints or protest against their involvement in the process at any time, as usual with the Applicant, about the process and the process.

According to the Applicant's statement, the data subject's rights to employees are contained in the Applicant's general employee information, which also applies to this data management.

Despite claiming a legitimate interest in the smooth provision of fringe benefits, the Applicant stated that after the application form was generated, the claimants received and signed the claim form and the data management consent statement, which also provided them with direct information about claiming the SZÉP Card. On this basis, the Requested Party also based the data transfer on the legal basis of the consent.

According to the Applicant's statement, the transfer of the Applicant's personal data took place on 12 October 2018. The Applicant requested the signature of the Applicant on the [...] SZÉPKardi main card application form and the data management consent statement printed from the [...] interface available on the Internet, however, the declaration was not signed, given that the Applicant's employment relationship with the Applicant was 19 December 2018. terminated on.

According to the Applicant's statement, the procedure objected to by the Applicant was a one-off measure during the implementation period due to legal changes, after which all employees must now apply for the SZÉP Card independently through the channels established and operating since then.

In addition, in the Applicant's opinion, the data processing did not have a significant impact on the data subjects, including the Applicant, as it was a one-off step (generation of the application form) and only took place on the Applicant's treated further. The data processing was also carried out in the interest of the data subjects, the contracting process had to be completed by the data subjects, the data transfer to a financial institution with a reputation in the market and, apart from the present case, no complaint was received in relation to the Applicant.

According to the Applicant's statement, according to its records, which do not contain data prior to 2012, the Applicant received a cafeteria benefit from 1 January 2012 to 18 December 2018.

According to the Applicant's statement, the Applicant's permanent address, which the Applicant registers for all employees, was also indicated during the preparation of the SZÉP Card application form and in the agreement on the reimbursement of travel expenses by the Applicant.

III. Decision

III. 1. Register of the Applicant's temporary residential address

It follows from the principle of accuracy of data under Article 5 (1) (d) of the General Data Protection Regulation that personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The controller shall take all reasonable steps to delete or rectify personal data which are inaccurate for the purposes of the processing without delay.

The General Data Protection Regulation regulates the right of rectification as well as the right of erasure within the framework of the rights of the data subject. Accordingly, under Article 16 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data subject has the right to have inaccurate personal data concerning him or her rectified without undue delay upon request, while Article 17 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation specifies in which case the data controller is obliged to delete the personal data of the data subject, including when the personal data are no longer needed for the purpose for which they were collected or otherwise processed

The obligations of the controller in relation to the rectification and erasure of personal data are set out in Article 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

The General Data Protection Regulation23. Article 17 (1) also defines the cases in which the right to rectification or erasure of personal data may be restricted, and Article 17 (3) of the General Data Protection Regulation specifically specifies the cases in which the rules on erasure of personal data do not apply.

In the present case, the Applicant indicated in his application several dates, including before 25 May 2018, when he informed the Applicant that his temporary residential address had ceased. These parts of the request concern data subjects' requests which were made before 25 May 2018, before the date of application of the General Data Protection Regulation, and therefore the rules of the General Data Protection Regulation do not apply to these requests. These parts of the application do not comply with Infotv. 60. § (2), as the General Data Protection Regulation was not yet applicable during the period of the aggrieved data subject's legal proceedings, so no application for the Authority's data protection authority procedure can be submitted in respect of them. the Authority does not have the power to examine compliance under this data protection authority procedure.

With regard to the Applicant's letter submitted after 25 May 2018, the date of application of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Authority's position is as follows:

In an e-mail sent to the Applicant's CEO on 25 September 2018, the Applicant indicated, inter alia, that his previous temporary home address had expired, referring back to his letter of 27 September 2016, in which he also indicated this. The Applicant also sent this letter to the Authority. In contrast, the Applicant stated that, based on his employment records, the Applicant had not announced the termination of his temporary home address to the Applicant as an employer, therefore the change had not been transferred or the temporary home address had not been canceled.

On the basis of all the above, and based on the content of the e-mail available to the Authority, the Applicant's e-mail sent to the Applicant's CEO on 25 September 2018, although covering other non-data protection issues, should have deleted or rectified this personal data of the Applicant, given that there were no circumstances under which the right of the Applicant to delete or rectify the personal data could have been restricted or the rules applicable to them could not have been applied. Consequently, the Authority finds that the Applicant did not delete the Applicant's temporary home address or correct this personal data registered about him, contrary to the rules of the General Data Protection Regulation, in violation of the General Data Protection Regulation16. Article 17. Article 5 (1) (d) of the General Data Protection Regulation on the processing of inaccurate personal data.

III. 2. Measures taken on the basis of the Applicant's request to cancel the temporary residence address

Article 12 (1) to (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation sets out the obligations of data controllers and the measures that data controllers must take in connection with the receipt and execution of requests from data subjects.

The Authority examined the measures taken by the Applicant in relation to Article 12 (1) to (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation in the context of his request for the cancellation of his temporary home address in an e-mail sent to the Applicant's CEO on 25 September 2018. In this letter, the Applicant indicated, inter alia, to the Applicant that his previous temporary residential address had expired. However, the Applicant did not provide any information in this letter.

In view of the above, the Authority notes that since the Applicant did not provide any information within the deadline, the Applicant2018. in breach of Article 12 (1) to (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation on the action taken on his request for erasure of his personal data sent on 25 September

The Authority draws the Applicant's attention to the fact that it must establish appropriate internal processes to ensure the exercise of the data subject's rights, and the Applicant's head as data controller must know not as an individual data controller.

III.3. Recording of the Applicant's real personal data

In his request, the Applicant requested the Authority to instruct the Applicant to keep a true personal data of the Applicant.

According to the Applicant's statement, after becoming aware of the Authority's data protection authority procedure, it took measures to delete the Applicant's temporary home address from the labor records on 17 January 2020, which was confirmed by sending the Requested Minutes.

Consequently, no action is required in this respect of the Applicant's application, therefore the Authority Pursuant to Section 47 (1) (c), the proceedings were terminated as the proceedings had become devoid of purpose in that regard.

III. 4. Transmission of the Applicant's personal data

1. According to the Applicant's declaration, the Applicant forwarded his name, tax identification number, mother's name, place and date of birth and permanent residence to [...] via its Internet interface on 12 October 2018 in order to: in view of the changes in the legislation concerning the application for the SZÉP CARD, to facilitate and start the application for the employees and the Applicant SZÉP Card.

76/2018 on the rules of issuing and using the Széchenyi Rest Card. (IV. 20.) from 1 January 2019, in order to order SZÉP Cards, the employee must enter into a contract directly with the cash register service provider, as opposed to the period before that, when the employer was responsible for ordering SZÉP Cards.

2.The Applicant indicated the legal basis of the data transfer as the legal basis of the legitimate interest, in the context of which he claimed that he had a legitimate interest in providing this fringe benefit to his employees smoothly from 1 January 2019, and from the employees, to make the administration easier on their side.

However, in the Authority's view, data processing can be based on a legal basis of a legitimate interest if the data processing is necessary to safeguard the interests of the controller or a third party and not of the data subject. It follows from the concept of a third party within the meaning of Article 4 (10) of the General Data Protection Regulation that the data subject does not constitute a third party and that this plea cannot therefore be relied on.

Consequently, this legal basis is not applicable in the case of the Applicant - and thus the other employees of the Applicant - as concerned. In addition, the circumstance classified by the Applicant as a legitimate interest to facilitate administration on the part of employees cannot be considered as a legitimate interest of data controllers in the opinion of the Authority, it also appears as the interest of employees as data subjects.

In the opinion of the Authority, the legal basis for the data management or data transfer related to the application of the Applicant SZÉP Card could be the data subject or, in the case of the Applicant, the consent of the Applicant.

The Applicant, although referring to its legitimate interest in ensuring the fringe benefit smoothly, also stated that after the application form was generated, the claimant employees received and signed the claim form and the data management consent statement, which also provided them with direct information about claiming the SZÉP Card. On this basis, the Requested Party also based the data transfer on the legal basis of the consent, but not properly.

Consent, as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation, must be based on appropriate information, be voluntary and be a specific, clear statement of intent indicating, by means of a statement or unambiguous statement of consent, that he or she consents to the processing of personal data concerning him or her. all of this must apply to the data subject or the Applicant in the present case and can only consent to the processing of the personal data of the data subject - the Applicant - instead of the Applicant, as in this case it is no longer possible to speak of data subject consent.

With regard to the voluntary nature of the consent, it can be stated that according to the established data protection practice, in the employment relationship, the consent cannot be interpreted due to the subordinate relationship between the volunteer and the employee, as in many cases the employee refuses his / her consent. The data subject's consent as a legal basis can therefore only be invoked exceptionally in the case of data processing at work, essentially when it is clear that the employee derives unconditional "benefits" from the data processing and cannot be disadvantaged in any way. Consequently, the legal basis for present data management or data transfer could have been the consent of the Applicant, as the Applicant as such could have decided whether or not to receive the benefit. If the Applicant had consented to the processing of his personal data for such purposes, he would not have received the benefit for his transfer, but he would not have been disadvantaged in connection with his legal relationship.

Consequently, in the Authority's view, the Applicant could have transferred his personal data to [...] before 1 January 2019, with the consent of the Applicant, regardless of whether the claimant was ultimately to be processed by the Applicant as an employer. After 1 January 2019, when [...] already concludes the relevant contract directly with the employee concerned, the Applicant no longer has such a role, as the data processing legal relationship is established between the data subject and [...].

On this basis, the Authority finds that the Applicant transmitted the Applicant's personal data to [...] on 12 October 2018 on an incorrect legal basis, in breach of Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

3. In connection with the information on the transfer of the Applicant's personal data, it can be stated that the data management information sent by the Applicant - as stated by the Applicant - is a general employee information, but it does not appear separately as an However, in the case of several data management purposes, the data subjects must be informed separately about each data management purpose and each data management.

The Applicant also referred to internal correspondence, on the basis of which he informed the employees and the Applicant about the application for the SZÉP Card and its changes.

These prospectuses did indeed provide information on the changed procedure for claiming the benefit, but cannot be considered as data management information under Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation, as they do not provide any of the information specified therein.

On this basis, the Authority finds that the Applicant did not provide adequate information on the data processing to the Applicant, in breach of Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

III. 5. Sanctioning
1. The Authority accepts the Applicant's request in part and condemns the Applicant pursuant to Article 58 (2) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation, as Annex III to this Decision.

However, in view of the fact that Annex III to this Decision Pursuant to Clause 3, the Applicant took measures to delete the Applicant's temporary home address from the employment registers after becoming aware of the Authority's data protection authority procedure, no action is required in this respect of the Applicant's application, therefore the Authority did not instruct the Applicant to comply with the Applicant's right. but the Acre. Pursuant to Section 47 (1) (c), the proceedings were terminated.

The Authority further condemns the Applicant pursuant to Article 58 (2) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation, as Annex III to this Decision.

2. The Authority examined of its own motion whether it was justified to impose a data protection fine on the Applicant. In this context, the Authority complies with Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation and Infotv. 75 / A. §, it considered all the circumstances of the case and found that in the case of the infringements discovered in the present proceedings, the warning was neither a proportionate nor a dissuasive sanction, therefore it is necessary to impose a fine.

3. In setting the amount of the fine, the Authority first of all took into account that the Applicant had, in essence, made two separate applications to the Authority. One of the applications is related to the registration, correction or deletion of the personal data of the temporary home address of the Applicant, and the other is related to the transfer of his / her personal data to [...].

In relation to both requests, the Authority took into account that the infringements committed by the Applicant constitute an infringement falling within the higher category of fines under Article 83 (5) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

In both applications, the Authority considered as an attenuating circumstance that the Applicant had not suffered harm as a result of the infringement committed by the Applicant (Article 83 (2) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation).

In both applications, the Authority took into account as an attenuating circumstance that the Applicant had not yet been convicted of a breach of the General Data Protection Regulation (Article 83 (2) (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation).

4. The Authority took into account as a countervailing circumstance the request of the Applicant regarding the correction or deletion of the temporary home address that the Applicant indicated to the Applicant three times, once during the period of application of the General Data Protection Regulation, that his temporary home address had been terminated [Article 83 of the General Data Protection Regulation. Article 2 (2) (k)].

The Authority took into account as an attenuating circumstance with regard to the Applicant's request to correct or delete the temporary residence address that the Applicant deleted the Applicant's temporary residence address from its records after becoming aware of the initiation of the data protection authority procedure [Article 83 (2) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation].

With regard to the request related to the correction or deletion of the Applicant's temporary residential address, the Authority took into account as an additional mitigating circumstance that the data processing concerned the Applicant's only personal data. [Article 83 (2) (k) of the General Data Protection Regulation].

The Authority did not consider the General Data Protection Regulation to be relevant in determining the imposition of a fine with regard to the Applicant's request to correct or delete the temporary home address83. the circumstances referred to in Article 2 (2) (b), (c), (d), (g), (h), (i) and (j), as they cannot be interpreted in the context of the specific case.

5. In view of its request for the transfer of the Applicant's personal data to [...], the Authority took into account as an attenuating circumstance that the transfer was in the interest of the Applicant and the employees in an uncertain legal environment, so that they were not financially disadvantaged The applicant intended to promote the interests of employees (Article 83 (2) (a) and (k) of the General Data Protection Regulation).

The Authority did not consider Article 83 (2) (b), (c), (d), (f), (g) of the General Data Protection Regulation to be relevant for the determination of the fine in relation to its request for the transfer of the Applicant's personal data to [...]. circumstances referred to in points (h), (i) and (j), as they cannot be interpreted in the context of the specific case.

6. The sales revenue of the Applicant in 2019 was in the order of HUF 20,000 million, so the imposed data protection fine is distant compared to the maximum fine that can be imposed.
