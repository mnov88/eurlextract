Okay, let's start breaking down the user's query. They provided a detailed decision from Sweden's Datainspektionen (DPA) regarding Google and want me to extract specific facts into 22 lines following strict formatting rules.

First, I need to parse through the content carefully. The first question is about the country of the DPA. The authority mentioned is "Datainspektionen" from Sweden, so the answer should be SE.

Next, the full name of the authority is straightforward: Datainspektionen (Sweden). 

The decision date is given as 10.03.2020, which in YYYY-MM-DD format becomes 2020-03-10.

For question 4, it's stated that there was no appeal ("Appeal: Not appealed"), so the answer is N.

Question 6 asks about GDPR articles evaluated. The relevant law section lists Articles 5(1)(b), 5(1)(a), 6, 9, 10, and 17. I'll list them separated by commas.

Violated articles (question 7) include the same ones mentioned in the evaluation but specifically noted as violations: 5(1)(b), 6, 9, 10, 17.

No explicit finding of no infringement is mentioned, so answer 8 is N.

Sanctions imposed are a fine (question 9). The amount is 75,000,000 SEK. Converting that to the currency code, it's SEK, but the user might expect EUR since the text mentions approximately â‚¬7 million. However, the exact figure given is in SEK, so I'll use SEK as per the document.

Number of defendants (question 12) is n/a, but looking back, the parties are listed as "n/a," which might mean no specific defendant named, but the primary defendant is Google LLC. Wait, the text says "Parties: n/a" but later mentions Google in the case details. Maybe the answer here is 1, with Google as the primary defendant.

The role of the primary defendant (question 14) is controller since they are processing personal data.

For SNA and ISIC codes, I need to find if there's any mention. The text doesn't provide specific SNA or ISIC codes, so those might be UNKNOWN unless inferred. But the user said not to infer except for questions 15 and 16. Wait, the instructions say that for 15 and 16, a must be used. Hmm, maybe I need to check again.

Looking at the content, there's no explicit SNA or ISIC code provided. The defendant is Google LLC, which is a non-financial corporation (SNA: S.11). For ISIC, Google's main activity is computer programming (6201), but since it's not explicitly stated in the text, maybe UNKNOWN. However, the user might expect using the example given in the instructions if no info is present.

For question 17, the primary defendant is a business entity, so the answer is BUSINESS.
