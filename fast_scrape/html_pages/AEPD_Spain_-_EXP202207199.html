<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Facts">Facts</span></h3>
<p>The data subject rented a room with the right to a kitchen and noted that the Landlord has installed a video surveillance camera in the kitchen of the property, without the data subject having at any time consented to the processing of his data or having signed any document in this regard.
</p><p>Despite been notified of the complaint, the Landlord did not respond to the DPA request.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holding">Holding</span></h3>
<p>The DPA first confirmed that the rental of a property or part thereof to a third party entails a series of rights and obligations for the parties, so that those relating to the protection of personal data must also be taken into account, especially if the installation of recording devices affects the privacy of the third party or leads to data processing in a way that is disproportionate to the intended purpose. 
</p><p>The Spanish DPA than considered that with the total or partial transfer of the property, the notion of <i>"personal and domestic sphere</i>" is excluded. Exemptions therefore do not apply and the camera falls within the scope of the GDPR. This meant that the presence of the camera must be in accordance with the purpose pursued, and its presence cannot be imposed by contractual clause, as the home in this case i<i>s "a space in which the individual lives without necessarily being subject to the uses and social conventions and exercises his most intimate freedom".</i> 
</p><p>Considering this, the Spanish DPA found that the Landlord should be considered as a data controller and that the data processing activity related to the video surveillance camera was held without sufficient legal basis as no consent was gathered from the data subject.
</p><p>For violating <a href="/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR" title="Article 6 GDPR">Article 6 GDPR</a>, the DPA fined the controller €4,000 and ordered, in accordance with <a href="/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2" title="Article 58 GDPR">Article 58(2) GDPR</a>, the removal of the device in question from the interior of the dwelling, granting a period of 15 working days from the day following notification of the decision.
