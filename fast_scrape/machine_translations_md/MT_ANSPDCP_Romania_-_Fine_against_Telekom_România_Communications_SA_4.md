## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is Telekom Romania, one of the biggest telecommunication providers in Romania. The data subject is a customer of the controller. They filed a complaint with the DPA after the controller erroneously sent them e-mail invoices and notifications that were issued for another customer. The DPA started an investigation and found that the situation was caused because the controller collected inaccurate data from one of its clients. Moreover, the DPA found that the controller did not take necessary measures to enforce an erasure request pursuant to [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR").

### Holding

First, the DPA held that controller violated [Article 5(1)(d)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1d "Article 5 GDPR"), [Article 5(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 5(2)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR"), because it collected inaccurate data and sent invoices and notifications containing personal data to the wrong recipient. For these violations, the DPA imposed a fine of approximately €5.000 (RON 24.745). Second, the DPA found that controller violated [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR") because it ignored the data subject's erasure request. For this violation, the DPA imposed a fine of approximately €1.000 (RON 4.949). Hence, in total, the fine was approximately €6.000 (RON 29.694).

Additionally, the DPA applied two corrective measures. The DPA ordered the controller to bring its processing operations into compliance with GDPR by implementing efficient measures which would guarantee the accuracy of personal data at the moment of the collection. Moreover, it ordered the controller to comply with data subjects' erasure and rectification requests, by adopting effective technical and organisational measures which will guarantee the correct implementation of such changes.
