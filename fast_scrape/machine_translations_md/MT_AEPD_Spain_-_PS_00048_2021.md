                                              I

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each

control authority, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDPGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve
this procedure.

                                             II

        Article 6.1 of the RGPD, establishes the assumptions that allow considering
lawful processing of personal data.

        For its part, article 5 of the RGPD establishes that personal data will be:

        "A) treated in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the interested party
("Lawfulness, fairness and transparency");

        b) collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be processed

subsequently in a manner incompatible with said purposes; in accordance with article 89,
section 1, the subsequent processing of personal data for archiving purposes in
public interest, scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes are not
deemed incompatible with the original purposes ("purpose limitation");

        c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes
for those who are processed ("data minimization");

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/6

        d) accurate and, if necessary, up-to-date; all measures will be taken
reasonable so that the personal data that
are inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are processed ("accuracy");

        e) maintained in a way that allows the identification of the interested parties
for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of data processing
personal; personal data may be kept for longer periods
provided that they are treated exclusively for archival purposes in the public interest, purposes of
scientific or historical research or statistical purposes, in accordance with article

89, paragraph 1, without prejudice to the application of technical and organizational measures
appropriate measures imposed by this Regulation in order to protect the rights and
freedoms of the interested party ("limitation of the conservation period");

        f) treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate security of the

personal data, including protection against unauthorized or illegal processing and
against their loss, destruction or accidental damage, by applying measures
appropriate technical or organizational ("integrity and confidentiality").

        The person responsible for the treatment will be responsible for compliance with the

                                             III

        According to the available evidence, it is considered proven
that on August 2, 2018, the respondent proceeded to disseminate through the social network

Twitter an alleged lawsuit for a conciliation act that would have been filed against the
claimant where their personal data were included, including their home address.

        Therefore, it is found that the complainant spread the message on the social network
home of the claimant, and therefore is responsible for the

violation of confidentiality when disseminating said data, so it is considered that

claimant, in relation to article 5.1 f) of the RGPD, which governs the principles of
integrity and confidentiality of personal data, as well as responsibility
proactive of the controller to demonstrate compliance.

                                              IV

mo or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the

the following corrective powers listed below:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/6

       b) punish any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with warning
when the processing operations have infringed the provisions of this Re-
regulation;

       d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,

in a certain way and within a specified time. "

       Recital 148 points out:

       "In the event of a minor offense, or if the fine that is likely to be imposed
would constitute a disproportionate burden for an individual, rather than
sanction by fine may be imposed a warning. It must however

pay special attention to the nature, severity and duration of the offense, to its
intentional nature, to the measures taken to alleviate the damages suffered,
the degree of responsibility or any relevant prior infringement, the way in which
that the supervisory authority has had knowledge of the infringement, to the fulfillment
of measures ordered against the person in charge or in charge, to the adherence to codes of

conduct and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstance. "

       There are no penalties preceding the claimed, the activity of the claimed

       The respondent has recognized this error, and it is clear that she withdrew from her
Twitter the document posted immediately.

of allegations on March 4, 2021, stating: “We must state that my
constituents withdrew from their Twitter account the document published in a
immediate, not being the same on the network for more than 15 minutes, being published by
error, error that once warned, caused the immediate withdrawal of the publication, no

leaving a trace of any kind on the networks, neither of the data, nor of the content of the
conciliation published by mistake, a fact that caused the complainant not to suffer
no harm.

       Therefore, having recognized the facts and not having any previous sanction,

taking into account the principle of proportionality and seriousness of what happened and the rapid
correction made, we request in application of art. 148 of the RGPD that the sanction
remain in a warning, showing our deepest regret for what
happened, not being our intention to cause harm to anyone, since everything is
It was due to an inadvertent error.

       We request: that they consider the facts to be recognized and if they consider that the
action is reprehensible, we request that taking into account the principles of seriousness and
