## English Summary

### Facts

A mafia boss was caught after 30 years of hiding during a medical treatment in a private hospital. A newspaper published detailed information on his state of health and more specifically about the fact that he was terminally ill. The Italian DPA intervened to ascertain whether the processing of personal data was legitimate.

### Holding

The Italian DPA stroke a balance between freedom of information and right to privacy. Health data are sensitive data covered by [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"). According to Article 137 of the Italian Data Protection Code, health data can be processed without the data subject´s consent provided that the controller complies with the principle of essentiality of information and the facts are of public interest. In addition, the controller shall respect the deontological rules governing journalism. In the present case, the Italian DPA found that the principle of essentiality was violated. Thus, it imposed the temporary limitation of processing concerning data already published and equivalent ones.

## Comment

It is possible to draw some parallels between this decision and the ECtHR attempt to reconcile privacy rights and freedom of expression in journalism. In its extensive case law on the matter, the ECtHR developed a list of criteria orienting this balance. The criteria are as follows: (i) contribution to a debate of public interest; (ii) whether the person concerned is known to the public, and the subject of the news report; (iii) the prior conduct of the person concerned; (iv) the way in which the information was obtained and its veracity; (v) the content, form and consequences of the publication; and (vi) the severity of the measure imposed (see [Axel Springer AG v. Germany, application no. 39954/08](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre#{%22itemid%22:%5B%22001-109034%22%5D}), points 89-95; [Hurbain v. Belgium, application no. 57292/16](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre#{%22tabview%22:%5B%22document%22%5D,%22itemid%22:%5B%22001-210884%22%5D}), point 94; [Biancardi v. Italy, application no. 77419/16](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre#{%22itemid%22:%5B%22001-213827%22%5D}), point 61) In the present case, the Italian DPA maintained that the mere fact that the data subject was a notorious public figure was not sufficient to legitimise privacy limitations. Given their nature and content, the information revealed did not contribute to a debate of public interest.

2. Publication is permitted in the context of pursuing the essentiality of information and always with respect for the dignity of the person if this holds a position of particular social or public importance."

CONSIDERING therefore that the Code envisages, in general terms, the aforementioned principle of the "essential nature of information" as a criterion for the determination in the publication of personal data in the journalistic field and that the Code of Conduct, in recalling and specifying this principle, intended to guarantee greater rigor with reference to the collection and dissemination of data suitable for revealing the state of health of identified or identifiable persons (articles 5, 6 and 10);

CONSIDERED it necessary to order the aforementioned limitation with immediate effect from the date of receipt of this provision, reserving any other determination to the outcome of the definition of the preliminary investigation started on the case;

RECALLING that, in the event of non-compliance with the measure established by the Guarantor, the criminal sanction pursuant to art. 170 of the Code and the administrative sanctions provided for by art. 83, par. 5, letter e), of the Regulation;

HAVING REGARD to the documentation in the deeds;

CONSIDERING the observations of the general secretary;

SPEAKER Prof. Pasquale Stanzione;

ALL THE ABOVE CONSIDERING THE GUARANTOR:

a) pursuant to art. 58, par. 2, lit. f) of the Regulation urgently provides Citynews S.p.A., as data controller, with the measure of the temporary limitation of the treatment, to be considered referred to the further dissemination of the health data indicated in the article in question, including those contained in the laboratory report accompanying it, as well as any other similar information reported in any other articles published on the same site;

b) the aforementioned limitation has immediate effect from the date of receipt of this provision, subject to any other determination following the outcome of the definition of the investigation started on the case.

The Guarantor, pursuant to art. 58, par. 1, of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, invites the data controller who is the recipient of the provision, also, within 3 days from the date of receipt of this provision, to communicate what initiatives have been undertaken in order to implement what is prescribed in this provision and in any case to provide adequately documented feedback.
