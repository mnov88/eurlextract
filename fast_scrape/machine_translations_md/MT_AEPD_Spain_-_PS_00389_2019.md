IV
In this case, it is common ground that on 23/04/2019 the LOCAL POLICE
of BADAJOZ TOWN HALL provided a copy of the Act of Complaint against the
The complaint, which shows that the regulations on the protection of
personal data, when they are spread out on the public highway and next to a vehicle of their
property medical examination reports relating to employees of the
company Aguas del Suroeste, S.L. containing sensitive data and especially
protected and the aforementioned forces of law and order proceeding to remove them from the public
as a precautionary measure.
On the other hand, the absence of sensitivity on the part of the defendant to
the aforementioned facts since he did not even answer the requests for information
made by the AEPD, nor did it respond by submitting written allegations at the beginning of
agreement on sanctioning procedures and which, in addition, aims to promote safety and health of workers through the development of activities
necessary and convenient for the prevention of risks derived from work.
It should be noted that the RGPD defines data security violations
personal as "all those violations of security that cause the
accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of transmitted personal data
stored or otherwise processed, or the unauthorized communication of or access to
such data".
From the documentation in the file, there are clear indications of
that the respondent has violated article 32 of the RGPD, by producing a breach of
security in their systems by allowing and providing access to data
related to medical examination reports dated 02/12/2010 of
workers of the company Aguas del Suroeste who were spread out over the
floor.
The RGPD in the mentioned precept does not establish a list of the measures of
security that apply according to the data that are the subject of
processing, but provides that the controller and the processor
apply technical and organisational measures that are appropriate to the risk involved
treatment, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, probability risks
and gravity for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.
Security measures should also be adequate and
proportionate to the risk identified, noting that the determination of the measures
The technical and organisational aspects of this must be taken into account: pseudonymisation and
encryption, the ability to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability and
resilience, the ability to restore data availability and access after a
incident, verification (non-audit) process, evaluation and assessment of
effectiveness of the measures.
In any case, when assessing the adequacy of the level of safety, the following shall be taken into account
particularly taking into account the risks presented by the processing of data, such as
as a result of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of data
transmitted, retained or otherwise processed, or the communication or
unauthorised access to such data and which could result in damage
physical, material or immaterial.
In the same sense, recital 83 of the RGPD states that
"(83) In order to maintain security and to prevent the processing from infringing
provided for in this Regulation, the responsible person or person in charge should evaluate
the risks inherent in the treatment and implement measures to mitigate them, such as
encryption. These measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, including
confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of implementation
with regard to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be
to protect themselves. When assessing the risk in relation to data security, you should
take into account the risks involved in the processing of personal data,
such as the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of personal data transmitted, retained or otherwise processed, or the communication or access not
authorized to such data, which may in particular cause damage
physical, material or immaterial".
As noted above and in the context of the
investigation \*\*\*EXPEDIENTE.1 the AEPD transferred to the reclaimed on 18/05/2019 and the
30/05/2019 the complaint submitted for analysis requesting the contribution of
information related to the claimed incidence, without having received in this
no organism response whatsoever.
The liability of the claimant is determined by the bankruptcy of
security highlighted by the Local Police of the City of Badajoz, already
who is responsible for making decisions aimed at effectively implementing
appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of safety
to ensure the confidentiality of the data, restoring their
availability and prevent access to them in the event of a physical or technical incident.
However, it is clear from the documentation provided that the entity has not only
This obligation has not been fulfilled, but there is also no knowledge of the adoption of any measures at
in this respect, despite having given him notice of the complaint filed.
## Article 33 of the RGPD also regulates the notification of violations of

security that may pose a risk to the rights and freedoms of
natural persons to the competent supervisory authority, which in the case of Spain is
of the AEPD.
Therefore, whenever a gap affects data of a
personnel of natural persons we must communicate it to the AEPD and, in addition
we must notify you within 72 hours of having
knowledge of the gap.
Finally, it should be added that having been informed of the incident of
The security department is also not known to have taken any measures to
to remedy it, once he became aware of it.
Nor is there any evidence that, in accordance with the
Article 34 would have informed the persons concerned of the violation of the security of
personal data without undue delay once he became aware of them.
In accordance with the above, the respondent would be responsible for the
violations of the RGPD: violation of Articles 32, 33 and 34, violations
all of which are typified in article 83.4.a).
V
The violation of articles 32, 33 and 34 of the RGPD are criminalized
in Article 83.4(a) of the said GPRS in the following terms:
“4. Infringements of the following provisions shall be sanctioned, in accordance with
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10 000 000 or
in the case of an undertaking, up to a maximum of 2 % of total annual turnover for the previous financial year, opting for
the largest:
(a) the obligations of the person responsible and the person in charge under Articles 8,
11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43.
(…)”
The LOPDGDD in its article 71, Infractions, points out that: "They constitute
infringements the acts and conduct referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of
## Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those which are contrary to the

present organic law".
And in its article 73, for the purposes of the statute of limitations, it qualifies as "Infringements
considered serious."
"In accordance with Article 83(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
are considered serious and shall be subject to a two-year statute of limitations for offences involving
substantial infringement of the Articles mentioned in that one and, in particular, the
next:
(…)
(g) Breach as a result of lack of due diligence,
of the technical and organisational measures that have been implemented in accordance with
required by Article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679".
(r) Failure to notify the protection authority of
data of a personal data security breach in accordance with the
provided for in Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
(s) Failure to comply with the duty to inform the person concerned of a breach of
data security in accordance with Article 34 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 if the controller had been requested
by the data protection authority to carry out such notification.
The facts set out in the complaint are specified in the
existence of a security breach in the systems of the claimed party allowing the
vulnerability of it by allowing reports dated 02/12/2010 concerning
medical examinations and belonging to workers of the company Aguas del
Southwest, were spread out on the public highway and allowing access to data
contained in them.
All of this constitutes a violation of the security of personal data, which
which constitutes an infringement of Articles 32.1, 33 and 34 of the RGPD.
VI
However, Article 58(2) of the EUCPN states: "Each authority
The inspection body shall have all the following corrective powers as indicated to
continued:
(…)
(b) sanction any person responsible for or in charge of the processing with
warning where processing operations have infringed the provisions of
this Regulation;
(…)”
The RGPD, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 83 thereof, provides in its
Article 58(2)(b) the possibility of using the warning to correct treatment
of personal data that does not meet your expectations.
In this case, it has been proved that the person claimed does not
has implemented technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security
capable of ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, availability of the
access; appropriate measures for notification in the event of a breach of the
of a personal data security breach and the procedure
implemented in the event that the violation of personal data security
involves a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
VII
The respondent has not replied to the information request
by the Inspection Service.
At this point, it is necessary to inform that not attending the requirements
of the Agency may constitute a very serious infringement in accordance with
referred to in Article 72 of the LOPDGDD, which provides "1. Depending on what
## Article 83(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 are considered very serious and

The statute of limitations for offences involving a substantial breach shall be three years
of the articles mentioned in that one and, in particular, the following ones:
(…)
ñ) Not to provide access to the staff of the data protection authority
competent to personal data, information, premises, equipment and means of
processing required by the data protection authority for the
exercise of their powers of investigation.
(o) Resistance to or obstruction of the exercise of the inspection function by
competent data protection authority'.
(…)”
At the same time, notification of the agreement to commence and the expiry of the period granted
to make allegations, I do not submit any written.
As stated above, it is common ground that the respondent
does not have technical and organisational measures in place to ensure a level of
adequate security capable of ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability
of the data avoiding its access, loss, etc.; adequate measures to proceed to the
notification in the event of a breach of personal data security and
procedure in place in the event of a data security breach
personal risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals It is necessary to point out that if these incidents are not corrected by adopting the
appropriate technical and organisational measures, adapting them to the
Articles 32.1, 33 and 34 of the RGPD or reiterate the conduct set out in
the complaint and that it is the cause of these proceedings, as well as not informing
following this DPSA of the measures adopted could lead to the exercise of
possible proceedings before the controller to ensure the application of
effectively the appropriate measures to ensure and not compromise the
confidentiality of personal data and the right to privacy of
people.

graduation of penalties whose existence has been established,
