## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject - the complainant - filed a complaint with the AEPD against the organisation “l’Associació per la Participació Política a Catalunya (AppCat)” for failure to comply with his right to be forgotten.

Indeed, the data subject required from the data controller the erasure of his personal data. No answer to his request has been received.

### Dispute

Does the GDPR allow the data controller to ignore a request for erasure?

### Holding

The AEPD found that Article 12 GDPR does not allow the data controller to ignore the request after the on-month deadline. In the event where there is no personal data, where the request does not fulfill the requirements for the exercise of the right to erasure but rather the right to rectification or the request has to be rejected, the controller must indicate the reasons of the refusal. In any case the controller must provide an answer which justifies by any means the receipt of the request. Therefore, the APED clarified the obligation upon the data controller to give an express answer without undue delay. In the case at hand, the right to erasure has not been complied with due to the lack of answer. Thus, the AEPD ordered the data controller to send the complaint an answer within the limit of 10 working days.

## Comment

The order to comply with the GDPR is not a surprise. However, it’s interesting to notice that the AEPD did not give reason for its decision on the basis of Article 17 GPDR (and the equivalent in domestic law) but on Article 12 GDPR. Therefore, this decision reinforces the obligation upon data controller to give an express answer for any rights exercised under Articles 15 to 22 GDPR, by virtue of Article 12 GDPR.

                           RESOLUTION Nº: R / 00457/2020

Mrs. A.A.A. , (from now on the complaining party), against ASSOCIACIÓ PER LA
POLITICAL PARTICIPATION TO CATALUNYA, (from now on the claimed party), by
not having duly attended to their right to erasure.

       The procedural actions provided for in Title VIII of the Law have been carried out.
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of

digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the following have been verified

                                       ACTS

FIRST: On November 18, 2019, the complaining party exercised the right
suppression against the claimed, without your request having received the answer
legally established.

       The complaining party provides various documentation related to the claim
raised before this Agency and on the exercise of the right exercised.

The claim was admitted for processing and the claimed entity was granted

has responded to the request for the exercise of rights that was presented by
the complaining party.

                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

FIRST: The Director of the Spanish Agency for

Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of section 2 of article 56 in
in relation to paragraph 1 f) of article 57, both of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free
circulation of these data (hereinafter, RGPD); and in article 47 of the LOPDGDD.

SECOND: In accordance with the provisions of article 55 of the RGPD, the Agency

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/5

about their obligations, as well as dealing with claims
submitted by an interested party and investigate the reason for them.

       Correlatively, article 31 of the RGPD establishes the obligation of the
responsible and in charge of the treatment to cooperate with the control authority
that he requests it in the performance of his functions. In the event that these have
designated a data protection officer, article 39 of the RGPD attributes to
This one the function of cooperating with said authority.

       Similarly, the domestic legal system, in article 65.4 the
LOPDGDD, has provided a mechanism prior to the admission for processing of the
claims that are made before the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, which
consists of transferring them to the data protection delegates
designated by those responsible or in charge of the treatment, for the intended purposes

in article 37 of the aforementioned rule, or to these when they have not designated them, to
to proceed to the analysis of said claims and to respond to them within the period of
one month.

       In accordance with these regulations, prior to admission for processing
of the claim gives rise to this procedure, it was transferred to the

responsible entity to proceed with its analysis, provide a response to this Agency
within a month and certify having provided the claimant with the proper response,
in the event of exercise of the rights regulated in articles 15 to 22 of the
RGPD.

       The result of said transfer did not allow the satisfaction of the
claims of the complaining party. Consequently, dated XXXXXXXX, at
effects provided for in article 64.2 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to accept the submitted claim for processing.
Said admission for processing agreement determines the opening of this procedure

lack of attention to a request to exercise the rights established in the
Articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD, regulated in article 64.1 of the LOPDGDD, according to the
which:

"1. When the procedure refers exclusively to the lack of attention of a
request to exercise the rights established in articles 15 to 22 of the

Regulation (EU) 2016/679, will start by agreement of admission for processing, which is
adopt in accordance with the provisions of the following article.
In this case, the period to resolve the procedure will be six months from
from the date that the claimant was notified of the admission agreement to
Procedure. After this period, the interested party may consider his

claim."

       The purging of administrative responsibilities is not considered appropriate in
the framework of a sanctioning procedure, the exceptional nature of which implies that
opt, whenever possible, for the prevalence of alternative mechanisms that

have protection in current regulations.

        It is the exclusive competence of this Agency to assess whether there are responsibilities
administrative procedures that must be purged in a sanctioning procedure and, in

be based on the existence of elements that justify said start of the activity
