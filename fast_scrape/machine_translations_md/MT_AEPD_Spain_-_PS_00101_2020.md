## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that he/she had been receiving unsolicited marketing emails from the defendant, and that he/she had tried to unsubscribe from such service by using the link on the emails, but without any results.

### Dispute

The defendant did not answer to any AEPD investigation requests, so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that the defendant has infringed its marketing communication duties as per Article 21(1) and 22(1) LSSI, according to which, (i) electronic marketing communications cannot be sent to anyone unless there is express consent of the recipient or a contract relationship with him/her and the marketing communications are similar to the products/services offered in the contract, and (ii) there is an obligation for the digital services provider to offer a simple and free process to unsubscribe from such communications. Consequently, after considering some mitigating circumstances \[(i) the absence of damages to the claimant, and (ii) the absence of advantages obtained by the defendant with such conduct\], the AEPD decided to impose a warning to the defendant. Additionally, the AEPD requires the defendant to correct the situation in the period of one (1) month since this resolution.
