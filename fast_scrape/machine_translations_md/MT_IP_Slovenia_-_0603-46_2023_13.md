## English Summary

### Facts

The Slovenian DPA carried out an investigation in the premises of a controller, following a complaint regarding their use of video surveillance and the lack of adequate notice for its use.

The controller had their premises under video surveillance. The video surveillance presented an information notice. However, this notice was not placed in a way that would allow for an individual to be informed about the surveillance before entering the premises and to decide whether they wanted to be in the area covered by the video surveillance.

### Holding

The Slovenian DPA held that the controller had failed to comply with its duty to ensure that data subjects were notified of the controller's use of video surveillance. As such, the controller had violated [Article 76(3) ZVOP-2](http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7959).

The controller had displayed an information notice for their use of video surveillance. However, this notice was not placed in a way that would allow for an individual to be informed about the surveillance before entering the premises and to decide whether they wanted to be in the area covered by the video surveillance.

The DPA found the placement of the notice to breach of [Article 76(3) ZVOP-2](http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7959). As a result, the DPA held the controller liable on the basis of [Article 100(3) ZVOP-2](http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7959) in conjunction with [Article 100(1)(2) ZVOP-2](http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7959), and issued a reprimand.

## Comment

ZVOP-2 is Slovenia's national implementation of the GDPR.

[Article 76(3) ZVOP-2](http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7959) states that a controller must ensure that a video surveillance notice includes the information required by [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). It further requires a written or unambiguous graphic description of the fact that video surveillance is being carried out, the purposes of the processing, the name of the controller of the video surveillance system, a telephone number or an e-mail address or a website address to exercise the data subject's rights in the field of the protection of personal data, information on the specific impact of the processing, in particular further processing, the contact details of the authorized person (telephone number or e-mail address) and information about unusual further processing, such as transfers to third country entities, live monitoring and the possibility of audio intervention in case of live monitoring.

LEGAL LESSON: A request for judicial protection is allowed against a decision on a misdemeanor.

The notice of request is sent by post or delivered directly in two copies and is considered timely if submitted on the last day of the deadline for submitting the notice of request by registered mail or directly to the authority that issued the decision. The announced filing of a request for judicial protection may be withdrawn until the deadline for filing the announcement of this request expires.

If the beneficiary of the request for judicial protection does not announce or withdraws the announcement within the legal deadline for filing this request, it is considered that he has waived the right to request for judicial protection.

If none of the beneficiaries of the request for judicial protection announces this request, the misdemeanor authority does not make a decision on the offense with reasons, but it is considered that a final decision has been served on the date of service of the decision without reasons, which with the expiration of the deadline for announcing the request for judicial protection becomes final.

When at least one of the beneficiaries of the request for judicial protection announces the filing of this request, a written decision on the offense with reasons is drawn up and sent no later than 30 days after the announcement of the filing of the request for judicial protection is received. In this case, the decision with reasons is served on all beneficiaries of the request for judicial protection.

Under the conditions and in accordance with the regulations governing the financial operations of the offense authority, the violator can also pay the costs of the procedure with a non-cash means of payment.
