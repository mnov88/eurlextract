In an [Article 60 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_60_GDPR "Article 60 GDPR") decision, the Swedish DPA reprimanded a company for, among others, a violation of [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). Since the data subject had provided an invalid e-mail address for the order confirmation, the company, in an attempt to track the client, shared his data with the e-mail domain provider.

## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject ordered a product from the German website of Trionic, a company selling wheelchairs among other products. According to the data subject, the controller then sent a copy of his order confirmation to the domain provider of the data subject's email provider. The data subject communicated his dissatisfaction about this practice to the controller. The data subject also complained about the fact that the controller was sharing personal data with another company, despite the fact that this was not mentioned in the privacy policy. The data subject later cancelled the order.

The controller clarified its several processing operations and the corresponding legal bases.

First, the controller suspected at first that the data subject had provided an incorrect personal e-mail address for this order. When the controller tried to contact the data subject with the provided telephone number, this did not work. It turned out that the data subject had provided a fax number instead of a telephone number. Because there was no other way to contact the data subject, the controller decided to send the order confirmation to the 'info' e-mail address of the data subject's e-mail domain. Besides the fact that the controller claimed that this was the only way to contact the data subject, the controller also stated that it was legally obligated to do so pursuant to [Article 5(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"). The controller did not explicitly mention [Article 6(1)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") GDPR, but it did mention that it was using the legal bases of 'legal obligation'.

Second, the controller allowed its customers to pay with invoice in the German market. However, the controller had experienced before that these invoices were not paid. To prevent this from happening again, the controller shared the data subject's personal data with its processor, providing fraud control services. The controller's legal basis for this processing was [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"), for the controller's legitimate interest to prevent fraud. It also provided its assessment why its interests outweighed the interests of the data subject. However, the controller merely referred to this processor in its privacy policy as '_external resources_', without any further explanation.

On an unspecified date, the data subject filed a complaint at a German DPA (not specified which German DPA). On another unspecified date, this German DPA then transferred the decision to the Swedish DPA, which was the lead supervisory authority in this decision. The concerned supervisory authorities were the DPA's of Denmark, Norway and a German DPA.

### Holding

First, with regard to the sending of the e-mail to the info address of the data subject's email domain, the DPA acknowledged that the controller had to comply with [Article 5(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"). However, this provision also only permitted the processing of personal data that was strictly necessary. In this case, the DPA held that there were less coercive measures which the controller could have taken, such as sending a fax to the data subject, which would have been possible. The processing was therefore not necessary. The DPA determined that [Article 6(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") and no other legal basis could be used for this processing. Therefore, the controller violated [Article 6(1)GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR").

Second, the DPA held that the controller could rely on [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") for sharing personal data with its processor for anti-fraud purposes. The DPA assessed the following three criteria of the assessment of legitimate interest. _First_, the DPA noted that the interest of preventing fraud was justified at the time of processing_,_ given the fact that it was an actual interest and not just hypothetical_. Second_, the DPA determined that sharing this data with its processor was also necessary for the controller to prevent fraud, because it could not fulfil this purpose in an equally effective manner. Also, the disclosure of this data was not too extensive or privacy-sensitive. _Third,_ based on several factors, the DPA determined that the interests of the data subject did not outweigh the legitimate interests of the controller. The DPA considered that the controller's interest to prevent fraud weighted heavily since the data subject's order was paid with a credit purchase. This interest had to be compared with the data subject's interest in preventing their data from being processed. The DPA considered in this regard that the data subject could reasonably expect the processing by the controller when making a credit purchase on invoice, despite the minor deficiencies of the privacy policy (see below). The DPA also considered that the processing did not appear to be severely privacy invasive and that the data itself was not really privacy-sensitive.

However, the DPA did determine a violation of [Article 13(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") because the processor was only mentioned in the controller's privacy policy as one of it's '_external resources_' for fraud prevention. The DPA held that this description was not specific enough.

The Swedish DPA determined that this was a minor infringement and issued a reprimand pursuant to [Article 58(2)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR").

## Comment

This summary only includes the considerations of the DPA where a violation was found. The parts where the DPA did not find a violation were left out.

It is unclear from the decision when the original decision was filed. It is also unclear at which German DPA was filed. Furthermore, it is also unclear when the decision was transferred to the Swedish DPA, the LSA in this decision.

The Swedish DPA and the controller mentioned several legal bases throughout the decision, sometimes without mentioning the specific GDPR provision. For the purposes of this summary, these GDPR provisions have been added.

                                Protection (IMY)

                                The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) finds that Trionic Sverige AB has
                                processed personal data in breach of

                                     •   Article 6(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by disclosing
                                         the complainant’s personal data with a third party without it being necessary
                                         to comply with a legal obligation,

                                     •   Article 13(1)(e) by providing the complainant with insufficiently specific
                                         information about recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data
                                         when processing data for the purpose of combating fraud.

                                The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection issues Trionic Sverige AB a reprimand
                                pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR for the infringement of Articles 6(1) and

                                13(1)(e) of the GDPR.

                                Presentation of the supervisory case

                                The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) has initiated supervision regarding

                                Trionic Sverige AB (Trionic or the company) due to a complaint. The complaint has
                                been submitted to IMY, as responsible supervisory authority for the company’s
                                operations pursuant to Article 56 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

                                The complaint
                                The complaint states the following.

                                On behalf of the complainant, a product was ordered via Trionic’s German website.
                                According to the complainant Trionic, for some reason became suspicious of the e-
                                mail address used for the order and therefore sent a copy of the order confirmation to

                                the info-e-mail address provided in the domain where the complainant has their e-mail
                                address.

                                Trionic also sent information about the order to a company even though it was not
                                apparent from the privacy policy that data will be shared with that company.
                                Furthermore, as of 1 July 2018, the privacy policy is not easily accessible. Clicking on

                                the “Privacy Policy” link on Trionic’s website opens a new page on the website that
                                links further to the policy located on another website.

                                Trionic also reportedly Google searched the name, address and contact details of the
                                complainant's representative and possibly linked that information to the complainant's
                                data. Trionic has also stored the entire IPv6 number used when ordering. The privacy

                                policy states that IP numbers are only processed for operation and maintenance
                                purposes. Trionic has also continued to store the IP number even after the
                                complainant canceled the order.

                                What Trionic Sverige AB has stated
                                Trionic has mainly stated the following. The company is the data controller for the

                                processing to which the complaint relates.

                                Transfer to info-e-mail address on the basis of a legal obligation

                                Trionic sent a copy of the complainant’s order to an info-e-mail address on the basis of
                                a legal obligation. Trionic is obliged to take all reasonable steps to ensure that
                                personal data that are inaccurate in relation to the purposes for which they are

                                processed are deleted or rectified without delay (cf. Art. 5(1)(d) GDPR). Trionic’s main
                                target group is people in the age range 60-90 years. It is common for the company’s
                                customers to make unintentional errors when ordering form in the company’s online

                                store.

                                When the company checked the details of the complainant’s order, it reacted to the
                                fact that the e-mail address contained Trionic’s company name and the company

                                therefore believed that the buyer had provided an invalid e-mail address. The company
                                then attempted to contact the customer through the given telephone number in order
                                to correct the e-mail address provided. The phone number turned out to be a fax

                                number. In the absence of other contact details, the company visited the domain name
                                of the email address. There the company found the info-e-mail address that the
                                company, for valid reasons, thought was the correct e-mail address. The company

                                then replaced the customer’s e-mail address with the one found and sent the order
                                confirmation to that e-mail address. At the time, the company considered that it was its'
                                only possibility to correct the customer’s contact details and that the measure therefore

                                was necessary.

                                When Trionic became aware of the mistake, the company found that it was unlikely

                                that it had resulted in any risk to the complainant’s personal integrity. The reason for
                                this was, in particular, that the circumstances indicated that the complainant’s personal
                                data had been disclosed to a very limited circle of (other than the complainant) a family

                                member and that it was personal data of relatively limited integrity value.Privacy Protection Authority    Our ref: DI-2021-3399                                                                  3(11)

                                Legal basis for disclosure to combat fraud
                                Trionic has disclosed personal data relating to the complainant to a provider of fraud

                                control services on the basis of a legitimate interest which, at the time, acted as a data
                                processor to the company.

                                The information disclosed consisted of the complainant’s name, e-mail address,
                                information that it is the complainant's first purchase from Trionic, the complainant’s e-

                                mail domain name, telephone number, order number, number of items purchased,
                                currency of the purchase, the value of the purchase, the complainant's invoice,
                                delivery and IP address.

                                On the German market, Trionic offers its customers to pay by invoice. It is Trionic that
                                issues the invoice and accounts for the credit risk. Over the years, Trionic has been

                                subject to a number of frauds and fraud attempts in the form of customers who choose
                                to purchase products with invoice payment without the intention to actually pay the
                                invoice. In order to prevent fraud (the purpose of the processing), Trionic has therefore

                                used the services of the provider. The data in question have been disclosed to the
                                service provider on the basis of Trionic’s legitimate interest to prevent fraud. Following
                                a balancing test considering the complainant’s interests and fundamental rights and

                                freedoms as set out below, Trionic considers that it has had a legal basis for the
                                processing.

                                The processing was necessary to achieve the purpose on the following grounds. The
                                complainant chose to pay by invoice. The data provided by the customer differed from

                                the norm, in that the fax number had been entered instead of a regular telephone
                                number and the e-mail address contained the word “Trionic”. Trionic is responsible for
                                the credit risk of invoice purchases on the German market and fraud attempts are
2 common for credit purchases in e-commerce. About two percent of all purchases in
                                Trionic’s online store have been flagged as suspicious by the supplier. Furthermore,
                                Trionic lacks the competence and resources to perform the type of analysis offered by

                                the supplier. Against this background, there were no alternatives to the processing in
                                order to achieve the objective of fraud prevention.

                                As regards to what the data subject can reasonably expect, the company notes that
                                the type of analysis offered by the supplier in the context of credit purchases is
                                common in e-commerce on the European market. The aim is to prevent fraud. It

                                constitutes a type of supplement to credit assessment. A credit assessment can show
                                that a buyer is creditworthy, but not that the buyer is indeed the person to whom the
                                credit assessment relates and that the buyer has a real intention to pay for the

                                purchase. Therefore, in the case of online credit purchases, consumers must expect
                                this type of assessment to be carried out.

                                Regarding the nature of the data, Trionic argues that the supplier’s analysis was based
                                entirely on the above-mentioned personal data that Trionic shared with the supplier.

                                This data typically has a relatively limited integrity value, as in many cases it is publicly
                                available.

                                As regards the negative consequences, according to Trionic, the potentially negative
                                consequence of the processing for the complainant is that the credit purchase would
                                be refused, which is a relatively mild consequence that should not affect the outcome

                                of the balancing of interests.

                                Legal basis for the processing and storage of IP address prior to cancellation
                                The complainant’s IP address was stored and transferred to the supplier for the
                                purpose of analysing the complainant’s geographical location at the time of ordering.

                                These processing operations were carried out for the purposes of fraud prevention
                                (Objective 1) and for the purpose of identifying and asserting legal interests (Objective
2). The purpose of fraud prevention is a legitimate interest of Trionic. With regard to the
                                necessity of the processing, it can be noted that in the case of fraud attempts, the

                                place of purchase and delivery often does not match the location of the IP address and
                                the customer’s connection. Along with other warning signs, such as incorrect phone
                                numbers and a possible IP address connected via anonymisation services, it helps

                                Trionic avoid fraud. Often, fraudulent buyers have several different e-mail addresses
                                but usually do not exchange IP address. Therefore, by saving and processing buyers’
                                IP addresses, Trionic can check the total amount of orders made in the web shop with

                                the same IP address. Without saving the IP address, none of this would have been
                                possible.

                                With regard to what the data subject reasonably can expect, reference is made to the
                                corresponding assessment regarding the disclosure of anti-fraud data as set out
                                above.

                                As for the purpose of establishing and exercising legal claims, Trionic has a legitimate
                                interest in storing the IP address used in purchases in order to establish and enforce

                                legal claims, both civil (debt collection) and criminal law (as a plaintiff in fraud
                                investigations). As regards the necessity of processing, in the case of online credit
                                purchases without the use of e-identification, there is no better opportunity to establish
                                the actual identity of the buyer than to document the IP address used in the purchase.

                                Proof of the identity of the buyer is directly necessary in order to recover past due
                                claims and to obtain conviction in the event of fraud.

                                Regarding what the data subject can reasonably expect, Trionic has made the
                                assessment that from the point of view of the data subject it should appear more or
                                less obvious that e-commerce companies save the IP address of the credit purchaser

                                in connection with purchases in order to be able, if necessary, to establish the identity
                                of the buyer and to recover past due claims and to be able to pursue criminal claims in
                                the event of fraud. Furthermore, Trionic has considered that the IP address has a

                                limited privacy value that does not outweigh Trionic’s need to establish and enforce
                                legal claims and that the processing does not risk to cause any significant
                                consequences for buyers. The most obvious consequence may be that the purchase

                                will be denied.

                                Legal basis for continued storage of IP address after cancellation

                                Trionic continued to save the complainant’s IP address for the purchase after the order
                                was cancelled. However, Trionic deleted it after receiving the complaint, which it
                                interpreted as a request for deletion.

                                Trionic considers that the company has a legitimate interest in saving the IP address
                                used for the purchase in order to establish and enforce legal claims, both civil

                                (receivable recovery) and criminal law (as plaintiff in fraud investigations). This also
                                applies in the case of cancellations as it may have civil and criminal implications within
                                the limitation period.Privacy Protection Authority    Our ref: DI-2021-3399                                                                   5(11)
                                Date:2022-10-10

                                The processing is necessary in the same way as before cancellation.

                                Concerning what the data subject could reasonably expect, it is the same as for

                                storage prior to cancellation, with the addition that, in Trionic’s view, the assessment is
                                not affected by the fact that it concerns a cancelled purchase, since it may have civil

                                and criminal implications within the limitation period. However, as mentioned above,
                                after receiving the complaint, Trionic decided to delete the complainant’s IP address.

                                Easily accessible information to the data subject
                                Trionic states that before confirming the purchase, the complainant had the opportunity

                                to read Trionic’s Privacy Policy by clicking on a link in the text “\[I\] have read the Terms
                                and Conditions and Privacy Policy and approves them.” It was then also possible for
                                the complainant to access the Privacy Policy by clicking on a link on the company’s

                                website. Due to a loading error, at the time of the complaint, two clicks were required
                                to reach the privacy policy, which has since been corrected. The policy could also be

                                accessed by just one click on a link to the policy at the bottom of the footer of the
                                Trionic website.

                                Information on the processing to combat fraud and the storage of IP addresses
                                As regards information on anti-fraud, the processing activities section states:

                                “Data processing is carried out using computers or IT-based systems in accordance
                                with organisational procedures, which are specifically aimed at the stated purposes. In

                                addition to the responsible person, other internal personnel (personnel management,
                                sales, marketing, legal department, system administrators), or external resource —
                                with the responsible person as principal (such as technical service providers, delivery

                                companies, hosting providers, IT companies or communication agencies) — may
                                operate this website and thus have access to the information. An up-to-date list of
3 these participants may be requested at any time from the provider (Trionic).”

                                Trionic is aware of its obligation under Article 13 of the GDPR to inform about the

                                recipients or categories of recipients who are to access the personal data. The text
                                above states, inter alia, that Trionic may pass on personal data to external resources.

                                With the complainant’s complaint, the company has reviewed the privacy policy and
                                decided to amend it to explicitly indicate that personal data may be disclosed to
                                companies that analyse the fraud risk of credit purchases.

                                With regard to information about the storage of the IP address, the Privacy Policy

                                specifies which data is processed by Trionic or by third parties. It states that so-called
                                “user data” is stored when it is provided voluntarily by the user or collected
                                automatically when using the online store and includes the user’s IP address.

                                Furthermore, it is clear that collected personal data may be processed in order to
                                safeguard Trionic’s rights and interests. Trionic informed about this in the same way as

                                in the case of anti-fraud.

                                 Applicable provisions, etc.

## Article 6(1) of the GDPR contains a list of possible legal bases for processing of

                                 personal data. One of the legal bases set out in this paragraph must be applicable in
                                 order for the processing to be lawful. The points applicable in the case are points
                                 6(1)(c) and (f).

                                 According to Article 6(1)(c), processing is lawful if it is necessary for the performance
                                 of a legal obligation incumbent the controller.

                                 In order for processing to be based on Article 6(1)(f), all three conditions provided

                                 therein must be fulfilled, namely, firstly, that the controller or third party has a legitimate
                                 interest (legitimate interest), secondly that the processing is necessary for purposes of
                                 legitimate interest (necessary) and third that the interests or fundamental rights and

                                 freedoms of the data subject do not weigh heavier and require the protection of
                                 personal data (balance of interest).

                                 Recital 47 of the GDPR states that processing of personal data strictly necessary for
                                 the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data
4 controller concerned. Furthermore, the Article 29 Working Party has previously stated
                                 that preventing abuse is a legitimate interest under the corresponding rules of the
                                 previously applicable Data Protection Directive, as long as the interest is "acceptable
5 under the law" in the broadest sense of the term.

                                 Article 13 sets out the information to be provided by the controller to the data subject
                                 where the personal data are collected from the data subject. Under Article 13(1)(e) the
                                 controller shall provide the data subject with information on the recipients or categories

                                 of recipients of the personal data. According to Article 4(9), the term “recipient” means
                                 for an example a natural or legal person to whom the personal data are disclosed,
                                 whether a third party or not.

                                 Trionic stats that the sending of the complainant’s order confirmation to the info-e-mail
                                 address — which was a different e-mail address from the one that the complainant
                                 filled in — was made on the basis of a legal obligation. The obligation is to comply with

                                 the obligation under Article 5(1)(d) GDPR to take all reasonable steps to ensure that
                                 personal data that are inaccurate in relation to the purposes for which they are

                                 processed are deleted or rectified without delay.

                                Date:2022-10-10

                                IMY notes that although Article 5(1)(d) constitutes a legal obligation for Trionic, it only
                                permits the processing of personal data that is necessary. IMY observes that there
                                were less coercive measures which the company could have taken that would have

                                led to a lower risk of unauthorised disclosure of the complainant's data. For example,
                                Trionic could have sent the order to the stated e-mail address and consider further
                                measures, for example, if the company received an automatic e-mail server response

                                that the message could not be delivered. The company could also have, for example,
                                refrained from processing the order until the complainant contacted them again, send
                                a regular letter to the address filled in by the complainant or send a fax to the fax

                                number indicated. IMY therefore concludes that the processing was not necessary and
                                that the company did not demonstrated that the processing could be based on this
                                legal basis.

                                Since it has not been established that Trionic had any other legal basis for the
                                processing, the company has therefor processed the complainant’s personal data in

                                breach of Article 6(1) and thus not met the requirement to have a legal basis for the
                                processing.

                                Legal basis for disclosure to combat fraud
                                The investigation shows that Trionic has disclosed the complainant's personal data to
                                a provider offering anti-fraud services. Trionic argues that the processing had a legal

                                basis in the company’s legitimate interest in preventing fraud, i.e. Article 6(1)(f) of the
                                GDPR.

                                IMY notes that it is therefore necessary for the company to be able to demonstrate that
                                three conditions are met:

                                     •   there are one or more legitimate interests

                                     •   the processing of personal data is necessary for a purpose relating to the
                                         legitimate interests
                                     •   the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects do not

                                         outweigh the company’s legitimate interests (balance of interests).

                                IMY notes that what may be a legitimate interest should be interpreted broadly. The

                                decisive factor is whether the interest is permitted by law or otherwise generally
                                recognised in the rule of law. Insignificant interests do not weigh as heavily as
                                important or compelling interests, but are important only in the balancing of interests.

                                However, if an interest is not justified and legitimate, the balancing of interests shall
                                not be carried out, as the initial threshold of this legal basis will not be reached.

                                It must also be an actual interest at the time of the processing and not an interest
                                which is hypothetical at that time. If there are evidence that the interest is not
                                hypothetical, the condition is satisfied, but it may also be sufficient that the interest

                                typically appears to be factual.

                                IMY finds that the interest presented by Trionic — to prevent fraud — was justified (cf.

                                recital 47 of the GDPR) and actual at the time of processing.

                                IMY notes that the requirement of necessity means that the interests which the

                                processing is intended to protect could not reasonably be protected in an equally
                                effective manner by other means less intrusive on the fundamental rights and
                                freedoms of data subjects. The condition must be examined together with the principlePrivacy Protection Authority    Our ref: DI-2021-3399                                                                   8(11)

                                of data minimisation which means, among other things, that personal data should not
                                be processed unnecessarily.

                                According to IMY, the processing — the disclosure of the data to the anti-fraud service
                                provider — was necessary in order to fulfil the purpose which Trionic could not
                                reasonably fulfil in an equally effective manner by, for example, carrying out such an

                                assessment itself. This assessment also considers the fact that the disclosure was not
                                too extensive or privacy sensitive in itself.

                                IMY notes that the third condition under Article 6(1)(f), balancing of interests, is carried
                                out by making an overall assessment, considering in particular:

                                     •   the seriousness of the violation that the processing entails for the data subject
                                     •   what data subjects reasonably can expect in that situation and
                                     •   what security measures have been taken.

                                When balancing the company's legitimate interests on one hand against the
                                complainant's interests, rights and freedoms on the other, IMY finds that the

                                company's interests weighs heavily especially considering it is a credit purchase. This
                                must be weighed against the complainant’s interest in not having their data processed
                                or not risking being denied the purchase of the credit.

                                The processing appears, in IMY’s view, to be something that the complainant could
                                reasonably expect when making a credit purchase on invoice, despite the minor

                                deficiencies in the information identified below by IMY in relation to the information
                                provided on that category of recipients of the data. With regard to the seriousness of
                                the violation, IMY finds that the processing does not appear to be highly violating of
                                privacy and that the data itself is not privacy sensitive. When it comes to protective

                                measures, there has been no evidence of relevance for the assessment in this case.

                                In an overall assessment IMY finds that the company has shown that the

                                complainant’s interests or fundamental rights and freedoms do not outweigh the
                                company's legitimate interests for the processing.

                                In conclusion, the company has demonstrated that the conditions laid down in Article
                                6(1)(f) are met and the company therefore had a legal basis for the processing.

                                Legal basis for the processing and storage of IP address prior to cancellation
                                Trionic states that it processed and stored the complainant’s IP address prior to
                                cancellation on the basis of the legitimate interests of (1) preventing fraud and (2)

                                being able to establish and enforce legal interests.

                                IMY has already considered that the disclosure of, inter alia, the complainant’s IP

                                number in order to prevent fraud had a legal basis. There has been no reason to make
                                any other assessment regarding Trionic’s own continued processing and storage of
                                that information before the complainant cancelled their order.

                                Furthermore, IMY considers that there were no grounds for calling into question the
                                legality of Trionic’s processing before the cancellation was made in order for Trionic to

                                be able to establish and enforce legal claims.

                                The processing of the complainant's IP number therefore had a legal basis.Privacy Protection Authority    Our ref: DI-2021-3399                                                                   9(11)
                                Date:2022-10-10

                                Legal basis for processing and storing IP address after cancellation
                                Trionic states that the complainant’s IP address was also saved for a certain period
                                after the order was cancelled, on the basis of its legitimate interest of being able to

                                establish and enforce legal claims. However, the data was deleted after the
                                complainant's request.

                                In view of the fact that Trionic deleted the data in response to the complainant’s
                                request and thereby satisfied the complainant’s rights, IMY considers that the subject
                                matter of the complaint has been examined to the extent appropriate. IMY does not

                                therefore investigate whether Trionics had a legal basis for storing the complainant’s
                                IP number after the cancellation or whether the company’s general storage periods are
                                well balanced.

                                Easily accessible information to the data subject
                                It is apparent from the company’s own information that, at the time of the complaint,

                                two clicks were required for the complainant (considering the links the complainant
                                chose to fallow) to be able to access Trionic’s privacy policy on its website. The
                                investigation also shows that the information was accessible on the website with fewer

                                clicks (one) in two other ways.

                                Against this background, and the fact that Trionic also has taken steps to ensure that

                                the policy requires only one click, IMY considers that the subject matter of the
                                complaint in this part has been investigated to the extent appropriate.

                                Information to the data subject on the processing for the purposes of combating
                                fraud and storage of IP address
                                The investigation shows that Trionic has disclosed the complainant’s data to a supplier
                                for the purpose of combating fraud. In order to comply with the obligation to provide

                                information to the complainant, Trionic had indicated in its privacy policy at the time
                                that personal data could be passed on to ‘external resources’. Trionic has now
                                changed this information so that it is explicitly stated that personal data may be

                                disclosed to companies that analyse the fraud risk of credit purchases.

                                IMY considers that the information provided to the complainant — “external resources”

                                — was not sufficiently specific to meet the requirement of Article 13(1)(e) GDPR to
                                inform the data subject about the recipient (the actual provider) or the categories of
                                recipients (anti-fraud service providers) who would receive the personal data in the

                                case. Trionic therefore infringed Article 13(1)(e).

                                Searching for the complainant’s data on search engines

                                The complainant has stated that Trionic has searched contact details on a search
                                engine and gathered them together with the complainant’s data. The statement was
                                rejected as by Trionic.

                                IMY considers that there has been no reason to question the company’s statement.
                                The investigation in the case does not therefore show that Trionic has processed the

                                complainant’s personal data in breach of the General Data Protection Regulation in
                                this part.

                                Choice of corrective measure

                                It follows from Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83(2) of the GDPR that the IMY has the

                                power to impose administrative fines in accordance with Article 83. Depending on thePrivacy Protection Authority    Our ref: DI-2021-3399                                                                 10(11)

                                circumstances of the case, administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or in
                                place of the other measures referred to in Article 58(2), such as injunctions and

                                prohibitions. Furthermore, Article 83(2) provides which factors are to be taken into
                                account when deciding on administrative fines and in determining the amount of the

                                fine. In the case of a minor infringement, as stated in recital 148, IMY may, instead of
                                imposing a fine, issue a reprimand pursuant to Article 58(2)(b). Factors to consider are
                                the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, such as the nature, gravity

                                and duration of the infringement and past relevant infringements.

                                IMY notes the following relevant facts. The violations have affected one person, the

                                personal data in question was not privacy-sensitive and the company has not
                                previously been found to have infringed the GDPR. Furthermore, Trionic Sverige AB
                                has improved its information to data subjects and acted in response to the complaint.

                                Against this background IMY considers that it is a minor infringement within the
                                meaning of recital 148 and that Trionic Sverige AB must be given a reprimand

                                pursuant to Article 58(2)(b) of the GDPR.

                                This decision has been made by the specially appointed decision-maker

                                after presentation by legal advisor               .Privacy Protection Authority     Our ref: DI-2021-3399                                                                   11(11)
                                 Date:2022-10-10
