## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject exercised its right to be forgotten on 19 June 2022, but the controller didn’t provide an answer. On 8 August 2022, the data subject filed a complaint at the Belgium DPA for the lack of an answer to the request.

### Holding

The DPA held that the data subject had exercised its right to be forgotten according to [Article 17(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1 "Article 17 GDPR") and had done so in a way as described in the privacy policy of the controller. Since the controller did not provide an answer at all, the DPA held that it had violated [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR") (the controller failed to answer within a month), [Article 12(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#4 "Article 12 GDPR") (The controller failed to provide a reason why it did not comply with the request) and [Article 17(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1 "Article 17 GDPR"). The DPA held that the controller had to comply with the request of the data subject and ordered the controller to delete the personal data within 30 days, based on [Article 58(2)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2c "Article 58 GDPR") and Article 95 §1,5 WOG. The DPA also held that the controller had notify the DPA within 30 days about the result of this decision.

File number : DOS-2022-03284

Subject: Exercising the right to erasure without informing the defendant

follows

The Disputes Chamber of the Data Protection Authority, composed of Mr Hielke Hijmans,
single chairperson;

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council of 27 April 2016 on

the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and

on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General
Data Protection Regulation), hereinafter GDPR;

Having regard to the law of 3 December 2017 establishing the Data Protection Authority, hereinafter WOG;

Having regard to the internal rules of procedure, as approved by the Chamber of Representatives

on December 20, 2018 and published in the Belgian Official Gazette on January 15, 2019;

Having regard to the documents in the file;

has taken the following decision regarding:

. The complainant: Mr X, hereinafter referred to as “the complainant”; .
. The Defendant: Y, hereinafter referred to as “the Defendant”. Decision 137/2021 - 2/5

I. Facts procedure

    1. On 8 August 2022, the complainant lodged a complaint with the Data Protection Authority against

        the defendant.

    2. On June 19, 2022, the complainant addressed the defendant with a request for the

        delete personal data pursuant to Article 17.1 GDPR, in accordance with .'s privacy policy

        the defendant. On August 8, 2022, the complainant has not yet received a reply from the defendant in
        in connection with the request for erasure. Following on from this, the

        complainant lodged a complaint with the Data Protection Authority.

    3. On April 22, 2022, the complaint will be declared admissible by the Frontline Service on the basis of the

        Articles 58 and 60 WOG and the complaint on the basis of art. 62, §1 WOG transferred to the
        Dispute room.

II. Justification

    4. The Disputes Chamber determines on the basis of the documents that substantiate the complaint that the complainant is entitled to

        exercised the erasure of data in accordance with Article 17.1 of the GDPR on June 19, 2022. From the documents accompanying

        the complaint, the Disputes Chamber concludes that the complainant has submitted his request for erasure

        performed as specified in the Defendant's Privacy Policy. Pursuant to Article 12.3 GDPR
        the controller, in this case the defendant, must respond to the request for

        to reply to the deletion of data within one month of receipt of the request. Possibly can

        this period can be extended by a further two months, given the complexity of the

        request. The complainant must then, within one month after the request for the erasure of data about this

        extension to be notified. If the defendant decides not to comply with the

        request of the complainant, it must communicate this within one month of receipt of the request
        to the data subject, in accordance with Article 12.4 GDPR. It is not apparent from the file that the complainant

        answer has been received about the effect that the weather has on the data erasure

        is given. As a result, the controller has acted in violation of Article

        12.3 and 12.4 GDPR, as well as Article 17.1 GDPR.

    5. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that on the basis of the above analysis,

        concluded that an infringement of the provisions of the GDPR was committed by the defendant,

        which justifies the taking of a decision in this case on the basis of

        of Article 95, §1, 5° WOG, in particular to order the defendant to comply with the

        exercise by the complainant of his right to erasure (Article 17.1 GDPR).

    6. The present decision is a prima facie decision taken by the Disputes Chamber

        in accordance with article 95 WOG on the basis of the complaint submitted by the complainant, in the context of Decision 137/2021 - 3/5

1 the ‘procedure prior to the decision on the merits’ and not a decision on the merits of the

        Dispute Chamber within the meaning of Article 100WOG. The Dispute Chamber has thus decided on the grounds

        of Articles 58.2. c) and 95, §1, 5° of the law of December 3, 2017, to order the defendant

        that the data subject's requests to exercise his rights are met, more

        determines the right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) as defined in Article 17 of the GDPR.

    7. The purpose of this decision is to inform the defendant that it is a

        has committed a breach of the provisions of the GDPR and to give them the opportunity to

        to still conform with the aforementioned provisions.

    8. However, if the defendant does not agree with the contents of this prima facie

        decision and is of the opinion that it can assert factual and/or legal arguments that lead to

        could lead to a different decision, this can be done via the e-mail address litigationchamber@apd-

        gba.be submit a request for treatment on the merits of the case to the Disputes Chamber and this

        within 30 days of notification of this decision. The implementation of

        to submit defenses and to attach to the file any documents they deem useful. The
