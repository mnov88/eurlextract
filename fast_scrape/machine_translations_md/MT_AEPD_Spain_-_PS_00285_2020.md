## English Summary

### Facts

A claimant filed a complaint with the DPA to report several infringements of the GDPR coming from the Asturian Handball Federation. They alleged that the federation did not have a DPO, that they did not obtain valid consent from the children above 14 or their parents, nor they verified the legitimacy of such consent, that they were publishing photos of minors without such consent, that they did not inform about the data processed according to Article 13 GDPR and that they made reference in their privacy policy to the old Spanish Data Protection Act.

The Asturian Handball Federation alleged that they had two websites, one with domain .es and another with .com, and that they were coexisting due to an administrative error. The old one was not up-to-date, what is what caused the reference to the old Data Protection Act and the fact that they had non-updated forms for gathering data.

Additionally, the federation appointed a DPO during the course of these proceedings and amended their privacy policy to include everything that Article 13 requires.

### Dispute

Did the Asturian Handball Federation incur in any violation of GDPR given these facts?

### Holding

The AEPD held that the federation had violated Article 37 GDPR for not having appointed a DPO. They also held that the federation had violated Article 13 for not having provided in their privacy policy the mandatory information provided by the GDPR.

For both these violations, the AEPD issued a warning.

However, the AEPD held that there was no violation regarding consent due to the fact that it is a public federation that, according to the law, processes the data that the sports clubs collect, and that therefore the obligations regarding consent lay on such clubs.

                                             II
In the present case, it was claimed that the Handball Federation of the Principality of
Asturias did not comply with the provisions of current regulations on data protection of
personal character, lacking a Data Protection Delegate (DPD) and when dealing with data
personal coughs of underage players, including their images, without the precepti-

vo consent of parents or guardians.

As stated in the brief initiating the file, on the use of
the personal data of underage players, including images of the players
themselves, without the mandatory consent of their parents or guardians, indicate that

corresponding authority, who must have collected the prior consent of the
gator or, where appropriate, the parent or guardian so that said treatment is lawful.

As regards the second part of the claim, it was verified, by
this Agency that, the forms that existed on the Federation's website made
reference to the repealed LOPD, however, once the sanctioning proceedings have been initiated
dor and after receiving the appropriate allegations from the Federation it was found that,
they had been conveniently modified, adapting them to current legislation.

Regarding the existence or not of the privacy policy of the website
of the Federation, it was found that, on its official page, \*\*\* URL.1; exists
a link, at the bottom, << privacy policy >> that redirects to a new page
gina \*\*\* URL.2, in which information is provided in accordance with those stipulated in the article

## Article 13 of the GDPR.

Regarding the complaint that the Federation had not appointed a Delegate of
Data Protection, indicate in this regard that, in the letter of allegations to the inco-
action of the file, the Federation informs this Agency that on 07/16/20
proceeded to designate a Data Protection Delegate, attaching proof of

said designation.

In view of the above, on the part of the Director of the Protection Agency of Da-
