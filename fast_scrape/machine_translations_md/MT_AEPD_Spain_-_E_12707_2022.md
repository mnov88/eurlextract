The reported facts materialize in that the notification carried out was
considers that it has violated the regulations on the protection of personal data by containing, together with the report of the complaint relating to the accused, a document containing third-party data.
## Article 58 of the GDPR, Powers, states:

"2. Each supervisory authority will have all of the following corrective powers
indicated below:
(...) b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of processing with a warning when processing operations have infringed the provisions of this Regulation;
(...).”
III
Firstly, such processing could constitute a violation of article
5, Principles relating to processing, of the GDPR which establishes that: “1. The personal data will be:
(...) f) processed in such a way as to ensure adequate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, through the application of appropriate technical or organizational measures ("integrity and confidentiality»).
(...)”
IV
Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD considers that the violation of “the basic principles for
The treatment, including the conditions for consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable.
For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 71, Infringements, states that: “The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 constitute infringements, as well as the that are contrary to this organic law.”
Also the LOPDGDD, for the purposes of prescription, in its article 72 indicates: “Infringements considered very serious:
1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infractions that involve a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following, are considered very serious and will expire after three years:
a) The processing of personal data violating the principles and guarantees established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
(...)”
V
1. The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the
claimed, violated article 5 of the RGPD, principles relating to processing, by allowing the

5/11
 access to personal data belonging to third parties by sending attached to the notification of the report of the complaint a list of names and surnames of 17 interested parties along with the corresponding record number.
The duty of confidentiality must be understood as having the purpose of preventing data leaks not permitted by the data owners.
The defendant himself has stated that the cause of the incident was “a regrettable human error at the time of photocopying the documents that should accompany the notifications of agreement to initiate the different sanctioning procedures. Obviously, the intention of the staff of this Department was in no case to reveal personal data to third parties not interested in each of the notified sanctioning procedures, nor to cause any harm to those affected, but only to comply with the obligations derived from the administrative procedure. correspondent".
This error caused the notification sent to the claimant to include “a list of names and surnames of 17 other people,..., associated with record numbers...also resulted in the first being sent to one of the interested parties. page of the complaint report corresponding to the claimant, which includes the identifying data of the interested party and the vessel.”
Therefore, the conduct of the defendant is considered to violate the principle of confidentiality, in accordance with the provisions of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, typified in article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned Regulation.
SAW
Secondly, the defendant is attributed with the violation of article 32 of the RGPD
“Safety of treatment” establishes that:
"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of application, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as risks of varying probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and The person in charge of the treatment will apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, which, where appropriate, includes, among others:
a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;
c) the ability to quickly restore availability and access to personal data in the event of a physical or technical incident;
d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of processing.
2. When assessing the adequacy of the level of security, particular account will be taken of the risks presented by data processing, in particular as a consequence of accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or unauthorized communication or access to said data.
3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or to a certification mechanism approved pursuant to Article 42 may serve as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.
4. The controller and the processor will take measures to ensure that any person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor and has access
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es 28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es

6/11
 to personal data may only process such data following instructions from the controller, unless it is obliged to do so under Union or Member State law.
VII
The violation of article 32 of the RGPD is classified in article 83.4.a)
of the aforementioned RGPD in the following terms:
"4. Infringements of the following provisions shall be punished, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 10 000 000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the total annual overall turnover of the previous financial year, opting for the highest amount:
a) the obligations of the controller and the processor in accordance with articles 8, 11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43.
(...)”
For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 71, Infringements, states that: “The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 constitute infringements, as well as the that are contrary to this organic law.”
And in its article 73, for the purposes of prescription, it qualifies as “Infringements considered serious”:
“Based on what is established in article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infractions that involve a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following, are considered serious and will expire after two years:
(...) g) The failure, as a consequence of the lack of due diligence, of the technical and organizational measures that had been implemented in accordance with the requirements of article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”
(...)”
VIII
1. The GDPR defines personal data security breaches as “any
those security violations that cause the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed, or unauthorized communication or access to said data.
The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the defendant has violated article 32.1 of the RGPD, when a security incident occurred, violating the established technical and organizational measures.
It should be noted that the RGPD in the aforementioned precept does not establish a list of the security measures that are applicable according to the data that are subject to processing, but rather establishes that the person responsible and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and organizational measures. that are appropriate to the risk involved in the processing, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of application, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, the probability and seriousness of the risks for the rights and freedoms of the interested parties. .
Likewise, security measures must be appropriate and proportionate to the risk detected, noting that the determination of technical and organizational measures must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymization and encryption, the ability to
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es 28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es

7/11
 guarantee confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience, the ability to restore availability and access to data after an incident, verification process (not audit), evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the measures.
In any case, when evaluating the adequacy of the level of security, particular consideration will be given to the risks presented by data processing, as a consequence of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed. or unauthorized communication or access to said data that could cause physical, material or immaterial damage.
In this same sense, recital 83 of the GDPR states that:
“(83) In order to maintain security and prevent processing from violating the provisions of this Regulation, the controller or processor must assess the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate them, such as encryption. These measures must ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of their implementation with respect to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected. When assessing risk in relation to data security, you should take into account the risks arising from the processing of personal data, such as accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. form, or unauthorized communication or access to said data, which may in particular cause physical, material or immaterial damage and harm.”
2. In the present case, as recorded in the file, the AEPD transferred the claim presented to the defendant so that he could proceed with its analysis and inform this Agency of the actions carried out to adapt to the requirements set forth in the regulations for the protection of data.
The defendant, as already indicated in the previous basis, has confirmed that due to a regrettable human error at the time of photocopying the documents that should accompany the notifications of agreement to initiate the different sanctioning procedures, the following occurred:
“- in one case, a list of minutes that should not have been included in the documentation sent together with the Agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure and
- in another case, the first page of the report corresponding to another interested party was sent to one of the interested parties.”
It should be noted that the responsibility of the claimant is determined by the security incident revealed by the claimant, as no measures have been adopted to avoid errors such as the one produced, since he is responsible for making decisions aimed at effectively implementing and adapting the appropriate technical and organizational measures in order to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk, ensuring the confidentiality of the data, restoring its availability and preventing access to it in the event of a physical or technical incident.
In accordance with the above, it is estimated that the defendant would be allegedly responsible for the violation of the RGPD: the violation of article 32, an infringement classified in article 83.4.a).
IX
The LOPDGDD in its article 77, Regime applicable to certain categories of
responsible or in charge of the treatment, establishes the following:
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es 28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es

b) The jurisdictional bodies.
c) The General Administration of the State, the Administrations of the autonomous communities and the entities that make up the Local Administration.
