The Spanish DPA held that the use of a doorbell camera did not constitute processing of neighbors' personal data, but it cautioned that the device must be used like a traditional peephole and not as video surveillance.

## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject complained to the Spanish DPA that a neighbor in their building had installed a doorbell camera that captured part of a common area. They did not know what their neighbor did with the recorded images but worried their 16-year-old daughter and another neighbor's 10-year-old grandson being recorded on the way to lay out or hang laundry on the landing.

The owner of the camera claimed to have installed it in response to their door being vandalized, and the complainant themselves acknowledged that the door had suffered various scratches.

### Holding

The DPA held that there was no data processing in the facts presented and that intervention would only be necessary if improper use of the recordings infringed on data privacy rights. The DPA analogized the doorbell camera to a traditional front door peephole, noting that such peepholes are not generally seen as invasive. Because there was no expectation of privacy in the common area immediately outside a neighbor’s front door, a doorbell camera was a reasonable and proportional step to deter further vandalism.

The DPA recommended that the neighbors resolve their disagreements according to “the minimum rules of good neighborliness” or else settle them in an appropriate judicial framework.

2021 filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. the re-

outcry is directed against B.B.B. with NIF \*\*\*NIF.1 (hereinafter, the claimed party).
The grounds on which the claim is based are as follows:

hang clothes on the roof”

       “The neighbor across the street has a 10-year-old grandson and I have a 16-year-old daughter.
who goes up to lay out or pick up the clothes. We don't know what exactly he does with the
recorded images” (folio nº 1).

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, of Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
hereinafter LOPDGDD), said claim was transferred to the claimed party in fe-

In accordance with the functions that article 57.1 a), f) and h) of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD) confers
each control authority and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48.1 of the Or-

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The formal procedures
ted by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection will be governed by the provisions of

Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the regulatory provisions
dictated in its development and, as long as they do not contradict them, with a sub-
sidiario, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

In the present case, the claim dated 12/06/21 is examined by me-
gave from which the following is transferred as the main fact:

       “…a peephole of the make and model has been installed: EZVIZ DP1C. We have
evidence that he uses it to record and know which neighbors go up to the landing or to

hanging clothes on the roof” (folio nº 1).

       The facts are therefore concretized in the presence of a digital peephole that
According to the claimant's statement, it is used "to record and know who is close to
his door according to comments from the defendant himself.

The above facts may constitute a presumed infringement of art. 5.1
c) RGPD, which provides: “Personal data will be:

       c) adequate, pertinent and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes
for which they are processed (“data minimization”) (…)”.

       It should be noted that the device (digital peephole) is installed on the door pro-
property of the defendant and not in a common area, which is why it differs from other cases analysed.

       The use of the installed devices must be carried out in accordance with the purpose of

       In the written claim itself it is made clear that the door of the
