## English Summary

### Facts

The electoral roll list was sent to political parties. The lists were updated up until a deadline. Persons who had objected to being on the lists within the deadline were removed from the list. The AEPD noted that the right to object to processing following Article 21 is not absolute. The data may still be processed if the controller can demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground to continue the processing. The AEPD noted that the deadline set out by national law (LOREG) was one such legitimate ground.

### Dispute

The question for the AEPD was if the claimant had registered his objection to the processing of his personal data within the deadline set out by law.

### Holding

The AEPD found that as the claimant did not register his objection within the deadline, the PSOE was not in breach of the GDPR or national legislation by sending political advertisement to his address.
