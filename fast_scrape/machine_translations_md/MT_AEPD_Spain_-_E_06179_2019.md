### Holding

Thus, with basis on the GDPR definition of personal data breach, the AEPD understood that Telefónica has complied with is personal data obligations and decided not to take further actions, according to these facts: (1) there is no proof that the affected data has been accessed by third parties, (2) the data controller complied with reasonable and adequate technical and organizational security measures, (3) the data controller has internal procedures that allowed a quick reaction, (4) complaints from possible affected subjects have not been received, (5) the data controller drafted a final report on the event traceability and value analysis that will be extremely useful to prevent further breaches.
