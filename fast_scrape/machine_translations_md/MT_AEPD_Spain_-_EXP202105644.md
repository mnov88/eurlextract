## English Summary

### Facts

A customer (data subject) of Naturgy Energy Group, a gas and electricity supplier (controller) discovered that her email address registered with the controller had been changed by a third party. This third party also asked the controller to send him two of the data subjects invoices.

After the data subject became aware of this change, she filed a complaint with the controller. However, the controller stated it did nothing wrong, as it asked the questions necessary according to its security policy. The third party identified himself as a relative of the data subject and provided the controller with the data subject's name, ID number, address, the last four digits of her bank account and her contract reference number.

Therefore, the data subject filed a complaint with the DPA against the controller for changing her contract data without her consent, in particular her email address.

### Holding

The DPA stated that despite the security measures mentioned, the controller ended up sending two invoices to the email address of someone claiming to have some kind of relationship with the data subject. The DPA held that the controller therefore violated [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") (principle of integrity and confidentiality).

The DPA followed that the security measures in place were evidently not enough to prevent the events mentioned above. It held that the controller also violated [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") by failing to adopt the necessary security measures to guarantee the protection of the data subjects personal data.

The DPA fined the controller €80,000: €50,000 for the violation of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") and €30,000 for the violation of [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

The original fine of €80,000 was reduced to €48,000 due to voluntary payment and admission of responsibility.

FIRST: A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claimant party) dated November 4,

2021 filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

The claim is directed against the company COMERCIALIZADORA REGULADA GAS
& POWER, S.A., belonging to NATURGY ENERGY GROUP, S.A. with NIF
A08015497 (hereinafter, the claimed party), of which the claimant is a client.

The claimant has become aware that a third party has used her data
personal to change the email and request that they send two invoices

change was made by telephone, providing the name of this third party, and

indicating that they had done the right thing since the caller provided
the name, DNI, address and contract reference of the claimant.

Therefore, the reason on which you base your claim is the change in your
contract with the claimed entity, specifically your email without your

consent.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/10

Together with the notification, the emails exchanged with the
claimed stating the facts, as well as a response to them, detailing in
one of them the name of the person who called (which does not match the name of the

claimant) and the email provided.

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, of Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
hereinafter LOPDGDD), on December 27, 2021, said communication was
claim to the claimed party, so that it proceeded to its analysis and inform the

this Agency within a month, of the actions carried out to adapt to
the requirements set forth in the data protection regulations.

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of
October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Administrations

Public (hereinafter, LPACAP), was collected on December 28, 2021 as
It is stated in the acknowledgment of receipt that is in the file.

On January 27, 2022, this Agency received a written response from the
claimed entity indicating the following:
“On October 4, 2021, the Comercializadora customer service

Regulada received a call from a person who identified himself as a “family member” of the
claimant, and indicated that he wished to request a duplicate of the last invoice of the
electricity supply corresponding to the claimant's supply point,
providing an email address for the invoice to be sent.

To be able to carry out the requested procedures, it is necessary to overcome the policy of
security of the Regulated Marketer, for which the person who
calls certain information of the holder of the supply contracts that only
should know said owner or person authorized by it.

The Submitter had all the information necessary to overcome the policy of
security and carry out the procedures requested. Thus, specifically, it provided the name and
surnames, as well as the DNI of the claimant and also the last four digits of the
claimant's bank account.

All these data and, in particular, the last four digits of the account number

bank, constitute information that only the Claimant should know.

In fact, those last four digits of the bank account constitute a
information that is not even visible in the documents that Comercializadora
Regulada generates for its clients, since they always appear hidden, both in the

invoices and through the Private Area, as a security measure.”

For all these reasons, the respondent entity considers that its action has been in all
time diligent and adjusted to law.

THIRD: On February 4, 2022, in accordance with article 65 of the
LOPDGDD, the claim filed by the claimant was admitted for processing.
