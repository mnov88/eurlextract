### Facts

Due to formal reasons, the Spanish Data Protection Authority (AEPD) decided to admit a claim against Asturias Healthcare System (the controller) for not satisfying a data subject's access request to medical records of data subject’s deceased mother, but without any economic fine nor warning, because, during the AEPD's investigation process, such right of access was finally fulfilled by the public administration.

### Dispute

Might be a request of access considered as duly fulfilled by the controller when it was not attended in due time and proper course?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA held that the access request was properly fulfilled, in spite of being properly attended after claim admission, so it decided not to impose any fine nor warning to the defendant.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/8

 "one. The medical history will incorporate the information that is considered transcendental for
accurate and up-to-date knowledge of the patient's health status. All patient or
User has the right to be recorded, in writing or in the technical support more

these rights. " Consequently, the respondent has the legal obligation to deliver to
the complaining party copies their entire medical record.

In the case analyzed here, the complaining party exercised its right of access to its
clinical history, and that, after the period established in accordance with the rules before

indicated, your request did not obtain the legally required response, since the access
granted was incompletely produced.

However, the foregoing, once the claim raised by the
complaining party, the complained party provides the documentation proving the communication

object of transfer to the complaining party, by postal notification, without there being any
presented any allegation against it, therefore, with the measures adopted
by the person in charge, the rights of the affected party are duly restored.

Consequently, the present claim must be upheld for formal reasons at
