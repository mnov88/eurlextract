An Austrian Court upheld a decision of the Austrian DPA affirming that the publication of personal data without given consent on the controllers’ websites for advertising purposes was contrary to [Article 6(1) GDPR.](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR")

## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject was marksmen from 2012 until about 2017 and participated in competitions. Controller 1 (first appellant in the present case) operates a website that offered shooting accessories and lessons. Controller 2 (second appellant in the present case) also operates a website where they added blogposts concerning these competitions and offered shooting lessons including advertisement for a company.

Several reports by the two controllers, published on their respective websites, included an image and the name (and nickname) of the data subject. However, the data subject had never explicitly consented to this publication nor was there a contractual agreement at any time. The publications were mainly for advertising purposes.

Controller 1 issued two of the reports in question; on 30 July 2015 and on 9 November 2015. Controller 2 published the other two reports, namely on 10 August 2016 and on 18 September 2016.

The controllers took down the reports in September 2018 and November 2018, respectively. On 17 February 2019, the data subject filed two complaints before the DSB (Austria) for infringement of their fundamental right to data protection by the two controllers.

The DSB joined the two cases in its decision of 13 July 2020 accepting the complaint and deciding in favour of the data subject: According to this decision, controller 1 unlawfully processed the data subject’s personal data from 9 November 2015 until 30 September 2018. Controller 2 unlawfully processed the same data from 10 August 2016 until November 2018. Both controllers appealed against this decision before the Austrian Federal Administrative Court (_Bundesverwaltungsgericht - BVwG_), claiming that their activities were covered by the media exception of [§ 9(1) Austrian Data Protection Act](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/NormDokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10001597&Artikel=2&Paragraf=9&Anlage=&Uebergangsrecht=) (_Datenschutzgesetz - DSG_).

### Holding

First, the BVwG considered the application of [§ 9(1) DSG](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/NormDokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10001597&Artikel=2&Paragraf=9&Anlage=&Uebergangsrecht=), which provides for a broad nonapplication of GDPR provisions (among others), notably [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"), which deals with the lawfulness of processing (“Medienprivileg”). The court, making reference to [CJEU C-73/07](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C-73/07_-_Satamedia "CJEU - C-73/07 - Satamedia"), held that personal data is processed for journalistic purposes if the processing has the sole purpose of disseminating information, opinions or ideas to the public. Since in this case there was at least an element of advertisement in each of the publications, the BVwG held that [§ 9(1) DSG](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/NormDokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10001597&Artikel=2&Paragraf=9&Anlage=&Uebergangsrecht=) was not applicable.

Then, the BVwG assessed the lawfulness of processing in light of Article 6(1) GDPR.

First of all, the court noted that none of the controllers could provide with a substantive argument or proof that the processing of data took place on the basis of consent by the data subject under [Article 6(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1a "Article 6 GDPR").

Hence, pursuant to [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"), the court further examined whether processing was necessary for the purposes of the controllers’ legitimate interest. It confirmed that making available to the public their reports on shooting competitions represents a legitimate interest for processing of personal data, however, the court pointed out that none of the four reports constituted an exercise of their right to freedom of expression and information. The reports were not issued as a contribution to a debate of general interest, but, in fact, merely for the purpose of promoting the company of controller 1 and another company as far as controller 2 is concerned. Thus, the controllers could also not rely on [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") as a legal basis for processing the data subject's personal data.

As a result, the court held that the publication of personal data in the reports was unlawful and that both controllers infringed the data subject’s right to confidentiality.

contribute to a debate of general interest is downright absurd. In addition, be
the incriminated contribution is completely true, since the co-involved actually dated 2015

was sponsored by the first complainant's company. It is therefore one

clear predominance of the first complainant's interests in freedom of
expression of opinion. The second complainant has already stated in his statement

dated May 9, 2019, that he had only been active in business since XXXX and before

The co-involved party made XXXX T-shirts with the inscription XXXX out of his own hands

the complainants' preparatory brief and the one since December 17, 2019

The authority concerned submitted the complaint along with the administrative act

2. Assessment of evidence:

The facts established above arise, among other things, from the administrative act submitted and

among other things, from the evidence listed in brackets.

The second complainant himself stated during the oral hearing that

that he wrote the contributions in question and is solely responsible for them

was (negotiation document, page 14: “VR: Who was the owner of the homepage at the time of

Reasons to doubt this argument.

That the designation XXXX is not an official designation of the co-participant and this or

That the first complainant submitted the contribution of July 30, 2015 and the report on the

The same applies to the second complainant's report of August 10, 2016
about the results of the XXXX. It only reports on the results of the XXXX

The second complainant also reports and explains that the meaning and purpose of the

due to the lack of consent of the co-participant or any other contractual agreement

of the T-shirt? MP: Contributed is an exaggeration. He told me then,

that he sent me a T-shirt and gave it to me.”; to the second complainant:

There was an agreement that I would be part of a team or something similar.”).

to the first complainant:

On the other hand, the first complainant argued throughout the proceedings that:

The co-participants have indeed given their consent to the publication in question
granted and he was also part of the team. He was able to do this throughout the entire process

However, neither make a valid argument nor provide any other evidence.

In particular, it was not possible for him to give his alleged consent to this
present publication concretely and, above all, uniformly. While

whether it would be okay for me if I included him in this XXXX community. \[…\]”). - 14 -

The first complainant conducted further questioning during the oral hearing
Negotiation in turn states that he is the co-participant with those in question

Publications wanted to rehabilitate him and the person involved had him out

requested publication for this reason (negotiation document, page 6: “VR: He has you
also asked to present him as XXXX or as part of your team on your homepage? BF1:

Given these different and vague descriptions, this is not the case

it can be assumed that there is an act of consent by the co-participant in relation to

It should also be taken into account that the first complainant, according to his own statements, 15

must have known about a declaration of consent (negotiation document, page 6:

Against this background, he did not provide a written declaration of consent from the other party involved

According to Section 9 Paragraph 1 DSG, two requirements must be met cumulatively in order to be included in the
privileged scope of application: Firstly, processing must be carried out

It is undisputed that the first complainant submitted the report dated July 30, 2015 (application

hence the media privilege according to the above in relation to this publication

cannot be used under any circumstances.

But also with regard to the other reports here from November 9, 2015

In the matter:

First of all, it should be noted that the co-participant objects to the

It is undisputed that the name of the plaintiff and his picture constitute personal data within the meaning of Art 4 Z 1

you have processed this data in accordance with Art 4 No. 2 GDPR.

Art 6 GDPR regulates the facts that justify the processing of data. The
Complainants rely on the permissible facts of Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letters a and f

GDPR.

According to this provision, the processing is lawful if the data subject

As was established, the complainants were able to do what they claimed

Consent of the co-participant to the publications in question neither - 24 -

prove or make credible. One based on the consent of the co-participant
based authorization for this publication is therefore not possible.

But there are no other reasons for the admissibility of this

Publication recognizable.

According to Art 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR, the processing of personal data is subject to three

cumulative conditions permitted: Firstly, the processing must be carried out

secondly, the processing of personal data must be carried out

Freedom of information arises (again OGH, February 2nd, 2022 m.w.H.).

The possibility must also be taken into account that for processing

The complainants see their legitimate interest in data processing in the fact that they

In principle, these statements cannot be contradicted. How, however

It should be noted that, as has already been stated, this is not a contribution to a debate
of general interest, but solely for the purpose of promoting the company
