## English Summary

### Facts

On 29 December 2023, a complaint was filed with Garante against T.A. Format S.r.l., the publisher of the news platform Telerama News. The complaint highlighted the lack of information regarding data processing on the company’s website (www.trnews.it), in violation of GDPR transparency requirements.

On 16 May 2024, Garante requested the controller to provide clarifications on the complaint, in which they responded claiming that the necessary privacy information was published on the website, but may have been temporarily inaccessible due to technical issues. The website had undergone a complete structural overhaul between late 2023 and May 2024, which could have led to occasional omissions.

On 11 June 2024, Garante formally initiated an investigation, notifying the company of potential violations of [Article 5(1)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"), [Article 12(1)(2)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR"), [Article 13](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") and [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR").

### Holding

During the investigation, the Garante confirmed that as of this date, the website lacked the required privacy notices under [Article 13](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") and [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR"), hindering users' ability to exercise their rights.

Garante issued a formal reprimand to the controller, under [Article 58(2)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2b "Article 58 GDPR"), since the company failled to meet the principles of transparency and fairness under [Article 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"), [Article 12(1)(2)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR"), [Article 13](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") and [Article 14 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR") by not providing users with the required information about data processing on its website for an extended period.

While acknowledging the violations, the Garante also considered mitigating factors, since the company acted promptly to address the issues once it became aware of them, they had no prior violations of data protection laws and the company cooperated throughout the investigation and provided clarifications.

The Garante ordered the inclusion of this case and the adopted measures in its internal registry under [Article 57(1)(u)](/index.php?title=Article_57_GDPR "Article 57 GDPR") of the GDPR. This step ensures that the measures are documented for record-keeping and future reference.

from the end of 2023 to May 2024 the Site was affected by technical-structural problems and was also subjected to a complete restructuring intervention; circumstances that have "made access to users somewhat complicated by not fully providing the information requested";

this state of inaccessibility of the Site has been communicated several times to the entity in charge of managing the related platform, through the opening of multiple reporting tickets indicating various reasons for the error;

the opening of the tickets took place during the period December 2023-May 2024 and, for some reports, also at an earlier time, thus proving the good faith of the Company;

having become aware of the malfunction of the Site, the Company immediately took action to resolve the problems encountered;

this resolution, also aggravated by the restructuring of the Site, required a prolonged timeframe, starting in December 2023 and ending in June 2024;
