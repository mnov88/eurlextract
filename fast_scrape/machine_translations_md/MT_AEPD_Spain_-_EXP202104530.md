## English Summary

### Facts

A.A.A. (data subject) received a commercial SMS from BOOKSY INTERNATIONAL SPOLKA, S.L. (the assumed controller) to their mobile number without being customer nor consent. On 11 October 2021, the data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA against the controller. The data subject stated that they were not familiar with the controller and justified their registration on the Robinson List. Furthermore they provided a screenshot of an SMS received as evidence.

The complaint was transferred to the controller for analysis and a response within one month. The controller did not reply. On 11 January 2022, the complaint was admitted for processing. On 15 March 2022, the DPA initiated a disciplinary proceeding against the controller for the alleged infringement of Article 21 LSSI, as defined in Article 38(4)(d) LSSI. The controller reacted to the allegations with a written statement, saying that they are a service provider to beauty establishments, like SHEILA NAILS (controller) offering them platform to promote their services. They claim to be a processor and not responsible for the data subjects data.

On 27 April 2022 a motion for resolution was formulated, proposing that the DPA sanctions the processor with a fine of €500 for the violation of Article 21 of the LSSI.

On 11 May 2022, the processor submitted additional allegations defending their position as data processor, arguing that the data subject is not their customer and they are not responsible for the actions of the data controller. The processor proved that it has compiled at all times with the data protection regulations, particularly with [Article 28 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR "Article 28 GDPR").

### Holding

The Director of the Spanish DPA issued a resolution based on the evidence presented by both parties. The DPA upheld the company's claim that it was processor and not controller. Therefore, the Spanish DPA decided to archive the proceedings and notify this resolution to the data subject and processor. The parties have the right to file an optional appeal for reconsideration with the Spanish DPA within one month from date of notification. They could also directly appeal to the Administrative Court of the National Court (Sala de lo Contencioso-administrativo de la Audiencia Nacional) within 2 months from date of notification.
