## English Summary

### Facts

Over the course of over two years, a number of data subjects was affected by personal data breaches in the form of unauthorised replacements of their SIM cards (SIM swap) and other procedures (e.g. call diversion, issuance of new telephone numbers) by third parties. Vodafone PANAFON S.A. (the controller) would comply with the request to change SIM cards by unauthorised third parties despite allegedly having carried out an identity check to rule out fraudulent behaviour.

The data subjects filed a complaint with the Greek DPA, claiming that the controller did not have appropriate security measures in place to prevent such data breaches from happening. The DPA carried out an investigation into the controller's technical and organisational measures. After the first incidents, the controller had implemented a series of new policies to its security measures as a result of the data breaches, including electronic authentication of a customer via a governmental website using verification or QR codes, a new e-fraud methodology, audits for customer service and training for the staff.

### Holding

First, the Greek DPA recalled that the controller, as a mobile service provider, was processing personal data, in line with the definition of [Article 4(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR"). In accordance with [Article 5(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"), the controller had an obligation to demonstrate compliance with the data processing principles, including lawfulness, transparency, integrity and confidentiality.

Second, the DPA recalled that [Article 12(1) of Law 3471/06](https://www.informatica-juridica.com/anexos/law-3471-2006-protection-of-personal-data-and-privacy-in-the-electronic-telecommunications-sector-and-amendment-of-law-2472-1997/), implementing the [e-Privacy Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058), obliges the controller to take appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to protect the security of its services and the public electronic communications network. The DPA held that the controller failed to implement sufficient policies and security measures in the SIM card replacement process in order to prevent fraud. Even the additional measures implemented after the first incidents, were not effective in preventing further exploitation of weaknesses in the controller's policy.

Third, the DPA noted that in case of the occurrence of a data breach, the controller was obliged to inform the data subjects and the DPA about it without delay, in accordance with [Article 12(5) of Law 3471/06](https://www.informatica-juridica.com/anexos/law-3471-2006-protection-of-personal-data-and-privacy-in-the-electronic-telecommunications-sector-and-amendment-of-law-2472-1997/). The DPA found a violation of this provision because in at least five incidents, the DPA only became aware of a data breach 2-3 months after it had occurred.

In conclusion, the DPA imposed a €150,000 fine on the controller for the violation of [Article 12 of Law 3471/06](https://www.informatica-juridica.com/anexos/law-3471-2006-protection-of-personal-data-and-privacy-in-the-electronic-telecommunications-sector-and-amendment-of-law-2472-1997/).
