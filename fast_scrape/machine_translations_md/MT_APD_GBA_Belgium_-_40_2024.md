## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject received unsolicited letters from the controller on a regular basis. On 27 July 2023, the data subject requested the controller that his data be deleted and to stop the communications. The data subject alleged that the influx of letters increased after these communications. The data subject lodged a complaint with the Belgian DPA (“APD”) asking them to force the controller to delete their data.

### Holding

[Article 17(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1 "Article 17 GDPR") establishes that under certain conditions, a data subject may obtain the erasure of personal data without undue delay. [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR") specifies this period by indicating that the controller provides information on action taken under a request regarding the data subject’s rights, without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. This period may be extended by two months if necessary. [Article 12(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#4 "Article 12 GDPR") adds that if the controller does not take action, it must inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within one month of receiving the request of the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility of lodging a complaint with the DPA.

In the present case, the APD found that the controller did not respond to the erasure request. Therefore, the DPA concluded that there was a breach of [Articles 12(3)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR"), [12(4)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#4 "Article 12 GDPR") and [17(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1 "Article 17 GDPR") and ordered the controller to proceed with the deletion of the data subject’s data.

## Comment

As this was a prima facie decision, if the controller does not agree with the contents of the decision or believes that it has factual and/or legal arguments that could lead to a different decision, it may submit a request for a hearing to the APD within 30 days of the notification of the decision.

I. Facts and procedure

 1. The subject of the complaint concerns the failure to respond to the complainant's request

       to delete data so that it no longer receives written communication from the

       defendant, being a non-profit organization.

 2. On January 11, 2024, the complainant submits a complaint to the Data Protection Authority

       against the defendant.

       In the complaint, the complainant states that he receives unsolicited letters on a very regular basis

       of the defendant. On July 27, 2023, the complainant wrote to the chairman

       from the defendant asking him to delete his data in order to make these communications

       fuses. The complainant states that the influx of letters continues after this communication

       increased, which is also demonstrated by copies of communications from the

       defendant on dates of August 11, 2023, September 4, 2023, October 18, 2023, 9

       November 2023, December 4, 2023 and December 12, 2023. The complainant asks the GBA between

       to force the defendant to erase his data.

       on the basis of articles 58 and 60 of the WOG and the complaint is filed on the basis of article 62, § 1
2 of the WOG transferred to the Disputes Chamber.

 4. In accordance with Article 95, § 2, 3° of the WOG as well as Article 47 of the internal regulations

       order of the GBA, the parties can request a copy of the file. If one

       both parties wish to make use of the opportunity to consult and

       copying the file, he or she must contact the secretariat of the

       Disputes Chamber, preferably via litigationchamber@apd-gba.be.

II. Justification

 5. Article 17.1 GDPR provides that the data subject of the controller without

       can obtain the deletion of personal data relating to him without unreasonable delay. The

       controller is obliged to process personal data without unreasonable

       delay to erase when the personal data is no longer necessary for the
       purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.

 6. In accordance with Article 12.3 GDPR, the controller shall provide the

       person concerned without delay and in any case within one month of receipt of the request

       pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 GDPR information about the outcome of the request

1In accordance with Article 61 of the WOG, the Disputes Chamber hereby informs the parties that the complaint is admissible
declared.
2In accordance with Article 95, § 2 of the WOG, the Disputes Chamber hereby informs the parties that the file will be sent to
has been transferred to her as a result of this complaint. Decision 40/2024 — 3/6

        is given. Depending on the complexity of the requests and the number of requests

        that period may be extended by a further two months if necessary. The

        the controller shall inform the data subject within one month of receipt of the

        request of such extension.

 7. The Disputes Chamber determines that the complainant is on the basis of the documents supporting the complaint

        exercised the right to erasure of data on July 27, 2023. The Disputes Chamber can

        However, it cannot be determined on the basis of the complaint that the complainant has received an answer. The inde

        documents attached communication from the defendant on the date of August 11, 2023, 4

        September 2023, October 18, 2023, November 9, 2023, December 4, 2023 and December 12

        2023, however, the Disputes Chamber suspects that there has been an infringement against it

        Articles 12.3 and 12.4 GDPR, as well as Article 17.1 GDPR. 4

 8. Based on the above analysis, it could be concluded that the defendant

        has committed an infringement of the provisions of the GDPR, which justifies this in this case

        a decision will be taken on the basis of Article 95, § 1, 5° of the

        WOG, in particular to order the defendant to comply with the exercise by

        has requested that his data be deleted.
