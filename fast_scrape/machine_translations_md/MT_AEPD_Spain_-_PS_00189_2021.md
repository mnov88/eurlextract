## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant has been a victim of identity theft with the data being used to conclude multiple contracts on new telephone lines with Vodafone. Vodafone, however, did not authenticate the complainant's identity but allowed the third party to register new telephone lines in the complainant's name. In this regard, the complainants personal data was incorporated in the information systems of Vodafone without them having legitimately contracted.

### Holding

The DPA found that Vodafone failed to deploy a minimum diligence for verifying the identity of the contracting party, allowing the third party to fraudulently contract with them in the name of the complainant. Therefore, Vodafone had no legal basis to collect and subsequently process the complainant's personal data and violated Article 6(1) GDPR.

Due to the lack of respect for the principle of legality and the aggravating factors of intention and negligence regarding the processing of basic identifiers of the data subject the AEPD determined a fine of €70,000 reduced to €56,000 because of prior voluntary payment by Vodafone.

<<

                            FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                             I

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

                                             II

      The RGPD deals in its article 5 with the principles that must govern the
treatment of personal data and mentions among them that of "legality, loyalty and
transparency". The precept provides:

      "1. The personal data will be:
         a) Treaties in a lawful, loyal and transparent manner in relation to the
             interested party (<< legality, loyalty and transparency >>); "

## Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", details in its section 1 the

cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

        "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:
      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data

      personal for one or more specific purposes;
      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
      pre-contractual;
      (…) "

      The infringement for which the claimed entity is responsible is found
typified in article 83 of the RGPD that, under the heading "General conditions for
the imposition of administrative fines ”, it states:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with

with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

       Organic Law 3/2018, on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions

considered very serious ”provides:

      "1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/8

suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that one and, in
in particular, the following:

        (…)
       b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
       conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
       Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                            III

      The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it processed the
personal data of the claimant without having any legitimacy to do so. The

The claimant's personal data were incorporated into the information systems
of the company, without having proven that he had legitimately hired,
have legitimacy for the collection and subsequent processing of your data
personal, or there is any other cause that makes the treatment carried out lawful.

       Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, it remains in

questioned the diligence used by the respondent to identify the
person who contracted on behalf of the claimant.
       Well, the respondent did not respond to the request made by this
Agency on February 2, 2021 and notified on the 3rd of the same month and year.

        Ultimately, the respondent has not provided a document or evidence
any evidence that the entity, in such a situation, had deployed the
minimum diligence required to verify that indeed your interlocutor was the one
claimed to flaunt.

       Respect for the principle of legality that is at the core of fundamental right
protection of personal data requires that it be proven that the
responsible for the treatment deployed the necessary diligence to prove that
extreme. If this Agency does not act like this - and if this Agency does not demand it, it is incumbent upon
for compliance with the regulations governing the right to data protection of
personal character - the result would be to empty the principle of legality of content.

                                            IV

        In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, provisions that state:

           "Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
administrative regulations pursuant to this article for the infractions of this
Regulations indicated in paragraphs 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive. "

       "Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of
each individual case, as an additional or substitute for the measures contemplated in the
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine

        b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;
        c) any measure taken by the person in charge or in charge of the treatment
        to alleviate the damages suffered by the interested parties;
        d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge or the person in charge of the

        treatment, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have
        applied by virtue of articles 25 and 32;
        e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the
        treatment;
         f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to establish

        remedy the violation and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the violation;
        g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
        h) the way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement,
        in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such
        case, to what extent;
        i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been

        previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge
        in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;
        j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or to mechanisms
        certification approved in accordance with article 42, and
        k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the

        case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct
        or indirectly, through the infringement. "

      Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76,
"Sanctions and corrective measures", provides:

         "2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
The following may also be taken into account:

  h) The submission by the person in charge or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, in those cases in which
there are controversies between those and any interested party. "

      In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the fine to impose
in the present case, the claimed party is considered responsible for an infringement
typified in article 83.5.a) of the RGPD, in an initial assessment, they are considered concurrent

      As aggravating factors the following:

- Intentionality or negligence in the offense (article 83.2 b).

bank, the line identifier) (article 83.2 g).
