## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that Glovo does not have a DPO to whom address any complaints regarding data protection.

### Dispute

The defendant answered to the AEPD investigation requests, stating that it is not included among the assumptions of Article 37 GDPR nor among the ones in Article 34 of the Spanish Law on Personal Data Protection (LOPDGDD), so it did not have the need to appoint a DPO. Glovo also stated that, despite these facts, in June 8th, 2018, it created an internal data protection board with exactly the same role and functions as a DPO (and even an internal data protection sub-board in order to incorporate the first one), and that such board effectively develops the activity of a DPO. According to this, the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure; to this procedure, Glovo stated that, in March 13th, 2019, it had formally appointed a DPO, but it had decided not to make this appointment public until February 2020, because the board, the sub-board and the legal department of Glovo had been already developing such functions effectively and with full guarantees for the rights and freedoms of any data subjects.

### Holding

Thus, the AEPD understood that Glovo has infringed its duties in relation to the need of appointing a DPO as per Article 37 GDPR and 34(1) LOPDGDD, as well as in relation to the need of registering such appointment at the AEPD website \[Article 34(3) LOPDGDD\], and, after considering some aggravating circumstances \[(i) the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them, and (ii) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement\], it decided to impose a fine of 25,000 € to Glovo.
