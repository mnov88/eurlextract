## English Summary

### Facts

In March 2020, the data subject concluded a postpaid mobile phone contract with a telecommunications provider (controller). The following day, the controller reported the existence and terms of the contract, including its type, duration, and the parties involved (positive data) to SCHUFA, a credit information agency. It did not report any payment default information (negative data). The data subject was informed about this practice in the contractual documentation.

On October 2023, the data subject became aware of the entry, following an access request to SCHUFA under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR").

The data subject brought a case before the court of first instance (Regional Court Nürnberg-Fürth-LG Nürnberg-Fürth) claiming that the transfer of his positive data was unlawful because he never provided his consent. Furthermore, the unlawful transmission of his data to SCHUFA caused him emotional distress, reputational concern, anxiety and a loss of control over his personal data. He also referred to an earlier rejection of a credit application for a television purchase (valued at approximately €800) and argued that the SCHUFA entry had contributed to this outcome. The data subject sought:

1.  compensation for material and immaterial damages under [Article 82 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR "Article 82 GDPR");
2.  a cease-and-desist order against further transmissions without consent;
3.  a declaration of liability for potential future damages.

The controller defended that the processing was lawful, arguing that the data was limited to positive contractual information, that the transmission was necessary for fraud prevention and credit risk assessment in mass-market telecommunications services, and that [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") provided a valid legal basis.

The court of first instance dismissed the action as unfounded stating that the data subject had no claim against the controller for the damages sought under Article 82(1) GDPR, as he had not been able to prove to the court's satisfaction that he had suffered material or non-material damage, and neither was he entitled to an injunctive relief because the transfer of positive data for fraud prevention is justifiable.

The data subject filed an appeal against this decision before the court of appeal (Higher Regional Court of Nuremberg -OLG Nürnberg), insisting that the controller's transmission of his data to SCHUFA and its processing there undoubtedly constituted a loss of control and thus damage, and that the notification of positive data is generally only possible with consent.

### Holding

The Higher Regional Court of Nuremberg issued its preliminary legal view of the case (Hinweisbeschlüssen) with which it dismissed the data subject’s appeal in its entirety and upheld the judgment of the court of first instance.

First, the court rejected the claim for damages under [Article 82 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR "Article 82 GDPR"). The court held that a mere subjective feeling of loss of control, distress, or reputational concern does not in itself give rise to compensation. The data subject failed to demonstrate any concrete harm or a substantiated risk of misuse. In particular, the SCHUFA score of 97.28% placed the data subject in the highest creditworthiness category, which undermined any alleged causal link between the data processing and a prior loan rejection.

Second, the court held that the data transfer to SCHUFA was lawful under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"). It held that the controller’s legitimate interests, particularly in fraud prevention in mass-market postpaid contracts that often include the provision of a mobile phone device, justified the transmission of limited contractual data. It is also clear that the specific data processing was necessary to prevent fraud and it outweighed the data subject's rights and interests. The court pointed out that the data subject had been informed of this practice in the contract documentation, and that the data transmitted did not include any payment default or sensitive categories of personal data.

Third, it dismissed the request for a cease-and-desist order since the controller did not breach the GDPR and in any case it was overly broad.

Finally, the court held that the request for a declaration of future liability was inadmissible.

It must be pointed out that this judgement is not binding yet.

## Comment

It is worth pointing out that in this case it is not clear from the decision if the data subject received a mobile phone device.

The court reaffirmed that non-material damage under [Article 82 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR "Article 82 GDPR") requires concrete harm, not merely subjective discomfort or a sense of lost control.

This decision also confirms that [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") remains a valid legal basis for sharing non-default data with credit agencies, especially where fraud prevention and credit risk assessment are at stake. The court rejected a consent-only approach and emphasised that legitimate interest may lawfully support such processing when the balancing test is met.

Opinion

Notice pursuant to Section 522 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure

The Senate intends to appeal the judgment of the Regional Court of Nuremberg-Fürth of March 6, 2025, Ref. No. 13 O 59/24, pursuant to Section 522 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), because it unanimously holds the view that the appeal clearly has no prospect of success, the case is also of no fundamental importance, neither the development of the law nor the safeguarding of uniform case law requires a decision by the appellate court, and an oral hearing on the appeal is not necessary.

Reasons for the Decision

1 The plaintiff asserts claims based on alleged violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in connection with the transmission of data.

2 The defendant provides telecommunications services. On March 3, 2020, the parties concluded a so-called postpaid mobile phone contract. Upon concluding the contract, the defendant informed the plaintiff of the intended transmission of so-called positive data to SCHUFA H. AG (hereinafter: SCHUFA) (see Exhibit B2). The plaintiff did not grant the corresponding consent.

3 On March 4, 2020, the defendant reported to SCHUFA that the plaintiff had concluded a telecommunications contract and provided the service account number …. SCHUFA announced on October 19, 2023, that it would delete the submitted positive data. The SCHUFA self-disclosure dated October 12, 2023, requested by the plaintiff and issued to him on October 19, 2023, still contained the entry concerning the mobile phone contract in dispute. As of October 6, 2023, a base score of 97.28% had been determined for the plaintiff. The plaintiff has not obtained any new information from SCHUFA since the deletion announcement.

4 The plaintiff claims that the unauthorized disclosure of the positive data caused the plaintiff a multitude of negative emotions and fears that significantly impaired his quality of life. The plaintiff immediately experienced a feeling of loss of control and great concern, particularly regarding his own creditworthiness. The feeling of loss of control is characterized by the fear of being exposed to unauthorized disclosure to a credit agency such as SCHUFA H. AG. Since then, the plaintiff has lived with the constant fear of at least unpleasant inquiries regarding his own creditworthiness, general conduct in business transactions, or a falsification of his SCHUFA score. The plaintiff's general malaise escalates to the point of sheer existential anxiety, as the plaintiff does not know in what form, if, and when a direct or indirect confrontation with the consequences of the SCHUFA entry will occur. This leaves him with stress, anxiety, and a general feeling of malaise on a daily basis.

5 During his briefing before the trial court, the plaintiff stated that his anxiety was primarily caused by the fact that T. Bank had refused him financing for a television worth approximately €800 without explanation shortly before obtaining the SCHUFA self-disclosure. He suspects this is related to the entries in the SCHUFA (credit agency).

6 The plaintiff is of the opinion that the data transfer to SCHUFA was unlawful, pursuant to Art. 6 (1), Art. 5 (1) (a) GDPR. The unlawful disclosure of data resulted in non-material damage. The resulting loss of control alone constitutes damage for the plaintiff. In any case, the other consequences result in non-material damage.

7 The plaintiff most recently filed a motion in the first instance:

1. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff reasonable damages for non-material damage, the amount of which is left to the court's discretion, but at least EUR 5,000.00 plus interest accruing since the action was filed at a rate of 5 percentage points above the base interest rate.

2. The defendant is ordered, on pain of a fine of up to EUR 250,000.00 to be determined by the court for each case of infringement, or alternatively, imprisonment of up to six months, to be enforced by its legal representative, or up to two years in the event of a repeat offense, to refrain from transmitting positive data, i.e., personal data that does not contain payment history or other non-contractual conduct, but rather information about the commissioning, execution, and termination of a contract, to credit agencies, namely SCHUFA H. AG, K.weg 5, 6... W., without the consent of the plaintiff, and in particular not on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR to improve the quality of credit assessments or to protect the economic operators involved from credit risks.

3. It is determined that the defendant is obligated to compensate the plaintiff for all future material damages and future currently unforeseeable non-material damages incurred by the plaintiff as a result of the unauthorized processing of personal data.

4. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff pre-trial legal fees in the amount of €713.76.

8 The defendant has applied in the first instance for:

9 The defendant argues that the data transmitted by the defendant to SCHUFA, with the exception of the existence of the mobile phone contract, was already known to SCHUFA before the positive data was registered, since, as a result of the required SEPA direct debit mandate, the remaining data was already transmitted to SCHUFA before the contract was concluded and thus before the positive data was transmitted.

10 The defendant is of the opinion that it was entitled to make the report in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The positive data transmitted served to prevent fraud, which, for example, would be relevant when several mobile phone contracts are concluded simultaneously, to prevent over-indebtedness, and to enable more precise default risk forecasts.

11 The Regional Court dismissed the action in its final judgment of March 6, 2025. It essentially stated that the admissible action was unfounded. The plaintiff had no claim against the defendant for the damages sought under Art. 82 (1) GDPR because the plaintiff had not been able to prove to the court's satisfaction that he had suffered material or immaterial damage. After the plaintiff's briefing, the court was unable to form a conviction that the plaintiff had suffered damage causally attributable to the alleged violations. It could therefore remain undecided whether the defendant's transmission of the positive data to SCHUFA actually constituted unlawful data processing within the meaning of Art. 6 GDPR.

12 The plaintiff is not entitled to an injunction against the defendant because the injunction claim is too broad. The claim to refrain from transmitting data without the plaintiff's consent proves to be too broad, since it cannot be ruled out that a data transfer (even without the plaintiff's consent) for reasons of fraud prevention, if the process is designed in compliance with data protection regulations, could be in the legitimate interest of the controller within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The wording "in particular" in the claim also leaves open which other scenarios are intended to be covered.

13 The plaintiff is also not entitled to a determination of the defendant's liability for the future damages claimed. There is no evidence of causal future material or immaterial damages as a result of the data transfer in question. The plaintiff has not sufficiently demonstrated and proven that the possibility of future damage exists. A negative impact of the disputed entry either on the plaintiff's score or, in fact, on (potential) contracts or other business relationships was not sufficiently specifically demonstrated. The plaintiff also failed to demonstrate or prove that the deletion announced by SCHUFA did not occur.

14 With the appeal, the plaintiff continues to pursue his claim and essentially argues that the court of first instance incorrectly determined that there was no loss of control. The defendant's disclosure to SCHUFA and its processing there undoubtedly constituted a loss of control and thus a loss. This is also unequivocally proven by the entry in the SCHUFA report. It is irrelevant to what extent the SCHUFA score was adversely changed. The Regional Court rejected the plaintiff's informational statements justifying his concern without discussion.

15 Contrary to the Regional Court's opinion, the plaintiff also has a claim for an injunction. The specificity of the claim is sufficient. Reporting positive data is generally only possible with consent. The processing of personal data based on legitimate interests under Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR is only lawful under three cumulative conditions, which are not met here.

16 The Regional Court wrongly rejected the declaratory judgment. A further predominant probability of damage occurring is not required. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether and to what extent deleted data also has or could have an impact on the credit score. Schufa H. AG stated in its own press release regarding the data deletion that the deletion process also resulted in score changes.

17 The plaintiff is of the opinion that all claims can be derived from the relevant decisions of the ECJ and that, in the event of a different opinion, the court must refer the matter to the ECJ or, analogously, stay the proceedings pursuant to Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) until the ECJ issues its decision in the pending cases C-655/23 and C-65/23.

18 In the appeal proceedings, the plaintiff requests that

the contested judgment be amended and the claim granted in full.

19 The defendant requests that

the appeal be dismissed.

20 The defendant defends the judgment under appeal. Moreover, there is no violation of the GDPR because the transmission in dispute was in any case necessary for fraud prevention and was therefore justified by legitimate interests within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

21 The Senate examined and assessed the plaintiff's objections to the Regional Court's decision. However, the appeal arguments are insufficient to enable the appeal to succeed. The judgment is neither based on a violation of law within the meaning of Section 546 of the Code of Civil Procedure, nor do the facts to be taken into account under Section 529 of the Code of Civil Procedure justify a different decision more favorable to the plaintiff (Section 513 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure).

22 The plaintiff's admissible appeal clearly has no prospect of success. The contested decision appears to be correct, even in light of the arguments presented in the grounds of appeal. The plaintiff is not entitled to the asserted claims under any legal perspective.

23 1. The plaintiff is not entitled to damages against the defendant pursuant to Art. 82 (1) GDPR.

24 a) The Regional Court rightly dismissed the action on the ground that it could not satisfy itself with the necessary certainty that the plaintiff suffered damage as a result of the transmission of the positive data.

25 (1) From a legal perspective, the following must first be stated – which the Regional Court also correctly recognized – regarding the burden of presentation and proof in the case of an alleged violation of the GDPR:

26 According to the case law of the Court of Justice, a claim for damages within the meaning of Article 82 (1) GDPR requires a violation of the General Data Protection Regulation, the existence of material or non-material damage, and a causal link between the damage and the violation, whereby these three requirements are cumulative (ECJ, judgment of 4 October 2024 – C-507/23, juris paras. 24 et seq.).

27 In particular, a person claiming a breach of the GDPR that has had adverse consequences for them must demonstrate that these consequences constitute non-material damage within the meaning of Article 82 GDPR, since the mere breach of the provisions of this Regulation is not sufficient to give rise to a claim for damages (ECJ judgment of October 4, 2024 – C-200/23, GRUR-RS 2024, 26255, para. 142 with further references, beck-online).

28 However, with reference to Recital 85 of the GDPR, the ECJ has clarified that the mere loss of control over personal data – even temporary – may constitute non-material damage, without this concept of "non-material damage" requiring proof of additional appreciable negative consequences (see ECJ, loc. cit., paras. 145, 156).

29 The burden of presentation and proof for the aforementioned requirements rests with the person claiming compensation for (non-material) damages on the basis of Art. 82 (1) GDPR (see ECJ, judgment of April 11, 2024 – C-741/21, NJW 2024, 1561, para. 35; Federal Court of Justice, judgment of November 18, 2024 – VI ZR 10/24, NJW 2025, 298, para. 21, beck-online).

30 (2) The Regional Court's conviction, based on an informative hearing of the plaintiff, that the plaintiff had not proven damages in the above sense, cannot be challenged under appeal law.

31 Insofar as the plaintiff's appeal primarily challenges the lower court's factual findings, he fails to take into account that the appeal—deviating from its previous function as a fully-fledged second instance of fact—now primarily serves to review and correct errors. Accordingly, the appellate court is generally bound by the facts established by the court of first instance; a new finding of fact is only provided for as an exception if the first instance's findings were not complete and convincing (cf. Section 529 para. 1 no. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure). The assessment of evidence is generally a matter for the trial judge. However, doubts about the accuracy and completeness of findings relevant to the decision may also arise from the possibility of differing assessments (cf. Federal Court of Justice, judgment of March 9, 2005 – VIII ZR 266/03, NJW 2005, 1583, beck-online). However, if the first instance court has comprehensively and consistently examined the evidence – i.e., if the assessment is complete and legally possible and does not violate any laws of logic or empirical principles – and if the appellate court is also convinced of the correctness of the first instance's assessment of the evidence, the findings are binding. A party cannot then legitimately substitute its own assessment for that of the first instance court. This is, however, what the objections raised in the appeal boil down to here.

32 The following must be stated in detail:

33 (a) The plaintiff relies on the fact that the mere transfer of the positive data by the defendant to Schufa and its processing there constituted a loss of control and thus damage. This overlooks the fact that – as explained above – a mere violation of the provisions of the GDPR is not sufficient to establish a claim for damages. A purely abstract loss of control cannot therefore suffice, see Prof. Dr. P., Schufa Scoring and Damages in the Transmission of Positive Data, NJW 2024, 1689, para. 25 with further references, beck-online. Rather, loss of control is understood as a data subject's well-founded fear that their personal data could be misused by third parties, see ECJ judgment of October 4, 2024 – C-200/23, GRUR-RS 2024, 26255 paras. 143-145, beck-online. In particular, a purely hypothetical risk of misuse by an unauthorized third party cannot lead to compensation (see ECJ, judgment of January 25, 2024 – C-687/21, EuZW 2024, 278 para. 68, beck-online).

34 Loss of control is therefore not equivalent to an unauthorized transfer of data to a third party, but requires a concrete fear of misuse by the third party.

35 In the present case, unlike in a data leak, in which data is accessed by unknown persons and its further use remains completely unclear, a loss of control is not immediately obvious. The data has not been published in this case, i.e., it has been made accessible to an indeterminate number of unknown persons.

36 SCHUFA, as the Senate recognizes, is Germany's leading credit agency, established since 1927. The plaintiff does not demonstrate any well-founded fears that SCHUFA could misuse the transmitted contract data. The Senate does not consider the mere consideration of the positive data in determining the so-called SCHUFA score to constitute misuse of the data. Regarding the alleged loss of control, the plaintiff further argued that he immediately experienced a feeling of loss of control and great concern, particularly regarding his own creditworthiness. This feeling of loss of control was characterized by the fear of unauthorized transmission to a credit agency such as SCHUFA. Thus, the plaintiff does not present any well-founded concerns regarding the contract data already transmitted, but rather relies on the fear that the defendant could again transmit positive data to a credit agency.

37 (b) Contrary to the appeal's contention, the Regional Court also examined the plaintiff's information. The Regional Court's assessment that, even taking into account the plaintiff's statement during his personal hearing, no damage to the plaintiff could be established is unobjectionable.

38 The plaintiff only learned of the defendant's disclosure of the positive data to SCHUFA via the information provided by SCHUFA pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR on October 12, 2023. Any suspicions and fears the plaintiff may have previously harbored due to the non-granting of a loan to purchase a television cannot therefore be causally attributed to the (alleged) violation of the GDPR at that time, due to the plaintiff's lack of knowledge of the latter.

39 Furthermore, the Regional Court rightly points out that, given the plaintiff's high SCHUFA score, it is not clear to what extent the disclosure of positive data to the plaintiff would lead to damage beyond the mere alleged unauthorized disclosure of the data, which in itself does not constitute damage. The information provided on October 12, 2023, results in a score of 97.28% for the plaintiff. The plaintiff thus achieves a score (even under the possible influence of the submitted positive data) that SCHUFA places in the highest credit rating category of "excellent" (www.schufa.de/scoring-daten/hilfe-ihrem-schufa-score/). The Regional Court's finding that the concerns raised by the plaintiff in his written submissions and during his briefing, particularly with regard to his creditworthiness, are not convincing, cannot be challenged in this context.

40 b) Furthermore, the appeal also has no prospect of success because the defendant cannot be accused of a violation of the GDPR – this was left open by the Regional Court.

41 The Senate agrees with the majority opinion that the corresponding data processing by the defendant was justified from the perspective of fraud prevention pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, see Higher Regional Court of Koblenz, judgment of May 12, 2025 – 11 U 1335/34, GRUR-RS 2015, 10143; Higher Regional Court of Bamberg, judgment of May 5, 2025 – 4 U 120/24e, GRUR-RS 2025, 8805; Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court, judgment of October 31, 2024 – 20 U 51/24, GRUR-RS 2024, 32757, Prof. Dr. P., Schufa scoring and damages for the transmission of positive data, NJW 2024, 1689, para. 13, beck-online.

42 (1) According to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, the processing of personal data is lawful under three cumulative conditions: first, a legitimate interest must be pursued by the controller or by a third party; second, the processing of the personal data must be necessary to achieve that legitimate interest; and third, the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject must not override the legitimate interest of the controller or a third party. See ECJ, judgment of December 7, 2023 – C-26/22 –, para. 75, juris.

43 According to the case law of the ECJ, in determining the necessity of processing personal data, it must be examined whether the legitimate interest in processing the data cannot be reasonably achieved just as effectively by other means that interfere less with the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in particular the rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the European Court of Human Rights. In this context, the necessity of data processing must be examined together with the so-called principle of "data minimization," which is enshrined in Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR. Finally, a balancing of the respective conflicting rights and interests must be carried out, which fundamentally depends on the specific circumstances of the individual case, see ECJ, judgment of July 4, 2023 - C 252/21, NJW 2023, 2997, paras. 108 et seq., beck-online.

44 (2) Based on these requirements, the notification of the conclusion of a telecommunications contract with service account no. … was justified for the purpose of fraud prevention.

45 (a) A legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR exists.

46 The provision does not explicitly define what constitutes a legitimate interest. According to Recital 47 of the GDPR, the processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary to prevent fraud expressly constitutes a legitimate interest of the respective controller.

47 The defendant has already plausibly explained in its defence that the data in dispute can be used to identify possible cases of fraud in the context of the conclusion of so-called postpaid mobile phone contracts, in which – as the Senate is also aware – usually in connection with the delivery of an (expensive) mobile phone – the telecommunications service is billed retroactively. This is because in cases where potential customers conclude an inexplicably large number of mobile phone contracts within a short period of time, it can be inferred that the customer's intention is to obtain the expensive hardware.

48 To the extent that the plaintiff objects that the contract has already been concluded when the data is submitted to SCHUFA, this does not contradict this, because the submission also serves to prevent future cases of fraud.

49 (b) It is equally understandable that the specific data processing was necessary for fraud prevention.

50 A milder, equally suitable means has not been demonstrated or is apparent, even taking into account the principle of data economy. To the extent that the plaintiff names other providers that offer services specifically for the telecommunications industry, this does not contradict the necessity, because according to the defendant's statements regarding the scope of the databases cited by the plaintiff, these are no better suited for the stated purpose of fraud prevention than SCHUFA; on the contrary, they do not cover the area to the same extent. For example, the German insurance industry's reporting and information system (HIS) is designed to uncover the fabrication of insurance claims. The TK Pool offered by Experian is a database based solely on information on payment defaults. Furthermore, special data pools generally have a significantly narrower database than cross-industry credit agencies.

51 (c) In the present case, the plaintiff's rights and interests in the protection of the personal data at issue, as protected under Article 8 of the European Court of Human Rights and Article 2(1) in conjunction with Article 1(1) of the Basic Law, do not outweigh the defendant's rights and interest in participating in the solidarity-based fraud prevention system described above for the purpose of protection against economic damage.

52 According to Recital 47 of the GDPR, the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject may outweigh the controller's interest, in particular, when personal data are processed in situations in which a data subject would not reasonably expect such processing.

53 The plaintiff could have ascertained from the contractual documents and therefore had to expect that, after the conclusion of the contract with the defendant, the contractual data at issue might be transmitted to SCHUFA by his contractual partner. The plaintiff received the relevant data protection notice (Exhibit B2). Under "Postpaid: Information on data exchange with credit agencies," the defendant pointed out that "personal data collected within the scope of this contractual relationship relating to the application, implementation, and termination of this business relationship, as well as data relating to non-contractual or fraudulent conduct," will be transmitted to SCHUFA, which is immediately apparent from even a cursory reading of the notice due to the visually highlighted heading "Data transmission to SCHUFA." This also satisfied the requirement that the data subjects be directly informed of the legitimate interest pursued at the time the data is collected (ECJ (1st Chamber) judgment of January 9, 2025 – C-394/23, NJW 2025, 807, para. 52, beck-online).

54 In the balancing of interests, it was necessary to consider that the positive data transmitted does not constitute sensitive data, but rather data that applies to a not insignificant portion of the population and that ultimately merely conveys the information that the plaintiff has concluded a postpaid mobile phone contract. The transmission of the aforementioned positive data from mobile phone contracts to credit reporting agencies has only minor effects. Concluding a mobile phone contract is now a normal behavior that does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about personal preferences or the like, nor does it allow for widespread monitoring of customer consumption behavior, see Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf, judgment of October 31, 2024 – I-20 U 51/24, GRUR-RS 2024, 32757, para. 47, beck-online. It is not apparent that the transmitted data could have any negative impact on the plaintiff, especially in light of the plaintiff's excellent credit score.

55 The defendant, however, considers itself exposed to a significant overall economic risk given the mass business with postpaid mobile phone contracts. In contrast, the registration of the plaintiff's contract data appears acceptable; see also OLG Koblenz, judgment of May 12, 2025 – 11 U 1335/24, GRUR-RS 2025, 10143, para. 31, beck-online.

56 2. The action is admissible, but also unfounded, insofar as, in claim 2, it seeks to prohibit the future transmission of positive data to SCHUFA without the plaintiff's consent.

57 The Regional Court correctly stated that the injunction claim is in any case too broad. According to the claim, the transmission of positive data would only be permissible with the plaintiff's consent. However, this is contradicted by Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which states that a (necessary) data transfer may be carried out to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party without the consent of the data subject being required.

58 A claim for injunctive relief also fails because there is no actual or concrete threat of a violation of the GDPR on the part of the defendant, since – as explained – the reporting of the positive data was permissible.

59 3. The declaratory action under 3) is admissible, but also unfounded due to the lack of a violation of the GDPR. In this respect, reference is made to the above statements under I. 1. b) for the purpose of reporting repetitions.

60 To the extent that the plaintiff argues that the subsequent deletion of positive data by SCHUFA could have a negative impact on the score, this may be true. A claim for damages against the defendant cannot arise from this, since the deletion is carried out by SCHUFA and not by the defendant. It is also incomprehensible why the plaintiff's score should be worse as a result than it would have been without the prior transmission, which the plaintiff considers unlawful.

61 4. Finally, the plaintiff is not entitled to reimbursement of the costs of the out-of-court legal proceedings due to the lack of a claim in the main proceedings.

62 5. There is no reason to refer the case to the ECJ or to stay the proceedings pursuant to Section 148 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO) (analogously) until the legal issues before the ECJ or those raised in the grounds of appeal have been clarified. The issues raised by the plaintiff have either already been clarified in the plaintiff's favor or are irrelevant to the present case.

63 Since the appeal has no prospect of success, the court recommends that the appeal be withdrawn for cost reasons. In the event of the withdrawal of the appeal, the court fees in this case will be reduced from 4.0 to 2.0 fees (see No. 1222 of the Schedule of Costs for the Court Court Act).

64 The opportunity to comment on this matter is open until August 6, 2025.
