A language test provider can refuse to provide an applicant with a perfect copy of their test insofar as its interest in secrecy of the questions outweights the right to access of the applicant.

## English Summary

### Facts

After failing a language test, a data subject requested the test provider (controller) to provide her a copy of her examination paper under [Article 15(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3 "Article 15 GDPR"). The controller offered the data subject to consult her paper at its office but refused to provide a copy. It argued that the majority of the paper did not contain personal data under the meaning of [Article 4 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR") and that it had an interest in secrecy that justified its refusal to provide a copy under [Article 15(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#4 "Article 15 GDPR"). Unsatisfied, the data subject brought an action with the Amstgericht Frankfurt (local Court of Frankfurt).

### Holding

_First_, the Court did not follow the controller's argument concerning the non-personal nature of the data included in the paper. Indeed, the answers of the data subjects and the comments of the examiner constituted personal data under [Article 4 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR"). The test questions however were not personal data.

_Second_, the Court weighed up the right of the data subject to obtain a copy and the interest of the controller in secrecy under [Article 15(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#4 "Article 15 GDPR"). It considered that the test questions constituted trade secrets within the meaning of national provisions and that the development of these language test represented a complex procedure involving considerable economic effort. These tests are used in naturalization procedure and due to a lack of secrecy, there could be a risk that the examination would no longer be considered sufficient to determine language skills for this purpose. As a result, the entrepreneurial freedom of the controller could be threatened.

The Court therefore considered that on the basis of its interest to secrecy, the controller could refuse to provide a copy under [Article 15(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#4 "Article 15 GDPR"). It also took into account that the right to access was not entirely denied since the data subject could consult her paper at the controller’s office.

## Comment

It appears curious that the holding focuses on this interest in secrecy and not on the entrepreneurial freedom since the text of [Article 15(4)](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") refers to "_rights and freedoms of others_". Also, the Court does not explain how these interests are _adversely_ affected. This appears as a very flexible interpretation of [Article 15(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"). According to the [EDPB guidelines on the right of access](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2022-01/edpb_guidelines_012022_right-of-access_0.pdf), "_the controller must be able to demonstrate that in the concrete situation rights or freedoms of others would factually be impacted_." (§170). However, in this case, the risk associated with providing a copy of the test to one data subject appears potential.
