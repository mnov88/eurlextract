## English Summary

### Facts

The Spanish DPA received a complaint about the installation of a video surveillance camera on the private property of a local residence, oriented towards public space and a neighbouring school area, disrupting citizen coexistence without just cause. The complaint was filed by the State Security Forces and Corps (Fuerzas y Cuerpos de Seguridad del Estado) in November 2019.

In addition, the system does not have an informational poster indicating the responsible person for data processing, contravening Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. The defendant was identified as a local resident who failed to comply with the recommendations made by the State Security Forces and Corps.

### Dispute

Does the installation of a surveillance camera in private property, oriented towards public spaces, violate Article 5 (1)(c) GDPR?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA found the defendant has a video surveillance camera oriented towards public spaces, affecting the right to privacy and treating personal data without consent of third parties, in violation of Article 5(1)(c) GDPR.

The DPA found the installation of the surveillance camera to lack an informational poster and to be oriented towards a nearby public school, causing distress to the local neighbours. This justified imposing a fine pursuant to Article 83(2)(a). The defendant also ignored the recommendations of the State Security Forces and Corps, proving his intentionality. This justified imposing a fine pursuant to Article 83(2)(b).

The DPA clarified surveillance cameras should be oriented preferably towards private space to avoid intimidation of local neighbours and to control public transit areas without just cause. Also, the obtaining of image(s) from public spaces is an exclusive competence of the State Security Forces and Corps.

Therefore, in light of the violations, the Spanish DPA imposed a €3000 fine on the defendant and stated he has to comply with Article 5(1)(c) and Article 83(2)(a)(b) GDPR.

Of the actions carried out in this procedure and of the documentation Obrante in the file, the following have been accredited:

PROVEN FACTS

Sixth. According to the manifestation of the acting force, the citizen in question has been widely warned, "ignoring" the recommendations.

FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

I
By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate and
to solve this procedure.

II
In the present case, we proceed to examine the claim dated 11/11/19 by means of which "the presence of a camera oriented towards public space" is transferred as a fact without just cause by a private individual, ignoring Local Police warnings (\*\*\* LOCALIDAD.1).

The art. 5.1 c) RGPD provides the following: Personal data will be:

"Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes
for those who are processed ("data minimization").

It should be remembered that individuals are responsible for ensuring that the installed systems comply with current legislation, proving that it complies with
all the requirements demanded by the regulations in force.

The installation of this type of device must have the mandatory poster informative, indicating the purposes and responsible for the treatment, where appropriate, of the data of a personal nature.

In any case, the cameras should preferably be oriented towards the particular space, avoiding intimidating neighboring neighbors with this type of device,
as well as controlling areas of transit of the same without just cause.

Neither with this type of device can image (s) of public space be obtained, as this is the exclusive competence of the Security Forces and Bodies. of the State.

It should be remembered that even in the case of a "simulated" camera the
It should preferably be oriented towards private space, since it is considers that this type of device can affect the privacy of third parties, which they are intimidated by it into the belief of being the subject of permanent recording.

III
In accordance with the evidence available in this sanctioning procedure, it is considered that the defendant has a video surveillance camera that affects the privacy of third parties, treating their personal data without consent.

The known facts are constitutive of an infringement, attributable to the defendant, for violation of the content of art. 5.1 c) RGPD.

Article 77 section 5 of Law 39/2015 (October 1) provides the following:

“The documents formalized by the officials who are recognized

According to the acting force, the camera “is oriented towards public roads”, specifically towards the public primary school located in front of their home (folio no one).

Consequently, the set of indications points to the operation of the camera, being oriented towards the nearby school area, lacking an information poster,
the observations of the local Police and to "ignore" the recommendations of the State Security Forces and Bodies.

The art. 83.5 RGPD provides the following: "Violations of the provisions
following will be sanctioned, in accordance with section 2, with administrative

justified, causing a situation of discomfort in the residents of the town (art.
83.2 a) RGPD).

requirements of this body, specifically the legalization of the system, oriented towards its private space.
