## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject made a complaint against the data controller since their personal data was used for allowing the loan for their sister buying a car. The data subject affirms that their personal data were processed by the data controller with no consent and alleged that they were set as the guarantor of the buying without their knowledge. However, there was evidence proving that the data subject knew about the transaction and, as mentioned by the data controller, the data subject is actually the co-owner of the car in dispute, not its guarantor.

### Holding

The DPA ruled that processing the personal data of a subject who is the co-owner of the car bought via contract is legitimate, considering Article 6 of the GDPR. There is no need for consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data when they are part of a contract with the data controller. Since the data subject is a part of the co-owner of the car bought and does not act as a guarantor, the execution of a contract is a legitimate legal base for the processing of personal data. Thus, the DPA understood there was no breach of the GDPR.

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), grants each
control authority and as established in articles 47 and 48.1 of the Law

Organic 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve
this procedure the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: “The procedures

processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

                                            II

Article 4.11 of the GDPR defines the consent of the interested party as “any

manifestation of free, specific, informed and unequivocal will by which the
interested party accepts, either by a declaration or a clear affirmative action, the
processing of personal data that concerns you.”

In this sense, article 6.1 of the LOPDGDD establishes that “in accordance with the
provided in article 4.11 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, consent is understood to be
ment of the affected person any manifestation of free, specific, informed and ineligible will.

ambiguity by which he accepts, either through a statement or a clear action
“Yes, the processing of personal data that concerns you.”

For its part, article 6 of the RGPD establishes the following:

"1. The treatment will only be legal if at least one of the following conditions is met:

nes:

a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;

b) the processing is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party

is part of or for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures;

c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;

d) the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the interested party or another

Physical person;

e) the processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a mission carried out in the interest
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the controller;

 f) the processing is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued

                                            III

In the present case, the complaining party denounces AUTOMOVILES FERSAN, S.A.

because they demand payment from him as a guarantor for a vehicle that his
sister B.B.B. despite the fact that, in the financing contract, only his sister appears and
not her.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/6

The claimed entity has provided documentation that allows it to prove that the
claimant is the joint owner of the vehicle that caused the requested debt and therefore,

requires payment not as guarantor but as co-owner. Specifically, it provides the
judicial claim for non-payment, in which both the claimant and the
B.B.B. as owners of the vehicle and the financing contract.

Therefore, after proving that the claimant is the joint owner of the vehicle and clarifying in

concept of what the debt is claimed from, we must consider that the entity
claimed is legitimized for the use of the personal data of the
claimant, based on the prior execution of a purchase and sale contract, and therefore
Therefore, a violation of article 6 of the RGPD indicated in the
legal basis II.

Therefore, after becoming aware of these facts, the Director of the Agency
