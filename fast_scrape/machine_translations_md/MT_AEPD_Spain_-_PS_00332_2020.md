The Spanish DPA (AEPD) fined Borjamotor, S.A. for infringing [Article 7 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR "Article 7 GDPR") and Article [Article 21(1)](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#1 "Article 21 GDPR") of the Spanish Law on Information Society Services (LSSI). Borjamotor, S.A., recognizing its responsibility, made an early payment of €4.800 (reduced from the original €8.000 fine).

## English Summary

### Facts

In 2016, the complainant contacted BORJAMOTOR, S.A. and objected to the processing of his personal data for direct marketing via e-mail. However, the complainant continued to receive e-mails with offers, although less frequently.

The complainant contacted the company on two further occasions to stop receiving emails: in November 2018 and in September 2019. During the latest unsubscribe request, the complainant used the contact form on the company's website to insist that he did not want to receive any more advertisements and to inform the company that he was going to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. The company responded to the data subject by showing its apologies. The AEPD decided to dismiss the case under the wrong impression that the situation had been rectified. However, in June 2020, the complainant received an SMS from the defendant with advertising content, so the data subject filed a new complaint with the AEPD.

After a request for information, the company said that the complainant had received the SMS because months before he had used the contact form on the BORJAMOTOR, S.A. website to inform them about his complaint. In order to send the complainant's message correctly, it was necessary to accept the privacy policy and, therefore, the sending of electronic commercial communications.

### Dispute

Did the obtained a valid consent from the data subject to send him commercial communications? Is it correct to send commercial communications to a person just because they used a contact form?

### Holding

The AEPD maintains that the defendant infringed the LSSI by sending commercial communications without consent. Likewise, the AEPD points out that the contact form did not meet the requirements of the GDPR regarding consent. The data subject simply wanted to communicate with the company about a data protection issue. To do so, he was forced to accept that his personal data would be processed (also) for advertising purposes. Therefore, the consent was neither free nor specific ([Article 4(11)](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#11 "Article 4 GDPR")).

The AEPD decided to impose on the defendant €4000 for each of the infringements, that is, €8000 in total. Finally, the company used the system of reductions for voluntary payment provided for in the Spanish administrative law and paid a fine of €4800.

With the file E / 09997/2019, the claimed entity sent an email a

caused. However, nine months later, on 06/10/20, the claimant returned to
receive a new commercial communication from the claimed person via SMS.

The facts presented, without prejudice to what results from the instruction, consisting of
the sending of non-consensual commercial communications, could constitute
infringement, by the defendant as established in article 21 of the
LSSI, where it is established that:

"1. The sending of advertising or promotional communications by

email or other equivalent electronic means of communication that
had not previously been requested or expressly authorized by the
recipients of the same.

2. The provisions of the preceding section shall not apply when there is a

previous contractual relationship, provided that the provider had obtained lawfully
the recipient's contact details and will use them to send communications
commercial related to products or services of your own company that are
similar to those that were initially contracted with the client.

In any case, the provider must offer the recipient the possibility of opposing the
processing of your data for promotional purposes using a simple procedure
and free of charge, both at the time of data collection and at each of the
commercial communications that you direct.

When the communications have been sent by email, said

means must necessarily consist of the inclusion of an email address
email or other valid email address where this right can be exercised,
being forbidden the sending of communications that do not include said address. "

The aforementioned offense is classified as minor in art. 38.4.d) of said

standard, which qualifies as such, “Sending commercial communications by mail
electronic or other equivalent electronic means of communication when in said
shipments do not meet the requirements established in article 21 and do not constitute
Serious offense".

In accordance with the provisions of article 39.1.c) of the LSSI, minor infractions may
be sanctioned with a fine of up to € 30,000, establishing the criteria for its
graduation in article 40 of the same rule.

After the evidence obtained in the preliminary investigation phase, and without prejudice to
what results from the instruction, it is considered that the sanction should be
impose in accordance with the following aggravating criteria, established in art. 40 of
the LSSI:

The existence of intentionality, an expression that must be interpreted as equivalent to
degree of guilt according to the Judgment of the National Court of
11/12/07 relapse to Appeal no. 351/2006, corresponding to the entity
denounced the determination of a system for obtaining informed consent
that conforms to the mandate of the LSSI.

Period of time during which the offense has been committed, as it is the first
claim of September 2019, (section b).

Based on these criteria, it is deemed appropriate to impose on the claimed entity
a penalty of 4,000 euros (two thousand euros), for the violation of article 21 of the LSSI,

Regarding the sending of commercial communications to the claimant without consent
express of the same
                                           IV

On the other hand, by this Agency it has been found that, when the user of
the website www.opelborjamotor.es, makes use of the existing form on the page

www.opelborjamotor.es/es/contacto, if you wish to contact the
dealer, you must accept both the "privacy statement", where the user
obligatorily accepts that, "they get in touch in order to receive more
information on Opel products and services from an Opel Dealer. ”,
as the "declaration of consent", where the user must accept
obligatorily, among others that, "the personal data provided in relation to

the information, are processed for personalized marketing purposes and
Market studies (…)".

Article 6.1. of the RGPD, establishes that the processing of personal data only
It will be lawful if at least one of the conditions indicated therein is met,
Among which is, in section b), if the treatment is “necessary for the

execution of a contract in which the interested party is a party or for the application to
request of this of pre-contractual measures ”, in which case, the sending of
communications that are closely related to the end of the signed contract, would be
endorsed by this precept, as it would be in the present case, maintain communication
between both parties, for the resolution of the questions raised by the user.

However, for any other type of communication with the user, as in this
case, to, “(…) receive more information about Opel products and services from
an Opel Dealer. ", or so that," the personal data provided in relation to
to the information, are processed for personalized marketing purposes and
market studies (…) ”, the provisions of section a) of article

6.1 of the RGPD, where it is stated that: “the treatment will only be lawful if the interested party gave
your consent to the processing of your personal data for one or more purposes
specific ”.

## Article 7 of the RGPD, establishes for its part, in relation to consent, that:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/14

"1. When the treatment is based on the consent of the interested party, the person in charge
must be able to demonstrate that he consented to the processing of his data

personal.

2. If the consent of the interested party is given in the context of a written statement
that also refers to other matters, the request for consent will be submitted
such that it is clearly distinguished from other subjects, intelligibly and clearly
easy access and using clear and simple language. No part will be binding

of the declaration that constitutes an infringement of these Regulations.

3. The interested party will have the right to withdraw their consent at any time. The
Withdrawal of consent will not affect the legality of the treatment based on the
consent prior to its withdrawal. Before giving consent, the interested party

will be informed of it. It will be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.

4. When evaluating whether consent has been freely given, it will be taken into account in the
as much as possible the fact whether, among other things, the performance of a contract,
including the provision of a service, is subject to consent to the treatment of
personal data that are not necessary for the execution of said contract ”.

In relation to these two cited articles, it should also be taken into account the
considering (32) of the RGPD, as it indicates that:

“Consent must be given through a clear affirmative act that reflects a

free, specific, informed, and unequivocal manifestation of the interested party
accept the processing of personal data that concerns him ... Therefore, the
Consent must be given for all processing activities carried out with the
same or the same ends. When the treatment has several purposes, the
consent for each of them, freely and without obligation.

For its part, article 6.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes, on the treatment based on the
consent, that: "When it is intended to base the processing of data on the
consent of the affected party for a plurality of purposes, it will be necessary that
It is specifically and unequivocally stated that said consent is granted to
All of them".

Well, in accordance with everything indicated, data processing requires the
existence of a legal basis that legitimizes it, as in this case, the execution of a
contract in which the interested party is a party (the realization of a request, a query or
a comment) through its website, in which case, the answer to the question

raised would be supported by this precept. Not so, when the shipment is
communications that do not have the same purpose as that included in the request
made, in which case the consent of the interested party is required
freely for each of the other purposes, such as, for example, the
sending advertising communications. Situation that is not fulfilled in the present

case, because to send the request or query to the entity, it must be accepted without option
to refusal that the user receives commercial communications from the claimed entity.

Thus, the known facts could constitute an infraction,
attributable to the defendant, for violation of article 7 of the aforementioned RGPD, to
carry out the collection of consent through a mandatory action to receive

any type of communication, even if it is different from the purpose for which they have been
obtained personal data.

For its part, article 72.1.c) of the LOPDGDD, considers very serious, for the purposes of
prescription, "Failure to comply with the requirements of article 7 of the RGPD".

This offense can be sanctioned with a fine of € 20,000,000 maximum or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
of greater amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

In accordance with the indicated precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the sanction to be imposed in
In the present case, it is considered that the sanction to be imposed should be adjusted according to
with the following criteria established in article 83.2 of the RGPD:

    - The intentionality or negligence in the infraction. In the present case we are

        in the event of unintentional negligent action, (section b).

    - The categories of personal data affected by the infringement
        (section g).

    - The way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement. The
        The way in which this AEPD has learned has been by filing
        two complaints by the claimant, (section h).

In accordance with the indicated precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the

instruction of the procedure, in order to fix the amount of the sanction to be imposed in
In the present case, it is considered that the sanction to be imposed should be adjusted according to
with the following criteria established in article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD:

    - The linking of the offender's activity with the performance of treatment of
        personal data, (section b).

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with
Regarding the offense committed by violating the provisions of Article 13, it allows
set a penalty of 4,000 euros, (four thousand euros).

Therefore, the total sanction to impose, for infractions in the cookie policy in
the four web pages owned, would be 8,000 euros (eight thousand euros).

In accordance with the foregoing, by the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection,
