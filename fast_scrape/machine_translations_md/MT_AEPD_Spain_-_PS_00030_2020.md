Outdoor maras must be proportionate to the intended purpose, as well as have an informative poster (s) assuming responsibility as the person responsible for the treatment of the images, an aspect whose responsibility is made clear by the contract provided.

b) the rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22; In the present case, the following is taken into account when motivating the sanction:

The foregoing justifies the imposition of a penalty in the amount of 1,000
