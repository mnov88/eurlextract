## English Summary

### Facts

The Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (controller) promoted the participation by cancer patients in a study being conducted by a data processor. The patients downloaded a mobile app and, using a code given to them by their oncologist, inputted data about their well-being.

In June 2023, the controller notified the AEPD (Spanish DPA) that the processor had suffered a breach of security which resulted in the unauthorised access to 2,622 patients' personal data by an intentional bad-actor. The personal data consisted of the participants' email addresses, their phone number and their health-related data.

### Holding

The DPA’s investigation revealed that the processor had failed to properly implement cryptographic controls to allow for the encryption of the data. Based on evidence from the National Cybersecurity and Technology Expertise Association, the DPA found that the failure to implement such controls facilitated the occurrence of the breach.

The DPA found that the controller had infringed [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") for failing to ensure appropriate security of processing.

The DPA initially levied a fine of €70,000 for the infringement but pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the DPA informed the controller that it may acknowledge its responsibility for the alleged violations and/or make a voluntary payment of the proposed fine. Each of these actions reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to reduce the fine by 40%, both acknowledging its responsibility for the violations and paying the reduced sanction amount of €42,000.

There are several fraudulent uses of data obtained through criminal means.

The most common uses are sales to marketing companies, as well as attempts to access personal devices.
In the case of data being sold to marketing companies, the effect will be the
reception of unwanted advertising through various means, (...).
The greatest risks relate to attempts to access devices and the information contained therein (personal data, bank accounts, etc.), as well as identity theft (...)."

16. In its document of February 12, 2024, FSEOM states: “6.4.- Regarding the clarification that the breach could have been avoided by adopting some additional measure, we refer to the fact that if \*\*\*COMPANY.1 had complied with the measure (…) agreed upon in the contract, the impact on those affected could have been avoided.” (sic)

For its part, within the framework of the preliminary investigation, this Agency has carried out a series of checks on the Internet:

- On September 11, 2024, this Agency verified that, in relation to the reactive measure implemented to replace tokens with roles, on the \*\*\*APP.1 website itself, entitled "Best Security Practices Recommended by \*\*\*APP.1", the following text was included, extracted from the official documentation of \*\*\*APP.1, which recommended not using access keys directly in the application that needs to access resources of \*\*\*EMPRESA.3 (programmatic tokens), using ROLES instead as a good security practice (\*\*\*URL.3):

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/25

"Use of access keys \*\*\*APP.3 for \*\*\*APP.1 Applications and Services that require access to \*\*\*COMPANY.3:

For applications running on \*\*\*COMPANY.4 or other \*\*\*APP.1 Services to access \*\*\*COMPANY.3 resources, they must include valid \*\*\*APP.1 credentials in their \*\*\*APP.1 API requests. We recommend not storing \*\*\*APP.1 credentials directly in the application or on a \*\*\*COMPANY.4 instance. These are long-term credentials that do not rotate automatically and could have a significant business impact if compromised. Instead, use an \*\*\*APP.3 role to temporarily manage credentials for applications or services that require access to \*\*\*COMPANY.3. When you use a role, you do not have to distribute long-term credentials (such as a username and password or access keys) to an instance of \*\*\*COMPANY.4 or a service of \*\*\*APP.1 such as \*\*\*APP.2. The role provides temporary permissions that applications can use when making calls to other resources of \*\*\*APP.1.”

- On September 19, 2024, this Agency verified that, with respect to the processes established in ISO 27001, Annex A.10 of this standard, which establishes cryptographic controls to protect information, encryption requirements for specially protected data, states: “The cryptographic controls in Annex A.10 are based on the principle of least privilege and require that only authorized persons have access to the cryptographic keys and that these keys are appropriately protected.”

- On September 20, 2024, this Agency verified that, in the official \*\*\*APP.1 documentation, in relation to "Identity Management" and "Best Practices for Securely Storing and Using Secrets," the following content could be seen at the link \*\*\*URL.4, among others (emphasis added):

"A common antipattern is to embed \*\*\*APP.3 access keys within source code, configuration files, or mobile applications. When an \*\*\*APP.3 access key is required to communicate with an \*\*\*APP.1 service, use temporary (short-term) security credentials."These short-term credentials can be provided through \*\*\*APP.3 roles for (...) instances, execution roles for \*\*\*APP.4 functions, \*\*\*APP.3 roles for \*\*\*ENTERPRISE.6 for mobile user access, and \*\*\*APP.5 policies for IoT devices.
When interacting with third parties, it is preferable to delegate access to an \*\*\*APP.3 role with the necessary access to your account resources rather than setting up an \*\*\*APP.3 user and sending that third party the secret access key for that user.

- On September 24, 2024, this Agency verified that in the official documentation of \*\*\*APP.1, in relation to information on good security practices and recommendations for the implementation of the National Scheme, the MEDIUM Level through the configuration of \*\*\*APP.1, on the website
\*\*\*URL.5, the following content could be seen, among others (The information was not updated with the latest version of the ENS (RD 311/2022):

In accordance with Article 64 of the LOPDGDD, and taking into account the characteristics of the alleged infringement, a sanctioning procedure is initiated.

The procedure will last a maximum of twelve months from the date of the initiation agreement. After this period, the resolution will expire and, consequently, the proceedings will be archived, in accordance with the provisions of Article 64 of the LOPDGDD.

If no objections are made to this initial resolution within the stipulated period, it may be considered a proposed resolution, as established in Article 64.2.f) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP).

III
Preliminary Questions

In the present case, in accordance with Articles 4.1 and 4.2 of the GDPR, personal data processing is established, since FSEOM

carries out, among other processing operations, the collection and storage of personal data of natural persons: email address, mobile phone number, and health-related data.

Fundacion SEOM carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller, as it determines the purposes and means of such activity, pursuant to Article 4.7 of the GDPR.

IV
Breached obligation. Integrity and Confidentiality

Article 5.1(f) of the GDPR provides:

"1. Personal data shall be:
(…)

f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, by applying appropriate technical or organizational measures ("integrity and confidentiality")."

Loss of confidentiality of personal data

On June 23, 2023, FSEOM, in its capacity as data controller, notified this Agency of a personal data breach, reporting that
"\*\*\*EMPRESA.1 detected unauthorized access (…) directly affecting the personal data of participants in a study sponsored by the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology, of which \*\*\*EMPRESA.1 is the CRO and technology provider, and also the data processor."

In its letter of February 12, 2024, FSEOM provides as Document No. 10 a copy of the contract dated April 20, 2021, between \*\*\*COMPANY.1 (as supplier)

and FSEOM (as client), for the execution of the project "\*\*\*PROJECT.1".

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/25

Based on the above, this Agency understands that there has been a loss of confidentiality of personal data linked to the project "\*\*\*PROJECT.1" promoted by FSEOM.

Personal Data Affected

On July 21, 2023, FSEOM submitted to this Agency a letter extending its notification of this breach, indicating that the contact and health data of (...) individuals had been affected by this incident.

In its letter of February 12, 2024, FSEOM indicated that "The personal data affected by the cyberattack and stored on the servers of \*\*\*COMPANY.1 were the following:
 Email address of the participant in the Observational Study

 Mobile phone number
 Health-related data (…) consisting of:
 (…)

In Document No. 3 of said letter, it can be seen that the interested parties were requested to provide the following personal data: “(…)” and health-related questions (…).

Based on all the above, this Agency understands that the following personal data of (…)

natural persons were affected by the breach that is the subject of this procedure: (…) and health-related questions.

Chronology of events and technical or organizational measures

On April 20, 2021, as can be seen from Document No. 10 attached to the letter from FSEOM dated February 12, 2024, FSEOM and \*\*\*COMPANY.1 signed a data processor agreement, Annex II of which obliged \*\*\*COMPANY.1 to “(…)”.

This contract also included an Appendix 3 with additional information on \*\*\*COMPANY.1's Security Measures, including:

(…).

On June 23, 2023, FSEOM, in its capacity as data controller, notified this Agency of a personal data breach, reporting that
\*\*\*COMPANY.1 (data processor) detected unauthorized access to the

personal data of participants in the study of the “\*\*\*PROJECT.1” project.

On July 5, 2023, the National Association of Cybersecurity and Technological Expertise prepared an incident report indicating that on June 14, 2023,
\*\*\*COMPANY.1 detected (…).

The report explained that (…).

The aforementioned expert report lists a series of technical recommendations to improve \*\*\*COMPANY.1's platform, including: (…).

The report also details improvements implemented by \*\*\*COMPANY.1, with respect to (…).

On February 9, 2024, company \*\*\*COMPANY.2 prepared a second expert report on the breach in question, which indicated that at the time of the incident (…).

\*\*\*COMPANY.1 had implemented “NEW TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES ADOPTED BY \*\*\*COMPANY.1 TO PREVENT, AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, SECURITY INCIDENTS LIKE THE ONE THAT HAPPENED,” such as: (…).

Also \*\*\*COMPANY.1 reportedly adopted "SECURITY MEASURES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF A SIMILAR ATTACK" such as:

(…)

For its part, on September 11, 2024, this Agency verified that, in relation to

the reactive measure implemented to replace tokens with roles, the following text, extracted from the official documentation of \*\*\*APP.1, was included on the \*\*\*APP.1 website entitled "Best Security Practices Recommended by \*\*\*APP.1", in which
(…).

On September 19, 2024, this Agency verified that, with respect to the processes established in ISO 27001, Annex A.10 of this standard, which establishes cryptographic controls for protecting information and encryption requirements for specially protected data, states: "The cryptographic controls in Annex A.10 are based on the principle of least privilege and require that only authorized persons have access to the cryptographic keys and that these keys are adequately protected."

On September 20, 2024, this Agency verified that the official \*\*\*APP.1 documentation, related to "Identity Management" and "Best Practices for Securely Storing and Using Secrets," contains the following content, among others, at the link \*\*\*URL.4:

"A common antipattern is to embed \*\*\*APP.3 access keys within source code, configuration files, or mobile applications. When an \*\*\*APP.3 access key is required to communicate with an \*\*\*APP.1 service, use temporary (short-term) security credentials. These short-term credentials can be provided through \*\*\*APP.3 roles for instances of (...), execution roles for \*\*\*APP.4 functions, \*\*\*APP.3 roles for \*\*\*ENTERPRISE.6 mobile user access, and \*\*\*APP.5 policies for IoT devices.
When interacting with third parties, it is preferable to delegate access to
an \*\*\*APP.3 role with the necessary access to your account resources

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 16/25

instead of setting up a \*\*\*APP.3 user and sending that third party the
secret access key for that user.”

On September 24, 2024, this Agency verified that in the official documentation of \*\*\*APP.1, regarding information on security best practices and recommendations for implementing the National Medium Level Scheme through the \*\*\*APP.1 configuration, on the website \*\*\*URL.5, the following content can be seen, among others (The information is not updated with the latest version of the ENS (RD 311/2022):

Related measure of RD 3/2010 (Annex II 4.2.5. Authentication Mechanism, page 27):
"Access to systems and assets can be controlled by checking that the root user does not have access keys attached to their role.

\*\*\*APP.3. Ensure root access keys are removed. Instead, create and use the role-based system \*\*\*APP.1 Accounts to help incorporate the principle of Minimum functionality."

In conclusion, the fact that \*\*\*COMPANY.1 (data processor) did not have the measures examined in place facilitated the occurrence of the personal data breach and its greater impact. The aforementioned measures were introduced by the data processor ex post (reactively) in order to prevent a similar personal data breach from occurring again.

Under Article 4.8 of the GDPR, the data processor is the person who "processes personal data on behalf of the controller."

Even if the personal data breach occurred in the systems of
\*\*\*EMPRESA.1, the data processor, and even if said processor did not have the measures just analyzed in place at the time the personal data breach occurred, which would most likely have prevented the breach or at least reduced its impact, the data controller is FSEOM.

Based on all the above, this Agency understands that FSEOM, as the data controller, did not have the appropriate technical or organizational measures in place to prevent an incident such as the one that occurred.

Therefore, based on the evidence currently available, in accordance with the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, it is considered that the known facts could constitute an infringement, attributable to FSEOM, for a violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR.

V
Classification of the violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR and classification for the purposes of limitation

Article 83.5 of the GDPR classifies the violation of the following articles as an administrative violation, which shall be punishable, in accordance with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual global turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is higher:

"a) the basic principles for processing, including the conditions for consent pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9; (…)"

For its part, the LOPDGDD, in its Article 71, Infractions, it states that:

"The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4,

5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that are contrary to this Organic Law, constitute infractions."

For the sole purposes of the statute of limitations, Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on Personal Data Protection) establishes the following:

"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infractions that constitute a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein, and in particular, the following, are considered very serious and will be subject to a three-year statute of limitations:
a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees

established in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679."

VI
Proposed Sanction

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:

“1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 9, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures provided for in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). When deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case, due account shall be taken of:
a) the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation that the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage they have suffered;

b) the intentionality or negligence of the breach;
c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects;
d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;
e) any previous breach committed by the controller or processor;

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 18/25

f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

(h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in particular whether the controller or processor notified the infringement and, if so, to what extent;
(i) where the measures referred to in Article 58(2) have been ordered against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with those measures;

(j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or to certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42; and
(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.

For its part, Article 76 "Sanctions and corrective measures" of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act) provides:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria established in paragraph 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account:
a) The continuous nature of the infringement.

b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.
c) The benefits obtained as a result of committing the infringement.
d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the commission of the infringement.

e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the violation, which cannot be attributed to the acquiring entity.
f) The violation of the rights of minors.
g) The availability, when not mandatory, of a data protection officer.
h) Voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.

In the present case, considering the seriousness of the potential violation, especially considering the consequences its commission has on those affected, a fine would be imposed, in addition to the adoption of measures, if appropriate.

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR. To guarantee these principles, FSEOM's sales volume (€) is considered as a preliminary consideration.

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence currently available,

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 19/25

Resolution to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following circumstances, contemplated in the aforementioned provisions.

As a preliminary matter, it is deemed that the following circumstances apply:

• The nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the
nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered (Article 83.2, letter a) of the GDPR): due to improper access to the
personal data of (...) natural persons: (...), due to not having the appropriate technical or organizational measures to prevent an incident such as the one that gave rise to this procedure.
• The categories of personal data affected by the

breach (Article 83.2(g) of the GDPR): Among the data affected by the
breach were health data of patients participating in the Project
"\*\*\*PROJECT.1".

Likewise, the following grading factors are considered as aggravating factors:

• The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data (Article 76.2, letter b) of the LOPDGDD):
FSEOM is an organization dedicated to collecting health data on a specific pathology, and is therefore accustomed to processing personal data.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, allows for the initial imposition of an administrative fine of €70,000.00.

VII
Corrective Measures

If the violation is confirmed, the resolution issued may establish the corrective measures that the offending entity must adopt to end the non-compliance with personal data protection legislation, in this case Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 58.2.d) of the GDPR, according to which each supervisory authority may "order the controller or processor to ensure that processing operations comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period..."

Thus, the responsible entity may be required to bring its actions into compliance with personal data protection regulations, within the scope expressed in the previous Legal Basis.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 20/25

This document establishes the alleged violation committed and the facts that could give rise to this potential breach of data protection regulations. From this, it is clear what measures to be adopted, without prejudice to the sanctioned party's responsibility to implement the specific procedures, mechanisms, or instruments. The data controller is fully familiar with its organization and must decide, based on proactive responsibility and a risk-based approach, how to comply with the GDPR and the LOPDGDD.

However, in this case, regardless of the foregoing, in accordance with the evidence currently available regarding the agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, the resolution adopted may require FUNDACION SEOM to adopt the following measures within three months from the date of the final resolution of this procedure:

- Prove the effective implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures, not only to comply with the regulations, but also to demonstrate compliance before the supervisory authorities and interested parties.

The imposition of these measures is compatible with the sanction of an administrative fine, as provided in Article 83.2 of the GDPR.

Please be advised that failure to comply with the possible order to adopt measures imposed by this body in the resolution of this sanctioning procedure may be considered an administrative infraction pursuant to the provisions of the GDPR, classified as an infraction in Articles 83.5 and 83.6. Such conduct may lead to the opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.

Please also remember that neither the acknowledgment of the infraction committed nor, where applicable, the voluntary payment of the proposed amounts exempts you from the obligation to adopt the relevant measures to cease the conduct or correct the effects of the infraction committed, nor from the obligation to prove compliance with this obligation to this AEPD.

Therefore, in light of the above, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency,
HAS RESOLVED:

FIRST: TO INITIATE SANCTIONING PROCEEDINGS against FUNDACIÓN SOCIEDAD
CIENTÍFICA DE ONCOLOGÍA MÉDICA, with NIF G07324239, for the alleged violation of Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, as defined in Article 83.5 of the GDPR.

In accordance with the provisions of Article 85 of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Code), it may acknowledge its liability within the period granted for the formulation of allegations to this initiation agreement; this will entail a 20% reduction in the appropriate penalty imposed in this procedure. With the application of this reduction, the penalty would be set at €56,000.00, and the procedure would be resolved with the imposition of this penalty.

Likewise, at any time prior to the resolution of this procedure, the court may voluntarily pay the proposed penalty, which will result in a 20% reduction in its amount. With the application of this reduction, the penalty would be set at €56,000.00, and its payment would terminate the procedure, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding measures.

The reduction for voluntary payment of the penalty is cumulative with the reduction applicable for acknowledgment of liability, provided that this acknowledgment of liability is made clear within the period granted for submitting allegations at the opening of the procedure. Voluntary payment of the amount referred to in the preceding paragraph may be made at any time prior to the resolution. In this case, if both reductions were to be applied, the penalty would be set at €42,000.00.

In any case, the effectiveness of either of the aforementioned reductions will be conditioned upon the express withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the sanction.

For these purposes, if you choose either of them, you must send the
General Subdirectorate of Data Inspection express notification of your withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the penalty, indicating which of the two reductions you are choosing, or whether you are choosing both.

If you choose to voluntarily pay any of the amounts indicated above (€56,000.00 or €42,000.00), you must do so by depositing it into account IBAN: ES00-0000-0000-0000-0000-0000

SECOND: On January 15, 2025, FSOM proceeded to pay the penalty
in the amount of €42,000.00, making use of the two reductions provided for in the
initiation agreement transcribed above, which implies recognition of liability in relation to the events referred to in the initiation agreement and

their legal qualification.

THIRD: FSOM has expressly waived any administrative action or appeal against the sanction.

FOURTH: The initiation agreement transcribed above indicated that, if the violation was confirmed, it could be agreed that the controller would be required to adopt appropriate measures to bring its actions into compliance with the regulations mentioned in this act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 58.2 d) of the GDPR, according to which each supervisory authority may "order the controller or processor to ensure that processing operations comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specific manner and within a specified period...".

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II
Termination of the Procedure

## Article 85 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), under the heading "Termination of Sanctioning Procedures" provides the following:

"1. Once a sanctioning procedure has been initiated, if the offender acknowledges responsibility, the procedure may be terminated with the imposition of the appropriate sanction.

2. When the sanction is solely monetary in nature, or when a monetary sanction and a non-monetary sanction may be imposed, but the inadmissibility of the latter has been justified, voluntary payment by the alleged offender, at any time prior to the resolution, will entail the termination of the procedure, except with regard to restoring the altered situation or determining compensation for damages caused by the commission of the offense. Infraction.

3. In both cases, when the sanction is solely monetary in nature, the competent body to resolve the procedure will apply reductions of at least 20% on the amount of the proposed sanction, which may be combined.
These reductions must be specified in the notification of initiation of the procedure, and their effectiveness will be conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the sanction.

The percentage reduction provided for in this section may be increased by regulation.

III
Voluntary Payment and Acknowledgment of Liability

In accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 85 of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Code), the notified initiation agreement

informed the public about the possibility of acknowledging liability and voluntarily paying the proposed penalty, which would entail two cumulative reductions of 20% each. With the application of these two reductions, the penalty would be set at €42,000.00, and its payment would imply

the termination of the procedure, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding measures.

Following notification of the aforementioned initiation agreement, FSOM has proceeded to acknowledge liability and voluntarily pay the penalty, accepting the two reductions provided and expressly waiving any action or appeal through administrative channels.

It should be noted that, in accordance with the provisions of the LPACAP, as well as the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on this matter, the exercise of voluntary payment by the alleged liable party does not exempt the administration from its obligation to resolve and notify all proceedings, regardless of their method of initiation. Similarly, Article 88 of the aforementioned law establishes that the resolution that concludes the proceedings will decide all issues raised by the interested parties and any other issues arising from them.

Therefore, in accordance with applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for graduating the sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: TO DECLARE the commission of the violations and CONFIRM the sanctions determined in the operative section of the initiation agreement transcribed in this

resolution.

The sum of the aforementioned amounts results in a total of 70,000.00 euros.

After FUNDACIÓN SOCIEDAD CIENTÍFICA DE ONCOLOGÍA MÉDICA made prompt payment and acknowledged liability, pursuant to

## Article 85 of the LPACAP, the aforementioned total is reduced by 40%, resulting in the final amount of 42,000.00 euros.

SECOND: DECLARE the termination of procedure EXP202416691, in accordance with the provisions of Article 85 of the LPACAP.

THIRD: ORDER the SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY OF MEDICAL ONCOLOGY FOUNDATION to notify the Agency of the adoption of the measures described in the legal grounds of the initiation agreement transcribed in this resolution within 3 months of this resolution becoming final and enforceable.

FOURTH: NOTIFY the SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY OF MEDICAL ONCOLOGY FOUNDATION of this resolution.

FIFTH: In accordance with the provisions of Article 85 of the LPACAP, which conditions the reduction for voluntary payment and acknowledgment of liability on the withdrawal or waiver of any action or appeal through administrative channels, this authority accepts the waiver expressly stated by the SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY OF MEDICAL ONCOLOGY FOUNDATION. Consequently, no optional appeal for reconsideration may be filed against this resolution, all of which is without prejudice to the possibility of resorting to contentious-administrative jurisdiction.

Consequently, taking into account the provisions of Article 90 of the LPACAP, given that no appeal may be made through administrative channels after expressly waiving this resolution, this resolution shall become final and fully enforceable upon notification.

However, in accordance with the provisions of Article 90.3.a) of the LPACAP, a final administrative decision may be suspended as a precautionary measure if the interested party expresses their intention to file an administrative appeal. If this is the case, the interested party must formally notify this fact in writing to the Spanish Data Protection Agency, submitting it through the Agency's Electronic Registry \[https://sedeagpd.gob.es/sede-electronica-web/\], or through any of the other registries provided for in Article 16.4 of the aforementioned Law 39/2015, of October 1. They must also forward to the Agency the documentation proving the effective filing of the administrative appeal. If the
Agency does not become aware of the filing of the administrative appeal within two months from the day following notification of this resolution, it will terminate the precautionary suspension.

In accordance with Article 50 of the LOPDGDD (Organic Law on Data Protection), this

Resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.
