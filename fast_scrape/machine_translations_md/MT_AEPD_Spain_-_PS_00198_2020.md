## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a sanction procedure started by the AEPD against the defendant due to a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that, since 2015, the defendant (i) not only has used the phone number of the claimant to train its employees, but also (ii) it has unauthorizedly accessed his/her client profile and (iii) has sent him/her a big amount of SMS and even made 534 phone calls from number 1002. The claimant attached the SMS and phone calls as evidence of his/her claim.

### Dispute

The defendant answered to the AEPD investigation requests stating that, in June 2020, it sent an email to the claimant informing that new measures have been taken in order to block the calling phone number (1002); it also stated that it has checked the detail of the SMS provided by the claimant as an evidence and, although some measures have been already taken in order to avoid such situation, those measures have been strengthened. The defendant also declared that it has included technical measures in order to prevent commercial agents and any business area to manually call the claimant; between such measures, the defendant included an information message ("This phone number is related to a real client, so any unlawful use is forbidden"). The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Without prejudice to the results of the final investigations corresponding to the sanction procedure, the AEPD understood that the defendant could have breached the lawfulness of processing principle as per article 6(1) GDPR: on the basis of the available evidences, and although the defendant admitted its mistake and declared that new measures in order to avoid such situations have been taken, it did not prove the lawfulness of the data processing. Consequently, after considering some aggravating circumstances \[(i) there is a negligence by the defendant, (ii) basic personal data have been affected, (iii) there has been a continuous breach, and (iv) there is a clear connection between the busines activity of the defendant and the processing of personal data related to clients and third parties\], the AEPD understood that, in case the sanction procedure resulted in a successful decision, this infringement would be fined with 75,000 € to the defendant. In this sense, the AEPD offered the defendant the possibility to settle the issue before the decision takes place by agreeing to a voluntary payment of part of the fine with two possible discounts: (i) acknowledging of its liability (60,000 €) and early voluntary payment (45,000 €). The defendant agreed to both concepts, so it paid 45,000 € and the sanction procedure was closed by the AEPD.
