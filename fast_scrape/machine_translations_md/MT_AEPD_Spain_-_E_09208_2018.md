## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against Niantic, a software developer, regarding their interactive game "Pokemon Go".

Pokemon GO is a game in which users interact with the real world, so they share their location in order to walk the map. This include sharing their user data with others when they go to specific locations called "gyms", in which they play together with others. For that, a user needs to be at least at 500m from the site. Therefore, their real location is also known.

However, some users fake their real location, so they can access the gyms from further away. Therefore, the location of other users may be also shared not only with regular players but with players that are faking their location.

From this data, that can easily indicate where a person lives or works, malicious users could access this information and also infer the real identity of these subjects, what may lead to harassment or stalking. It is important to note that a big number of players of the game are minors, what increases the risk.

The complainant had asked Niantic to avoid sharing location data with users that were known to be faking their location.

Niantic stated that they have a security policy in place that tries to tackle that problem. Players who are detected to use these methods are warned with a three-strikes mechanism. They have other additional measures, such as information about the data that is shared, a recommendation not to provide your real name, the lack of a chat where users can directly interact, prohibitions on harassing and misuse, limited sharing of data, and different privacy options and information.

### Holding

The AEPD considered that the controller had correctly assessed the risks and implemented adequate measures to mitigate them. Their three-strikes mechanism for users that fake their location is deemed to be enough to deal with the alleged risk. Therefore, the DPA decided to archive the case.

## Comment

Even if the facts of the case have a logical connection with other GDPR Articles, such as Article 32 GDPR, about the security of processing, the AEPD did not consider its content, but limited their analysis to, and only referred to Article 6 GDPR and the lawfulness of the processing.

a pokemon impossible to defeat individually so they must meet in
specific points what makes them known, where they work, etc., for this reason
providing data about a player gives information to know what natural person he is.

game and even in real life (even minors, who are many who play
habitually).

players who falsify their situation to which Niantic has not replied.

    In relation to the procedures to falsify the identity or position of a
certain player to whom data of other players can be provided
supposedly close to this, the representatives of the entity state that

Niantic UK is aware that certain players engage in conduct
fraudulent or cheating that includes the falsification of the location (what is
called GPS location spoofing). These behaviors
violate Niantic's Terms of Service.

    Niantic UK is committed to creating a gaming experience
friendly and fair to all players and, as part of that commitment, executes
a three-touch policy against said fraudulent practices or
cheating of players who discover that they are practicing impersonation of

Location.
    In relation to the mechanisms used to prevent harassment of other players,

avoid publishing your nickname by relating it to your real name. "

    Regarding harassment of players based specifically on information

                              FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                              I

       In accordance with the investigative and corrective powers that article 58 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter
RGPD) grants each control authority, and according to the provisions of article 47 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and

28001 - Madrid 6 sedeagpd.gob.es 6/7

guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), is competent to
resolve these investigative actions by the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection.

                                                 II

        In accordance with the provisions of article 55 of the RGPD, the Agency
Spanish Data Protection is competent to perform the functions that

are assigned to it in its article 57, among them, that of enforcing the Regulation and
promote the awareness of those responsible and those in charge of the treatment
about their obligations, as well as dealing with claims
submitted by an interested party and investigate the reason for them.

        It is also the responsibility of the Spanish Data Protection Agency to exercise
the powers of investigation regulated in article 58.1 of the same legal text, between
those that include the power to order the controller and the person in charge of the treatment that
provide any information required for the performance of their duties.

        Correlatively, article 31 of the RGPD establishes the obligation of the

data controllers and processors to cooperate with the supervisory authority
that he requests it in the performance of his functions. In the event that these have
appointed a data protection officer, Article 39 of the RGPD attributes to
this the function of cooperating with said authority.

        Similarly, the domestic legal system also provides for the possibility
to open a period of information or previous actions. In this sense, the article
55 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of the
Public Administrations, grants this power to the competent body in order to
know the circumstances of the specific case and whether or not to start the

process.

                                                 III

        In the present case, the claim submitted has been received at this Agency
by the claimant against the defendant for the alleged violation of article 6 of the

RGPD that guarantees the legality of the treatment.

        In the present case, the claimant has asked the defendant not to provide his
geographical location to players who falsify theirs.

        In accordance with the regulations set forth, prior to admission to
processing this claim, the Subdirectorate General for Data Inspection proceeded to
carrying out preliminary investigation actions to clarify the
facts that are the subject of the claim.

        As a result of the investigations carried out by the Agency, the claimed
states that he is aware that certain players carry out behaviors
fraudulent or cheating that includes the falsification of the location (what is
called GPS location spoofing). These behaviors

violate the Claimed's Terms of Service.
