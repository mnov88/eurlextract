                             Report on the supervisory matter

                             The Privacy Protection Authority (IMY) has initiated supervision regarding Rebtel Networks AB
                             (the company) in connection with a complaint. The complaint has been submitted to IMY, i

                             as the responsible supervisory authority in accordance with Article 56 of the Data Protection Regulation.
                             The transfer has taken place from the supervisory authority in the country where the complainant has left
                             lodged its complaint (Spain) in accordance with the provisions of the Regulation on cooperation

                             in cross-border treatment.

                             The complaint alleges that the complainant unsuccessfully tried to persuade the company

                             to stop sending unsolicited emails after deleting her account. She

                               mail, but it has not worked either. Against this background, she believes that

                               the company has breached its obligations under Article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation.

                               Rebtel Networks AB has mainly stated the following.

                               The company received a request for deletion from the complainant on September 18, 2019. I
                               subsequently, however, it can be stated that it was not handled as a request for deletion

                               under the Data Protection Regulation, even if certain data were deleted. This is
                               the reason for further e-mail in the form of a reminder of a survey for

                               customer survey has been sent to the complainant. This has happened during the period up to
                               and with effect from 1 October 2019, ie not after the deadline of one month
                               applies under the Data Protection Regulation to comply with a deletion request.

                               Remaining data was deleted on November 9, 2020, except for those that are
                               necessary to be able to handle the current supervisory matter. The company informed

                               complainant about this on 20 November 2020.

                               Due to this supervisory matter, the company has taken special measures to
                               strengthen their established processes and procedures for identifying a request under
                               the Data Protection Regulation. This includes above all that further training of its

                               customer service agents. The company has further improved its so-called data triggers in its
                               customer service tools. The company's investigation of the complainant's case showed that it did not
                               had been flagged as a matter under the Data Protection Regulation as the data application did not

                               perceived any reference to the Data Protection Regulation in Spanish.

                               The processing has taken place through correspondence. Given that it applies

                               cross-border treatment, IMY has used the mechanisms of cooperation
                               and uniformity contained in Chapter VII of the Data Protection Regulation. Affected

                               regulators have been the data protection authorities in Spain, Germany, Norway,
                               Italy and France.

                               Justification of decision

                               Applicable regulations

                               According to Article 12 (3) of the Data Protection Regulation, the controller shall:
                               request without undue delay and in any case no later than one month after
                               to have received the request to provide the data subject with information on the measures taken

                               taken in accordance with Article 17. This period may, if necessary, be extended by a further two
                               months, taking into account the complexity of the request and the number received

                               requests. The personal data controller shall notify the data subject of a
                               such extension within one month of receipt of the request and state the reasons
                               to the delay.

                               According to Article 17 (1) (a), the data subject shall have the right to be informed by the controller
                               without undue delay have their personal data deleted and it

                               the person responsible for personal data shall be obliged to delete without undue delay
                               personal data if the personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which

                               which they have collected or otherwise treated. According to Article 17 (3) (b), this shall not be the case
                               apply to the extent that the processing is necessary to comply with a legal
                               obligation requiring treatment under Union law.Integrity Protection Authority Record number: DI-2020-10561 3 (5)
                               Date: 2021-03-23

                               The Integrity Protection Authority's assessment

                               Has there been a breach of the Data Protection Regulation?

                               The company has stated that the reason for the complainant's request for deletion of the 18th
                               September 2019 was not handled until November 9, 2020 due to the company not

                               perceived it as a request for deletion.

                               In the IMY's view, however, it has been made clear in the request that it

                               registered wanted to exercise their right to deletion. Because some data was deleted
                               only on 9 November 2020 did Rebtel Networks AB process personal data in violation
                               with Article 17 of the Data Protection Regulation by not without undue delay first it

                               9 November 2020 delete the personal data requested by the complainant on 18
                               September 2019. However, the company has been justified in retaining the information needed for

                               to be able to show that the request has been handled in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation.

                               The company has stated that no further e-mails have been sent since October 2, 2019

                               and that this is within the time limit of one month provided for in Article 12 (3) and 17
                               the Data Protection Regulation. However, the company was incorrect in its reply to the complainant on 22
                               September 2019 stated that the information had been deleted and that the complainant would not receive

                               a few more mailings. Rebtel Networks AB thereby violates Article 12 (3)
                               Data Protection Regulation provided incorrect information on what measures - that the data

                               had been deleted - which has been taken as a result of the complainant's request.

                               Despite the fact that the company, on 22 September 2019, informed the complainant that no more e-

                               mailing if customer satisfaction should take place, the complainant has received another four
                               such mailings. The four mailings were made on 22 and 25 September and on 1 and 2

                               October 2019. However, the IMY notes that this is a relatively short time after
                               request for deletion was made and considers that it is within the time limit
                               the company had undertaken to take action if the request had been handled correctly.

                               Choice of intervention
