## English Summary

### Facts

The AEPD received a letter filed by the interested party against the respondent stating that on 20 March 2019, he addressed requesting information on the fingerprint clocking control in accordance with the provisions of the regulations on the protection of personal data, without having received a response to this request.

The AEPD initiated an investigation procedure, to which the City Council responded with a Security Document in which it reports in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR and points out, among other things, that the body used a fingerprint detection system to control presence and access to its facilities, which does not perform a biometric analysis at any time, but rather produces an identification algorithm based on a reading of several points of the personal fingerprint and that the algorithm data cannot be decrypted or disassembled by any unauthorized entity.

And in response to a new request for information, the Council sent a report including the impact assessment on the processing of fingerprint data for the control of employee presence.

### Dispute

Is the use of biometric data to monitor working time without informing data subjects a breach of Article 13 GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD held that the facts complained of involving the violation by the City Council of the provisions of Article 13 of the RGPD, by not informing of the processing provided for in relation to the fingerprint clocking control.

As the investigated party is a public administration, the AEPD applies Article 77 LOPDGDD, according to which a warning sanction must be applied when the offence is committed by a public administration.

                                            IV
        In the present case, the claimant wrote to the defendant
requesting information on fingerprint control,

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/13

Considering that the regulations regarding the protection of
data without obtaining a response to said request.

       The documentation provided to the file does not contain the answer offered to the
claimant and, as stated in the second precedent in response to the
informative request sent by the AEPD the claimed provides Document is
Security in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD, noting that the body
local used this system of presence and access control to its facilities that
does not involve a biometric analysis at any time, but rather a

identification algorithm as a result of a reading of several points of the personal fingerprint and
that the algorithm data cannot be decrypted or disassembled by any
unauthorized entity. The report on Impact Assessment was also provided
in the treatment of the fingerprint data to control the presence of the
employees.

       In relation to the issues raised in this case, first of all
It should be noted that the implementation and integration of a time control system
based on the employer's fingerprint, must be informed to the
employees in a complete, clear, concise manner and, in addition, the aforementioned information must
be completed with reference to both the legal bases that cover said type

access control, as well as the basic information referred to in the
## Article 13 of the RGPD.

       In the case examined, it is true that the respondent's response to the
writing submitted by the claimant in which he requested to be informed of the moment in

that the information was provided to the workers of the fingerprint check-in system
fingerprint and reiterate such information.

       Second, the installation of a control system based on the collection
and treatment of the fingerprint of the employees implies the treatment of their data

personal since personal data is all that information about a person
physical identified or identifiable in accordance with article 4.1 of the RGPD.

       As for the fingerprint, it is also data that must be qualified.
two as biometric data and in accordance with article 4.14 of the RGPD have this
consideration when they have been “obtained from a technical treatment

specific, relating to the physical, physiological or behavioral characteristics of a
natural person that allow or confirm the unique identification of said person,
such as facial images or fingerprint data ”.

       This means that, in accordance with article 9.1 of the RGPD, in the case

present, the specific regime provided for special categories is applied to them
of data provided for in article 9 of the RGPD.

       In this sense, recital 51 of the RGPD highlights the nature of
restrictive with which the processing of these data can be admitted:

       “(51) ... Such personal data should not be processed, unless it is allowed
its treatment in specific situations contemplated in this Regulation,
given that Member States may lay down provisions

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/13

specific data protection in order to adapt the application of the

       “(52) Likewise, exceptions to the prohibition to treat

       In accordance with these considerations, the processing of biometric data from

special categories will require, in addition to the concurrence of one of the bases
legal provisions established in article 6 of the RGPD, any of the exceptions provided
in article 9.2 of the RGPD.

       The analysis of the legal basis of legitimacy to carry out this treatment comes

of article 6 of the RGPD, regarding the legality of the treatment, which in its section 1, letter
b) states: “The treatment will be lawful if at least one of the following is met
conditions: (…) b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in the
that the interested party is part of or for the application at his request of measures
pre-contractual (…) ”.

       By virtue of this precept, the treatment would be lawful and would not require the
consent, when the data processing is carried out for the fulfillment of
contractual relationships of a labor nature.

       This precept would also cover the data processing of the

public employees, even if their relationship is not strictly contractual. There are

the exceptions provided in article 9.2 of the RGPD that would allow lifting the

9.1. At this point, special mention must be made of letter b) of article 9.2 of the
RGPD, according to which the general prohibition of biometric data processing does not

a collective agreement in accordance with the law of the Member States that establishes
adequate guarantees of respect for fundamental rights and the interests of the

       In Spanish law, article 20 of the Consolidated Text of the Statute of
workers (TE), approved by Royal Legislative Decree 2/2015, of 23
October, foresees the possibility for the employer to adopt surveillance measures and
control to verify compliance with the labor obligations of their
workers:

       "3. The employer may adopt the measures he deems most appropriate in
surveillance and control to verify compliance by the worker with his obligations
and labor duties, keeping in their adoption and application the consideration due to
their dignity and taking into account, where appropriate, the actual capacity of the workers
with disabilities ”.

       And in the Basic Statute of the Public Employee, approved by Royal Decree
Legislative 5/2015, of October 30, in its article 54 in relation to the principles of
conduct of public employees indicates: “The unemployment of the tasks
corresponding to your job will be diligently enhanced and complying with the

established day and schedule "

       In any case, prior to the decision on the start-up

of such a control system and taking into account its implications,
processing of biometric data aimed at uniquely identifying a
natural person, it would be mandatory to carry out an impact assessment regarding the
protection of personal data to evaluate both the legitimacy of the

       Biometric data is closely linked to a person, given
who can use a certain unique property of an individual for their
identification or authentication.

       According to Opinion 3/2012 on the evolution of biometric technologies,

“Biometric data irrevocably changes the relationship between the body and the
identity, as they make the characteristics of the human body legible
by machines and are subject to further use. "

       In relation to them, the Opinion specifies that it is possible to distinguish different types of
treatments by stating that “Biometric data can be processed and stored in

different ways. Sometimes the biometric information captured from a person is
stored and treated raw, allowing the source from which it came to be recognized without
special knowledge; for example, a photograph of a face, a photograph of a
fingerprint or voice recording. Other times, raw biometric information
captured is treated in such a way that only certain characteristics or traits are extracted and

they are saved as a biometric template. "

       The processing of these data is expressly permitted by the RGPD
when the employer has a legal basis, which is usually his own
Work contract. In this regard, the STS of July 2, 2007 (Rec. 5017/2003), has

legitimately understood the treatment of biometric data carried out by the Administration
for the time control of its public employees, without requiring the
prior consent of workers.

       However, the following should be noted:

       O The worker must be informed about these treatments.

       O The principles of limitation of the purpose, necessity,
proportionality and data minimization.

       In any case, the treatment must also be adequate, pertinent and not
excessive in relation to that purpose. Therefore, biometric data other than
necessary for that purpose should be suppressed and creation will not always be justified.
of a biometric database (Opinion 3/2012 of the Art. 29 Working Group).

       O Use of biometric templates: Biometric data must be stored
as biometric templates whenever possible. The template should be taken from
a way that is specific to the biometric system in question and not used
by other data controllers of similar systems in order to ensure that

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/13

a person can only be identified in biometric systems that have
a legal basis for this operation.

       O The biometric system used and the security measures chosen must
ensure that reuse of the biometric data in question is not possible
for another purpose.

       O Mechanisms based on encryption technologies should be used, in order to
prevent unauthorized reading, copying, modification or deletion of biometric data.

       O Biometric systems should be designed so that they can be revoked
the identity bond.

       O You must choose to use data formats or specific technologies that

make it impossible to interconnect biometric databases and disclose data
not verified.

       O Biometric data should be deleted when they are not linked to the
purpose that motivated their treatment and, if possible, they should be implemented
automated data deletion mechanisms.
