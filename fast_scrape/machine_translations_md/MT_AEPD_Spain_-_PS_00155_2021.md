The Spanish DPA (AEPD) launched an investigation on Vodafone, following a complaint lodged by a data subject.

The AEPD, however, did not receive any response from Vodafone.

### Holding

The AEPD considered this behaviour as a hindering of their functions, and therefore decided to sanction Vodafone in accordance with Article 83(5)(e) GDPR, for the non-compliance with an order pursuant to [Article 58(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#1 "Article 58 GDPR").

For this infringement, the AEPD fined Vodafone €5000, that were reduced to €3000 for early payment and acknowledgement of responsibility.

                                              I

        in charge of the treatment access to all personal data and to all

        all the premises of the controller and the processor, including
        any equipment and means of data processing, in accordance with the

        Procedural law of the Union or of the Member States. "

                                             III

of greater amount.

For the purposes of the statute of limitations for infractions, the alleged infraction

prescribes after three years, in accordance with article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which qualifies as
the following conduct is very serious:

        “Ñ) Do not facilitate the access of the personnel of the data protection authority

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/10

procedure, it is considered that it is appropriate to impute the defendant for the violation

of article 58.1 of the RGPD typified in article 83.5 e) of the RGPD. The sanction that
it would be appropriate to impose an administrative fine.

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate
and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of article 83.1 of the RGPD. On

established in article 83.2 of the RGPD, and with the provisions of article 76 of the
LOPDGDD, regarding section k) of the aforementioned article 83.2 RGPD.

        of a company that is not newly created and should have
        procedures established for the fulfillment of the obligations that
        contemplates the data protection regulations, among them, to respond to

        the requirements of the supervisory authority.

        - Art. 83.2 k) RGPD: any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the

        circumstances of the case, such as the financial benefits obtained or the
        losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement. The
        claim refers to the particular case of a person, but the

        data processing to which it refers, can potentially affect a
        very high number of clients of the responsible entity or users of the

        service provided by the responsible entity.
