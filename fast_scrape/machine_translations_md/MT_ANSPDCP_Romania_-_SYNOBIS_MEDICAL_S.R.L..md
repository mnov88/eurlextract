The decision below is a machine translation of the Romanian original. Please refer to the Romanian original for more details.

10.12.2024 Sanction for non-compliance with Law no. 506/2004 and GDPR

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in October 2024, an investigation at the operator SYNOBIS MEDICAL S.R.L. and found:

a) violation of the provisions of art. 13 paragraph (1) letter i) of Law no. 506/2004 on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector, as subsequently amended and supplemented.

b) violation of the provisions of art. 12-14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

For the acts committed, the operator was fined 10,000 lei, as well as given a warning.

The investigation of the sanctioned operator was initiated following a complaint regarding a possible violation of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Law no. 506, as amended and supplemented, through the website www.synobis.ro, owned by SYNOBIS MEDICAL S.R.L., which did not offer the possibility of access without accepting the collection of information through cookie technologies nor did it ensure the information of the data subjects, according to the legal provisions in the field.

During the investigation, it was found that the operator SYNOBIS MEDICAL S.R.L.:

a) allowed the storage of information and obtaining access to the information stored on users' equipment by using cookie files available on the website www.synobis.ro, without complying with the legal conditions regarding the prior obtaining of express consent and without informing users, as provided for in art. 4 para. (5) of Law no. 506/2004, as amended and supplemented;

b) does not provide complete information to the data subjects whose personal data are collected and processed through the website www.synobis.ro, in accordance with art. 12-14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

At the same time, the following corrective measures have been ordered:

a) the operator shall actively implement the provisions of art. 4 paragraph (5) of Law no. 506/2004, as amended and supplemented, by obtaining express consent and informing users before installing cookies on their device;

b) the operator shall provide complete information to the data subjects on the website www.synobis.ro, in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and simple language, on each section of the website where personal data may be collected/processed, in accordance with the provisions of art. 12-14 of the GDPR, the information will be mainly in Romanian.
