## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject, employed by SC Piramida Trade Invest SRL (the controller) presented a complaint to the DPA for unlawful monitoring of employees in the workplace.

### Holding

The DPA found several violations. First, the controller had not sufficiently informed its employees of the monitoring, and had not proven that it used less intrusive means prior to the implementation of video surveillance. The DPA considered the processing unlawful under [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR") and [6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR").

Furthermore, the controller was unable to prove that it responded to employee access requests on time. The controller did not provide the employees with the audio-video recordings requested. The DPA considered this a violation of [Articles 12(3)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR"), [Article 15](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"), [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR") and [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR").

Finally, the controller did not implement appropriate measures to ensure data security. According to the DPA’s investigations, the controller installed a filter to resent messages from one email address to another. This led to the disclosure of employee documentation (including medical files) to persons outside of the company. The DPA considered this a violation of [Article 32(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1 "Article 32 GDPR").

The DPA fined the controller RON 15,219 (€3,000) in total: RON 10,146 (€2,000) for the violation of [Article 5(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1 "Article 5 GDPR") and [6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"), and RON 5,076 (€1,000) for the violation of [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR"), [17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR") and [21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR"). The DPA also issued a warning for the violation of [Article 32(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1 "Article 32 GDPR"). The DPA ordered the controller to implement corrective measures. These included removing the cameras that monitored employees inside the building, and to respond to the data requests.

## English Machine Translation of the Decision

The decision below is a machine translation of the Romanian original. Please refer to the Romanian original for more details.

26.06.2025 Sanctions for violation of the GDPR

The National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing completed, in May 2025, an investigation at the operator SC Piramida Trade Invest SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) letter a) and art. 6 para. (1), art. 12 para. (3), art. 15. art. 17 and art. 21 and art. 32 para. (1) letter b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

As such, the operator was sanctioned for a misdemeanor:

1. with a fine in the amount of 10,146 lei (equivalent to the amount of 2,000 EURO), for violating the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) letter a) and art. 6 para. (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;

2. with a fine of 5,073 lei (equivalent to 1,000 EURO), for violating the provisions of art. 12 paragraph (3), art. 15, art. 17 and art. 21 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;

3. with a warning for violating the provisions of art. 32 paragraph (1) letter b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

The investigation was initiated following a complaint submitted by a natural person reporting possible violations of the processing of personal data regarding the monitoring of employees through audio-video surveillance systems.

During the investigation, the National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing found that the operator did not provide mandatory, complete and explicit prior information to its employees. At the same time, it did not prove that it had previously used other less intrusive forms and methods to achieve the intended purpose. Consequently, the personal data were not processed in a lawful, fair and transparent manner towards the data subject ("legality, fairness and transparency"), which represents a violation of the provisions of art. 5 para. (1) let. a) and art. 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and is subject to a fine of 2,000 euros.

At the same time, during the investigation it emerged that the operator did not provide proof that it had responded to the data subject's requests to exercise the rights of access, deletion and opposition from a certain period, within one month of their receipt. In addition, the employer did not provide the copy of the audio-video recordings from that period that was requested by the employee. Therefore, this situation represents a violation of the provisions of art. 12 paragraph (3), art. 15, art. 17 and art. 21 of Regulation (EU) 679/2016 and the operator was fined 1,000 euros.

Also, during the investigation it was found that the company was allowed to install, without the operator's knowledge, a filter for forwarding messages from one email address to another email address. This led to the disclosure of a data subject's documents (which included medical documents) to persons outside the company. As such, the operator did not demonstrate that it had adopted appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and continuous resilience of the systems and services processing personal data, which constitutes a violation of the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) letter b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. For this act, the operator was sanctioned with a warning.

At the same time, pursuant to the provisions of art. 58 para. (2) letter c) and d) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following corrective measures were also ordered:

taking the necessary measures so that, in the future, the compliance of the processing operations with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is ensured, namely the video cameras installed outside the building record images only from the perimeter of the company Piramida Trade Invest SRL. At the same time, it was ordered to eliminate the use of video surveillance cameras installed in offices, in the warehouse and in the production hall, for which there is no express legal basis for processing according to art. 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679; providing full information to all data subjects, in relation to all activities involving the processing of personal data, by providing all the information provided for in art. 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as the case may be, and in compliance with the conditions provided for in art. 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679; adopting internal procedures regarding the manner of resolving requests submitted by data subjects pursuant to the provisions of art. 12-22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, complying in all cases with the applicable provisions regarding the analysis and resolution of these requests without delay and the communication of responses to data subjects within the legal deadlines, as well as regular training of the operator's staff in this regard; ensuring compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of personal data processing operations in order to implement an appropriate internal policy for identifying risks, analyzing them and notifying the National Supervisory Authority in the event of a security breach, under the conditions provided for in art. 33 para. (1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, including in terms of appropriate training of persons who process data under the authority or on behalf of Piramida Trade Invest SRL (employees, collaborators, authorized persons, etc.); sending a response to the data subject to requests for exercising the right of access, opposition and deletion requested by him.
