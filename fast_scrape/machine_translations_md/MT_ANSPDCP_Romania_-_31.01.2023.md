## English Summary

### Facts

Based on a data subject's complaint, the Romanian DPA started investigations into a dental practice and a collaborating dentist (the controllers). The data subject had alleged that they had disclosed his health data online without his consent.

It found that the controllers disclosed medical information concerning the data subject's orthodontic treatment, consisting of a set of photographs and radiographs that could be correlated with the person's name, by in a published article on a specialized blog. The personal data had been published for scientific and commercial purposes.

In contradiction to [Article 33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR"), despite the fact that the dental practice was informed by the data subject about the unauthorized disclosure of his personal health data, the controller did not notify DPA within 72 hours of the security breach.

At the same time, the DPA found that the collaborating dentist published personal data regarding the state of health of the data subject in an article posted in a personal blog, without obtaining the express consent of to the data subject and without informing the data subject.

The DPA held that both controller's violated the GDPR.

The dental practise violated the GDPR by not informing the DPA of the data breach within 72 hours and, thereby, violated [Article 33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR").

The dentist who was collaborating with the dental practise, violated Articles 6(1), and 9(2)(a) GDPR by publishing the data subject's health data without consent. Moreover, by failing to inform the data subject about the publication the dentist also violated Articles 12, 13, and 14 GDPR.

The DPA fined each of them respectively 4,919 lei (approx. €1000). Additionally, both controllers were ordered to implement corrective measures to come into compliance with the GDPR.

The dental practice applied the corrective measure by implementing technical and organizational security measures appropriate to the specifics of the processing and identified risks and training authorized persons and other persons who process data under its authority.

The dentist implemented corrective measures by ensuring that the processing of patients' personal data is conducted in strict compliance with the legal provisions regarding the laws on medical services and data protection. Additionally, in the case of the use of patient's personal data for other purposes, the dentist would comply with all the legal conditions on processing personal data.
