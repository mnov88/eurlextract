## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a sanction procedure started by the AEPD against the defendant due to a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that the defendant had sent him a message thanking the acquisition of a new phone line he/she did not recognize; after checking this point in the mobile app of the defendant, the claimant discovered that the defendant (acting through an agency) had unlawfully used his personal and banking details in order to produce a contract without his/her consent, as its commercial procedure is the following: the agency buys prepaid cards in the name of its clients in order to authorize portability to Vodafone.

### Dispute

The defendant answered to the AEPD investigation requests stating that the whole situation is due to an isolated behaviour of the agency, as the defendant, always following strict procedures, was fully convinced of the veracity of the portability contract (which was not signed, and in which the agency had included the personal data of the claimant without his/her consent), and so it has been “a victim” of the bad practices of the agency; the defendant also stated that there is no intentionality on its side, and that it totally rejects the behaviour of the agency, as such unlawful activity would be punished according to the commercial agreement between both companies. The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Without prejudice to the results of the final investigations corresponding to the sanction procedure, the AEPD understood that the defendant could have breached the lawfulness of processing principle as per article 6(1) GDPR: on the basis of the available evidences, the defendant did not take the due diligences to avoid such situation, and it did not prove the lawfulness of the data processing. Consequently, after considering some aggravating circumstances \[(i) there is a negligence/intentionality by the defendant, and (iii) basic personal data have been affected\], the AEPD understood that, in case the sanction procedure resulted in a successful decision, this infringement would be fined with 60,000 € to the defendant. In this sense, the AEPD offered the defendant the possibility to settle the issue before the decision takes place by agreeing to a voluntary payment of part of the fine with a possible discount (48,000 €). The defendant agreed, so it paid 48,000 € and the sanction procedure was closed by the AEPD.

"Organic Law 3/2018, on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee ofDigital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading " Infractionsconsidered very serious ” provides:"one. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions thatsuppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, inin particular, the following:(…)b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of theconditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of theRegulation (EU) 2016/679. "IIIThe documentation in the file provides evidence that theclaimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD , since it processed thepersonal data of the claimant without having any legitimacy to do so. TheClaimant's personal data were incorporated into the information systemsof the company, without having proven that he had legitimately hired,had your consent for the collection and subsequent treatment of yourpersonal data, or there is any other cause that makes the treatment lawfuleffected.The Administrative Litigation Chamber of the National Court, inassumptions such as the one presented here, it has considered that when the owner of thedata denies the contract, the burden of proof corresponds to whoever affirms theirexistence and the person responsible for the data processing of third parties must collect andkeep the necessary documentation to prove the consent of the owner.We cite, for all, the SAN of 05/31/2006 (Rec. 539/2004), Basis of LawFourth.On the other hand, there is evidence, in the contract provided by the claimant, thatthe portability contract was made in the physical store of the claimed and that thecontract is without signatures.C / Jorge Juan, 6www.aepd.es28001 - Madridsedeagpd.gob.es

6/11Although the company states that portability does not occur if it is missingany of the signatures, the contract obtained by the claimant through the applicationfor Vodafone mobiles contains all the spaces intended for the signatures of theblank headlines.However, and this is essential, the defendant does not prove the standing tothe treatment of the claimant's data.Respect for the principle of legality that is in the essence of fundamental rightprotection of personal data requires that it be proven that theresponsible for the treatment deployed the necessary diligence to prove thatextreme. If this Agency does not act in this way - and if this Agency does not demand it, it is incumbent uponfor compliance with the regulations governing the data protection right ofpersonal character - the result would be to empty the principle of legality of content.IVIn accordance with the provisions of the RGPD in its art. 83.1 and 83.2, when deciding theimposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case will betake into account the aggravating and mitigating factors that are listed in the articleindicated, as well as any other that may be applicable to the circumstances of thecase."Each supervisory authority will guarantee that the imposition of finesadministrative pursuant to this article for the infractions of thisRegulations indicated in paragraphs 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual caseeffective, proportionate and dissuasive.
