## English Summary

### Facts

Three customers filed a complaint with the Greek DPA against a company (the Company) for processing their personal data for a purpose other than the one for which their data was collected in the first place. The personal data was initially collected during the purchases of goods. The customers claimed that the Company contacted them in order to promote other products and services without respecting their opt-out requests. The Company was claiming that they had contacted the data subjects for a customer satisfaction survey after having obtained their consent.

### Holding

The Greek DPA held that the processing of the customers' data to promote other services and goods constituted use of personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data was originally collected. Although the Company had argued that they had obtained the customers' oral consent to such processing during the sale of the goods, the Greek DPA found that the Company was unable to prove it.

The Greek DPA also considered whether or not the criteria of [Article 6(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") had been respected. In this respect, the DPA found that the customers had not been properly informed during the data collection stage about the identity of the controller, and about the fact that their personal data could have been used for an additional purpose.

The Greek DPA also found that the objections of the customers to the further processing of their personal data for marketing purposes had not been respected, in violation of [Article 21 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR "Article 21 GDPR"). The DPA found in particular that the Company did not respect the customers' opt-out requests and did not provide appropriate documents or policies to prove that they would have been able to respond to such requests.

The Greek DPA therefore imposed a fine of €20,000 for the violations found, taken into consideration the duration and the intensity of the violations.

## Comment

What is interesting in this case is that the controller claimed that they processed personal data for marketing purposes (promotion of products) based on data subjects' oral consent obtained during the purchase of products. The DPA couldn't find evidence to suggest that consent was given. Therefore, in the absence of evidence, it cannot be accepted that consent was used as the legal basis of this processing. The DPA stated that it could accept legitimate interest as a legal basis, given the soft opt-in exception. Given though that the processing was carried out for a purpose different that the one for which the personal data was collected in first place, the Greek DPA held that article 6(4) and 5 of the GDPR must be respected. In this specific case at least appropriate information should have been provided to data subject at the data collection stage so that data subjects know that their personal data will be used for an additional purpose, while at the same time providing them with the opportunity to express their objections.
