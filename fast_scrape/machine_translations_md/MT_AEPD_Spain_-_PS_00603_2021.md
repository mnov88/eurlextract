## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a complaint against Lia's Clothes (an online clothes store) stating that the website did not have an adequate privacy policy or cookie banner.

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) initiated an investigation, and determined that once data subjects were prompted to introduce their personal data, there was indeed no information provided related to the protection of personal data, or a link to a privacy policy.

The AEPD also verified that when entering the website, non-essential cookies such as Google Analytics are used, without an adequate banner informing data subjects about their use, the possibility to reject them, or consent to them in a differentiated granular manner.

### Holding

The AEPD held that by processing personal data without the data subject’s clear, affirmative, informed and free consent, or any other valid legal basis, the online store had violated [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR").

The AEPD also held that the online store had violated its obligation under [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") to provide data subjects information related to the processing of their personal data when collected from them, in particular by not having a privacy policy and not disclosing any details as to who the controller of that personal data would be.

Lastly, the AEPD held that the online store’s use of non-essential cookies without having a cookie banner violated Article 22.2 of the [Spanish Law of Information Society Services (LSSI)](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2002-13758), which establishes that clear and complete information on the use of cookies and the purposes of the data processing must be provided to data subjects, as well as the possibility to reject non-essential cookies.

Taking into account that the online store was owned by a private individual, the AEPD issued a fine of €1000 for the each of the three aforementioned violations, for a total fine of €3000. Due to the fact that the individual voluntarily paid the fine and expressly accepted their responsibility, the fine was reduced to €1800.

The AEPD also ordered the owner of the store to incorporate an adequate privacy policy and cookie banner in order to comply with GDPR and national data protection provisions.

the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of the

art. 43.1, second paragraph, of Law 34/2002, of July 11, on Services of the
Information Society and Electronic Commerce (LSSI).

II.- On the non-existence of an acceptance box, which generates a record of the con-
feeling in the purchase form.

It has been verified that in the "purchase" form, https://liasclothes.olistshop-

clicking on the link: <<send order>>, therefore, there is no possibility of
give consent through an affirmative, clear and voluntary act for the transaction

treatment of personal data.

In this sense, article 6.1.a) of the RGPD, establishes, on the legality of the treatment

of personal data, that the treatment of these will only be lawful if at least
one of the conditions indicated in point 1, among which is: a) the

interested party gave their consent for the processing of their personal data for

blank box or similar mechanism where you can give the consent of a

affirmative, informed and free manner.

It would be desirable that the interested party be recommended to read and understand the privacy policy.

an online service or advertising communications.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 6/18

Thus, article 72.1.b) of the LOPDGDD considers it very serious, for the purposes of
prescription, “The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the

conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation”.

This infraction can be sanctioned with a maximum fine of €20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual turnover of the previous financial year, opting for the

of greater amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated, with respect to the infraction committed,

by violating the provisions of article 6.1 of the RGPD, and considering that the owner of
the claimed web page is a natural person, it allows setting an initial sanction of
1,000 euros, (one thousand euros), when carrying out an illicit treatment of personal data

obtained from the "purchase" form of the web page of its ownership.

Along with this and in accordance with article 58.2 of the RGPD, the corrective measure that

could be imposed on the owner of the web page would consist of ordering him to take the
necessary measures to adapt it to current regulations, with the inclusion of a

mechanism that enables users of this to provide their consent for the
treatment of your personal data, in a clear, affirmative and voluntary way.

III.- About the "Privacy Policy" of the website:

On the web page in question, personal data of users can be obtained through

through the "purchase" form. However, it has been found that there is no
“Privacy Policy”, nor any type of link that redirects the user to a second
layer where you are informed of the necessary aspects about the processing of your data

personal. On the web there is only the following information about the person in charge
from the page: “contact: 34685792696 infozapatones@gmail.com”.

## Article 13 of the RGPD establishes the information that must be provided to the

when this is not possible, the criteria used to determine this period; b) the
existence of the right to request access to data from the data controller
related to the interested party, and its rectification or deletion, or the limitation of its

For its part, article 72.1.h) of the LOPDGDD considers it very serious, for the purposes of
prescription, “the omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the treatment of
your personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the RGPD”

For the use of non-excepted cookies, it will be necessary to obtain the consent
expressly stated by the user. This consent can be obtained by doing

denotes that consent has unequivocally occurred. Therefore, the mere

If for the configuration of cookies, the web refers to the browser configuration
installed in the terminal equipment, this option could be considered complementary

to obtain consent, but not as the only mechanism. Therefore, if the publisher
opts for this option, it must also offer, and in any case, a mechanism that

V- Violation of the Cookies Policy

The known facts could constitute an infraction, attributable to the

responsible for the web, for violation of article 22.2 of the LSSI, since it establishes
what:

“Service providers may use storage devices and
recovery of data in terminal equipment of the recipients, provided that

data processing, in accordance with the provisions of Organic Law 15/1999, of 13

December, on the protection of personal data.

Where technically possible and effective, the recipient's consent to

Accepting the processing of the data may be facilitated through the use of the parameters
from the browser or other applications.

The foregoing will not prevent the possible storage or access of a technical nature to the sole
purpose of effecting the transmission of a communication over a communications network

electronic or, to the extent that is strictly necessary, for the provision of
a service of the information society expressly requested by the
addressee".

considers as such: “Use data storage and retrieval devices

when the information has not been provided or the consent of the
recipient of the service in the terms required by article 22.2.”, and may be

sanctioned with a fine of up to €30,000, in accordance with article 39 of the aforementioned
LSSI.

impose in accordance with the following aggravating criteria, established by art. 40 of

the LSSI:

        corresponding to the denounced entity the determination of a system of

        Obtaining informed consent that is in accordance with the mandate of the LSSI.

In accordance with these criteria, it is considered appropriate to impose an initial sanction of

1,000 euros (one thousand euros), for the infringement of article 22.2 of the LSSI, regarding the
cookie policy made on the website in question.

Along with this, the corrective measure that could be imposed would consist of ordering that,
take the necessary measures on the web page of its ownership to adapt it to

current regulations, with the inclusion of a mechanism that makes it impossible to use
of non-necessary cookies before the user gives his consent; including a
mechanism that makes it possible to reject all cookies or do it in a granular way to

tion about cookies and a "Cookies Policy" with more detailed information in a
Second layer.

VI-Initial total sanction:
