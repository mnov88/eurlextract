The DPA fined Aldi HUF 80,000,000 (€204,000) in connection to its age verification practices when selling alcohol. It found that data subjects could not easily access information and that they could not be asked for an ID when there was no doubt they were over 18.

## English Summary

### Facts

The controller, a supermarket company, conducted verifications about the age of customers wanting to buy alcoholic beverages. In addition to asking for an ID card, in some shops the controller also recorded the date of birth of the data subjects, while in other shops it did not.

Moreover, another complaint concerned the fact that the controller asked elderly data subjects for an ID, even though it was evident that they were not under 18.

Finally, according to the data subjects, no information under [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") was not provided to them. Therefore, they could not know which was the legal basis and the duration of the processing.

For these reasons, several data subjects filed a complaint with the DPA.

### Holding

First, the DPA found that the data subjects were not able to have sufficient information about the processing at hand, since no sign was put in the controller’s shops. Moreover, the staff were not able to provide more information or to inform the data subjects where to find more information about the data processing. Furthermore, the DPA noted that the practices varied between the stores.

Therefore, the DPA held that the information provided by the controller was insufficient, not easily accessible and not transparent. As a consequence, it found a violation of [Article 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), [12(1)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR"), [13(1)](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#1 "Article 13 GDPR") and [13(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#2 "Article 13 GDPR").

Secondly, the DPA noted that Article 16/A(4) of the Consumer Protection Act of 1997 (_[1997\. évi CLV. Törvény a fogyasztóvédelemről](https://njt.hu/jogszabaly/1997-155-00-00.44)_) requires alcohol sellers to ask for an ID card only when they are in doubt that the buyer could be under 18 years old. When this doubt does not exist, like in the case of a 70-year-old man, this obligation does not apply. Therefore, the controller could not rely on [Article 6(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1c "Article 6 GDPR").

As a consequence, the DPA found a violation of [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR").

Thirdly, the DPA found that recording the date of birth in the cash register system violated [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"). Indeed, the DPA considered that there was a method of achieving the objective which was appropriate but less harmful to the data subjects and involved fewer processing operations.

Finally, the DPA held that the controller did not implement adequate measures to protect the personal data of data subjects in its stores since, for example, data subjects were required to state their date of birth aloud and other customers could hear it.

On these grounds, the DPA issued a fine of HUF 95,000,000 (€242,000), then lowered to HUF 80,000,000 (€204,000).

Moreover, it ordered the controller to display in each of its shops, in a prominent place and in a readily accessible format for data subjects, its current privacy notice, drawn up in accordance with [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

## Comment

This decision is issued after an appeal by the controller before the Metropolitan Court of Justice (_Fővárosi Törvényszéknek_). The court found that the recording of date of birth did not constitute processing of personal data since this only piece of information cannot allow to identify a person. It confirmed the remainder.

The DPA took this judgement into account and lowered the amount of the fine from HUF 95,000,000 (approx. €242,0000) to HUF 80,000,000 (approx. €204,000).

ARC. Judgment

(63) In its judgement, the Metropolitan Court of Appeal considered point 3 of the Decision
      Act I of 2017 on the Code of Procedure (hereinafter: Law) § 89 (1) paragraph b)

      annulled it on the basis of point and obliged the Authority to proceed with a new procedure in this regard. This
      moreover, the Metropolitan Court rejected the claim.

(64) The Metropolitan Court explained in paragraph \[27\] of the Justification of the Judgment that the
      "the court found that after the purchase, in the given cash register, the entry
      as a result of a keystroke in the form of a string of numbers in the format "NNHHYYYYYY".
      a recorded and stored date of birth was not considered personal data because the data subject

      identification was no longer possible. The date of birth is all in this form
      together with keystrokes, any other data that can be associated with the data subject
      without, it was stored solely for the purpose of troubleshooting and not for the identification of the data subject.
      The number line of the date of birth recorded by keystroke during storage is not the customer,
      as a natural person, but made it possible to identify the purchase \[...\] From all this
      therefore, the preservation of the date of birth in the log file for 180 days was not implemented
      and data management".

(65) Pursuant to paragraph \[42\] of the Justification of the Judgment, this repeated data protection
      in an official procedure, the Authority must make its decision taking into account that
      the Obligor "did not commit in the field of keeping the date of birth in the diary file
      infringement".

(66) In its judgment, the Metropolitan Court also emphasized that (see: the Judgment

      Paragraph \[41\] of its justification), that the annulment of point 1 of the Decision is for that reason
      was not justified, because in that the Authority handled the Obligor's data as a unit
      evaluated and established a violation; and realized with insight and input
      with regard to data management, the provisions contained in point 1 of the Decision
      its violation exists regardless of whether the same with regard to preservation
      findings, according to the Metropolitan Court, "were not legal".

(67) Pursuant to the above \[see paragraphs (63) – (66) of the reasons for this decision\]
      therefore, in view of all the circumstances of the case, the Metropolitan Court in its Judgment so
      decided that, contrary to the provisions of the Decision, "the date of birth in the diary file
      By keeping it for 180 days, the Obligee did not carry out data management".

V. Legal Consequences

V.1. Data protection fine

(68) Pursuant to paragraph \[42\] of the Justification of the Judgment, the Authority should "Repeatedly decide
      is required in connection with the data management implemented with insight or input
      on the legal consequence applicable due to established violations, with the fact that
      in the case of imposing a fine, its amount is a narrower scope of the scope of the violation
      must be determined taking into account; related to retention in the log file

      circumstances should not be taken into account during the consideration and cannot be assessed as aggravating
      as a circumstance in connection with the mandatory age verification (inspection, entry) 14

      a longer period of established infringement. The amount of the fine is therefore all this
      disregarding circumstances, it should be proportionally less.".

(69) The Authority pursuant to Article 58(2)(i) and Article 83 of the General Data Protection Regulation
      (2) also imposes a data protection fine instead of or in addition to the other measures
      can impose.

(70) In the matter of whether, in this repeated data protection official procedure, it is justified
      e the imposition of a data protection fine, the Authority has discretion based on the law

      decided acting in his authority, taking into account Infotv. § 61. Paragraph (1) point a), that is
      Infotv. 75/A. §, as well as Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
      and Article 58 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation. The Authority considered it
      all the circumstances of the case, paying special attention to the provisions of the Judgment and
      established that in the present repeated data protection official procedure a
      warning and conviction are neither proportionate nor dissuasive in themselves
      would be a sanction, therefore the imposition of the fine is necessary in view of the Obligee's market

      situation, the general and national nature of the practice it introduced and the significant
      to the person concerned. In this case, the protection of personal data - which is the Authority
      task - no, based on the totality of the fine imposition circumstances detailed below
      is available without imposing a data protection fine. The imposition of fines is both special and
      it also serves general prevention, according to which the decision not only
      On the Authority's website, but on the opening page of the Obligor's website, clearly and easily
      is also published in an accessible place.

(71) When determining the amount of the fine, the Authority took into account, above all,
      that the Metropolitan Court decided in its Judgment that “the date of birth
      keeping it in a log file for 180 days did not implement data management" (see: az
      Paragraph \[27\] of the Justification of the Judgment); the Obligee “the date of birth in the log file
      he did not commit a violation of the law during the preservation of the
      paragraph \[42\]). However, the Authority cannot dispense with the fact that in the Decision

      established additional, fundamental violations of the general data protection regulation
      Belonging to the category of fines with a higher amount according to Article 83, paragraph (5), point a).
      are considered violations of the law, based on this the maximum fine that can be imposed is EUR 20,000,000,
      and in the case of enterprises, the total annual world market turnover of the previous financial year
      an amount of up to 4%, the higher of the two must be imposed.

(72) When determining the amount of the fine (95,000,000 HUF) imposed by the Authority in the Decision

      took into account the data for 2021, on the basis of which the Obligor's sales
      its net sales revenue in 2021 was HUF 315,282,601,000. At the same time, the Authority also
      took into account that, in comparison, the taxable profit of the Obligor is HUF 8,504,878,000
      was this year \[see paragraph (184) of the Decision's justification\].

(73) During the determination of the fine in this repeated data protection official procedure
      in view of the period of existence of the violations, the Authority is the Obliger's 2021

      business year taken into account.

(74) Based on the 2021 data, it must be taken into account by the Authority
      Based on HUF 315,282,601,000, the legal maximum of the fine is
      in the case HUF 12,611,304,040. Compared to this, the HUF 80,000,000 included in this decision
      HUF data protection fine 0.025% of the net sales of the debtor's sales, i.e
      significantly below the maximum fine amount.                                              15

(75) When determining the amount of the data protection fine, the Authority uses the following mitigating factor
      circumstances were taken into account:

       - September 2022 employees employed as a mandatory store salesperson
          From day 1, customers will only be called in case of doubt about their age loan
          proof of eligibility in case of purchase of alcoholic beverages; what the Judgment

          Paragraph \[39\] of its justification also contains \[Article 83 of the General Data Protection Regulation
          (2) point a)\];
       - The violation affected a narrow range of categories of personal data of the persons concerned, a

          recording was limited to the customers' date of birth \[General Data Protection Regulation
          Article 83(2)(g)\];
       - The Authority assessed that the primary purpose of the measure introduced by the Obliger

          protection of persons under the age of eighteen (which the Judgment
          Paragraph \[35\] of its justification is also confirmed), the consumer protection law
          compliance with the regulations as fully as possible, there was no question about that
          information that the other was aimed at obtaining an unlawful advantage \[general
          Article 83 (2) point k) of the Data Protection Regulation\].

(76) When determining the amount of the data protection fine, the Authority takes into account the Judgment

      Also for paragraph \[42\] of his reasoning - he took the following aggravating circumstances
      taking into account:
       - Obliged - on the basis of paragraph \[39\] of the Justification of the Judgment, which is not contested by him -

          committed several legal violations and violated other fundamental provisions, therefore the Authority
          considered the nature of the violations to be of medium seriousness, to which it belongs
          evaluation based on paragraph \[39\] of the Reasoning of the Judgment not even like that
          it is unreasonable that the Obligor's practice of keeping it in the log file is "no
          was unlawful" \[General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point a)\];

       - The number of those involved was significant, as stated in the Justification of the Judgment \[33\]
          also confirmed \[Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
          point a)\];

       - The violations existed at the national level \[see: (38) and
          Paragraphs (120)\], were not ad hoc in that August 4, 2022 and
          In the period between August 31, 2022, the Obligor prescribed it in a general manner
          for the age of each person intending to buy alcoholic beverages
          mandatory inspection; as well as paragraphs \[33\] and \[38\] of the Justification of the Judgment

          confirmed \[General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point a)\];
       - Data management operations are opaque for a longer period of time to those concerned
          were due to the fact that the information on data management was not easily accessible,

          incomplete information was provided to those concerned in several aspects; this is it
          Paragraph \[32\] of the Justification of the judgment also confirmed \[general data protection
          Regulation Article 83 (2) point a)\];

       - As a result of the data management, certain data subjects who have reached the age of 18 are Obliged
          hindered in their right to contract (see: case number NAIH-6989-5/2022
          minutes page 6; minutes of case number NAIH-6989-6/2022, page 6); what it is
          Paragraph \[37\] of the Justification of the judgment also confirms \[general data protection decree
          Article 83(2)(a)\];

       - Based on several reports received against the Obligor, the Authority detected a
          The probability of the unlawful nature of the mandatory data management practices, which
          resulted in the ex officio proceeding under case number NAIH-6989/2022; this Judgment 16

          It was also confirmed by paragraph \[34\] of its justification \[general data protection decree 83.
          Article (2) point h)\].

(77) When determining the amount of the data protection fine, the following circumstances – a
      As stated in paragraph (187) of the justification of the decision - the fine
      their extent was neither aggravated nor alleviated, they had a neutral effect:

       - After completing the proof procedure, the obligee put it on his website
          Effective from January 17, 2023, the investigated data management operations and
          fully describing the recipients - however, the mandatory age check
          is still unclear regarding - modified data management
          information, however, the date of the committed violation (August 4, 2022 -
          31.), it is no longer possible to assess the mitigation of the damage

          of a measure taken in order to \[general data protection regulation Article 83 (2)
          point c)\];
       - Mandatory after completion of the proof procedure on January 16 and 17, 2023

          in the context of personal education, the revised data protection was introduced in the meantime
          documents with the regional managers, who were then given the task of
          to be replaced in all stores by January 31, 2023 at the latest
          data protection documents, however, the date of the breach (2022)
          in view of the period that has passed since August 4 - 31), the mitigating factor can no longer be evaluated
          as circumstances \[General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point c\];

       - To establish a data protection violation by the Obligor, the general data protection
          due to violation of the regulation, it has already taken place twice, however, these
          infringements were evaluated by the Authority in this official data protection procedure
          did not consider it relevant in terms of data management \[NAIH-987/2021

          case number (previous case number: NAIH/2020/8690) and case number NAIH-1044/2021
          (previous case number: NAIH/2020/2255) data protection investigation procedure\] \[general
          Article 83 (2) point (e) of the Data Protection Regulation\];

       - The Obligee cooperated with the Authority during the procedure, but this is a matter for the judge
          practice and legal obligation based on the practice of the Authority, its absence
          could be an aggravating circumstance. This is also stated in paragraph \[36\] of the Justification of the Judgment
          confirmed \[General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point f)\].

(78) The Authority, when determining the amount of the data protection fine, in the Decision
      originally 4 relievers; It took into account 6 aggravating and 4 neutral circumstances \[see:

      paragraphs (185) – (187) of the justification of the Decision\]. Reasoning for Judgment \[42\]
      Pursuant to paragraph
      no longer evaluated the longer duration of the infringement as an aggravating circumstance (which
      The justification for the decision was found in the 3rd indent of paragraph (186).
      in addition to the additional circumstances according to which the violations are on a national level
      existed, they were not random). Paragraph \[42\] of the Justification of the Judgment stated
      also that the Authority is “related to the preservation in the log file

      circumstances should not be taken into account during the consideration". In view of this, however, the
      during this repeated data protection authority procedure, the Authority is the data protection fine
      when determining its extent, it no longer took into account as a mitigating circumstance the
      It was evaluated in the 2nd indent of paragraph (185) of the justification of the decision
      circumstance on the basis of which, according to the Obligor's statement, the personal data
      in relation to the log files containing the protection measures proportionate to the risks
      applied \[general data protection regulation Article 83 (2) point d)\].                                           17

(79) Considering paragraphs \[30\], \[31\] and \[42\] of the Justification of the Judgment, the Authority
      during the imposition of a fine in a repeated data protection official procedure a

      the amount of the fine, taking into account the narrower range of the scope of the violation
      determined; circumstances related to retention in the log file a
      did not take it into account during consideration; and did not assess it as an aggravating circumstance
      in connection with the mandatory age verification (inspection, input).
      a longer period of established infringement. However, the Authority cannot waive it
      from the fact that the Obligor - based on paragraph \[39\] of the Reasoning of the Judgment, neither by him
      disputed - committed several violations; violated several fundamental provisions; furthermore

      the number of those affected was significant; and the violations existed at the national level,
      they were not random.

(80) The above \[see: paragraphs (68) – (79) of the reasons for this decision\] and the case
      based on all its circumstances, the Authority originally considered 6 in the Decision
      due to aggravating circumstances during the present repeated data protection official procedure 1
      circumstance (longer duration of the violation) was no longer assessed as aggravating

      as a circumstance, so - even though not every violation can be of the same weight
      consider - the fine originally imposed by the Authority in the Decision (HUF 95,000,000)
      reducing its amount by roughly 1/6 (HUF 15,000,000) and
      thus decided to impose a data protection fine of HUF 80,000,000 in total. The present
      the amount of the data protection fine imposed in the decision - the Reasoning of the Judgment \[42\]
      taking into account the provisions of paragraph - it became proportionately less than a
      Fine originally imposed in a decision.

(81) Based on the above and all the circumstances of the case, the Authority is the deciding party
      considered the imposition of a data protection fine in the amount of proportional and dissuasive
      effective both in terms of special and general prevention, which
      amount is still significantly below the maximum fine; at the same time a
      is proportional to the severity of violations, it is the sales data for 2021
      in comparison, it cannot represent a disproportionate financial burden for the Obligor.

      In other cases, this amount may be significantly different based on individual circumstances,
      does not bind the Authority in other matters.

(82) On April 26, 2023, the obligee paid to the Authority in point 3 of the Decision
      imposed a HUF 95,000,000 data protection fine \[see: file number NAIH-3227-4/2023\].
      In view of this, the Authority acts ex officio in the Decision and in this decision
      payment of the difference in the data protection fine to the Obligor

      repayment.

(83) In view of the period of existence of the violations, as well as the fact that the Authority has a
      When making a decision, you did not have to apply the European Data Protection Act
      Administrative fines for the board according to the general data protection regulation
      04/2022 on its calculation. guidelines no. (hereinafter: Guidelines), thus
      the Authority also omits it during the current repeated data protection official procedure

      the use of reserved items. At the same time, the Authority notes that the Guidelines
      if applied in the present case, the amount of the data protection fine is significant
      would exceed the amount of the fine contained in both the Decision and this Decision.

V.2. Publication of the decision

(84) Pursuant to paragraph \[42\] of the Reasoning of the Judgment, the Authority "Repeatedly decides

      is necessary in connection with the data management implemented with insight or input
      on the legal consequence applicable due to established violations".                                            18

(85) Infotv. Pursuant to § 61, paragraph (2): "The Authority may order in its decision - that
      by publishing the identification data of the data manager or the data processor -

      disclosure if
       a) the decision affects a wide range of persons,
       b) it was brought in connection with the activities of a body performing a public task, or

       c) the seriousness of the infringement justifies disclosure."

(86) In point 4 of the Decision, the Authority referred to Infotv. On the basis of point a) of paragraph (2) of § 61
      ex officio ordered the identification data of the Obligor in its final Decision
      publicizing it by publishing it on the website of the Authority, and a
      On the opening page of the mandatory website, in a clearly visible and easily accessible place, a

      for 30 days.

(87) Based on the provisions of paragraph \[40\] of the Justification of the Judgment, the final Decision –
      Obligatory and on the website of the Authority
      in connection with its order, the Capital Court established that the Authority e
      specifically provided by Infotv. It was founded on point a) of paragraph (2) of § 61, which
      was clearly stated in point 4 of the operative part of the Decision and the Decision

      also in paragraph (194) of its justification. The Authority is the disclosure
      not by the weight of the infringement, but by the fact that the Decision
      affected a wide range of people. With attention to the fact that the Obligor a
      objectionable data management practices on a general basis, nationally, for all stores
      comprehensively ordered, i.e. the challenged practice during the investigation period, all
      he ordered it to be used in the case of a person buying an alcoholic drink, without a doubt
      it can be established that the Decision affected a wide range of persons. In itself e

      due to circumstances, the Authority is Infotv. could order it on the basis of point a) of paragraph (2) of § 61
      publication of the Decision.

(88) On the basis of the above, the Metropolitan Court made the Decision public
      with regard to point 4 of the order, the Obligor's claim is submitted to Kp. Section 88, paragraph (1), point a).
      rejected based on (see paragraph \[41\] of the Justification of the Judgment).
