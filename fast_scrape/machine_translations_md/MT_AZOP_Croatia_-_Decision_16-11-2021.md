The Croatian DPA determined that a photograph of a person camouflaged in a jacket and wearing a protective mask did not consitute personal data according to [Article 4(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR") because it was impossible for the average person to identify the individual. As a result, the publication did not infringe the GDPR.

## English Summary

### Facts

The Croatia DPA received a complaint in which, in essence, the complainant pointed out that a real estate agency (the controller) published their photograph taken during a viewing of an apartment that was advertised for sale, without their consent and knowledge. The photo was available on a public website via an URL link.

At the request of the Croatian DPA, the controller stated that they deleted, in good faith, the disputed parts of the photo allegedly representing the complainant. At the same time, the controller argued that they did not believe that, in this case, it was about the complainant's personal data, since the person in the initial photograph was camouflaged in a jacket and a protective face mask. Moreover, the person voluntarily entered the frame during the photo shoot.

### Holding

The Croatian DPA rejected the complaint as unfounded. It pointed out that it was not possible to determine the data subject's identity from the contested photo. In particular, the assessment of identity should be based on objective and reasonable factors so that the average person could determine in an unequivocal way (directly/indirectly) the identity of an individual.

The DPA concluded that the identity of the applicant was impossible to determine by objective factors available to the average person, who was not an acquaintance of the complainant, from just looking at the attached photo. The photo was not clear and the face was not visible (mostly covered by a surgical mask).

Therefore, the photograph in question could not be referred to as personal data in the sense of [Article 4(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR"), so there was no obligation of the controller to delete the photograph. It was only about publishing a photo of a property intended for sale and did not contain personal data.

Before elaborating the normative part of the General Data Protection Regulation, it is necessary to refer to the introductory part
statement number 26 to the General Regulation on data protection, in which it is defined in more detail that the code
assessment of whether an individual's identity can be established should take into account all means, such as for example
selections, which the controller or any other person can apparently use for the purpose
of direct or indirect identification of an individual. In order to determine whether, according to all appearances,
it is likely that means are used to determine the identity of an individual, should be taken into account
all objective factors, such as costs and time required to establish identity,
taking into account both the technology available at the time of processing and technological developments.
Article 2, paragraph 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation prescribes how it applies to processing
personal data, which is fully automated and non-automated processing of personal data

processed transparently with respect to the respondent (principle of legality, fairness and transparency);
collected for special, explicit and legal purposes and may not be further processed in a way that is not in

is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (principle of reducing the amount of data); accurate and according to
up-to-date if necessary (accuracy principle); stored in a form that allows the identification of the respondent only
as long as necessary for the purposes for which personal data are processed (principle of limitations
storage); processed in a way that ensures adequate security of personal data,
including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or
damage by applying appropriate technical or organizational measures (principle of integrity and
confidentiality).

legal only if and to the extent that at least one of the following is met: the respondent has given
consent to the processing of your personal data for one or more specific purposes; processing is necessary for
execution of a contract to which the respondent is a party or to take actions at the request of the respondent
before the conclusion of the contract; processing is necessary to comply with the legal obligations of the controller; processing

and that they do not believe that in this case it is about the applicant's personal data, since
that it is a person (the applicant) who is camouflaged in a jacket and a protective mask and who
voluntarily entered the frame during the photo shoot.
The agency also determined, based on the submitted photo, that a smaller one can be found on it

a photo in which (according to the applicant) the applicant is, since
it is only about publishing a photo of a property that is intended for sale and that does not contain
