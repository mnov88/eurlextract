## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant sent a complaint to the Castilla y León Basketball Federation (FEDERACIÓN DE BALONCESTO DE CASTILLA Y LEÓN) and this organization shared his personal data without his consent.

On 30 August 2017, the complainant filed a complaint with the AEPD against the FEDERACIÓN DE BALONCESTO DE CASTILLA Y LEÓN for the disclosure without consent of his personal data via the Internet and a newspaper.

It was demonstrated that the FEDERACION de BALONCESTO de CASTILLA Y LEÓN sent the document with the personal data of the claimant, and therefore it is responsible for the violation of confidentiality when sending this document with the personal data of the claimant to a newspaper.

### Dispute

Does sharing a complainant's personal data without their consent a breach of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD considered that the conduct of the defendant's employees - sending personal data from a complaint - infringes Article 6(1) GDPR, by unlawfully processing the complainant's personal data, in relation to Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, which governs the principles of integrity and confidentiality of personal data, as well as the proactive responsibility of the data controller to demonstrate compliance. This is an infringement punishable under Article 83(4)(a) GDPR.

Assessing the circumstances that modify the responsibility contemplated in Article 83(2) GDPR, in this case, the aggravating circumstances for being a non-intentional but significant negligent action (Article 83(2)(b) GDPR), and for being data known as basic personal identifiers such as name and address (Article 83(2)(g) GDPR).

The AEPD set the amount of the administrative fine at € 3000.

## Comment

In the first place, the AEPD did not admit the complaint about processing, stating that the processing of the complainant's data relating to his status as a representative of a sports organization is outside the scope of application of the LOPD and, therefore, outside the scope of action of the AEPD. The complainant filed an administrative appeal with the Audiencia Nacional, a court that declared the previous resolutions of the AEPD null and void, and therefore the AEPD agreed to initiate preliminary investigation proceedings.

The defendant/sanctioned benefited from the reduction provided for in Article 85 of Law 39/2015, of 1 October, on the Common Procedure of Public Administrations. In fact, two reductions of 20% were applied to it: one for acknowledging his responsibility and the other for the voluntary payment prior to the resolution of the procedure.

Therefore, the initial penalty corresponded to EUR 5,000 and was reduced by 40%, resulting in a final figure of €3000.

LEGAL FOUNDATIONS
I
By virtue of the powers conferred on each authority by Article 58(2) of the GPRS
control, and in accordance with Articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDPGDD, the Director of
the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this
procedure.
II
Article 6.1 of the RGPD establishes the cases in which the following may be considered lawful
processing of personal data.
For its part, Article 5 of the RGPD establishes that personal data will be
"(a) processed in a lawful, fair and transparent manner in relation to the data subject
("legality, fairness and transparency");
(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not treated
subsequently in a manner incompatible with those purposes; in accordance with Article 89,
paragraph 1, the further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the interest
public, scientific and historical research or statistical purposes shall not be considered
incompatible with the initial purposes ("purpose limitation");
(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for
those that are processed ("data minimization");
(d) accurate and, where necessary, updated; all measures shall be taken
to have personal data deleted or rectified without delay if they are
inaccurate with respect to the purposes for which they are intended ("accuracy");
(e) kept in a form which permits identification of the data subjects during
no longer than is necessary for the purposes of processing the personal data; the

the implementation of the appropriate technical and organizational measures imposed by this
Regulation to protect the rights and freedoms of the data subject ("time limit
of conservation");
(f) processed in such a way as to ensure adequate security of the data
including the protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against
accidental loss, destruction, or damage, through the application of technical or
appropriate organizational arrangements ("integrity and confidentiality").
The controller shall be responsible for compliance with the provisions
in paragraph 1 and able to demonstrate it ("proactive responsibility")."
III
In accordance with the evidence available at present,
and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation, it is deemed to be established that on 26
July 2017, the complainant submitted a brief containing his
name, surname, and ID card, in his capacity as a representative of the BALONCESTO CLUB
TIZONA, S.A.D. before the FEDERATION OF BALONCESTO OF CASTILLA AND LEÓN, and that
almost immediately upon its reception by the aforementioned federal body, began to
circulate on social networks.
It is also noted that on \*\*\*DATE.1, the DIARIO DE BURGOS published in its
print edition and in its digital formats the document in conflict with the data
personal of the claimant, after having been referred by the FEDERATION OF
CASTILLA Y LEÓN BASKETBALL.
With regard to the DIARIO DE BURGOS, it should be noted that in accordance with the
data protection regulations, the processing of personal data is considered lawful,
in particular where necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the data controller or by a third party, provided that such interests are not
the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the person concerned which
require the protection of such data.
In relation to the dissemination of personal information in
communication, it should be noted that Article 20 of the Constitution
Spain protects, in particular, the right to freely express and disseminate
thoughts, ideas, and opinions by word, writing, or any other means of
reproduction and also the right to freely communicate or receive truthful information by
any media.
The case-law of the Constitutional Court tends to give a position
preferential to freedom of expression over other constitutional rights when
on the basis of the truthfulness of the information provided, the facts reported are
considered to be of public relevance. This relevance is projected not only on those who
public activity, but also in those who participate in events that
are considered to be of interest to citizens. Case law has also
determined that the discussion about the veracity of the published information is not
incompatible with the pre-eminence of the right to information over the right to
data protection.
The preferential value of freedom of expression and information reaches its

information professionals by publishing information considered to be
public relevance through an institutionalized vehicle for opinion formation

proportionality which, given its organic nature, would necessarily imply a

It should also be noted that Organic Law 1/1982 of 5 May 1982 on the Protection of
Right to Honor, to personal and family privacy, and to one's own image, in its
Article 8(2) provides for certain limitations on the protection of these rights if the

right to professional secrecy for information professionals, in development of the
recognition provided for in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
Human beings.
However, those concerned may exercise the right of withdrawal provided for in
