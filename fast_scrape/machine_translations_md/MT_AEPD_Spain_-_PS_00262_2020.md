## English Summary

### Facts

The personal data of the claimants were used illegitimately to contract two telephone lines with the company XFERA MÓVILES, S.A. The decision does not provide a clear description of the facts. However, on the basis of the available information it seems that when the complainants learned what had happened, they reported it to the Guardia Civil (Spanish military police) and the AEPD.

### Dispute

The key to this case was to determine whether or not the defendant applied adequate measures to verify the identity of the clients. The company claimed that when they learned that it was a fraudulent contract, they suspended the services and cancelled the debt generated. Likewise, they blocked the data of the data subjects and classified the contract as fraudulent.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA concludes that the defendant has not been able to demonstrate that it adopted sufficient diligence measures to verify the identity of the clients before signing the contracts. Therefore, it breached Article 6(1) GDPR by processing personal data without a legitimate basis.

       with one of his daughters informing her that, if they do not pay the amounts

       owed to said numbers, the service would be interrupted.
     Summary of the actions carried out by the Bolaños Civil Guard
       de Calatrava (Ciudad Real).
     MASMOVIL (XFERA MÓVILES, S.A.) contracts for the telephone lines
       reported.

SECOND: In view of the facts denounced, the General Subdirectorate of
Data Inspection proceeded to carry out preliminary investigation actions
for the clarification of the facts in question, by virtue of the powers of
investigation granted to the control authorities in article 57.1 of the Regulation

(EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter RGPD), and
in accordance with the provisions of Title VII, Chapter I, Second Section, of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD).

       As a result of the investigation actions carried out, it is verified
that the person responsible for the treatment is the one claimed.

        Likewise, the following points are found:
        Examining the information provided by the Civil Guard, it is found that the
Reported lines have been hired by people outside the claimants. No

 outstanding debts were incurred by the claimants, since in the
 contracts contained the bank account of the people who had impersonated the
 identity of the claimants. These people, who used the ID of the claimants

 for both contracts, they lived in the same address of this and have been identified
 by the Civil Guard from the bank accounts provided in the hiring.

         Information requested from the respondent about the measures adopted after the
receipt of the complaint before the Civil Guard of Bolaños of a possible impersonation
of identity when contracting lines \*\*\* TELEPHONE.1 and \*\*\* TELEPHONE.2 and on

the guarantees required for the accreditation of identity in the contracting of the

         On January 16, 2020, the defendant states that according to his
inquiries, the lines denounced have been classified as contracting

fraudulent, and the debts associated with them have been forgiven.

         They provide a screenshot of the data that works in their systems of the
reported lines.

 THIRD: On September 8, 2020, the Director of the Spanish Agency

 of Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure for the claimed party, with
 in accordance with the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, of the
 Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter,

Of the actions carried out in this procedure and of the documentation
Obrante in the file, the following have been accredited:

                                 PROVEN FACTS

FIRST: Two telephone lines and internet are registered in the name of the
claimants. The usurpation of identity in the contracting of services
telecommunications, took place on February 26, 2019.

SECOND: The defendant acknowledges said error and thus in his allegations he manifests
that the reported lines have been classified as fraudulent hires, and
the debts associated with them have been forgiven.

                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                            I

       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.
                                            II

       The defendant is accused of committing an offense for violation of the

Article 6.1 of the RGPD.

       Article 6, Legality of treatment, of the RGPD establishes that:
       "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

       a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for one or more specific purposes;
       b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
pre-contractual;
       (…) "

## Article 4 of the RGPD, Definitions, in section 11, states that:

       "11)" consent of the interested party ": any manifestation of free will,
specific, informed and unequivocal by which the interested party accepts, either through
a statement or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that
they concern him ”.

       Also article 6, Treatment based on the consent of the affected,
of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection
Personal and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), states
what:

       "1. In accordance with the provisions of article 4.11 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679, the consent of the affected party is understood to be any manifestation of will
free, specific, informed and unequivocal for which it accepts, either through a

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/7

declaration or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that
concern.
       2. When the data processing is intended to be based on consent

of the affected party for a plurality of purposes, it will be necessary to record in a
specific and unequivocal that said consent is granted for all of them.
       3. The execution of the contract may not be subject to the consent of the affected party
processing of personal data for purposes that are not related to the
maintenance, development or control of the contractual relationship ”.
       Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of “the principles

basic for the treatment, including the conditions for consent in accordance with
of articles 5, 6, 7 and 9 ”is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the
mentioned Article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, “with administrative fines of
€ 20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, of an equivalent amount
at a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover of the financial year

above, opting for the highest amount ”.
       On the other hand, the LOPDGDD in its article 72 indicates for the purposes of prescription:
“Violations considered very serious:
       1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in

in particular, the following:
       (…)
       b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.

       (…) "
                                               III

       The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since he processed the personal data

without having any legitimacy for it. The personal data were
incorporated into the company's information systems, without having accredited
that he had legitimately hired, had his consent for the
collection and subsequent processing of your personal data, or there is any other
causes the treatment carried out to be legal.

       Well, with respect to the facts that are the subject of this claim,
we must emphasize that the defendant has recognized this error and thus both in his writing
dated January 16, 2019, as in the allegations to the Agreement to initiate the
This sanctioning procedure has stated that the lines denounced have
been classified as fraudulent contracts, and the debts associated with them have

been forgiven.

       The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the
Obligations imposed by the regulations for the protection of personal data
It is thus obvious. A diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the treatment

of third-party data requires that the person responsible for the treatment is in conditions
to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).

                                               IV

        In order to establish the administrative fine to be imposed, they must
observe the provisions contained in articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, which

point out:

        f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to
        remedy the violation and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the violation;
        g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
        h) the way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement, in
        particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such case,

        what extent;
        i) when the measures indicated in Article 58 (2) have been
        previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge

        or indirectly, through infringement.
        In relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, in its
        Article 76, “Sanctions and corrective measures”, establishes that: “2. According to

        the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 may also
        be taken into account:

       interested."
                                               V

       In accordance with the provisions transcribed in order to fix the amount of the
sanction of a fine to be imposed in the present case for the offense typified in the
Article 83.5 of the RGPD for which the claimed person is responsible are estimated
concurrent the following factors:

      Extenuating:

     - Any measure taken by the person in charge or in charge of the treatment to
       palliate the damages suffered by the interested parties (art.83.2. c) of the RGPD).

      Aggravating factors:

     - The intentionality or negligence of the infringement (article 83.2. B) of the RGPD).

     - Basic personal identifiers are affected (personal data
       (art.83.2. g) of the RGPD).

     - The evident link between the business activity of the claimed and the
      processing of personal data of clients or third parties (article 83.2.k, of the

      RGPD in relation to article 76.2.b, of the LOPDGDD)

     Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and the criteria of

graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been accredited, the Director of the
Spanish Agency for Data Protection RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE XFERA MÓVILES, S.A., with NIF A82528548, for a
violation of Article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, a fine
