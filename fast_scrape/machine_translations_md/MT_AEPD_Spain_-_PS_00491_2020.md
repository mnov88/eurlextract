## English Summary

### Facts

A law firm filed a complaint before the AEPD on 29 July 2020 against a real estate company for failing to comply with the GDPR on its corporate website (www.higclffeestates.com).

The complaint was based:

1.  Firstly, on the lack of information regarding the processing of data collected by the form of the website.
2.  Secondly, on the fact that the image and personal data of one of the partners of the complainant's law firm was displayed without their consent.
3.  Lastly, on the fact that the privacy policy of the company's website made reference to the derogated Data Protection Act from 1999.

### Dispute

*   Can the reference to a repealed law in the privacy policy be considered to constitute a breach of Article 13 of the GDPR?
*   Is the publication of a photograph and personal data without the data subject's express consent a violation of Article 6 (1) GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD found that publishing the image of the data subject without his consent was a violation of Article 6 (1) GDPR, and decided to fine the controller €8000.

Secondly, the AEPD decided that the lack of the necessary information and making reference to the derogated Data Protection Act was a violation of Article 13 GDPR and issued a warning to the controller.

The AEPD took into account the following aggravating factors (Article 83 (2) GDPR) to determine the level of the sanction:

*   It is an intentional negligent action (art. 83 (2) (b) GDPR).
*   The AEPD became aware of the infringement through the complainant's filing of a complaint (Art. 83 (2) (h) GDPR).

the art. 47 of LOPDGDD.
                                             II

The joint assessment of the documentary evidence in the procedure brings to
knowledge of the AEPD, a vision of the denounced action that has been
reflected in the facts declared proven above related.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/6

Regarding the "Privacy Policy" of the website, it has been found that it
refers to the repealed Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13, on Protec-
tion of Personal Data (LOPD).

According to article 99 of the RGPD, the entry into force and application of the new RGPD was,
"Twenty days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union (05/25/16)"
and it would be applicable as of May 25, 2018 ”. Therefore, as of 05/25/18,
the LO was repealed. 15/1999, (LOPD), applying compulsorily, from that date
date, the current RGPD and as of 12/07/18 the new LOPDGDD.

The known facts could be constitutive of an infraction, attributable to the
claimed, for violation of article 13 of the RGPD, which establishes the information that
must be provided to the interested party at the time of collection of their data
personal.

For its part, article 72.1.h) of the LOPDGDD, considers very serious, for the purposes of
prescription, “the omission of the duty to inform the affected party about the treatment of
your personal data in accordance with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the RGPD "

This offense may be punished with a fine of a maximum of € 20,000,000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
of a higher amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

However, Article 58.2) of the RGPD provides that: “Each control authority

have all of the following corrective powers listed below: b)
sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with warning when
the treatment operations have infringed the provisions of this
Regulation; (…); i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83,
in addition to or instead of the measures mentioned in this section, according to the

circumstances of each particular case ”, therefore, the sanction would be
"Warning."

                                           IV
Regarding the non-consensual treatment of personal data, it has been verified that
there is a publication of a photograph of the interested party and their personal data, according to

claim, without the express consent of the interested party.

The known facts are constitutive of an infraction, attributable to the defendant, for
violation of art. 6.1 of the RGPD, when publishing personal data of the claimant without the
legitimation necessary for it.

For its part, article 72.1.b) of the LOPDGDD, considers very serious, for the purposes of
prescription, "Failure to comply with the requirements of article 6 of the RGPD".

This offense may be punished with a fine of a maximum of € 20,000,000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the
of a higher amount, in accordance with article 83.5.b) of the RGPD.

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/6

In accordance with the indicated precepts, in order to set the amount of the sanction to
impose in the present case, the sanction to be imposed should be adjusted in accordance with
the following aggravating criteria established in article 83.2 of the RGPD:

    - The intentionality or negligence in the infringement. In the present case we are
        before intentional negligent action, (section b).

    - The way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement. The

        The way in which this AEPD has been made aware has been through the filing of
        the complaint by the claimant, (section h).

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD, with

Regarding the offense committed by violating the provisions of its article 6.1, it allows
set a penalty of 8,000 euros, (eight thousand euros).

In accordance with the above, the Director of the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
