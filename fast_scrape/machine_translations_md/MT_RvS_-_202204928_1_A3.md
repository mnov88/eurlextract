## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is GGNET, a mental health care institution operating in the Netherlands.

The data subject sought medical treatment there after a reference by her general practitioner. The practitioner also forwarded to the controller the data subject’s medical records. After her first session with the social psychiatric nurse of the controller, the data subject decided she didn’t want to continue with the treatment and asked for her medical record to be deleted. The controller informed her that it deleted her medical records but retained a record regarding the erasure request.

The data subject filed a complaint before the DPA (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens-AP) requesting that the controller was ordered to delete the record regarding the erasure request. The DPA rejected her complaint, ruling that the controller could retain this record for the management of its health care services and under the medical treatment contract with the data subject, as referred to in Article 9(h) GDPR.

The data subject challenged the decision of the DPA before the court of first instance (Gelderland District Court). The court dismissed the appeal as unfounded, affirming the DPA’s decision.

Then, the data subject appealed against this ruling before the Highest Administrative Court (Council of State), claiming that the court of first instance misjudged the case. She claimed that the court did not recognise that the DPA should have taken enforcement action against the controller. According to the data subject, the record of the deletion request was not necessary for the management of the controller's health services nor there was a treatment agreement between the parties since she did not receive any treatment.

### Holding

The court held that the data subject’s right to erasure referred to in [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR") could not be satisfied.

First, it stated that the retention of the deletion request was necessary for the controller to manage its service, and in particular in order to justify why it no longer has certain medical records to regulators, such as the Health and Youth Care Inspectorate, health insurers and the DPA.

Second, it pointed out that under the Dutch Civil Code, all medical procedures are covered by a medical treatment agreement and all care providers have the duty to keep a medical record regarding the treatment of each patient. The session of the data subject with the social psychiatric nurse for the assessment of her psychological condition constituted a medical procedure and therefore was subject to a medical treatment agreement.

Therefore, the court held that the processing of the record of the deletion request, which constituted special category of personal data, was lawful under the exception of [Article 9(2)(h) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#2h "Article 9 GDPR"). The retention of the data was necessary for the management of the controller’s services and was also necessary under the medical treatment agreement. According to [Article 17(3)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#3c "Article 17 GDPR"), the right to erasure could not be satisfied because the processing was necessary for reasons of public health in the field of public health in accordance with Article 9(2)(h) and [Article 9(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#3 "Article 9 GDPR").

The court concluded that the controller was not obliged to honour the request to erase the record and rejected the appeal as unfounded.

DIVISION

ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

Judgment on the appeal of:

\[appellant\], residing in \[place of residence\],

appellant,

against the judgment of the Gelderland District Court of July 27, 2022, in case no. 20/4225 in the proceedings between:

\[appellant\]

and

the Dutch Data Protection Authority.

Procedural history

By decision of July 12, 2019, the Dutch Data Protection Authority rejected \[appellant\]'s enforcement request.

By decision of June 25, 2020, the Dutch Data Protection Authority dismissed \[appellant\]'s objection.

By decision of July 27, 2022, the District Court dismissed \[appellant\]'s appeal against this request.

\[Appellant\] filed an appeal against this decision.

The Dutch Data Protection Authority submitted a written statement.

\[Appellant\] submitted additional documents.

The Division heard the case at a hearing on July 29, 2024, at which \[appellant\], represented by Mr. J.A.B.H.M. Willemse, attorney at law in Ulft, and the Dutch Data Protection Authority, represented by Mr. W. van Steenbergen and Mr. J.M.A. Koster, appeared.

After the hearing concluded, the Division reopened the investigation and referred it to a three-judge panel.

The Division heard the case at a further hearing on April 8, 2025, at which \[appellant\], represented by Mr. J.A.B.H.M. Willemse, attorney at law in Ulft, and the Dutch Data Protection Authority, represented by Mr. W. van Steenbergen and Mr. J.M.A. Koster, appeared.

Considerations

Introduction

1. \[Appellant\] submitted a request to the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) to take enforcement action against GGNet for keeping a record of \[appellant\]'s request to GGNet to delete her medical file.

2. GGNet is an organization that provides specialized care to people with mental health conditions. \[Appellant\] was referred to GGNet by her general practitioner. GGNet therefore held \[appellant\]'s medical file. After an intake interview between \[appellant\] and a psychiatric nurse from GGNet, \[appellant\] requested GGNet to delete her medical file because she did not want treatment. GGNet deleted \[appellant\]'s medical file and informed her of this. GGNet made a record of the deletion request. \[Appellant\] disagrees with this and wants this record deleted from GGNet's system.

3. The only remaining issue on appeal is whether the District Court correctly upheld the Dutch DPA's conclusion that GGNet is permitted to retain the record of \[appellant\]'s deletion request and therefore rightly refrained from enforcement.

Judgment of the District Court

4. In the District Court's opinion, \[appellant\]'s appeal to the right to erasure as referred to in Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter: the GDPR) is unsuccessful. Article 17, paragraph 3, introductory sentence and (c), of the GDPR states that this right does not apply if processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, in accordance with Article 9, paragraph 2, introductory sentence and (h), of the GDPR.

5. The District Court finds no explicit assurances or other statements in the documents referred to by \[appellant\] indicating that the DPA would oblige GGNet to delete the record. The District Court therefore finds that the principle of legitimate expectation is invalid.

Grounds and Assessment of Appeal

6. \[Appellant\] argues that the court failed to recognize that the Dutch Data Protection Authority should have taken enforcement action against GGNet, because GGNet should have deleted the record of the deletion request. According to \[appellant\], the record of the deletion request is not necessary for the management of GGNet's healthcare services. It is unlikely that GGNet will still have to answer to the Health and Youth Care Inspectorate (hereinafter: IGJ) given the considerable time elapsed in these proceedings. The court wrongly upheld the Dutch Data Protection Authority's position that GGNet has a duty to maintain records and retain data. According to \[appellant\], no agreement regarding medical treatment (hereinafter: treatment agreement) has been concluded between \[appellant\] and GGNet.

6.1. Article 9 of the GDPR states:

"1. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.

2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following conditions is met:

(…)

h) processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment, or the management of health or social care systems and services, on the basis of Union or Member State law or in accordance with contract with a health professional, and subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 3;

(…)".

Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 3, introductory sentence and point (c), of the GDPR, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 17 of the GDPR (right to erasure) do not apply for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, as referred to in Article 9, paragraph 2, introductory sentence and point (h), of the GDPR.

6.2. It is undisputed that the record of the erasure request constitutes special personal data within the meaning of Article 9 of the GDPR. This means that GGNet may not, in principle, process the record unless an exception under paragraph 2 applies. The Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) takes the position that the record of the erasure request may be retained because it is necessary for the management of GGNet's healthcare services and pursuant to a contract with a healthcare professional as referred to in Article 9, paragraph 2, introductory sentence and point (h), of the GDPR.

6.3. The court correctly ruled that the Dutch Data Protection Authority was entitled to take the position that recording the record is necessary for the management of GGNet's healthcare services, as referred to in Article 9, paragraph 2, introductory sentence and (h), of the GDPR. GGNet will be required to justify to supervisory authorities, such as the Healthcare Inspectorate (IGJ), health insurers, and the Dutch Data Protection Authority, where appropriate, why it no longer holds certain medical records. The Division therefore disagrees with \[appellant\]'s assertion that no inspections will take place due to the time elapsed in the procedure and the failure to submit claims.

Is the basis for this processing established in Union or Member State law, as referred to in Article 9, paragraph 2, introductory sentence and (h), of the GDPR?

6.4. Article 7:446 of the Dutch Civil Code (hereinafter: BW) states:

1. The agreement concerning medical treatment – hereinafter referred to in this section as the treatment agreement – is the agreement whereby a natural person or legal entity, the healthcare provider, in the exercise of a medical profession or business, undertakes in favor of another person, the client, to perform acts in the field of medicine, directly related to the person of the client or a specific third party. The person to whom the acts directly relate will hereinafter be referred to as the patient.

2. Acts in the field of medicine are defined as:

a. all acts – including examination and advice – directly related to a person and aimed at curing them of an illness, preventing them from developing an illness, assessing their state of health, or providing obstetric assistance;

b. other than those referred to under (a), directly related to a person, which are performed by a physician or dentist in that capacity.

3. The actions referred to in paragraph 1 also include nursing and caring for the patient in that context, and otherwise directly providing the patient with the material conditions under which those actions can be performed.

\[…\]

Article 7:454, paragraph 1, of the Dutch Civil Code states:

"The healthcare provider shall establish a file regarding the patient's treatment. He keeps a record in the file of the information regarding the patient's health and the procedures performed in that regard, and includes other documents containing such information, all to the extent necessary for providing proper care to him.

6.5. The Division accepts \[appellant\]'s argument that the record-keeping obligation under Article 7:454, paragraph 1, of the Dutch Civil Code does not apply because the conversation between her and the GGNet nurse does not fall under a medical act. \[Appellant\] has not further substantiated and therefore not made plausible the assertion that the conversation between \[appellant\] and GGNet was not an intake interview. Moreover, now that \[appellant\]'s medical file has been deleted by GGNet at her request, this assertion can no longer be verified. Pursuant to Article 7:454 of the Dutch Civil Code, healthcare providers are obligated to maintain a medical file regarding the treatment of a patient. This record-keeping obligation exists if there is a treatment agreement as referred to in Article 7:454. Article 7:446 of the Dutch Civil Code (BW) defines medical acts as all activities—including examination and advice—directly related to a person and aimed at assessing their state of health. Such activities may also be performed by a nurse. Given the nature of the intake interview between \[appellant\] and the GGNet social psychiatric nurse, the record-keeping obligation applies in this case. Because GGNet is legally obligated to maintain records and must be accountable to the supervisory authority, GGNet has sufficiently substantiated the need to record the deletion request.

6.6. This establishes that the storage of the data was lawful. Lawful storage of data, in principle, provides a basis for its retention, as long as it is necessary for the purpose for which it is processed. Article 5, paragraph 1, introductory sentence and (c), of the GDPR stipulates that personal data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This principle of data minimization can therefore lead to an initially lawful storage no longer providing a basis for retaining the personal data at some point.

6.7. The Dutch Data Protection Authority was entitled to take the position that retaining the record is not in violation of Article 9, paragraph 2, introductory sentence and (h), of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Article 6, paragraph 1, introductory sentence and (f), of the GDPR. Retention of the data is also necessary for GGnet's record-keeping obligations and for accountability to the supervisory authority. GGNet was therefore not obligated to honor the request to erase the record under Article 17 of the GDPR. The court therefore correctly ruled that GGNet was allowed to continue retaining the record of the deletion request, because there was no unlawful processing.

6.8. The argument is unsuccessful.

7. Finally, \[appellant\] argues that the court failed to recognize that she was entitled to infer from her email exchange with the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) and a telephone conversation with a supervisory officer of the AP that the AP would oblige GGNet to delete the record. According to \[appellant\], the court wrongly rejected her appeal to the principle of legitimate expectation.

7.1. Regardless of whether the AP created trust in \[appellant\] with the emails and the telephone conversation, it is established that enforcement is not possible without a violation. As the Division considered above, the court correctly ruled that GGNet was allowed to retain the record of \[appellant\]'s deletion request. Therefore, there is no violation. The Dutch Data Protection Authority could therefore not take enforcement action. The court rightly dismissed the appeal based on the principle of legitimate expectation.

8. The argument is unfounded.

Conclusion

9. The appeal is unfounded. The Division upholds the court's judgment.

10. The Dutch Data Protection Authority is not required to reimburse legal costs.
