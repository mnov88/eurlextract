## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject concluded a contract with a telecommunications company (controller) for the provision of telecommunications services . The controller provided the data subject with a leaflet, informing him about the transfer of data regarding the conclusion of the contract (positive data) to credit information agencies. On the same day, the controller transmitted the name, date of birth and address of the data subject as well as the contract number and the date to Schufa, a credit information agency.

In the meantime, the data subject was involved in consumer insolvency proceedings, for failing to settle personal loans.

The data subject later became aware of the data transfer to Schufa and filed a case before the court of first instance (Regional Court of Singen - AG Singen). He maintained that the transfer was unlawful because he never provided his consent and climed immaterial damages of least €500, under [Article 82(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR#1 "Article 82 GDPR"). He alleged that due to the data transfer he suffered from anxiety, a sense of loss of control over his data and worried about his creditworthiness, which affected his sleep and therefore his quality of life.

The controlled argued that he transmission of positive data to credit information agencies was permissible for reasons of fraud and over-indebtedness prevention and that the data subject was not entitled to any damages.

### Holding

The court rejected the case as unfounded.

First, it held that the data subject had no claim for damages arising from [Article 82(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_82_GDPR#1 "Article 82 GDPR") because the processing of personal data was lawful, under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"). The transfer of the data subject’s contractual data was necessary for reasons of fraud, identity theft and over-indebtedness prevention, thus serving the legitimate interest of the controller.

Second, the court ruled that the data subject did not suffer immaterial damage from the data transfer. It pointed out that since he was involved in consumer insolvency proceedings, there were serious doubts that his concerns about his creditworthiness could only be attributed to the transfer of contractual data to Schufa. Furthermore, the data subject failed to demonstrate sufficient harm attributable to the loss of control of his data.

beck-abstract - AI-generated summary:

The Singen District Court dismissed a plaintiff's claim for damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief for alleged violations of the GDPR. Although the claim was partially admissible, it was deemed unfounded overall. The defendant's processing of the plaintiff's personal data was lawful and justified by legitimate interests, such as the prevention of fraud and over-indebtedness, pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The plaintiff was unable to prove non-material damage that would justify a claim for damages pursuant to Article 82 (1) GDPR. The mere allegation of loss of control and psychological impairment was insufficient. Therefore, there is no claim for damages pursuant to Sections 280 (1) BGB and 241 (2) BGB. The action was dismissed in its entirety.

Tenor:

1. The action is dismissed.

2. The plaintiff shall bear the costs of the legal action.

3. The judgment is provisionally enforceable against the defendant due to costs. The plaintiff may avert enforcement by providing security in the amount of 120% of the amount enforceable under this judgment, unless the defendant provides security in the amount of 120% of the respective amount to be enforced prior to enforcement.
Facts:

1 The parties are in dispute over the plaintiff's claims for damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief based on alleged violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by the defendant.

2 The defendant is a telecommunications company and concluded a contract for telecommunications services (mobile phone contract) with the plaintiff on December 4, 2021, with contract number ... Upon conclusion of the contract, the defendant provided the plaintiff with a data protection information leaflet containing the information pursuant to Article 13 of the GDPR and Article 14 of the GDPR. In this information sheet, the defendant also informed the plaintiff about the transfer of so-called positive data to credit reporting agencies, such as Schufa Holding AG (Schufa). The information sheet also contained a reference to the right of objection under Article 21(1) of the GDPR.

3 Also on December 4, 2021, the defendant transmitted the plaintiff's name, date of birth, and address, as well as the date of conclusion of the contract, the contract number, and the date of termination of the contract, to Schufa. The plaintiff had not given his express consent to the transfer of the data. At the time of concluding the contract, he assumed that the data would be transferred to Schufa, but not stored.

4 The plaintiff has been in consumer insolvency proceedings since May 2022 after being unable to service previously concluded private loans. He then became aware of the defendant's data transfer to Schufa again via an Instagram account called "Finanzhacker." The plaintiff requested information and a copy of the data stored about him from Schufa and received this information on October 20, 2023, with the following content: "On December 4, 2021, F. DLS GmbH reported the conclusion of a telecommunications contract and submitted the service account under the number ...."

5 In a legal brief dated December 5, 2024, the plaintiff demanded that the defendant pay damages and submit a cease-and-desist declaration. By seeking legal assistance, the plaintiff incurred out-of-court legal fees of €367.23.

6 The plaintiff claims that

he feels powerless and insecure due to the data disclosure. Furthermore, he has a profound sense of loss of control and occasionally suffers from anxiety. He feels helplessly at the mercy of the credit agencies and is afraid of encountering obstacles in a future apartment search due to his creditworthiness. This causes him sleeplessness. The worries would affect his quality of life.

7 The plaintiff argues,

against this background and taking into account his right to informational self-determination as well as the violation of his personal rights, he is entitled to a claim for damages under Article 82 (1) of the GDPR. A claim for injunctive relief arises from Sections 280 (1) of the German Civil Code (BGB), Section 242 (2) of the German Civil Code (BGB), as well as from Section 1004 of the German Civil Code (BGB), analogously, and from Section 823 (2) of the German Civil Code (BGB) in conjunction with Article 6 (1) of the GDPR, Article 17 of the GDPR, and Article 18 of the GDPR. In addition, the defendant must bear the out-of-court legal fees totaling €367.23.

8 The plaintiff requests that:

1. The defendant be ordered to pay the plaintiff reasonable damages for non-pecuniary damages, the amount of which shall be left to the court's discretion, but at least €500.00 plus interest accruing from the date of the action at a rate of 5% above the base interest rate.

2. The defendant is ordered, on pain of a fine of up to €250,000.00 to be determined by the court for each case of infringement, or alternatively, imprisonment of up to six months, or up to two years in the event of a repeat offense, to be enforced by its legal representatives, to refrain from transmitting the plaintiff's positive data, i.e., personal data that does not contain payment history or other non-contractual conduct, but rather information about the commissioning, execution, and termination of a contract, to credit reporting agencies, namely Schufa Holding AG, without the plaintiff's consent, and in particular not on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR to improve the quality of credit assessments or to protect the economic operators involved from credit risks.

3. It is determined that the defendant is obligated to compensate the plaintiff for all future material damages and future, currently unforeseeable, non-material damages incurred by the plaintiff as a result of the unauthorized processing of personal data.

4. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff pre-trial legal fees in the amount of €367.23.

9 The defendant requests that

the lawsuit be dismissed.

10 The defendant claims that

the plaintiff has not suffered any damage. The mere allegation of damage without corresponding evidence does not give rise to a claim for damages. The plaintiff does not stand out from the rest of the population because, on average, every German citizen has more than one mobile phone contract. Therefore, there is no reason for banks or insurance companies to question the plaintiff's creditworthiness because of a mobile phone contract.

11 The defendant believes that

the transmission of positive data to credit agencies is permissible for reasons of fraud prevention and over-indebtedness prevention. Against this background, the plaintiff is not entitled to the asserted claims for damages and injunctive relief. Furthermore, the motions for injunctive relief and declaratory relief are already inadmissible.

12 The court held a conciliation hearing on June 18, 2025, and heard the plaintiff for informational purposes at the subsequent oral hearing. For the outcome of the informational hearing, reference is made to the minutes of June 18, 2025. Furthermore, for supplementary information on the facts of the case, reference is made to the written submissions exchanged between the parties, including the attachments.
Reasons for the Decision:

13 Although the action is at least partially admissible, it is entirely unfounded.

I. Admissibility

14 The Singen District Court has subject-matter and local jurisdiction.

15 The claim for performance seeking an order to pay damages for non-pecuniary damages is admissible.

16 Concerns exist regarding the application for an injunction to refrain from sharing positive data unless consent has been given. This application appears to be overly broad and insufficiently specific in view of Section 253 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), Section 253 (2) No. 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO). The application is based on a violation of Article 6 (f) GDPR. The plaintiff fails to recognize that this provision also contains grounds for justification for the processing of personal data. It is therefore not possible to issue a blanket ban on sharing data, as this would effectively ignore the possibility of justification.

17 The same applies to the application for a declaratory judgment that the defendant is obligated to compensate the plaintiff for all future material and immaterial damages resulting from the unauthorized processing of personal data. While there is generally an interest in establishing liability for future damages if there is a possibility that damages may arise from a violation of an absolute right that has already occurred, the right to data protection is also one of these absolute rights. However, in the present case, as the court already pointed out in the oral hearing on June 18, 2025, no damage has occurred, and there is no reason to even expect such damage to occur.

II. Fundamental Appeal

18 Even if the action is admissible, it is unfounded.

19 The plaintiff is not entitled to damages under Article 82(1) of the GDPR, because the processing of the personal data was necessary to protect the defendant's legitimate interests, and the plaintiff suffered no further damage.

20 In this case, the defendant did indeed transmit the plaintiff's so-called positive data to Schufa and thus process it. The forwarding of the positive data to Schufa is processing within the meaning of Art. EWG\_DSGVO Article 6 Para. EWG\_DSGVO Article 6 Para. 1 GDPR in conjunction with Art. EWG\_DSGVO Article 4 No. EWG\_DSGVO Article 4 No. 2 GDPR (as correctly stated by LG Paderborn, judgment of September 2, 2024 - LGPADERBORN file number 3O9624 3 O 96/24, para. LGPADERBORN file number 3O9624 2024-09-02 para. 53). The defendant is the data protection controller, while the plaintiff is affected by the forwarding of the positive data. The scope of application of Article EWG\_DSGVO Article 4 No. 2 GDPR is also open, because personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR was processed. Processing pursuant to Article 4(2) of the GDPR is any operation or set of operations performed on personal data, whether or not by automated means. According to Article 4(1) of the GDPR, personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

21 However, the processing of the personal data was lawful. The lawfulness of the processing of personal data is to be determined pursuant to Article 6(1) of the GDPR. The plaintiff has not given his consent to the processing of his personal data pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR. To the extent that the plaintiff argues that the resolution of the Conference of the Independent Data Protection Supervisory Authorities of the Federal and State Governments (DSK) does not consider the processing of positive data of private individuals from mobile phone contracts to be justified by Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, but rather requires effective consent, this is irrelevant, as the DSK is merely a working group whose resolutions are not binding (cf. Paal in NJW 2024, NJW Year 2024, page 1689, marginal no. NJW Year 2024, page 1689, marginal no. 11).

22 Rather, the processing of the plaintiff's personal data is justified pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, because the defendant had legitimate interests that made processing necessary. The defendant disclosed the plaintiff's positive data for reasons of fraud prevention and over-indebtedness prevention, thereby exercising a legitimate interest. For the prevention of fraud, the processing of positive data to the extent absolutely necessary represents a legitimate interest of the respective controller (as correctly stated by the Higher Regional Court of Koblenz, judgment of May 12, 2025 – OLG KOBLENZ, case number 11U133524 11 U 1335/24, para. OLG KOBLENZ, case number 11U133524 2025-05-12, para. 12). By disclosing the positive data, the contractual partner's data can be verified, thus preventing identity theft.

23 The processing of positive data also serves to protect victims of identity theft from fraudulent orders using their data (as correctly stated by the Paderborn Regional Court, judgment of September 2, 2024 – LGPADERBORN, file number 3O9624 3 O 96/24, paragraph 62). The transfer and processing of positive data also serves to prevent consumer over-indebtedness, as the risk of default and over-indebtedness patterns can be identified and prevented by determining creditworthiness (cf. Paal in NJW 2024, NJW Year 2024, page 1698, paragraph 5). Furthermore, the provision of accurate credit reports is of considerable importance for the functioning of the economy (see Federal Court of Justice, judgment of February 22, 2011 – BGH File No. VIZR12010 VI ZR 120/10).

24 Furthermore, the processing of personal data must be necessary to pursue the legitimate interest, and the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the person whose data are to be protected must not prevail (see ECJ, judgment of July 4, 2023 – ECJ File No. C25221 C 252/21, paragraph 106). In this respect, the plaintiff asserts the right to informational self-determination as an expression of the general right of personality pursuant to Article 2 (1) of the Basic Law in conjunction with Article 1 No. 1 of the Basic Law, or the right to the protection of personal data in the form of Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (GDPR) (cf. Munich Regional Court 1, judgment of April 25, 2023 - file number 33O597622 33 O 5976/22). However, the defendant explicitly referred to the disclosure of positive data in the data protection information sheet. Furthermore, it referred to the possibility of objection pursuant to Article 21 (1) of the GDPR. The plaintiff did not object to the disclosure but even expected it. Finally, in terms of safeguarding the defendant's legitimate interests, no less lenient means than the disclosure of the positive data can be identified within the context of the balancing of interests. Recourse to the German Insurance Industry's Reporting and Information System (HIS), invoked by the plaintiff, is not suitable in this respect, as this system pursues the interests of the insurance industry and cannot be transferred to the prevention of fraud and over-indebtedness with regard to the conclusion of mobile phone contracts. If the data processing is therefore found to be lawful, there is no right to an injunction, regardless of the admissibility of the application.

25 Ultimately, the plaintiff has not suffered any damage. In this case, he claims non-material damage in the form of a profound loss of control, fainting and anxiety states, as well as sleep problems, which collectively affect his quality of life. He is also concerned about his creditworthiness.

26 It can be seen here that the plaintiff is involved in consumer insolvency proceedings. It is therefore unlikely that his concerns about his creditworthiness can be attributed solely to a positive entry in the Schufa database regarding the conclusion of a mobile phone contract. Furthermore, the plaintiff's statements are also insufficient to consider the described personal and psychological impairments due to possible data protection violations as proven (cf. Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main, judgment of March 19, 2024 - LGFRANKFURTAM, case number 210O69123 2-10 O 691/23). The asserted abstract "loss of control" alone is not sufficient to establish non-material damage within the meaning of Article 82 GDPR. The plaintiff bears the burden of proof for any impairment beyond this (cf. Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main, loc. cit.). However, he has only described a general loss of control and has not specified it in more detail. Non-material damage cannot be derived from this.

27 In the absence of a breach of duty and damage, the plaintiff is also not entitled to a claim for damages.

§§ BGB § 280 para. BGB § 280 para. 1, BGB § 241 para. BGB § 241 para. 2 BGB. Against this background, both the claims for damages and, again regardless of admissibility, for a declaration of liability to compensate for further damages are ineffective.

28 In the absence of a claim in the main proceedings, the plaintiff is also not entitled to reimbursement of out-of-court legal fees. The action was therefore dismissed in its entirety.

III. Ancillary Decisions
