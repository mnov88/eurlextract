## English Summary

### Facts

A former employee, the data subject, advanced a complaint before the DPA against a construction company, their former employer, the controller.

The controller allegedly shared with a third party data related to their employment. Among these, there were: copies of the individual employment contract, the work aptitude sheet, and a medical certificate.

Subsequently, this data was later used in court litigation by the third party.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller shared this data unlawfully with the third party. The entirety of data processed included: name, surname, address, serial number and ID, personal numerical code, position/job/occupation, signature, date birth, home address, medical condition, signature and doctor’s initial.

The controller violated [Article 5(1)(a), (b) and (f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") due to the violation of the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency, as well the principles of purpose limitation and integrity and confidentiality. Moreover, the DPA found that the controller failed to fulfil its duties under the accountability principle, [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"). Moreover, the controller violated [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") and [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR") due to the unlawful disclosure of personal and sensitive data, among which medical condition.

*   Ensure GDPR compliance in relation to the subsequent processing of personal data collection and processing, so as to avoid accessing and disclosing personal data processed in violation of the principles of lawfulness;
