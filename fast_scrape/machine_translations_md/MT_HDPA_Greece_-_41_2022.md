## English Summary

### Facts

The Greek DPA initiated an investigation regarding the processing of health data in accordance with its ex officio competences under Articles 51 and 55 GDPR and Article 9 of National Law 4624/2019. The DPA examined the legal compliance of the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Labor and of Social Affairs, the Naval Defense Fund, the Ministry of Health and IDIKA S.A. (the controllers) with regards to the processing of personal data on the COVID-19 [self-test distribution platform](https://self-testing.gov.gr).

### Holding

The Greek DPA started by pointing out that certain restrictive measures, such as the obligation to use self-testing to control the spread of a virus, are justified by objectives of public interest, specifically the need to protect public health and, therefore, are permissible under Article 8(2) ECHR as well as Articles 9 and 25 of the Greek Constitution.

Further, the DPA examined whether the controllers possessed a valid legal basis for their processing activities, including the processing of special categories of personal data. In the present case, processing took place under [Articles 6(1)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") and [(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") as well as [Articles 9(2)(g)](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR") and [(i) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR") for sensitive data.

The DPA also assessed the compliance with transparency obligations under [Articles 5(1)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). It concluded that the information provided by the Ministry of the Interior regarding data retention periods was incomplete and opaque thereby violating [Article 13(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR#2 "Article 13 GDPR"). The investigated controllers did not comply with the storage limitation principle under [Article 5(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1 "Article 5 GDPR") because the data retention period was not specified in relation to the purpose for which the personal data was collected. For IDIKA S.A., the violation of this principle happened because the controller did not implement appropriate technical and organisational measures as provided in [Article 25(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR#1 "Article 25 GDPR"). Specifically, the controller did not undertake a risk analysis and assessment with regards to the storage period of students’ personal data on the self-test platform. Moreover, the controller did not provide documentation about the operation of a special application for the declaration of the self-test results for ship crew members. As a consequence, the DPA imposed a €5,000 fine on IDIKA S.A..

Additionally, the Greek DPA concluded that IDIKA S.A. and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs only prepared a data protection impact assessment after the start of processing against the provision of [Article 35(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR#1 "Article 35 GDPR"). Despite a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individual persons, including extensive processing of sensitive data, the Ministry of the Interior and the Naval Defense Fund did not carry out a data protection impact assessment at all. Hence, the DPA imposed on the controllers a fine of €5,000.

Finally, the DPA reprimanded the controllers for the above-discussed violations.
