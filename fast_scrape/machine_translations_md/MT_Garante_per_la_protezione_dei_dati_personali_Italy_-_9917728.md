## English Summary

### Facts

An advertising billboard depicted a first aid care setting with a first aid card visible in the scene. This contained the name of the data subject along with the name of their healthcare provider. The billboard was placed in the main entrance in the emergency room of an Italian hospital and was therefore, accessible to the public. The controller removed the billboard once notified of the data breach by the data subject. The controller also self-reported the breach to the DPA under [Article 33.](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR") Criminal proceedings were also launched against the controller’s data protection officer, which were later dismissed by a judge.

### Holding

The personal data (first and last name) was deemed health data under [Article 4(15)](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#15 "Article 4 GDPR") as the data subjects name was combined with the name of their healthcare provider.

Therefore, the controller's dissemination of the health data to the public was found to violate [Articles 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1 "Article 5 GDPR"), [(c)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1 "Article 5 GDPR") and [(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1 "Article 5 GDPR") as the processing was unlawful, excessive for its intended purpose and failed to ensure the security of the personal data. [Article 9](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR") was also violated as processing of health data is prohibited and the health authority failed to ensure privacy by design in its advertisement infringing [Articles 25(1) and (2).](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR#1 "Article 25 GDPR")

The DPA considered the corrective measure under [Article 58(2)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2 "Article 58 GDPR") to be the removal of the billboard. While the controller had removed the billboard without instruction, given that the breach had already occurred, the DPA nonetheless imposed a fine. The DPA found violations of [Articles 5(1)(a)(c)(f),](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") [9](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"), [25(1) and (2)](/index.php?title=Article_25_GDPR "Article 25 GDPR") and issued a fine of 25,000 euros under [Article 83.](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR "Article 83 GDPR")

XX whose terms were extended with a note of the XX prot. n. XX).

In this deed, the Office noted that the AUSL disclosed data on the complainant's health since the aforementioned billboard showed his personal data associated with the fact that an emergency medical service had been provided in violation of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8, of the Code and of the basic principles of the treatment pursuant to articles 5, 25 and 9 of the Regulation.

- “With Resolution of the General Manager n. 20th of the 20th century, the Code of Conduct of the USL Toscana Sud Est Company was updated, which contains specific provisions relating to the protection of personal data and the use of social networks.

2. Outcome of the preliminary investigation.

Having taken note of what is represented by the AUSL Toscana Sud Est in the documentation in the deeds and in the defense briefs, it is noted that:

pursuant to the Regulation, "data relating to health" are considered personal data relating to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information relating to his or her state of health (art. 4, par. 1, no. 15, of the Regulation). Recital no. 35 of the Regulation then specifies that data relating to health "include information on the natural person collected during his registration in order to receive health care services";

pursuant to the Regulation, personal data must be "processed in a lawful, correct and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness, correctness and transparency")" and must be "adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary with respect to the purposes for which are processed ("minimization of data")" (Article 5, paragraph 1, letter a) and c) of the Regulation);

the data must also be processed "in such a way as to guarantee adequate security (...), including protection, through appropriate technical and organizational measures, against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage (principle of " integrity and confidentiality")" (Article 5, paragraph 1, letter f), of the Regulation);

the data controller is required to implement "from the planning stage", i.e. both when determining the means of processing and at the time of the processing itself, "adequate technical and organizational measures, \[...\] aimed at effectively implementing the principles of data protection, such as minimisation, and to integrate the necessary guarantees in the processing in order to meet the requirements of this regulation and protect the rights of data subjects" (privacy by design), ensuring "that they are processed, by default" (privacy by default) «only the personal data necessary for each specific purpose of the processing» (art. 25, par. 1 and 2, of the Regulation);

the regulation on the protection of personal data provides that information on the state of health cannot be disseminated and can be communicated to a person other than the interested party only on the basis of a suitable legal prerequisite or on the indication of the interested party subject to written authorization of the latter (Articles 2 septies, paragraph 8 and Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Code and Article 9 of the Regulation);

the Authority since 2014, in accordance with art. 22, ch. 8 of the Code then in force, represented that "the publication of any information from which it is possible to infer the state of illness or the existence of pathologies of the subjects concerned is prohibited, including any reference to the conditions of invalidity, disability or physical handicap and /or psychic. To this end, from the stage of drafting the deeds and documents to be published, in compliance with the principle of adequate motivation, "excess", "irrelevant", "non-essential" (and, even less, "forbidden"). Otherwise, it is necessary to provide for the relative obscuration" (see Guidelines on the processing of personal data, also contained in administrative deeds and documents, carried out for purposes of advertising and transparency on the web by public subjects and other bodies obliged, part II, paragraph 1, of 15.5.2014, web doc. n. 3488002);

from the documentation produced in the deeds and also in the light of what is indicated in the order to dismiss the criminal proceedings initiated on the facts of the appeal adopted by the Judge for preliminary investigations of Arezzo on the XX, it is noted that the name and surname were recognizable on the aforementioned billboard of the complainant present in the first aid operator screen shot on the billboard;

the presence on the aforementioned billboard of the complainant's personal data associated with the health service provided to him in an emergency integrates a dissemination of data on his health since, according to what was declared in the documents, the aforementioned billboard had been located in the main patient entrance corridor in the emergency room, or in an area accessible to anyone;

from the documentation in the documents, it is therefore ascertained that the AUSL Toscana Sud Est has disseminated information on the state of health of an interested party since in the aforementioned advertising billboard, located in a place accessible to anyone, the name and surname of the complainant was recognizable on a first aid card displayed on the operator's screen shown on the aforementioned billboard.

3. Conclusions.

In the light of the assessments referred to above, taking into account the statements made by the owner during the preliminary investigation ˗ and considering that, unless the fact constitutes a more serious crime, anyone who, in a proceeding before the Guarantor, falsely declares or certifies news or circumstances o produces false deeds or documents and is liable pursuant to art. 168 of the Code "False statements to the Guarantor and interruption of the execution of the duties or the exercise of the powers of the Guarantor" ˗ the elements provided by the data controller in the defense briefs do not allow to overcome the findings notified by the Office with the deed of initiation of the proceeding, since none of the cases envisaged by art. 11 of the Regulation of the Guarantor n. 1/2019.

For these reasons, the unlawfulness of the processing of personal data carried out by AUSL Toscana Sud Est, in the terms set out in the justification, in violation of articles 5, par.1, lett. a), c) and f), 9 and 25, paras. 1 and 2, of the Regulation, of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8 of the Code.

In this context, it being understood that the AUSL Toscana Sud Est has declared that it has removed the aforementioned advertising billboard, the conditions for the adoption of the corrective measures pursuant to art. 58, par. 2, of the Regulation.

4. Adoption of the injunction order for the application of the pecuniary administrative sanction and accessory sanctions (articles 58, paragraph 2, letter i), and 83 of the Regulation; art. 166, paragraph 7, of the Code).

The violation of the articles 5, par.1, lett. a), c) and f), 9 and 25, paras. 1 and 2, of the Regulation, of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8 of the Code, caused by the conduct implemented by the AUSL Toscana Sud Est, is subject to the application of the administrative fine pursuant to art. 83, par. 4 and 5, of the Regulation and of the art. 166, paragraph 2 of the Code.

Consider that the Guarantor, pursuant to articles 58, par. 2, lit. i), and 83 of the Regulation, as well as art. 166 of the Code, has the power to "impose a pecuniary administrative sanction pursuant to article 83, in addition to the \[other\] \[corrective\] measures referred to in this paragraph, or instead of such measures, according to the circumstances of each single case" and, in this context, "the Board \[of the Guarantor\] adopts the injunction order, with which it also orders the application of the ancillary administrative sanction of its publication, in whole or in part, on the website of the Guarantor pursuant to article 166, paragraph 7, of the Code" (art. 16, paragraph 1, of the Guarantor's Regulation no. 1/2019).

The aforementioned pecuniary administrative sanction imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, must be determined in the amount taking into account the principles of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness, indicated in art. 83, par. 1, of the Regulation, in the light of the elements provided for in art. 85, par. 2, of the Regulation in relation to which it is observed that:

the Authority became aware of the event following the violation notification presented by the AUSL on XX pursuant to art. 33 of the Regulation and of the complaint presented by the interested party to XX (art. 83, paragraph 2, letter h), of the Regulation);

the dissemination concerns the personal data related to the provision of a first aid service of a data subject present on a single billboard placed in a place accessible to the public (Article 83, paragraph 2, letters a) and g), of the Regulation) ;

the aforesaid billboard was posted for a few weeks in a room which, although it was open to the public (main entrance corridor for patients to the Emergency Department), given the concomitance of the pandemic period, was intended for the transit of only Covid-negative patients 19 and precluded to their companions (article 83, paragraph 2, letter a) and g), of the Regulation);

the facts under examination occurred during the ongoing state of health emergency from Covid-19 (Article 83, paragraph 2, letters a) and g), of the Regulation);

the AUSL promptly cooperated in order to remedy the violation by removing the aforementioned billboard and warning the companies involved in the creation of the same to cancel the complainant's personal data, promptly reporting it to the same (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter f ) of the Regulation);

the AUSL has carried out mandatory training courses for staff for the year 2022 and planned a new training cycle for the year 2023, and carried out the training course in December 2022 "Data processing - with particular reference to images - in the Healthcare Company", which was attended by numerous operators of various profiles (technical, administrative, healthcare), of which a new edition is expected in 2023 (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter c), of the Regulation );

following the facts subject to the investigation, the AUSL has prepared a company procedure which governs the provision of a centralized supervision at company level in order to create materials with the use of images on any medium (signs, brochures, videos, photos, posts , etc.) aimed at publication/dissemination as part of the Company's institutional information, communication, education/health promotion initiatives (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter c), of the Regulation);

although the AUSL has been sanctioned for previous violations of the regulation on the processing of personal data, these do not concern the dissemination of health data (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter e) of the Regulation).

Based on the aforementioned elements, evaluated as a whole, it is decided to determine the amount of the pecuniary sanction provided for by art. 83, par. 5, letter. a), of the Regulation, to the extent of 20,000 (twenty thousand) euros for the violation of articles 5, par.1, lett. a), c) and f), 9 and 25, paras. 1 and 2, of the Regulation, of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8 of the Code, as a pecuniary administrative sanction withheld, pursuant to art. 83, par. 1, of the Regulation, effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

It is also believed that the ancillary sanction of publication on the Guarantor's website of this provision should be applied, provided for by art. 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and by art. 16 of the Regulation of the Guarantor n. 1/2019, also in consideration of the type of personal data subject to unlawful processing.

• "the positioning of the billboard with the above characteristics in the triage of the Emergency Department is attributable to an accidental internal action, to mere inattention in an exceptional temporal context given the persistence of an emergency state of health emergency (with the consequent load of organizational and human stress) and close to the planning and resumption of ordinary activities in anticipation of the cessation of the state of emergency";

• “Dated XX u.s., with PEC prot. no.

(…) following a complaint/complaint presented by the interested party through the lawyer Elisa Fornaciari, for the crime pursuant to art. 167 Legislative Decree 196/2003 in relation to the presence of the billboard at the Emergency Department of Arezzo”;

• "As regards organizational and procedural measures, including of a general nature, and staff awareness, to prevent similar episodes in the future, it should be noted that:

2. Outcome of the preliminary investigation.

Having taken note of what is represented by the AUSL Toscana Sud Est in the documentation in the deeds and in the defense briefs, it is noted that:

pursuant to the Regulation, "data relating to health" are considered personal data relating to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information relating to his or her state of health (art. 4, par. 1, no. 15, of the Regulation). Recital no. 35 of the Regulation then specifies that data relating to health "include information on the natural person collected during his registration in order to receive health care services";

pursuant to the Regulation, personal data must be "processed in a lawful, correct and transparent manner in relation to the interested party ("lawfulness, correctness and transparency")" and must be "adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary with respect to the purposes for which are processed ("minimization of data")" (Article 5, paragraph 1, letter a) and c) of the Regulation);

the data must also be processed "in such a way as to guarantee adequate security (...), including protection, through appropriate technical and organizational measures, against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage (principle of " integrity and confidentiality")" (Article 5, paragraph 1, letter f), of the Regulation);

the data controller is required to implement "from the planning stage", i.e. both when determining the means of processing and at the time of the processing itself, "adequate technical and organizational measures, \[...\] aimed at effectively implementing the principles of data protection, such as minimisation, and to integrate the necessary guarantees in the processing in order to meet the requirements of this regulation and protect the rights of data subjects" (privacy by design), ensuring "that they are processed, by default" (privacy by default) «only the personal data necessary for each specific purpose of the processing» (art. 25, par. 1 and 2, of the Regulation);

the regulation on the protection of personal data provides that information on the state of health cannot be disseminated and can be communicated to a person other than the interested party only on the basis of a suitable legal prerequisite or on the indication of the interested party subject to written authorization of the latter (Articles 2 septies, paragraph 8 and Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Code and Article 9 of the Regulation);

the Authority since 2014, in accordance with art. 22, ch. 8 of the Code then in force, represented that "the publication of any information from which it is possible to infer the state of illness or the existence of pathologies of the subjects concerned is prohibited, including any reference to the conditions of invalidity, disability or physical handicap and /or psychic. To this end, from the stage of drafting the deeds and documents to be published, in compliance with the principle of adequate motivation, "excess", "irrelevant", "non-essential" (and, even less, "forbidden"). Otherwise, it is necessary to provide for the relative obscuration" (see Guidelines on the processing of personal data, also contained in administrative deeds and documents, carried out for purposes of advertising and transparency on the web by public subjects and other bodies obliged, part II, paragraph 1, of 15.5.2014, web doc. n. 3488002);

from the documentation produced in the deeds and also in the light of what is indicated in the order to dismiss the criminal proceedings initiated on the facts of the appeal adopted by the Judge for preliminary investigations of Arezzo on the XX, it is noted that the name and surname were recognizable on the aforementioned billboard of the complainant present in the first aid operator screen shot on the billboard;

the presence on the aforementioned billboard of the complainant's personal data associated with the health service provided to him in an emergency integrates a dissemination of data on his health since, according to what was declared in the documents, the aforementioned billboard had been located in the main patient entrance corridor in the emergency room, or in an area accessible to anyone;

from the documentation in the documents, it is therefore ascertained that the AUSL Toscana Sud Est has disseminated information on the state of health of an interested party since the name and surname of the complainant was recognizable on the aforementioned billboard, located in a place accessible to anyone a first aid card displayed on the operator's screen shown on the aforementioned billboard.

3. Conclusions.

In the light of the assessments referred to above, taking into account the statements made by the data controller during the preliminary investigation ˗ and considering that, unless the fact constitutes a more serious crime, whoever, in a proceeding before the Guarantor, falsely declares or certifies news or circumstances o produces false deeds or documents and is liable pursuant to art. 168 of the Code "False declarations to the Guarantor and interruption of the execution of the duties or the exercise of the powers of the Guarantor" ˗ the elements provided by the data controller in the defense briefs do not allow to overcome the findings notified by the Office with the deed of initiation of the proceeding, since none of the cases envisaged by art. 11 of the Regulation of the Guarantor n. 1/2019.

For these reasons, the unlawfulness of the processing of personal data carried out by AUSL Toscana Sud Est, in the terms set out in the justification, in violation of articles 5, par.1, lett. a), c) and f), 9 and 25, paras. 1 and 2, of the Regulation, of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8 of the Code.

4. Adoption of the injunction order for the application of the pecuniary administrative sanction and accessory sanctions (articles 58, paragraph 2, letter i), and 83 of the Regulation; art. 166, paragraph 7, of the Code).

The violation of the articles 5, par.1, lett. a), c) and f), 9 and 25, paras. 1 and 2, of the Regulation, of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8 of the Code, caused by the conduct implemented by the AUSL Toscana Sud Est, is subject to the application of the administrative fine pursuant to art. 83, par. 4 and 5, of the Regulation and of the art. 166, paragraph 2 of the Code.

The aforementioned pecuniary administrative sanction imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, must be determined in the amount taking into account the principles of effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness, indicated in art. 83, par. 1, of the Regulation, in the light of the elements provided for in art. 85, par. 2, of the Regulation in relation to which it is observed that:

the Authority became aware of the event following the violation notification presented by the AUSL on XX pursuant to art. 33 of the Regulation and of the complaint presented by the interested party to XX (art. 83, paragraph 2, letter h), of the Regulation);

the dissemination concerns the personal data related to the provision of a first aid service of a data subject present on a single billboard placed in a place accessible to the public (Article 83, paragraph 2, letters a) and g), of the Regulation) ;

the aforesaid billboard was posted for a few weeks in a room which, although it was open to the public (main entrance corridor for patients to the Emergency Department), given the concomitance of the pandemic period, was intended for the transit of only Covid-negative patients 19 and precluded to their companions (article 83, paragraph 2, letter a) and g), of the Regulation);

the facts under examination occurred during the ongoing state of health emergency from Covid-19 (Article 83, paragraph 2, letters a) and g), of the Regulation);

the AUSL promptly cooperated in order to remedy the violation by removing the aforementioned billboard and warning the companies involved in the creation of the same to cancel the complainant's personal data, promptly reporting it to the same (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter f ) of the Regulation);

the AUSL has carried out mandatory training courses for staff for the year 2022 and planned a new training cycle for the year 2023, and carried out the training course in December 2022 "Data processing - with particular reference to images - in the Healthcare Company", which was attended by numerous operators of various profiles (technical, administrative, healthcare), of which a new edition is expected in 2023 (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter c), of the Regulation );

following the facts subject to the investigation, the AUSL has prepared a company procedure which governs the provision of a centralized supervision at company level in order to create materials with the use of images on any medium (signs, brochures, videos, photos, posts , etc.) aimed at publication/dissemination as part of the Company's institutional information, communication, education/health promotion initiatives (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter c), of the Regulation);

although the AUSL has been sanctioned for previous violations of the regulation on the processing of personal data, these do not concern the dissemination of health data (Article 83, paragraph 2, letter e) of the Regulation).

Based on the aforementioned elements, evaluated as a whole, it is decided to determine the amount of the pecuniary sanction provided for by art. 83, par. 5, letter. a), of the Regulation, to the extent of 20,000 (twenty thousand) euros for the violation of articles 5, par.1, lett. a), c) and f), 9 and 25, paras. 1 and 2, of the Regulation, of the art. 2 septies, paragraph 8 of the Code, as a pecuniary administrative sanction withheld, pursuant to art. 83, par. 1, of the Regulation, effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

It is also believed that the ancillary sanction of publication on the Guarantor's website of this provision should be applied, provided for by art. 166, paragraph 7, of the Code and by art. 16 of the Regulation of the Guarantor n. 1/2019, also in consideration of the type of personal data subject to unlawful processing.

Finally, it should be noted that the conditions pursuant to art. 17 of Regulation no. 1/2019 concerning internal procedures having external relevance, aimed at carrying out the tasks and exercising the powers delegated to the Guarantor.

ALL THIS CONSIDERING THE GUARANTOR
