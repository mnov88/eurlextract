## English Summary

### Facts

The data subjects submitted a request to the Municipality of Almere (the controller), under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"), seeking access to their personal data contained in their adult son's 'Social Support file'.

In May 2019, the controller provided partial access, refusing to provide access to the extent necessary for the protection of third-parties, their son.

The data subjects challenged the decision of the controller before the court of first instance (District Court of Midden), alleging that the controller withheld additional personal data.

The lower court partly agreed, finding that more data should have been disclosed, but upheld the decision on the extent that data concerning third parties should not be disclosed.

The data subjects appealed the decision before the the Council of State, claiming that it is up to them and not the controller or the court to judge whether the confidentiality and the right to privacy of others makes an intrusion into the lives of their families permissible. They also sought damages for exceeding the reasonable time limit to a fair and public hearing.

### Holding

The Council of State upheld the controller’s decision to withhold access to the data subjects' personal data where disclosure would have infringed the privacy of their adult son. It confirmed that in the event of a conflict between the full exercise of the right of access under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and the rights or freedoms of others, it is up to the controller to weigh them against each other. In this case the controller adequately justified the balancing of interests.

Additionally, it found that the total duration of the proceedings, exceeding the reasonable period of four years by two years and two months, violated the reasonable time requirement under [Article 6 ECHR](https://fra.europa.eu/de/law-reference/european-convention-human-rights-article-6). The court awarded €2,500 in damages, split among the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior, and the controller.

## Comment

This case highlights that the right of access under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") is not unlimited and must be weighed against the privacy interests of third parties.

## Judgment

202202760/1/A3. Date of judgment: July 2, 2025
DIVISION
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW
Judgment on the appeal of:
\[appellant A\] and \[appellant B\] (hereinafter jointly referred to as: \[appellant A\]), residing in Almere,
appellants,
against the judgment of the MiddenNederland District Court of March 15, 2022, in case no. 20/1726 in the proceedings between:
\[appellant A\]
and
the Municipal Executive of Almere.
Procedural history
By decision of May 28, 2019, the Municipal Executive partially rejected \[appellant A\]'s request for access to personal data.
By decision of March 23, 2020, the Municipal Executive supplemented the overview to be provided and declared the objection lodged by \[appellant A\] unfounded. In its judgment of March 15, 2022, the District Court upheld the appeal lodged against it by \[appellant A\], annulled the decision of March 23, 2020, and ruled that the legal consequences of this decision remain in effect.
\[Appellant A\] appealed this judgment.
The municipal executive provided a written explanation.
\[Appellant A\] submitted additional documents.
The municipal executive requested the Administrative Jurisdiction Division to apply Article 8:29 of the General Administrative Law Act (hereinafter: the General Administrative Law Act) to the unredacted documents relating to the case.
\[Appellant A\] granted the Division permission as referred to in Article 8:29, paragraph 5, of the General Administrative Law Act.
The Division heard the case at a hearing on November 27, 2024, at which \[appellant A\], accompanied by \[appellant B\], and the municipal executive, represented by B.M.E. Kunst, appeared. Considerations
Introduction and Judgment of the Court
1. The municipal executive partially granted \[appellant A\]'s request for access to personal data and provided an overview of \[appellant B\]'s and his personal data. The municipal executive supplemented this overview in its decision of March 23, 2020.
The appeal and the further appeal specifically concern the restriction of the municipal executive's right to access processed personal data of \[appellant A\] and \[appellant B\] in the file concerning the former tenant (urgency declaration) and in the Social Support Act/Sheltered Housing file (hereinafter: the Wmo file) of the son of \[appellant A\] and \[appellant B\].
2. Regarding the access to data in documents concerning the former tenant, the court, after reviewing the documents submitted only to the court with \[appellant A\]'s consent, considered that those data did not contain any personal data of \[appellant A\] and \[appellant B\]. The municipal executive therefore rightly refused access to this data pursuant to Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter: the GDPR). The court also considered that, to protect the privacy interests of third parties, the municipal executive was not required to grant access to these documents.
Regarding the access to the Social Support Act (Wmo) file and related documents of the son of \[appellant A\] and \[appellant B\], the court ruled that some of the requested data concerned personal data that the municipal executive should have included in the overview. At the hearing before the court, the municipal executive acknowledged that it had wrongly failed to do so.
Regarding the remaining personal data from the son's Wmo file, the court ruled that the interest in respecting the privacy of the adult son precludes access to the personal data of \[appellant A\] and \[appellant B\] that are included in the Wmo file. According to the court, the municipal executive has sufficiently substantiated the balancing of interests in the decision of March 23, 2020, and the underlying advice of the objections committee. \[Appellant A\] has not demonstrated that the interest of the right of access should outweigh the interest of \[appellant A\] in access in this case. The court ruled that the municipal executive was entitled to prioritize the son's right to respect for his privacy over \[appellant A\]'s interest in access.
Legal Framework
3. Pursuant to Article 15, paragraph 1, of the GDPR, the data subject has the right to obtain confirmation from the controller as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her is being processed and, if so, to obtain access to that personal data, the recipients, the source, and the processing purposes.
Appeal and Assessment
4. \[Appellant A\] argues that the court misinterpreted the GDPR request, even though he extensively described to both the court and the municipal executive what he intended with the request. In this regard, he claims to have been lied to by municipal officials because new documents repeatedly surfaced containing personal data relating to him and \[appellant B\]. Therefore, the court could not rely on the integrity of the officials.
4.1. \[Appellant A\] did indeed explain the purpose of the request in several documents. The court extensively outlined the municipal executive's position on this matter in consideration 2 of its ruling. In considerations 9 through 13, the court extensively addressed the grounds for appeal submitted by \[appellant A\] against the rejection of his request. The Division found no evidence that the municipal executive and the court misinterpreted his request.
In its decision of March 23, 2020, the municipal executive supplemented the previously obtained overview. The municipal executive also acknowledged at the hearing before the court that other processed personal data should have been included in the overview. The court also established this in its ruling, therefore upheld the appeal, and annulled the decision for this reason. Contrary to \[appellant A\]'s assertion, this does not, however, lead to the conclusion that he was lied to by municipal officials. \[Appellant A\] has not substantiated this assertion in any other way.
This argument is unsuccessful.
5. Regarding consideration 6 of the District Court's judgment, \[appellant A\], in short, argues that the District Court distorted his words, changed the context, and failed to assess the essence of the appeal.
5.1. In considerations 6 and 7 of its judgment, the District Court addresses \[appellant A\]'s arguments regarding the confidential documents. This is based on the additional documents that \[appellant A\] submitted to the District Court. The District Court also explained this in its considerations. The Division has not found that the District Court did not base its decision on the grounds and arguments put forward by \[appellant A\], or on a different context. \[Appellant A\]'s argument regarding the distorted course of events, as he claims the court presented in the 2018 annual report of the Appeals Committee, regarding the declaration of urgency, does not alter this. The Division notes that the court addressed the essence of \[appellant A\]'s appeal in considerations 9 through 16. The Division will discuss \[appellant A\]'s grounds of appeal relating to this in paragraph 7.
This argument is unsuccessful.
6. \[Appellant A\] argues that the court wrongly failed to recognize that his appeal to the so-called third rule of thumb of Widdershoven pertains to the actual situation of his son and the former tenant at a time when the decisions regarding sheltered housing and the urgency had not yet been made.
6.1. This argument was discussed further with \[appellant A\] at the hearing before the Division. The Division explained that this rule of thumb pertains to the concept of interested party and that \[appellant A\] and \[appellant B\] are undoubtedly interested parties in this appeal. Furthermore, these proceedings concern only \[appellant A\]'s request for access to personal data. Insofar as \[appellant A\]'s argument relates to the decision on his son's sheltered housing and the former tenant's declaration of urgency, it is considered that those decisions cannot be addressed in these proceedings. The aforementioned third rule of thumb is also irrelevant in this regard. Insofar as \[appellant A\] intended with this argument to emphasize the importance of access to his own personal data in the file on the declaration of urgency and in his son's Wmo file, the Division considers that this pertains to the reasoning for rejecting the request and that \[appellant A\]'s relevant grounds for appeal will be discussed below. 7. \[Appellant A\] argues that the court wrongly failed to recognize that both files contained very negative statements about \[appellant A\] and \[appellant B\]. It is up to \[appellant B\] and him, not the municipal executive or the court, to decide whether the confidentiality and right to privacy of others justify an intrusion into their family's life. The municipal executive's balancing of interests must not be preemptively biased against them.
7.1. At the hearing before the Division, \[appellant A\] explained that the supplementary document dated November 17, 2024, should be viewed primarily as substantiation of his argument set out in point 7.
7.2. The overview provided by the municipal executive includes the personal data of \[appellant A\] and \[appellant B\], the purposes for which these were processed, the recipients to whom they were provided, and the origin of the personal data. The municipal executive refused to grant \[appellant A\] and \[appellant B\] access to their personal data insofar as this was necessary for the protection of third parties.
Regarding the data in the file concerning the former tenant, the municipal executive took the position that access to this data would not be granted for the sake of the tenant's protection. The same applies to the Social Support Act (Wmo) file of the son of \[appellant A\] and \[appellant B\], but in the interest of protecting the son's privacy.
The Division has taken cognizance of the documents submitted under confidentiality. As the Division previously considered (judgment of 31 January 2024, ECLI:NL:RVS:2024:376, under 11.1), in the event of a conflict between the full exercise of the right of access, on the one hand, and the rights or freedoms of others, on the other, the rights in question must be weighed against each other. Contrary to \[appellant A\]'s argument, it is up to the municipal executive to make this balancing of interests and for the district court to rule on this matter, given \[appellant A\]'s grounds for appeal. The Division agrees with the district court that the municipal executive has provided sound reasons for arguing that the interest in respecting the privacy of the adult son of \[appellant A\] and \[appellant B\] in this case precludes access to their personal data processed in the Social Support Act (Wmo) file. The municipal executive's reasoning for the balancing of interests when rejecting the request for access to processed personal data concerning the former tenant is also sound. However, the Division does see reason to improve the reasoning of the district court's judgment on this matter, as the court also considered that the data did not contain personal data of \[appellant A\].
\[Appellant A\] also failed to demonstrate on appeal that the importance of the right of access should be given more weight in this case.
The grounds that \[appellant A\] further submitted in this regard on appeal are virtually a repetition of his arguments on appeal. The district court addressed these grounds with reasoning. The Division concurs with the district court's judgment and the considerations set out in paragraphs 15 and 16, on which that judgment is based.
This argument is unsuccessful.
8. At the hearing, \[appellant A\] further explained regarding the Wmo file that the processing of the personal data is unlawful. The municipal executive should have requested permission for the processing. This argument, whatever its merits, is unfounded, as these proceedings focus solely on the rejection of the request for access, and the lawfulness of the processing of the data is not at issue. 9. The appeal is unfounded. The Division upholds the District Court's judgment, insofar as it was appealed, with an amendment of the grounds.
10. The municipal executive is not required to reimburse legal costs.
Exceeding a reasonable period
11. \[Appellant A\] has requested compensation for damages because the reasonable period has been exceeded.
11.1. As the Division previously considered in its judgment of 29 January 2014, ECLI:NL:RVS:2014:188, the reasonable period, as referred to in Article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, has been exceeded if the duration of the entire procedure is excessive. In cases with a prior objection procedure, the period commences upon receipt of the objection by the administrative body. The period ends upon the court's judgment. The reasonable period for a three-tier procedure in cases like this one is, in principle, not exceeded if the procedure as a whole has not lasted longer than four years, with the objection hearing a maximum of six months, the appeal hearing a maximum of one and a half years, and the appeal hearing a maximum of two years.
11.2. At the time of this ruling, the reasonable period of four years has been exceeded by two years and two months. There are no special circumstances that could justify a longer or shorter hearing period.
11.3. Based on a fixed amount of €500.00 for each six months that the reasonable period has been exceeded, with the total rounded up, the damages to be awarded to \[appellant A\] amount to €2,500.00. The excess is attributable to the municipal executive, the district court, and the Division. Compensation for the damages is awarded to the municipal executive, the State of the Netherlands (the Minister of Justice and Security and the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations). 11.4. There are no legal costs for this request.
Decision
The Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State:
I. upholds the judgment of the District Court, insofar as appealed;
II. grants the request for damages;
III. orders the State of the Netherlands (the Minister of Justice and Security and the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations) to pay \[appellant A\] and \[appellant B\] €1,979.00 in damages (€521.00 to be paid by the Minister of Justice and Security and €1,458.00 to be paid by the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations);
IV. orders the Municipal Executive of Almere to pay \[appellant A\] and \[appellant B\] €521.00 in damages. Thus decided by Mr. J. Schipper-Spanninga, member of the single-judge chamber, in the presence of Mr. R.F.J. Bindels, clerk of the court.
