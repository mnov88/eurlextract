## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject received different calls by the controller, which used different phone numbers. These were national, foreign and anonymous numbers. The nature of the controller and the nature of these calls were not specified in the decision. The data subject asked the controller for a copy of his data ([Article 15 GDPR)](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and asked the controller multiple times to remove his data ([Article 17 GDPR)](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR"). The data subject submitted the erasure requests by e-mail and using the controller’s website. However, the controller never replied.

### Holding

The DPA held that the data subject properly submitted his access - and erasure requests ([Articles 15](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and [17 GDPR)](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR"). The DPA held that the controller breached [Articles 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR"), [Article 15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and [Article 17(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR") by not responding to any request made by the data subject. The DPA ordered the controller to fulfil the data subject requests within 30 days. This order was based on Article 95, § 1, 5° WOG (law establishing the Belgian DPA) and [Article 58(2)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR"). This order was not a final decision in light of article 100 WOG but a decision in a procedure prior to the decision on the merits.

                                                     Decision 160/2022 of 8 November 2022

File number : DOS-2022-04158

Subject: Complaint due to insufficient follow-up to the right of inspection

The Disputes Chamber of the Data Protection Authority, composed of Mr Hielke Hijmans,
sole chairman;

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council of 27 April 2016 on

the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and

on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (general
Data Protection Regulation), hereinafter GDPR;

Having regard to the law of 3 December 2017 establishing the Data Protection Authority, hereinafter WOG;

Having regard to the rules of internal order, as approved by the Chamber of Representatives
on December 20, 2018 and published in the Belgian Official Gazette on January 15, 2019;

Having regard to the documents in the file;

has taken the following decision regarding:

. The complainant: Mr X, hereinafter referred to as “the complainant”; .
. The defendant: Y, hereinafter “the defendant”. Decision 160/2022 - 2/6

I. Factual Procedure

    1. On 21 September 2022, the complainant submitted a complaint to the Data Protection Authority

        against the defendant.

        The complainant works in the IT sector and is regularly called by the

        controller, either via different (foreign) telephone numbers, or
        anonymously. The complainant indicates that he has already made several requests during these telephone conversations

        to delete his data, but this was never done. The complainant was allowed

        nor did we receive a response to the request for data erasure via the website or email

        regarding his data erasure request which he has sent directly to the

        data protection officer. On August 16, 2022, the complainant received another email

        a request for access in accordance with Article 15 GDPR and a request for data erasure
        in accordance with Article 17 GDPR addressed to the controller, to which he has no

        received a reply.

    2. On 12 October 2022, this complaint was declared admissible by the First Line Service on the basis of

        Articles 58 and 60 WOG and the complaint pursuant to Article 62, §1 WOG is transferred to
        the Disputes Chamber.

II. Motivation

    3. On the basis of the complaint and the enclosed supporting documents, the Disputes Chamber determines that the

        the complainant has properly exercised his right to erasure and right of access.

    4. With regard to the right of access, the Disputes Chamber refers to Article 15 GDPR. In accordance
        Article 15 GDPR, the data subject has the right to obtain a confirmation from the controller

        about whether or not personal data concerning him is being processed and, when

        that is the case, to obtain access to that personal data and to the following information:

        a) the processing purposes;

        b) the categories of personal data concerned;

        c) the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data are or will be

        provided, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations;

        d) if possible, the period during which the personal data is expected to be retained

        are stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria for determining that period;

        e) that the data subject has the right to request from the controller that
        personal data are rectified or erased, or that the processing concerns him

        personal data is restricted, as well as the right to object to that processing; Decision 160/2022 - 3/6

    f) that the data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;

    g) where the personal data is not collected from the data subject, all available

    information about the source of that data;

    h) the existence of automated decision-making, including those referred to in Article 22(1) and
    4, the profiling referred to, and, at least in those cases, useful information about the underlying

    logic, as well as the importance and expected consequences of that processing for the data subject.

5. Based on Article 17.1 GDPR, the data subject has the right of the controller

    to obtain the erasure of personal data concerning him without unreasonable delay.

6. Pursuant to Articles 12.3 and 12.4 GDPR, the controller shall inform the data subject within

    at the latest one month after receipt of the request for access to the requested information

    and to delete the personal data in question when requesting data erasure. In

    in the case of complex requests, this period can be extended by a further two months if necessary

    be extended. The controller shall inform the data subject within one month
    receipt of the request of such extension. When the

    controller does not comply with the request of the data subject, he shares it

    the latter without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request why it

    request has not been acted upon, and informs him of the possibility of lodging a complaint

    to a supervisory authority and appeal to the courts.

7. Based on the complaint and the documents submitted by the complainant, the Disputes Chamber will determine

    that the complainant should not have received any reply from the controller

    to his request for inspection, nor to his request for data erasure, which constitutes an infringement

    to Article 12.3 GDPR, Article 15.1 GDPR and Article 17.1 GDPR.

8. The Disputes Chamber is of the opinion that on the basis of the above analysis it should be
    concluded that the controller has committed a breach of the provisions of the

    GDPR was committed, which justifies taking a

    decision pursuant to Article 95, § 1, 5° WOG, in particular to order that the

    request of the complainant to exercise his rights, in particular the right of access (article 15.1

    AVG), and proceed to grant access to the relevant personal data and become

    complied with the request of the data subject to exercise his rights, in particular the right
    to data deletion (article 17.1 GDPR), and to delete the relevant data

    personal data.

9. The present decision is a prima facie decision taken by the Litigation Chamber

    in accordance with article 95 WOG on the basis of the complaint submitted by the complainant, in the context of Decision 160/2022 - 4/6

1 the “procedure prior to the decision on the merits” and no decision on the merits of the

          Disputes Chamber within the meaning of Article 100 WOG.

     10. The purpose of this decision is to inform the controller of the

          fact that it may have committed a breach of the provisions of the GDPR and put it in the

          possibility to still comply with the aforementioned provisions.

     11. However, if the controller does not agree with the content of this

          prima facie decision and considers that it may leave factual and/or legal arguments

          funds that could lead to a different decision, this can be done via the e-mail address

          litigationchamber@apd-gba.be to submit a request for consideration of the merits of the case to the

          Litigation Chamber and this within the period of 30 days after notification of this decision. The

          enforcement of this decision will, if necessary, take place during the aforementioned period

          suspended.

     12. In the event of a continuation of the handling of the case on the merits, the Disputes Chamber

          the parties pursuant to Articles 98, 2° and 3° in conjunction with Article 99 WOG invite their

          submit defenses as well as attach any documents they deem useful to the file. The

          the present decision will, if necessary, be definitively suspended.

     13. The Disputes Chamber points out for the sake of completeness so that a hearing on the merits of the case can take place

2 lead to the imposition of the measures referred to in Article 100 WOG.

     14. Finally, the Disputes Chamber points out the following:
