## English Summary

### Facts

A police officer (controller) used his work computer and credentials to access personal data of five people in the police system. The data he accessed included names, surnames, addresses, car registration numbers and mentions in reports. He however did not need to access these data in the performance of his official duties.

### Holding

The DPA held that these data were originally collected to carry out tasks by the police for lawful purposes. However, the police officer processed the data in a manner incompatible with these purposes, in violation of [Article 5(1)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR").

As he did not have to deal with these data in the performance of his job, the controller could not rely on a legal basis under Articles [5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [6(1)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR").

The DPA consequently fined the controller €500

## Comment

Slovenia implemented GDPR very recently. Altough there was a national privacy law, this decision is one of the first ones based on GDPR. The activity apparently did not fall under Directive (EU) 2016/680 but the GDPR. The decision does not give explanation on this but it is probably because the police officer acted for his own personal agenda.

If none of the beneficiaries of the request for judicial protection announces this request, the misdemeanor authority does not make a decision on misdemeanors with reasons, but it is considered that a final decision has been served on the date of service of the decision without reasons, which with the expiration of the deadline for announcing the request for judicial protection becomes final.

When at least one of the beneficiaries of the request for judicial protection announces the filing of this request, a written decision on misdemeanors with reasons is drawn up and sent no later than 30 days after the announcement of the filing of the request for judicial protection is received. In this case, the decision with reasons is served on all beneficiaries of the request for judicial protection.

A violator who does not announce a request for judicial protection against a decision on misdemeanors shall pay half the amount of the fine (250 euros) within eight days after the deadline for announcing a request for judicial protection has expired, otherwise he must pay the full amount of the fine within the deadline specified in the sentence this decision.
