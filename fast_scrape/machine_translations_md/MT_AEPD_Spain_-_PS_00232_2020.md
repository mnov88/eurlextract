## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant filed an action against Alterna Operador Integral SL (Flip Energy).

The complainant complained that her energy provider was switched from Naturgy to Flip Energy without her consent. Invoices proved that this change had occured.

As such, the complainant's personal data were transferred to Flip Energy without having proof of consent from the concerned data subject, the complainant, or that there were other legitimate purposes for processing that personal data.

Flip Energy claims that the subcontracted company (Sycgestion Global Energy, S.L.) was responsible for contacting and promoting Flip Energy services to the data subject.

### Dispute

Is it contrary to Article 6(1) of the GDPR for a customer to have their energy provider switch from one company to another without contracting with them or having gathered their consent prior to the switch?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) held that Alterna Operador Integral SL (Flip Energy) infringed Article 6(1) of the GDPR as it processed the complainant's data without a legal basis. The data subject's personal data were incorporated into Flip Energy's information system without proving that it was necessary for a contract, that the data subject had consented to it, or that there was another legal basis making the processing lawful.

The DPA noted that the complainant had taken no action or caution with the subcontracted company (Sycgestion Global Energy, S.L.) responsible for contacting and promoting Flip Energy services to the data subject. However, the DPA held that inactivity by Alterna Operador Integral SL (Flip Energy) lead to failure to take action or precautions.

The DPA also held that the defendant failed to prove that the complainant had contracted for the supply of energy from Flip Energy (and as such contracted for the switch). The defendant did not provide any documents obtained from the complainant indicating a contractual relationship which effectively identified the complainant.

Therefore, the Spanish DPA imposed a fine of €50,000 on Alterna Operador Integral SL for infringing Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR.

Article 83.5 of the RGPD.

FOURTH: Once the aforementioned initiation agreement was notified, the respondent requested an extension of

stated what he considered appropriate in defense of his interests, pointing out that the
provider processed the data of his contacts in his own name and on behalf of

diligence, since at the time that the claimant's granddaughter, in
representation of the claimant, contacted Alterna, on the occasion of

       Consequently, the claimant was registered in their systems as

In this regard, she was discharged from Alterna on January 21, 2020, having been

registered with another marketer by the claimant.

       It indicates that there was no type of penalty for the termination of the contract or

Article 83 RGPD and 76 LOPDGDD.

FIFTH: On October 16, 2020, the instructor of the procedure agreed to the
opening of a period of practical tests, taking as incorporated the
preliminary investigation actions, E / 03187/2020, as well as the documents
provided by the claimed.

SIXTH: On November 19, 2020, a resolution proposal was formulated,
proposing that the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/9

punish the complained party for an infraction of article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in the
Article 83. 5) of the RGPD, with a fine of 50,000 euros.

SEVENTH: Once the resolution proposal was notified, the claimed party submitted a written
of allegations being ratified in those made to the Initiation Agreement, that is to say:
but to conclude that the performance of my client in this case has been diligent and
according to the personal data protection regulations and this part wants to highlight
both the quick action and the good faith that ALTERNA has shown in each
moment, fulfilling the duty of diligence required, without prejudice, to the

corresponding responsibilities that, where appropriate, may correspond to the
Provider. SYC GESTION's performance was carried out not only in breach
flagrantly the contract signed with the Company, but rather, this party considers
proven the contractual bad faith of the aforementioned telemarketing entity, as well as a
malicious and potentially fraudulent attitude, which is why this party has

filed the pertinent complaint against the Provider.

In addition, the repeated non-observance of ALTERNA's instructions, as
data controller, necessarily convert SYC GESTION into
responsible for the treatment. My client was the victim of a hoax and understood that
there was a contractual relationship with the complainant. However, the error was corrected

with absolute speed, proceeding with total diligence: the data of the complainant is
remained active in the systems for only ten (10) days, proceeding my
represented, as soon as it became aware of the claimant's intention to
change marketer, to cancel its debt and, subsequently to the blocking of its
personal information. The Company has acted with the highest level of due diligence, of

compliance with its internal procedures, substituting the services of the Provider
by those of other partners who, like the Supplier, guarantee the strict
compliance with data protection regulations and that are more rigorous in their
committed SYC MANAGEMENT. In this sense, my client is immersed in a
process audit in order to carry out robust audits of your

suppliers and collaborators. In any case, it should be understood that there is no
of ALTERNA a subjective element of guilt for which it would be appropriate
decree the file of this sanctioning procedure. Personal information
affected, correspond mainly to contact and character data
identification, without including in any case, data from special categories of data or
criminal offenses. It is obvious and common sense that the activity of the

Company (like any other company) is linked to the treatment of
Personal data. However, the foregoing, ALTERNA's activity is not
linked to the infringing treatment of personal data, if not to the supply
energetic. The actions of the Company have in no case been intentional, or
malicious, nor has it received any kind of benefit. Also, he had no intention

any of violating data protection regulations, or causing damage or harm to
the complainant. That the present brief of
allegations, serve to admit it, and previous the appropriate procedures agree the file
of the referenced file, leaving without effect the procedure initiated against this
trade".

In view of all the actions, by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection
In this proceeding, the following are considered proven facts,

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/9

                                       ACTS

                               FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                            I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of
control, and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of
The Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to resolve this
process.
                                            II

       The complained party is charged with the commission of an infraction for violation
of Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", which indicates in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

       "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:
      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data

      personal for one or more specific purposes;
      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures

      pre-contractual;
      (…) "

       The offense is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance

with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/9

      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

       Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious ”provides:

      "1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
in particular, the following:

        (…)

       b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
       conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
       Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                            III

      The documentation in the file shows that the claimed,
violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, every time he processed the data
claims of the claimant without having any standing to do so. The data
Claimant's personal data were incorporated into the information systems of the

company, without having proven that it had legitimately hired, provided
of your consent for the collection and subsequent processing of your data
personal, or there is any other cause that makes the treatment lawful.

      The personal data of the claimant were recorded in the files of the
claimed and were processed for the issuance of invoices for services associated with the

claimant. Consequently, it has carried out a processing of personal data without
that it has proven that it has the legal authorization for it.

      It should be noted that the claimant did not adopt any kind of measure or
Caution with the outsourced company that you entrusted to carry out

hiring, and in this case the inactivity of the claimed was proven, in the
failure to adopt measures or precautions.

       Article 6.1 RGPD says that the treatment “will be lawful if it is necessary for the
execution of a contract in which the interested party is a party ”.

       It was therefore essential that the respondent accredited to this Agency that
the claimant had contracted with her the electricity supply; that at the time of the
contracting had deployed (through its treatment manager) the diligence
that the circumstances of the case required to ensure that the person who facilitated
as his bank details and other personal data was effectively his

headline.

       The respondent has not provided any document collected from the client at the time
of the contracting that allows its identification.

      In determining the administrative fine to be imposed, the
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, precepts that indicate:

      "Each supervisory authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines
administrative under this article for the infractions of this
Regulations indicated in paragraphs 4, 9 and 6 are in each individual case
effective, proportionate and dissuasive. "

      "Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of
each individual case, as an additional or substitute for the measures contemplated in the
