## English Summary

### Facts

Two customers of INDECEMI (the controller) were separately involved in a customer complaint procedure through the controller's website. At some point, they received an email addressed to them containing personal data of the other customer (name, surname, national identification number, address, telephone, and email address). One the customers (the data subject) reported this incident to the controller. Additionally, the data subject complained about this occurrence to the Spanish DPA.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA first noted that the controller was processing personal data in accordance with [Article 4(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR") by the collection, registration, use, etc. of personal information of natural persons, such as, name, identification number, number, phone number, email address etc.

Further, the DPA held that the data subject's personal data were improperly disclosed to another customer by the controller. Consequently, the DPA found a violation of the principle of confidentiality under [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR").

The DPA stated that the existence of a security breach does not automatically imply the imposition of a fine, but requires an analysis of the due diligence of managers and security measures applied. In this case, the complaint forms were mishandled while no evidence existed of appropriate security measures taken by the controller. Hence, the DPA held that [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") was also violated.

The DPA imposed a €3,000 fine for the infringement of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and a €2,000 fine for violation of [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). The DPA took into account mitigating circumstances, such as the fact that only two persons were affected by the confidentiality breach and that the controller, as a small business owner, did not handle vast amounts of personal data.

"The acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4,
5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result

contrary to this organic law”.

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 "Infractions considered very
serious” of the LOPDGDD indicates:

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the

                  Penalty for violation of article 5.1.f) of the GDPR

considers that the infringement in question is serious for the purposes of the GDPR, and that
it is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed according to the following criteria that

Article 83.2 of the GDPR establishes:

As mitigations:
       - The nature, seriousness and duration of the infringement, taking into account the
       nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question

       as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and
       damages they have suffered (section a). In the present case, only
       Two people were affected, and there is no record that they were caused
       some serious harm.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/8

Likewise, it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the
following criteria established in section 2 of article 76 "Sanctions and measures
corrective measures" of the LOPDGDD:

           INDECEMI, wholesale office furniture, does not indicate that
           handle a large amount of personal data

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the GDPR and the
Article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the offense committed by violating the
established in article 5.1.f) of the GDPR, allows setting a penalty of €3,000 (three
a thousand euros).

                                           SAW
Article 32 "Security of treatment" of the GDPR establishes:

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as risks of

variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which may include, among others:
       a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;

       b) the ability to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
       c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data
       quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
       d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness

       technical and organizational measures to guarantee the safety of the
       treatment.

2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration will be given to
take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data

personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or
unauthorized access to such data.

3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct pursuant to article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element

to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the
present article.

4. The controller and the processor shall take measures to ensure that
any person acting under the authority of the controller or processor and

have access to personal data can only process such data by following
instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the Law of
the Union or of the Member States.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/8

In the present case, at the time the breach occurred, it cannot be said that
INDECEMI had the appropriate measures to avoid the incident, since it
sent a claim form with personal data to a different client.

                                           VII
Article 83.4 of the GDPR under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of
administrative fines” provides:

paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 10,000,000 or,

the highest amount:

       a) the obligations of the person in charge and the person in charge according to articles 8,
       11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43; (…)”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 "Infractions" establishes that
"The acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4,
5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result

contrary to this organic law”.

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 73 "Infractions considered serious"
of the LOPDGDD indicates:

"Based on what is established in article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
are considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the

following:
       f) The lack of adoption of those technical and organizational measures that
       are appropriate to ensure a level of security appropriate to the

       risk of treatment, in the terms required by article 32.1 of the
       Regulation (EU) 2016/679. (…)

                                          VIII
For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount

considers that the infringement in question is serious for the purposes of the GDPR, and that
it is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the criteria established by the
article 83.2 of the GDPR and section 2 of article 76 “Sanctions and measures
corrective measures" of the LOPDGDD:

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the GDPR and the
Article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the offense committed by violating the
established in article 32 of the GDPR, allows a penalty of €2,000 (two thousand
euro).

Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and assessed the criteria of

graduation of sanctions whose existence has been accredited,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
