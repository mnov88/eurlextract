## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Civil Guard local office (the claimant) stating that the data controller had sent a Whatsapp message to a third party including personal data (name, surname, ID number) of three people (a mother and her children, probably underage) without their knowledge nor their consent. The complaint includes a copy of such message and a certification by the Civil Guard (although the mobile number of the sender is not identified).

The data controller did not answer to any AEPD investigation requests, so the AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Dispute

... ### Holding

The AEPD found that the data controller has infringed not only the integrity and confidentiality principle, but also the accountability principle of Article 5(2) GDPR and, after considering some aggravating circumstances \[(i) the data controller has performed a not intentional, but significantly negligent action; (ii) basic personal identification data have been affected (name, surname, domicile)\], it decided to impose a fine of 30,000 € to the data controller.

LEGAL BASIS
I
By virtue of the powers conferred on each supervisory authority by Article 58 (2) of the GDPR, and as set out in Articles 47 and 48.1 of the LOPDEAM, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.
II
## Article 6 (1) of the GDPR lays down the cases in which the processing of personal data may be considered lawful.

For its part, Article 5 of the GDPR provides that personal data shall be:
“(a) processed lawfully, fairly and transparently in respect of the data subject (“lawfulness, fairness and transparency”);
b)	collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’); 
oepd
c)	 adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (“data minimisation”);
d)	accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (‘accuracy’);
e)	maintained in such a way as to permit identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods provided that they are processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, in accordance with Article 89(1), without prejudice to the application of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to protect the rights and freedoms of the data subject (‘storage limitation’);
f)	processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).
The controller shall be responsible for and able to demonstrate compliance with paragraph 1” (“accountability”).”
— III —
It is considered that the facts reported, i.e. send the respondent by WhatsApp to a third party a document containing the personal data (names, surname and ID card) of three persons without their consent, constitutes a violation of Article 5 (1) (f) of the GDPR, which governs the principles of personal data integrity and confidentiality, as well as the proactive responsibility of the controller to demonstrate compliance.
IV
## Article 72 (1) (a) of the LOPD states that ‘ in accordance with the provisions of Article 83 (5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, infringements resulting in a substantial violation of the articles referred to therein shall be deemed to be very serious and shall be subject to a limitation period of three years.

(a) processing of personal data in breach of the principles and guarantees set out in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;
V
Article 58 (2) GDPR reads: ‘Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following corrective powers:
(b) to sanction any controller or processor with a warning when the processing operations have infringed the provisions of this Regulation; 
oepd
 (D) instruct the controller or processor that the processing operations comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period;
impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of each particular case;
VI
Such infringement may be penalised by a fine of up to EUR 20 000 000 or, in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 % of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, in accordance with Article 83 (5) of the GDPR.
It is also considered appropriate to graduate the penalty to be imposed in accordance with the following criteria laid down in Article 83 (2) GDPR:
As aggravating factors:
•	In this case, negligent action is not intentional, but it is significant (Article 83 (¬2) (b)).
•	There are basic personal identifiers (name, surname, address), as referred to in Article 83 (2) (g).
Therefore, in accordance with the applicable legislation and assessed the criteria for the gradation of sanctions whose existence has been established,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency:
FIRST: To impose a fine  of EUR 5000 (EUR) in respect of an infringement of Article 5 (1) (f) of the GDPR under (74345679) (f) of the GDPR, as set out in Article 83 (5) (a) of the GDPR.
