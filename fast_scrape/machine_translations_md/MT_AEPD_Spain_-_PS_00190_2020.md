## English Summary

### Facts

A Home Owners' Association released a debtors list, that was shown publicly in the building's hall, where address details, name and surname of the claimant could be found.

### Dispute

Is a Home Owners' Association allowed to publish such data?

### Holding

The AEPD determined that this behaviour infringed Article 5(1)(f) GDPR, because it discloses personal data without the consent of the data subject. The [Spanish law](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1960-10906) regulating private ownership of housing allows in its Article 19(3) Home Owners' Associations to publish of (personal) data in certain cases: for notification purposes, when other means have not resulted, for calling for meetings and for the publication of meetings memorandum. However, they are not allowed to publish personal data for mere informative purposes that are not supported by a legal ground.

The AEPD warned the Home Owners' Association and gave them a month to rectify the level of security of the data.

                                            I

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of

Community, personal data must adhere to a series of principles
in order not to violate data protection regulations.

As a means of personal and individualized notification to the owner, the Law of
Horizontal Property, indicates the assumptions in which the data exposure is authorized
of a personal nature related to matters arising from the management of the
Community of owners.

Its article 9. h) indicates as an obligation of the owner “Communicate to whoever exercises the
functions of secretary of the community, by any means that allows to have
proof of receipt, the address in Spain for the purposes of subpoenas and
notifications of all kinds related to the community.

In the absence of this communication, the address will be for citations and
notifications of the apartment or premises belonging to the community, having full effect
those delivered to the occupant of the same. If a subpoena or notification was attempted

will forward to the owners in accordance with the procedure established in article

call, meeting or minutes, but rather the desire to want to inform the
owners, although the community board should not serve as a board for

notify or inform when personal data is exposed, if the
requirements in each case indicated for said exposure and its functions shall be those of
notification or summons.
