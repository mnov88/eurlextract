## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant had five telephone lines contracted with Telefónica. One of these lines was used by her son, who received a message from Telefónica informing him that he had stopped sharing mobile data with the rest of the contracted lines. The complainant went to a Telefónica store to find out what had happened. There she was told that a third party, pretending to be the complainant, had changed the ownership of the telephone line.

### Dispute

The AEPD focuses its investigation on verifying whether the respondent processed the complainant's data in accordance with the principle of lawfulness of Article 6(1) GDPR. To this end, it was essential to ascertain whether the respondent took due diligence to ascertain the identity of the person who changed the ownership of the line.

### Holding

According to the AEPD, the respondent processed the claimant's personal data without the legitimacy to do so. The respondent carried out the change of ownership of the claimant's line without legitimacy to do so, because the commercial agent did not verify correctly de identity of the person who requested the change of the ownership of the line. The principle of lawfulness is at the core of the fundamental right to the protection of personal data and requires that it be proven that the data controller deployed the diligence necessary to prove this. Diligent compliance with the principle of lawfulness in the processing of third-party data requires that the controller be in a position to prove it (principle of accountability).

mechanism prior to the admission for processing of claims made before
the AEPD, consisting of transferring them to the Data Protection Delegates
designated by those responsible or in charge of the treatment, for the intended purposes

in article 37 of the aforementioned rule, or to these when it has not designated them,
transfer of the claim to the claimed entity to proceed with its analysis and
respond to the complaining party and this Agency within one month.

       As a result of this process, on July 8, 2020, the claimed
states:

       That they have sent a letter of response to the claim of the claimant.
They attach a copy of the letter.

THIRD: The result of the transfer process initiated in the previous event does not

allowed to understand satisfied the claims of the claimant. In consecuense,
given that the respondent replied only that “additional measures of
security". That is why on July 24, 2020, for the purposes provided in its
Article 64.2 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data agreed to admit the submitted claim for processing.

FOURTH: On September 25, 2020, the Director of the Spanish Agency
of Data Protection agreed to initiate a sanctioning procedure to the claimed, with
in accordance with the provisions of articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, of the
Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter,
LPACAP), for the alleged violation of Article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in Article

83.5 of the RGPD.

FIFTH: Once the aforementioned start-up agreement was notified, the respondent requested an extension
of term to formulate allegations.

On October 5, 2020, the granting of the extension of the
mentioned term for 5 days.

Subsequently, the defendant presented allegations in which, in summary,
stated that: “TME has a consolidated and adequate procedure for
verification of the identity of our clients. In this verification procedure

identity are requested, in addition to the identifying data of the old and new
holder, the last 4 digits of the bank account of the former holder.
Therefore, it is interesting to emphasize that the reason for the situation exposed by the
claimant is due to the illegal obtaining and use of the personal data of the
claimant by the impersonator and subsequent deception of the commercial agent of

\*\*\* PHONE. 2 that processed the request to change the owner, and not to a treatment
illegitimate of the data of the claimant by my client.

Once the claim has been filed with TME, two days after having
produced the change of holder and subsequent duplicate of card, it is offered to the

claimant the possibility of restoring ownership of the line. However, the
Claimant expresses the wish that no further formalities be carried out, in the
extent to which you prefer to be advised by your lawyers.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/8

Consequently, my client considers that there has been no violation of article
6.1 of the RGPD to carry out the treatment of the claimant's data on their part,

but by an impersonator, since the treatment of these data by
TME is necessary to manage the contractual relationship with the claimant, and the
effects of carrying out said treatment, TME has established an operation that covers
sufficient guarantees to ensure compliance with current regulations in
data protection matter ”.

Requests that the circumstances that have occurred in the events be taken into account
object of the procedure and, in the event that the infringement is appreciated, the
amount of the penalty proposed in the Initiation Agreement and that Resolution is issued
ordering the filing of the present sanctioning file or alternatively,

opening of a period of practice tests, taking as incorporated all the
previous actions, as well as the documents provided by the claimed.

SEVENTH: On December 3, 2020, the resolution proposal was formulated,
proposing that the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection
punish the complained party for an infraction of Article 6.1 of the RGPD, typified in the
Article 83.5 of the RGPD, with a fine of 75,000 euros.

EIGHTH: The proposed resolution was notified, on December 9, 2020, it requested
extension of term to formulate allegations, being granted.

The complained party submitted a brief of allegations, ratifying those made at the

Initiation Agreement, requesting a declaration of non-existence of
responsibility on the part of the claimed for an alleged infringement that is imputed in
this procedure, and a Resolution is issued ordering the filing of the
present sanctioning file to the referenced margin, and alternatively, lower
the initially proposed sanction of art. 83 of the RGPD.

 In view of all the actions, by the Spanish Agency for the Protection of
Data in this procedure are considered proven facts the following:

                                 PROVEN FACTS

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/8

SECOND: It is clear that on January 14, 2020, the claimant's son receives a
message informing him that said line had stopped sharing mobile data with the
rest of the lines. Contact the claimed and inform her that the line was

deactivated and that it was no longer owned.

incidence the claimed (provide name and surname of the third party, address, store, date
and time, and incident number).

is due to the illegal obtaining and use of the claimant's personal data by

\*\*\* TELEPHONE. 2 that processed the request to change the owner.

                                FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

                                             I

       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority and as established in arts. 47 and 48.1 of LOPDGDD, the
Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve
this procedure.
                                            II

       The complained party is charged with the commission of an infraction for violation
of Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", which indicates in its section 1 the
cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

        "one. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met

terms:
      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data

      personal for one or more specific purposes;
      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures

      pre-contractual;
      (…) "

       The offense is typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance

with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/8

total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

       Organic Law 3/2018, on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious ”provides:

      "one. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
in particular, the following:

        (…)
       b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
       conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
       Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                            III

      The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
claimed violated article 6.1 of the RGPD.

      In this sense, it is proven that the respondent processed the personal data of
the claimant without standing for it. It is clear that the claimed has carried out
the change of ownership of the claimant's line, without standing for it, such
as recognized by the respondent in her allegations, stating: “that it is due to the
Obtaining and illegal use of the personal data of the claimant by the
impersonator and the subsequent deception of the impersonator to the commercial agent of 1004 that

processed the request for a change of ownership ”.

       Based on the foregoing, in the case analyzed, it remains in
the diligence employed by the claimed party questioned.

       Respect for the principle of legality that is in the essence of fundamental right
protection of personal data requires that it be proven that the
responsible for the treatment displayed the essential diligence to prove that
extreme. If this Agency does not act in this way - and if this Agency does not demand it, it is incumbent upon
for compliance with the regulations governing the data protection right of

personal character - the result would be to empty the content of the principle of legality.

       The lack of diligence displayed by the entity in complying with the
Obligations imposed by the regulations for the protection of personal data
It is thus obvious. A diligent compliance with the principle of legality in the treatment
of third-party data requires that the person responsible for the treatment is in conditions

to prove it (principle of proactive responsibility).

       Thus, it has been established that the respondent processed the data
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/8

personal data of the claimant, who denies their consent to the treatment, and as long as
the first has not provided any evidence to disprove such evidence, it is estimated
that the facts that are submitted to the assessment of this Agency could be

constituting an infraction of article 6.1 of the RGPD, infraction typified in the
Article 83.5 of the aforementioned Regulation 2016/679.

                                               IV

        treatment;
         f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to

        h) the way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement,
        in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infraction and, in such
        case, to what extent;

        i) when the measures indicated in Article 58 (2) have been
