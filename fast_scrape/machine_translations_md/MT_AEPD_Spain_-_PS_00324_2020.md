## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject submitted a complaint to the AEPD stating that the defendant had sent an email containing an accusation of attempted fraud, letter of dismissal, and severance pay of the claimant, to a third party without the their authorisation. This information as well as the response from the third party to the email received, became known to the data subject when appearing before the Court of First Instance of Solares (Cantabria) following a report the defendant made to the Local Police of Santander for theft of tools. The third party upon receiving said documents responded stating the following:

“… We believe that the accompanying documentation, particularly the letter of dismissal and the corresponding severance pay, should not have sent to us as it contains personal data ...”

The AEPD sent a request for information to the defendant but they did not respond. The AEPD admitted the data subject's complaint in accordance with Article 65 LOPDGDD and decided to initiate a sanctioning procedure in accordance with Article 83(5)(a) GDPR against the defendant for alleged infringement of Article 5(1)(f) GDPR.

### Dispute

Does the action of the defendant constitute a violation of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR")?

### Holding

Considering the evidence available, the AEPD held that the action of the defendant violated the principle of confidentiality established in Article 5 (1)(f) GDPR by sending an email containing the data subject's personal data without authorisation for doing so, and decided to impose a fine of €10,000 on the defendant.

The fine imposed falls within the criteria stated in Article 83(5)(a) GDPR. In imposing the fine, the AEPD factored in accordance with Article 83(2) GDPR and Article 76 LOPDGDD the following points:

*   The local scope of processing concerned by the defendant
*   The volume of data subject affected. In this instance, only one person was affected.
*   There is no evidence of actions taken by the defendant to mitigate the damage suffered by the affected data subject and to prevent recurrence as the defendant did not respond to the request of information made by the AEPD, this also reveals the absence of cooperation of the defendant with the supervisory authority, in order to remedy the infringement and mitigate its possible adverse effects.
*   There is no evidence that the defendant acted intentionally, however, it is evident that the actions constitute a high degree of negligence.
*   The defendant is a small-sized company.

## Comment

It would have been interesting to know if the defendant provided the data subject with a copy of its Privacy Notice and whether the categories of the data disclosed, the name of the third party, and the legal basis for sending personal data to the third party were included in it.

       instead of the measures mentioned in this section, according to the

       circumstances of each particular case;
       (…) "

       In the first place, the treatment of the claimed person could constitute a
violation of article 5, Principles relating to treatment, of the RGPD that establishes

what:

       "1. The personal data will be:

       (…)
       f) treated in such a way as to guarantee adequate security for the

       personal data, including protection against unauthorized processing or
       illicit and against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application
       appropriate technical or organizational measures ('integrity and

       (…)

       Article 5, Duty of confidentiality, of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights
(hereinafter LOPDGDD), states that:

       "1. Those responsible and in charge of data processing as well as all

                                           IV
       The documentation in the file shows that the defendant
violated article 5 of the RGPD, principles relating to treatment, in relation to the
## Article 5 of the LOPGDD, duty of confidentiality, when sending an email to

a third party, containing the dismissal and termination document, revealing your

personal character and being accessible to third parties without their authorization.

It is understood that its purpose is to prevent leaks of data not

       (…) "

                                           SAW

observe the provisions contained in articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, which
point out:

       "1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of fines

        or indirectly, through infringement.

        In relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, in its
Article 76, “Sanctions and corrective measures”, establishes that:

        "2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU)
2016/679 may also be taken into account:

        a) The continuing nature of the offense.
        b) The linking of the offender's activity with the performance of treatments

        of personal data.
        c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the offense.
        d) The possibility that the affected person's conduct could have led to the
        commission of the offense.
        e) The existence of a merger process by absorption after the commission
        of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.

       claimed.

       The number of affected is limited to a single person, the claimant.

       The measures taken by the defendant to avoid being

       the Agency has not responded to it, which in turn affects the absence
       of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to remedy the

       infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the same.

       There is no evidence that the entity acted maliciously, although
       the performance reveals a serious lack of diligence.

graduation of sanctions whose existence has been proven,
