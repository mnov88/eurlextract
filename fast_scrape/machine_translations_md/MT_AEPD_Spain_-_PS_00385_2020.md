## English Summary

### Facts

10 individuals complained about the Canary Click Consulting website, who claimed to offer processing services for obtaining certain official certificates.

The individuals complained that they had to enter personal data and pay a fee in order to receive official certificates, but only received instructions on obtaining the certificates once they did this. Several complainants also stated that the company gave them no information about the storage or deletion of their data once they asked for a refund.

On their investigation, the AEPD found the following:

*   URL 1’s privacy policy stated that personal data would only be used for “strictly necessary purposes”, but also that marketing was an object of the processing. URL 1 also did not provide an option to reject cookies.
*   URLs 2, 3 and 4 had no cookie banner and no rejection mechanism in their cookie policies. When users sought to delete cookies, the URLs instructed them to “configure the browser on their terminal equipment.”

### Dispute

Were URLs 1-4 in breach of the GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD held that Canary Click Consulting breached European and Spanish data protection law.

It held that URL 1 breached Article 7 of the GDPR because the users had to “generically” give their consent to all processing purposes, meaning they could not withdraw consent for specific purposes, such as marketing. For this the AEPD issued Canary Click with a warning and ordered them to bring URL 1 and their privacy policy in line with Article 6(1)(a) GDPR within a month.

The AEPD also held that URLs 1-4 breached Article 22(2) of the [Law 34/2002 (LSSI)](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2002-13758), the Spanish law implementing the e-Privacy Directive. For this, Canary Click was fined €8,000, i.e. €2,000 per URL.

A) .- On the consent given by the users of the website, \*\*\* URL.1:

As indicated on the website, the purpose for which the data is processed is for management
to obtain the European Health Card or proceed with its renewal.

However, in its Privacy Policy, \*\*\* URL.6, it is indicated, among others, that: "
personal data that is collected is strictly necessary for the

sending newsletters and own commercial offers (…) ”. Later, it
continues to indicate: “(…) we will treat your personal data provided through
our web forms for sending commercial communications related to the
goods or services that make up our activity, and / or related news or bulletins
two with our sector (…) ”.

Article 6.1.b) of the RGPD, establishes that the processing of personal data will be
lawful if necessary for the performance of a contract in which the interested party is a party
tea. In this case, the processing of personal data by the person responsible
It will be lawful as long as the purpose for which they are used is related to obtaining
tion of the European Health Insurance Card.

For any other data processing, the person in charge must do so in a manner
lawful, in accordance with the provisions of article 6.1 of the RGPD, that is: “a) the interested party
gave your consent for the processing of your personal data for one or more
specific purposes; b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in the

that the interested party is part of or for the application at the request of this of measures
pre-contractual; c) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of a
legal obligation applicable to the person responsible for the treatment; d) treatment is necessary

the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the interested party prevail
that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the interested party
be a child.

If the controller chooses to base the lawfulness of the treatment on consent, (6.1.a),
It will only be lawful if the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
personal for each of the different purposes. It is not valid, therefore, to mark the
chair of acceptance of the privacy policy, consenting to it, in a generic way

For its part, article 7 of the RGPD indicates, regarding consent, that:

the fact whether, among other things, the performance of a contract, including the provision of
of a service, is subject to consent to the processing of personal data that

they are not necessary for the execution of said contract ”.

Likewise, article 6.2 of the LOPDGDD indicates, on the treatment based on the
feeling, that: “2. When it is intended to base the treatment of the data on the
sentiment of the affected person, for a plurality of purposes, it will be necessary to
