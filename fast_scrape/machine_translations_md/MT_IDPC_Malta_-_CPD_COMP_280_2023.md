## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject filed a complaint with the Maltese DPA because a lecturer (working for the controller) sent personal school materials via the data subject's personal email address. The emails sent by the controller to the data subject included colleagues of the data subject in the "cc". Thus, the personal email address of the data subject was disclosed to unauthorized third parties.

Because of this, the data subject requested the controller to use "bcc" when sending her personal emails. The controller stated that this was not possible because their way of communication was by group. The controller instead requested the data subject to provide them with an alternative email address.

### Holding

The DPA mentioned that a person's email address, that consists of one's first and surname, constitutes personal data according to [Article 4(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#1 "Article 4 GDPR"). Therefore, the controller is subject to [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR") and has to demonstrate and be responsible for compliance with GDPR provisions. The controller has to ensure appropriate safeguards according to [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"). This is further regulated in [Article 32(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1 "Article 32 GDPR"). The controller did not prove that they implemented appropriate safeguarding measures, only saying that it is not possible. The DPA held that the controller's processing constitutes an infringement of [Article 32 (1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

Therefore, the DPA upheld the data subject's claim.

Information and Data Protection Commissioner

                                                                      CDP/COMP/280/2023

COMPLAINT

    1. On the 1" March 2023,                   (the "complainant") lodged a complaint with the 
        Information and Data Protection Commissioner (the "Commissioner") pursuant to article 
        77(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation' (the "Regulation"), alleging that a lecturer
        working for                                                 (the "controller" or the
        64      .") continued to send Microsoft Teams' links and classwork on her personal email
        address, without using the 'blind carbon copy', and as a result, disclosed her email address to 
        unauthorised third parties.

INVESTIGATION

Request for submissions

    2. Pursuant to article 58(1)(a) of the Regulation, the Commissioner provided with a copy 
        of the complaint, including the documentation attached thereto, and requested it to put forward 
        its submissions in order to defend itself against the allegations raised by the complainant. By 
        means of an email dated 12th April 2023,    submitted the following principal arguments 
        for the Commissioner to consider in his legal analysis of the case:

  Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection 
of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and 
repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).

                                                                                  Page 1 of 6

                 i.  that in an email dated 28' February 2023 sent to the controller, the complainant noted 
                     that she had two lectures, one on Monday and the other on Wednesday, during which 
                     the lecturer teaching her on Wednesdays consistently sent personal emails, including 
                     all other group colleagues in 'CC '. The complainant expressed her concern that this 
                     practice amounted to a data breach, stating that there should be a method to send 
                     Microsoft Teams' links and information without divulging personal email addresses;

                ii.  that on the same day, the complainant sent another email to   's general email
                     address                           , wherein she informed          that "Non-
                             users are now using this as a thread with all in copy to my personal email. I 
                     did not consent for my personal details to be used in this way. Can this practice please 
                     be reviewed?". Moreover, in this email, she attached a list of her colleagues' emails as 
                     evidence to substantiate her claim;
               iii.  that the complainant also attached a reply (dated 22nd February 2023) that she received 
                     from her lecturer on this subject, stating that "I am very sorry but the way we send 
                     communication is as a group. Kindly send email that we can use in the group to 
                     admin explaining the situation";
               iv.   that the complainant's lecturer a part-timer at , with an eight-week contract to
                     teach               , and she admitted to being fully aware of the     ' Data 
                     Protection Policy & Procedure;
                v.   that the lecturer confirmed the following points:
                      ▪    that the complainant, along with all other class colleagues, were informed prior
                           to their registration for the course that Microsoft Teams served as the designated 
                           learning-teaching platform;

                      ■    that the lecturer requested the complainant to provide an alternative email, she 
                           failed to do so;
                      ■    that Microsoft Teams was the designated platform for this module, which was 
                           adopted during the Covid era when learning shifted from face-to-face to online, 
                           and therefore all the participants' emails were required for communication 
                           purposes. Technically, the system could not be altered or modified as it

                                                                                        Page 2 of 6

                          constitutes an integral part of Microsoft Teams. It was further noted that the 
                          Director for Student Services also corroborated all the aforementioned 
                          testimonies.

          3. In line with the Commissioner's complaint-handling procedure, on the l 9th April 2023, the 
              Commissioner provided the complainant with the opportunity to rebut the arguments made by 
              the controller. On the same day, the complainant rebutted the arguments made by the controller 
              and submitted the following salient points:

                  that the complainant upheld that "\[m\]y complaint isn't about teams as I log in with the 
                  email provided by

             ii.  that "\[m\]y complaint is the fact that lecture material was distributed via my personal email
                  through cc. I had requested bcc as I didn't want my email shared with the people on the 
                  course, and it was not just limited to my group-.

       LEGAL ANALYSIS AND DECISION

          4. During the course of the investigation, the Commissioner established that 's lecturer 
              sent various school-related emails to various recipients using the 'to' field instead of the 'blind 
              carbon copy' field. The complainant's personal email address was included in this 
              communication and, as a result, disclosed to the other recipients.

          5. The Commissioner notes that an email address which contains the name and surname' of a 
              natural personal constitutes "personal data" within the meaning of article 4(1)3 of the 
              Regulation. In this context, recital 26 of the Regulation states that a person may still be 
              identifiable after taking into account "all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as 
              singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person 
              directly or indirectly" \[emphasis has been added\].

       2 This has been confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Doreen Camilleri vs Kummissarju ghall-lnformazzjoni u l-Protezzjoni 
       tad-Data, Appeal No. 63/17.
       3 Article 4(1) of the Regulation defines 'personal data' as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural 
       person ('data subject); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by 
       reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors 
       specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;'

                                                                                       Page 3 of 6

      6. Accordingly, the controller is obliged to ensure that its processing activities are carried out in a 
        manner that ensure appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against 
        unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data. By virtue of the principle of 
        accountability held under article 5(2) of the Regulation, the controller is responsible for, and 
        must be able to demonstrate compliance with the principles of data processing, specifically the 
        principle of integrity and confidentiality pursuant to article 5(1)(0 thereof.

      7. The principle of integrity and confidentiality is further reflected in article 32(1) of the 
        Regulation, which is more prescriptive and sets out the obligations to which the controller is 
        subject, in terms of data security. In this respect, article 32(1) of the Regulation obliges the 
        controller to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of 
        security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of 
        implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of 
        varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

      8. The Commissioner stresses that the controller should select the appropriate security measures 
        which are necessary to effectively protect the personal data prior to the processing activity. 
        This, therefore, obliges the controller to put in place proactive measures to ensure compliance 
        with the provisions of the Regulation.

      9. The obligation of personal data security should therefore be construed as an obligation to 
        guarantee a "level of security appropriate to the risk". In this aspect, article 32(2) of the 
        Regulation stipulates that "in assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be taken 
        in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or 
        unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of or access to personal data 
        transmitted, stored or otherwise processed".
      10. After thoroughly examining the submissions furnished by the controller, particularly those 
        presented on the 12' April 2023, wherein it was stated that, "I am very sorry but the way we 
        send communication is as a group", and taking into account the surrounding circumstances that 
        led to the unauthorised disclosure of the complainant's personal data, the Commissioner 
        determined that the controller did not adequately prove that it had implemented the appropriate 
        technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

                                                 Page 4 of 6

   In light of the foregoing, the Commissioner hereby decides that the controller infringed article 

   32(1)(b) of the Regulation, when it failed to implement the appropriate technical and 

   organisational measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality of the complainant's personal data, 

   including the principle of integrity and confidentiality pursuant to article 5(1)(f) of the 

   Regulation.

   In terms of article 58(2)(d) of the Regulation, the controller is hereby being ordered to implement 

   the appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality of 

   the processing of personal data when sending bulk emails to multiple recipients.

   Furthermore, the controller is being advised that school-related emails should be sent to the email 

   address provided by , unless the controller obtains written consent, by virtue of which 

   they assent to the use of their private email for such purposes.
