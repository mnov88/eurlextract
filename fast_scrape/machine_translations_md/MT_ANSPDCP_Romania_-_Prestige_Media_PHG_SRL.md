## English Summary

### Facts

A complaint was filed with the Romanian DPA, alleging that Prestige Media PHG SRL (the controller) published confidential documents, such as terminations of employment contracts of another company's employees (the data subjects) on its website. As a result, the DPA started an investigation into the controller.

During the investigation, the DPA confirmed that, indeed, 23 such documents were published on the controller's website. The publications contained the name, surname, position, employment contract number and disciplinary violations of these employees. The DPA also found that the data subjects had no legal relationship with the controller.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller did not provide evidence of the fact that it lawfully processed the personal data of the 23 data subjects. As such, the DPA found that the controller violated the principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency laid down in [Article 5(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), the principle of accountability laid down in [Article 5(2)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). Therefore, the DPA fined the controller €5,000. The DPA also ordered the controller to remove all information that allowed the identification of the data subjects from the publications on its website.

## Comment

The Romanian DPA rarely published full decisions. This summary is based on a press release of the Romanian DPA.
