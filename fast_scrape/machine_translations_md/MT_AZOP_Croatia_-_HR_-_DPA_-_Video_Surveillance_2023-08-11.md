## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant alleged that the owner had installed two surveillance cameras on metal poles at their residential property.

The cameras captured areas including properties owned by the complainant and their father, as well as parts of a public pathway used by others.

Following an inspection, the agency confirmed that the cameras were positioned to monitor the public pathway excessively. The findings were documented in a report dated 11 August 2021.

### Holding

The AZOP determined that the surveillance system violated [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") because monitoring public areas is permissible only for public authorities or other authorized entities, and only when legally mandated and strictly necessary.

The agency ordered the owner to: Adjust the camera angles to ensure that public areas were no longer monitored beyond what was necessary for property protection and delete all recordings obtained unlawfully.

The owner was given 15 days to comply and instructed to provide proof of compliance, including photographs of the adjusted camera views and evidence of deleted recordings.

The decision specified that no appeal was allowed but permitted the initiation of an administrative dispute before the Administrative Court within 30 days.

                                    R e p o n t i o n 

1The Personal Data Protection Agency (hereinafter: the Agency) has received a request for establishing a violation of the applicant's right to personal data protection, in which the applicant essentially states that at the address xy, person x (owner) has installed two cameras on metal

poles that are directed towards real estate owned by the applicant and his father and towards the road used by other citizens, stating that this has directly
infringed his rights to personal data protection.

Acting on the request for establishing a violation of the applicant's right to personal data protection

the request for which the case CLASS: was opened, and based on the letter of the Ministry of Interior, Primorsko-Goranska Police Department, I. PP Rijeka No.: dated 29.06.2021. upon which a case was opened for official action CLASS:, The Agency carried out competent action at the address xy, Rijeka, on which a report CLASS: NUMBER: was drawn up on 11 August 2021. Upon inspection of the coverage of the cameras of the video surveillance system in question, it was determined that their recording angle includes, in addition to cadastral parcel 001 and cadastral parcel 002, the public area/road on cadastral parcel no. 003 classified

as "public good roads and waters x" which is contrary to Article 32 of the Act on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation

Further to the above, we would like to point out that since 25 May 2018, Regulation (EU) 2016/679
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive

95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) OJ EU L119 has been directly applicable in all Member States

of the European Union, including the Republic of Croatia.

The Act on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (Official Gazette, No. 42/18) regulates the processing of personal data through video surveillance, and Article 25 stipulates that video surveillance, within the meaning of the provisions of the Act, refers to the collection and further processing of personal data, which includes the creation of a recording that constitutes or is intended to constitute part of a storage system. Unless otherwise provided by another law, the provisions of the Act on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation shall apply to the processing of personal data through video surveillance systems. Article 26 of the said Act stipulates that the processing of personal data through video surveillance may be carried out only for a purpose that is necessary and justified for the protection of persons and property, unless the interests of the data subjects that conflict with the processing of data through video surveillance prevail. Video surveillance may cover premises, parts of premises, the external surface of a building, as well as the interior of public transport, the surveillance of which is necessary to achieve the purpose referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. Article 32. Paragraph 1 of the aforementioned Act stipulates that the monitoring of public areas by means of video surveillance is permitted only to public authorities, legal entities with public authorities and legal entities performing public service, only if prescribed by law, if it is necessary for the performance of the tasks and tasks of the public authority or for the protection of life and health of people and property. 

2Following the above, and based on the collected evidence and the determination of the factual situation in this

administrative matter, it has been established that the owner of the residential building at the address xy, has installed a
video surveillance system consisting of a recorder/storage device and video surveillance cameras that are installed on metal poles on cadastral plot no. 001 and cadastral plot no. 002 and that their recording angle

excessively covers the public area/road no. 003classified as "public good roads and waterworks
of the city of x" which is contrary to Article 32 of the Act on the Implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation.

Based on the above, it was necessary to act as in the operative part of the decision.
