The Spanish DPA referred a case to the Irish DPA regarding Facebook transfers of data to third parties. The Irish DPA rejected the case, since Ireland has not implemented [Article 80(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_80_GDPR#2 "Article 80 GDPR") and the consumer organisation that brought the claim in Spain could therefore not act without an individual mandate.

## English Summary

### Facts

A consumers organisation lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against Facebook, since according to a series of news articles, Facebook had shared their users' personal data with over 150 third organisations without the users' consent.

### Holding

The AEPD referred the complaint to the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) through the Internal Market Information system (IMI), since Facebook Ireland has their main establishment in Ireland, pursuant to the definition set by [Article 4(16) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#16 "Article 4 GDPR"). And, since the DPC is the lead authority with regard to Facebook Ireland, the DPC is in charge of cases regarding Facebook's international transfers of personal data, in accordance to [Article 4(23) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#23 "Article 4 GDPR").

According to the AEPD, there are other concerned DPAs in this case, as defined in [Article 4(22) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#22 "Article 4 GDPR"): Spain, Belgium, Rhineland-Palatinate, Netherlands, Lower Saxony, Italy, Luxembourg, France, Sweden, Thuringia, Hesse, Norway, Berlin, Hungary, Finland, Saarland, Slovenia, North Rhine-Westphalia, Portugal, Slovakia, Greece, Austria and Poland.

The DPC rejected the case, alleging that it came from an organisation without an individual mandate. According to the DPC, Ireland has not implemented [Article 80(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_80_GDPR#2 "Article 80 GDPR") and therefore the authority cannot handle a complaint lodged by an organisation mentioned in such Article (a not-for-profit body, organisation or association which has been properly constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State, has statutory objectives which are in the public interest, and is active in the field of the protection of data subjects' rights and freedoms with regard to the protection of their personal data).

Since the case had been rejected, the AEPD manifested that it was the competent authority to notify the complainant, in accordance with [Article 60(8) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_60_GDPR#8 "Article 60 GDPR"). Therefore, the AEPD archived the proceedings, without prejudice of the consumers organisation lodging a new complaint following the mandate of an individual data subject.

Notwithstanding, according to the DPC, these facts are currently under investigation by the DPA within the competences attributed to it as lead authority.

       "A) in what refers to a person responsible for the treatment with establishments

       in more than one Member State, the place of its central administration in the
       Union, unless decisions about the purposes and means of treatment are

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/6

In the case examined, as stated, FACEBOOK IRELAND LIMITED has
its main or sole establishment in Ireland, so that the supervisory authority of
Ireland is competent to act as the lead supervisory authority.

V: interested control authority

In accordance with the provisions of article 4.22) of the RGPD, it is the Authority of

main supervisory authority and the other interested supervisory authorities, has

VII: Question claimed and legal reasoning.

In this case, it has been submitted to the Spanish Data Protection Agency
claim for an alleged violation of Article 6.1 of the RGPD, related to
a cross-border processing of personal data, carried out by
FACEBOOK IRELAND LIMITED.

The grounds on which the claimant bases the claim are related to the
fact that the social network Facebook could have shared the data of its
users with more than 150 companies without the consent of the users, as
collected in several newspaper articles.

The aforementioned claim was transferred to the DPC as it was competent to act as
main supervisory authority. However, the claim was rejected, as it came from
of an association without an individual mandate.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/6

As explained by the Irish supervisory authority, the national law that completes the GDPR

in Ireland (the “Irish Data Protection Act 2018”) has not implemented its art. 80.2, and, by
Therefore, this authority cannot manage a claim filed by an entity,
non-profit organization or association that has been properly constituted
under the law of a Member State, the statutory objectives of which are to
public interest and act in the field of protection of rights and freedoms

of those interested in the protection of their personal data, with
independence of the mandate of an interested party.

However, the DPC has also reported that these events are being subjected to
of an investigation that they are carrying out within the competences that it has

attributed as main authority.

So, taking into account that Ireland has not implemented the provision
contained in art. 80.2 of the RGPD, but that the reported events are being
object of an investigation by the DPC, the file of this claim proceeds

without prejudice to the fact that FACUA may present another claim as a representative of
an interested party as provided in article 80.1 of the RGPD, providing the mandatory
power of attorney.

Therefore, in accordance with the provisions, by the Director of the Spanish Agency for

Data Protection,

HE REMEMBERS:

FIRST: PROCEED TO THE FILE of the claim presented, dated February 26,

December 2018 and with entry registration number 212801/2018
