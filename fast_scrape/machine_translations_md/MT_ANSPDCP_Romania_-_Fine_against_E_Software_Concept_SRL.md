## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is E Software Concept SRL. The data subjects are its customers.

In May 2022, the Romanian DPA completed an investigation against the controller concerning a data breach.

The controller published several documents on their website, including client invoices and tracking numbers for the parcels sent to their clients. These documents disclosed the personal data of their clients, including names, surnames, delivery addresses, phone numbers, usernames, passwords and email addresses.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller failed to implement the appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a proper level of security and confidentiality for personal data, in breach of [Article 32(1)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1b "Article 32 GDPR") and [Article 32(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#2 "Article 32 GDPR"). The DPA further noted that the controller did not reply to the formal request for information submitted by the Authority.

The DPA fined the controller € 3,000 (RON 14,837.10) for not implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures.

The DPA also fined the controller €1,000 (RON 4,945.54) for not answering the Authority's request, in breach of GDPR [Article 58(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#1a "Article 58 GDPR") and [(e)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#1e "Article 58 GDPR").

## English Machine Translation of the Decision

The decision below is a machine translation of the Romanian original. Please refer to the Romanian original for more details.

07.07.2022 Fine for violation of RGPD

The National Supervisory Authority completed in May of this year an investigation at the operator E Software Concept SRL and found a violation of the provisions of art. 58 para. (1) lit. a) and e) and of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation.

As such, the company E Software Concept SRL was sanctioned for minor offenses as follows:

fine in the amount of 4,945.54 lei, the equivalent of 1000 EURO, as the operator did not provide the information requested by the Supervisory Authority; fine in the amount of 14,837.10 lei, the equivalent of 3000 EURO, as the operator did not implement adequate technical and organizational measures in order to ensure a level of security corresponding to the processing risk.

During the investigation, it was found that, on the operator's website, at certain links, certain documents were publicly available (such as invoices issued by E SOFTWARE CONCEPT SRL to its customers, individuals and legal entities, and AWBs - transport documents that must accompany the sending of parcels, issued by courier service applicants) by which the following personal data were revealed: name, surname, sender and consignee address, telephone number, username and password, e-mail addresses . This situation has led to the loss of confidentiality of personal data of the operator's customers (individuals and legal entities).

Thus, the company E SOFTWARE CONCEPT SRL was sanctioned with a fine for violating the provisions of art. 32 para. (1) lit. b) and para. (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, as it has not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing.

At the same time, the operator was fined for failing to comply with the request for information addressed by the National Supervisory Authority in the exercise of its powers.
