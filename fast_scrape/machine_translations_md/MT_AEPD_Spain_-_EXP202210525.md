## English Summary

### Facts

The controller was a security guard hired by a private company providing video surveillance services to a prison in Madrid. The guard used his mobile phone to capture images of a visitor from the video surveillance system and sent these images via WhatsApp to other colleagues. In September 2022, the prison's security department filed a complaint against the controller for possible GDPR violations.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA highlighted that the physical image of a person is personal data within the meaning of Article 4(1) GDPR. Therefore, their processing is subject to data protection regulations. The DPA concluded that capturing the images of a person from the prison's video surveillance system and disseminating them via WhatsApp violates the provisions of [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"). For this reason, the DPA fined the controller €10,000.

3/8
The images generated by a system of cameras or camcorders are data of
personal nature, so its treatment is subject to the protection regulations

It is, therefore, pertinent to analyze whether the processing of personal data (image of the
natural persons) carried out through the denounced video surveillance system is

II
Law 5/2014, of April 4, on private security, in its article 42.5 establishes what

against the right to honor, to personal or family privacy, to one's own image or to
secrecy of communications when they do not constitute a crime.
Article 6.1 of the GDPR establishes the assumptions that allow the use of
processing of personal data indicating the following:
"1. Processing will only be lawful if at least one of the following is fulfilled
conditions:
a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;

by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said
interests do not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the
interested is a child. The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply.

functions.
Regarding treatment for video surveillance purposes, article 22 of the LOPDGDD
establishes that natural or legal persons, public or private, may carry out
carry out the treatment of images through systems of cameras or video cameras
in order to preserve the safety of people and property, as well as their
facilities."
IV. Instruction No. 4/2022, of July 28, 2022, of the General Secretariat of

personnel obtained by recording images and sounds by the systems of
existing video surveillance in the different penitentiary establishments, explains what

"Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the protection of personal data and
guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LO 3/2018); and Organic Law 7/2021, of
May 26, protection of personal data processed for prevention purposes,
detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offenses and enforcement of
criminal sanctions (hereinafter LO 7/2021), establish different legal regimes
of protection and action that must be regulated”.
In addition, said instruction clarifies that "on the one hand, regarding the treatment of data
obtained through video surveillance that do not affect persons deprived of liberty
and that are not directly related to criminal execution, which will be
provided for in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of

On the other hand, regarding the detailed legal regime for the recordings of the
persons deprived of liberty, which will be in accordance with the provisions of Organic Law 7/2021 and
to the recommendations made by the Ombudsman for the specific
penitentiary area”.
V
It is considered that the facts exposed, that is, capturing the images with a mobile phone
of the Center's video surveillance system, in which a visitor to the Center appeared,
to spread them by WhatsApp to other colleagues, violate what is established in the
article 6 of the RGPD, for which reason it could suppose the commission of a typified infraction
in article 83.5 of the GDPR, which provides the following:
Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,

the highest amount:
a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;
For the purposes of the limitation period for infringements, the infringement indicated in the
previous paragraph is considered very serious in accordance with article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD,
which states that:
"Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:
b) The processing of personal data without the fulfillment of any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
(…)
SAW
In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR, precepts that state:
"Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of administrative fines
under this Article for infringements of this Regulation
indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are effective in each individual case,
proportionate and dissuasive.”
"Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each
individual case, in addition to or in lieu of the measures contemplated in

b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;
c) any measure taken by the controller or processor to mitigate

particular whether the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, if so, in what
extent;
i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been ordered
previously against the person in charge or the person in charge in relation to the
same matter, compliance with said measures;
j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or to mechanisms of
certification approved in accordance with article 42, and
k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case,
such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or
indirectly, through the infringement.”
Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the GDPR, the LOPDGDD, article 76,
"Sanctions and corrective measures", provides:
"2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
may also be taken into account:

In accordance with the precepts transcribed, for the purpose of setting the amount of the sanction of
fine to be imposed in the present case on the entity claimed as responsible for a
offense typified in article 83.5.b) of the GDPR, in an initial assessment,
The following aggravating factors are considered concurrent:
o Seriousness of the facts, since the defendant took advantage of his condition
security guard and access to images to capture and disseminate them
o Intentionality in the action, since such actions are not their own
of their professional work.

It is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed on the defendant and set it at the amount of 10,000
€ in accordance with article 58.2 of the GDPR
VII
The text of the resolution establishes which have been the infractions committed and
the facts that have given rise to the violation of the regulations for the protection of
data, from which it is clearly inferred what are the measures to adopt, without prejudice
that the type of procedures, mechanisms or concrete instruments for

treatment who fully knows its organization and has to decide, based on the
proactive responsibility and risk approach, how to comply with the GDPR and the
LOPDGDD.
