The Romanian DPA issued a fine of approximately €2000 against Kaufland for a violation of [Article 15(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3 "Article 15 GDPR") by failing to grant a data subject's access right to all the video surveillance recordings which included their personal data.

## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject submitted an access request regarding their personal data appearing in video recordings captured through the surveillance systems in Kaufland, one of the biggest retail shops in Romania. In reply to the request, the Kaufland failed to send the full copies with all the available recordings which captured the data subject's personal data. As a result, the data subject filed a complaint with the Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP), which initiated an investigation against the controller.

### Holding

The ANSPDCP's investigation found that Kaufland indeed did not fully answer the data subject access request, since it did not provide a full copy of the records concerning the data subject, although they were available at the time requested. Therefore the ANSPDCP held that the controller had violated [Article 15(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3 "Article 15 GDPR"), and consequently issued a fine approximately €2000 (RON 98889,4).

Additionally, as a corrective measure, the ANSPDCP ordered Kaufland to comply with the data subject's access request by providing the copies of all the available recordings that included their personal data, blurring the personal data belonging to other individuals within these recordings.

## English Machine Translation of the Decision

The decision below is a machine translation of the Romanian original. Please refer to the Romanian original for more details.

25.03.2022 Sanction for violating the RGPD

The National Supervisory Authority completed in February 2022 an investigation at the operator Kaufland Romania SCS and found a violation of the provisions of art. 15 para. (3) of the General Data Protection Regulation on access rights.

As such, the operator was sanctioned with a fine of 98889.4 lei (equivalent to 2000 EURO).

The investigation was initiated following a complaint, and during the investigation, it was found that the operator Kaufland did not provide the petitioner with a copy of all the recordings in the video surveillance system, which is a violation of art. 15 para. (3) of the General Data Protection Regulation

Thus, it was found that the operator did not send, at the request of the data subject, a full copy of the records concerning him from the store, although they were available at the time requested by him.

At the same time, the corrective measure was applied to the operator to communicate to the person concerned all the images requested by him, insofar as they are available, with the blurring of the images that lead to the identification of other persons, according to art. 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
