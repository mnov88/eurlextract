Initial Contributor:

Heiko Hanusch

The Regional Court Essen held that an insurance company can reject an access request as excessive if the request's purpose is not to be aware of or verify the lawfulness of the processing but to verify the validity of increases to insurance premiums.

## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is a private health insurance company. The data subject is a customer of the controller. The parties are in dispute about the validity of several increases to the insurance premiums. The data subject requested refund of overpaid premiums as well as information on all adjustments to the premiums in the form of notification letters sent to the data subject and supplements to the insurance policy to verify the lawfulness of the increases. The controller rejected both claims. Consequently, the data subject filed a lawsuit against the controller with the Regional Court of Essen (Landgericht Essen - LG Essen).

### Holding

The Regional Court of Essen rejected the data subject's claim entirely.

Regarding the notification letters, the court concluded that the data subject has no right to access under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") , because the notification letters are standardised letters sent to every policy holder and, therefore, not personal data under [Article 4(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#1 "Article 4 GDPR"). Moreover the court found that the controller can refuse to act on the request according to [Article 12(5)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#5b "Article 12 GDPR"), because the request is excessive. The court held that the "repetitive character" of a request is just an example under [Article 12(5) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#5 "Article 12 GDPR") and that an access request can also be considered excessive if the request does not serve the purpose of verifying the lawfulness of the processing as stated in Recital 63. The court then established that the data subject's request does not serve this purpose but solely aims at verifying the validity of the premium increases.

## Comment

The decision is in line with many other decisions by German Courts (see [OLG Dresden - 4 U 1905/21](/index.php?title=OLG_Dresden_-_4_U_1905/21 "OLG Dresden - 4 U 1905/21"); [OLG Nürnberg - 8 U 2907/21](/index.php?title=OLG_N%C3%BCrnberg_-_8_U_2907/21 "OLG Nürnberg - 8 U 2907/21"); [LG Krefeld - 2 O 448/20](/index.php?title=LG_Krefeld_-_2_O_448/20 "LG Krefeld - 2 O 448/20")); however, there is also a recent decision by the [OLG Köln - 20 U 295/21](/index.php?title=OLG_K%C3%B6ln_-_20_U_295/21 "OLG Köln - 20 U 295/21") which convincingly demonstrates that the right to access under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") is not and should not be limited by the purpose pursued with the request. As stated by the OLG Köln, and opposed to the LG Essens' view, the notification letters sent to a data subject constitute personal data under [Article 4(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#1 "Article 4 GDPR") because they show the content and conditions of the insurance cover provided to the particular data subject by the controller. The LG Essen missed the fact that, even if the notification letters are standardised, they are still addressed to one specific person and have an effect on this person. The OLG Köln further established that the overall purpose of the GDPR is to protect all rights and freedoms of the individual against harm and risks arising from the processing of personal data, and not only the rights and freedoms enshrined in data protection law. Therefore, the court concluded that a data subject pursues a recognizable, legitimate interest when using [Article 15(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") to reduce an asymmetric level of information between himself and the controller in order to protect his or her rights. Moreover, the OLG Köln found that there is no way to verify that a data subject is indeed only interested in the copy of his data to check the validity of the premium increases and is not also concerned about the protection of his or her data.

 Tenor:
                              The charges get dismissed.

Due to the further details of the factual and disputed situation, the mutual 29th
Documents and attachments submitted to the file and the reasons for the decision are referred to.

Reasons for decision: 30

The lawsuit is partially inadmissible and otherwise unfounded. 31

As far as the PVN maintenance obligation insurance tariff maintained by the defendant is concerned, 32
the Essen Regional Court would not have jurisdiction according to § 51 Para. 2 SGG and the lawsuit would already be over
not permitted for this reason. With the request for information, the plaintiff requests information “about all
Contribution adjustments (...) to the insurance number (...)". With brief dated February 19, 2022
However, the plaintiff has made it clear that the asserted claims for information are not

accordingly restrictive.

I 33

The declaratory application for 2) 34, which has not yet been specified for specific contribution adjustments

and the unnumbered benefit applications for 3) and 4) are inadmissible, since there is already one
specific claim within the meaning of Section 253 (2) No. 2 ZPO is missing.

These applications are also not admissible by way of a step action according to § 254 ZPO. A 35

Enforcement of the claim serves (Zöller/Greger, ZPO 33rd ed., § 254 para. 2). On the other hand, it is inadmissible if the information is not provided for the purpose of determining the

provide unrelated information about his legal prosecution
should (cf. BGH, judgment of April 18, 2002 - VII ZR 260/01; OLG Hamm, decision of

1st 43rd

A claim does not result from Art. 15 Para. 1 GDPR. With the standardized 44, letter of justification, which is uniformly sent to all policyholders in an identical
form are sent, it is already not personal data in the sense
the GDPR.

The defendant also has a right of refusal under Art. 12 (5) sentence 2 lit. b) GDPR, 45

since the application is based on the objection of abuse of rights arising from Section 242
opposes. The provision only lists the frequent repetition as an example for
an "excessive" request. However, the use of the word "in particular" makes
clear that the provision also intends to cover other abusive applications (cf.

Heckmann/Paschke, in Ehlmann/Selmayr, General Data Protection Regulation 2nd edition, Art. 12
paragraph 43). With the application, the plaintiff also asserts a formal legal status in which
he has no self-interest worthy of protection.

When interpreting what is abusive in this sense, the protective purpose of the 46th

There is also a claim from §§ 241 Paragraph 2, 242 BGB in conjunction with the between the 49th

Something else could only apply to the information regarding the triggering factors. 50

In this respect, however, the plaintiff's argument is not sufficiently substantiated, since the plaintiff has not specifically explained when the triggering factors are affected

A claim from § 810 BGB is also not given, since the provision does not have a 52nd

Likewise, there would be no claim from §§ 666, 675 Para. 1 BGB, since the 55th
insurance contract does not constitute an agency agreement.

Further bases for claims are not apparent. 56
