## English Summary

### Facts

First, a data subject filed a complaint in which indicated that they have exercised their right to object to the use of their personal data for direct marketing purposes but the defendant continued to send SMS to their mobile number. The complainant provided proof of having received more than 60 SMS within 30 days which suggests that the defendant did not fulfil the complainant’s request.

Second, the same complainant indicated that they reported to the defendant that they were receiving a large number of SMS to their mobile number with confidential information about third parties. The defendant told the complainant that it had noted the incident and that it would not reoccur. However, the defendant continued to send information related to third parties to the complainant, in particular, a security code to access the platform "Mi Yoigo", to which the complainant accessed and was able to view personal data from a third party. The access given allowed the complainant to view someone else’s bills, phone number, address, bank account, account number and the possibility to make any changes in the third party’s profile. The complainant also provided proof to this effect.

## Dispute

Were the actions of the defendant a violation of the principles relating to processing of personal data contained in article 5(f) and 32 the GDPR?

### Holding

The AEPD held that this offense is considered as ‘grave’ in accordance with Article 72(1)(k) LOPDGDD and falls under the criteria defined in article 83(5)(a) GDPR where a company can be fined up to €20000000, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 % of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.

The AEPD imposed a fine of €150000 for infringing the following provisions:

\-Article 17 GDPR – Right to Erasure - €50000 fine

\-Article 32 GDPR – Failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk – €30000 fine

\-Article 5(1)(f) GDPR - For breaching of the principle of integrity and confidentiality in the processing of personal data of customers - €50000 fine

\- Article 21 of the LSSI (Spanish Law on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce) regarding the sending of commercial SMS or advertising without the express consent of the recipient - €20000 fine

The AEPD, indicated that the fine may be reduced to €90000 for voluntary payment and admission of responsibility.

## Comment

**When imposing the fine, the AEPD considered:**

\- The duration of the violation, taking into account the scope or purpose of the data processing operation, as well as the damages caused to the interested party and third parties – Article 83(2)(a) GDPR

\- Negligence in the infringement, when verifying the lack of due diligence of the claimed entity in the fulfilment of its obligations with respect to the management of users' personal data - Article 83(2)(b) GDPR

\- The way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement, since this occurred through several complaints filed by the complainant, Article 83(2)(h) GDPR

\- The existence of a prior complaint.

**Aggravating factors in accordance with Article 72(2)(a) & (b) LOPDGDD and Article 83(2)(k) GDPR:**

\- The continuing nature of the infringement even though the defendant informed that it had been corrected

\- The nature of the defendant’s activities with respect to the processing of personal data.

                                             II

From file No.: E / 06604/2020, followed by this Agency as a result of the
first complaint filed by the claimant against the claimed entity, it must be
keep in mind the following points:

On 07/17/20, the claimant filed a complaint with this Agency,
indicating in it that: “he was receiving advertising messages on his phone

mobile, from the company denounced, which he had not authorized ”.

Dated 09/14/20, in response to the request made from this Agency

on the occasion of the denounced events, the company indicated that: “we confirm that
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/19

We have managed the claimant's right of opposition in relation to all the
databases for which we are responsible for the treatment dated 13 of

August 2020 (…) ”.

On 09/25/20, the claimed entity, in response to the request for
additional information made from this Agency, reported that: “In relation to the
extension made by the claimant, as can be seen in the messages

provided by this, point to a "url" with domain hazmeclic.es, which is not
ownership of my client, as accredited through red.es., not being the
database of this company under the responsibility of Xfera Móviles ”.

Vector Software Factory, S.L. is a MASMOVIL distributor, with whom you have a
Agency contract, which carries out commercial campaigns on its own initiative and

on its own database, which, as we have indicated, is not under
responsibility, nor have we provided from MASMOVIL. However, the foregoing,

We will proceed to contact this agent in order to transfer the opposition
of Mr. A.A.A. in order to meet the right of the interested party.

By mail dated September 24, 2020, at 3:25 p.m., we have proceeded to
inform the interested party of the following: “We write to your email, to which
we have had access within the framework of the procedure followed by the Spanish Agency

of Data Protection E / 06604/2020. in order to inform you of how we have
proceeded in the attention of your right of opposition. We hereby inform you
that we proceeded to manage your right of opposition regarding the numbering

XXX XXX XXX, by Xfera Móviles, S.L. (More Mobile) dated August 13
2020. In relation to the communications that the Spanish Protection Agency indicates to us
of Data has received after that date, we inform you that we have

verified that they have been sent by an agent of the brand
MASMOVIL, who carries out commercial actions on its own databases. In
In this sense, we inform you that we will transmit your request to exercise your

rights of opposition to this agent, after which we hope you will stop receiving our
advertising.

Well, dated 10/01/20, once the reasons given by the
claimed entity, and consider that the person responsible had attended the claim

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/19

presented, this Agency agreed not to admit the claim for processing
submitted, notifying the interested parties.

However, dated 10/16/20, a second entry has been entered into this Agency

complaint filed by the claimant indicating that the operator was still
sending SMS to his telephone line, and attached the screenshots of more than 60 SMS
received until that day, for which he considered that the operator had not attended

satisfactorily the first claim, and that the AEPD had rejected the processing of the
consider otherwise.

A few days later, on 10/31/20, the claimant resubmits a written statement of
complaint to this Agency, indicating that he had contacted the
claimed entity, on 09/24/20, to inform them that, although he had exercised before them

the right to object continued to receive a huge amount of advertising SMS,
receiving as a response from the entity that had responded to his request for opposition

dated 08/13/20 and that it would not happen again, but the claimant again justifies
that you continue to receive SMS from the company after that date, providing a copy
of all of them. On 11/10/20, he once again submits a new letter to this

Agency providing advertising SMS of the claimed entity, up to 16 SMS, from the
10/18/20 to 11/09/20.

Apart from all the above, the claimant also reports that he has received an SMS from
the company, to your phone number with a security code to access the
platform, (“Mi Yoigo”), in which, once accessed, you have been able to verify that the

profile belongs to another user, but has access to the personal data of this
person, to their invoices, and even has the possibility and to carry out any procedure

with the data of this person.

     III- On the breach of the right to delete personal data.

This section examines the presumed non-compliance, on the part of the
claimed entity, of the deletion of all personal data from its databases

data, which was requested by the claimant.

Article 17.1.c) of the RGPD, establishes the right to delete data

personal data of the interested party, ("the right to be forgotten"), that:
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/19

"The interested party shall have the right to obtain without undue delay from the person responsible for the

treatment the deletion of personal data that concerns you, which will be
obliged to delete without undue delay the personal data when there is any

of the following circumstances: (…)

c) the interested party opposes the treatment in accordance with article 21, paragraph 1, and does not

other legitimate reasons for the treatment prevail, or the interested party opposes the
treatment in accordance with article 21, paragraph 2; ”.

From the existing documentation in the file followed in this Agency, by the
same facts denounced (E / 06604/2020), of the documentation presented by the
claimant in the present sanctioning procedure (PS / 00448/2020) and of the

Answers made by the claimed entity, to the requirements made
by this Agency, set forth in point II, it is verified that the facts known

could be constitutive of an infringement, attributable to the defendant, for violation of the
Article 17.1.c) of the RGPD, for breach of the right to delete data
personal data of the interested party, when he had exercised the right of opposition before the

entity and he had even confirmed that he had correctly managed said
right.

Article 72.1.k) of the LOPDGDD, considers very serious, for the purposes of prescription,
“The impediment or the obstruction or the repeated lack of attention to the exercise of the
rights established in articles 15 to 22 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. ”.

contracting with the client. In any case, the provider must offer the recipient the

possibility of opposing the processing of your data for promotional purposes through
a simple and free procedure, both at the time of data collection
