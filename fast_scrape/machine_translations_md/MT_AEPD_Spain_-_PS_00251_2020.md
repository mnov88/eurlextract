## English Summary

### Facts

Conseguridad SL (a private security company) set up a video surveillance system recording any individual that enters and work in their premises. However, the company does not have a data protection officer, meaning that no GPDR rights can be exercised in that respect.

Conseguridad SL did not respond when notified by the Spanish DPA.

### Dispute

Does the lack of a data protection officer in a company result in a breach of Article 37 GDPR?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) found that Conseguridad SL had violated Article 37(1)(b) GDPR by not having designated a data protection officer (DPO). The absence of a DPO also resulted in a breach of Article 34(1)(ñ) and 34(3) of the national law, "LOPPDGDD". The DPA specified that a DPO is necessary where a private security company processes personal data on a large scale, such as Conseguridad SL.

On the question of video surveillance, the Spanish DPA mentioned that the installation of video cameras are not necessarily illegal, so long as they have an information notice attached (Article 22(4) LOPDGDD).

Conseguridad SL was fined €50000 for not having a DPO.

       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

                                           II

## Article 37 of the RGPD establishes the following:

  "1. The person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will designate a delegate of
data protection provided that:

    b) the main activities of the controller or processor consist of
treatment operations that, due to their nature, scope and / or purposes,
require regular and systematic stakeholder observation on a large scale, "

       In this sense, the LOPDGDD determines in its article 34.1) and 3):

"1. Those responsible and in charge of the treatment must designate a delegate of
data protection in the cases provided for in article 37.1 of the Regulation

are obligated to their appointment as in the case in which it is voluntary. "

                                           III

       According to the available evidence, it is considered that the
denounced fact of the lack of designation of DPD by a security company
private, when the claimed processing of personal data on a large scale, and

Being a private security company we are faced with the violation of the
article 37.1b) of the RGPD in relation to article 34.1 ñ) of the LOPDGDD.

       On the other hand, it should be noted that the installation of video surveillance cameras can
be carried out in order to guarantee the safety of goods and people, being

legitimized for them, if there is an informational poster, as provided for in article 22
section 4 LOPDGDD.

                                           IV

       Article 83.7 of the RGPD establishes that: “Without prejudice to the corrective powers of

supervisory authorities pursuant to Article 58 (2), each Member State may
establish rules on whether and to what extent administrative fines can be imposed on
authorities and public bodies established in said Member State "

       Article 58.2 of the RGPD provides the following: “Each control authority

       b) sanction any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with
warning when the processing operations have violated the provisions of
these Regulations;

       d) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment are in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified time;

       i) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition or in

place of the measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances
of each particular case.
                                           V

## Article 73 of the LOPDDG indicates: "Violations considered serious

  "Based on what is established in article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the following: "

  v) Failure to comply with the obligation to appoint a data protection officer
when their appointment is required in accordance with article 37 of Regulation (EU)
2016/679 and article 34 of this organic law. "

    25 to 39, 42 and 43 "

       Likewise, it is considered that the sanction to be imposed should be adjusted according to
with the following criteria established in article 83.2 of the RGPD:

       As aggravating factors the following:
