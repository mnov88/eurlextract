## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject, a landlord, had a bank account with the controller, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. A tenant made a rent payment to the data subject's account and asked the controller for a receipt. In response, the controller provided the tenant with a document containing the data subject's account balance.

The data subject subsequently filed a complaint with the DPA.

### Holding

The case was categorized as a personal data security breach. The DPA held that the controller violated the integrity and confidentiality of personal data when it shared with a third party a document containing the data subject’s account balance. The DPA imposed a sanction of €50,000 for the infringement of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR").

The DPA also held that when the breach occurred, technical and organizational measures were not in place to prevent the data subject’s account balance from being seen by whoever requested proof of payment. A sanction of €30,000 euros was imposed for the infringement of [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

The total fine was reduced from €80,000 to €48,000 because the controller acknowledged responsibility for the breach and agreed to pay before final resolution of the sanctioning procedure.

                Classification of the infringement of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD

If confirmed, the aforementioned infringement of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD could lead to the
commission of the offenses typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD that under the

paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,

the largest amount:

       consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9; (…)”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 "Infringements" establishes that
“The acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4,
5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result

agreement to initiate sanctioning proceedings, and without prejudice to what results from the

investigation, the infringement in question is considered to be serious for the purposes of
RGPD and that it is appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the following
criteria established by article 83.2 of the RGPD:

As aggravating factors:

       -The degree of responsibility of the person in charge or of the person in charge of the treatment,
       taking into account the technical or organizational measures that they have applied in
       under articles 25 and 32. Art. 83.2.d).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

           with which it has, entails the handling of a large number of data
           personal. This implies that they have sufficient experience and should have

           with the adequate knowledge for the treatment of said data.
