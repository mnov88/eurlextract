## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject had been a member of the Budapest Bar Association (the controller) until 2011 when their membership was terminated after their failure to pay their membership fees in time. On 1 October 2020, the data subject requested information about their account balance and the decision on the termination of their membership. After they did not receive the information asked for, they sent another request to the controller on 12 December 2020, referring to [Article 15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1 "Article 15 GDPR"), and asking for information relating to their account balance, the amount of their debt, the legal basis of the registered debt and the existence of the suspension and termination decisions. On 4 February 2021, the data subject complained to the DPA that the controller did not provide them with access to this information which constituted their personal data.

In its submission to the DPA, the controller claimed that the data subject’s communication from 1 October 2020 did not qualify as an access request within the meaning of the GDPR. Additionally, the request from 12 December 2020 was only received by the controller on 23 December 2020. Since the offices of the controller were closed between 19 December 2020 and 3 January 2021, the controller claimed that the time limit for complying with the access request only started running on 4 January 2021. The controller claimed that due to the complexity of the request, it was entitled to extending the deadline by additional two months as provided for in [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR"). Hence, the controller considered itself to have properly provided access to the data subject within the time limit when it replied to the data subject’s request on 2 April 2021.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller violated [Article 15(1)](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and [(3)](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR").

The DPA considered the communication sent by the data subject on 1 October 2020 to be too general to qualify as an access request. On the other hand, it regarded the communication sent on 12 December 2020 and received on 23 December 2020, which explicitly referred to the data subject‘s rights under the GDPR, as a proper access request from the data subject. The DPA further held that because the time limit set in [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") is calculated in calendar days and not in working days, the time limit for complying with the request started running on 24 December 2020 and not on 4 January 2021. Contrary to the controller’s assertions, the calculation of the time limit is not affected by the leave arrangements of the controller, as it is obliged to organise its work in such a way that it complies with the provisions of the GDPR. Consequently, the deadline for complying with the data subject's access request had already passed when the controller replied on 2 April 2021.

In addition, although the controller claimed that the complexity of the request entitled it to extending the deadline for replying by further two months, the data subject was not informed of any such extension and the reasons for it as required under [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR"). The controller was also unable to supply evidence of any internal decision made to actually extend the deadline. Lastly, whilst the controller could have possibly refused to comply with the access request for being too excessive under [Article 12(5) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#5 "Article 12 GDPR"), it did not invoke this ground in its letter to the data subject sent on 2 April 2021.

Consequently, the DPA held that the controller violated [Article 15(1)](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and [(3)](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") by not replying to the access request within the time limit and for not complying with the requirements relating to the extension of the deadline.

## Comment

The complaint was only partly upheld because the DPA refused to order the controller to comply with the access request. Instead, it only issued a warning.

III.1. Application of the Applicant concerned

In its letter of 1 October 2020, the Applicant did not clearly indicate the subject of his application, thus
nor does it intend to exercise the data subject's right. The Applicant on 1 October 2020 during the proceedings
indicated the subject of his letter as a general request for information concerning his debt.

However, the subject of his letter of 12 December 2020 has already been "the exercise of the right of access,

Before the expiration of the original one month, the Applicant has not fulfilled the right of access of the Applicant
nor did it indicate to the Applicant the need for an extension of the deadline. This is the procedure
during which the Applicant also acknowledged.

According to the Applicant's statement, since the Office and headquarters of the Applicant Service Provider are 19 December 2020 and
2021.01. It was kept closed between 03. During this period, my administration work was open, open for administration

The time limit specified in Section 12 of the General Data Protection Decree is a calendar day and not a working day
therefore the deadline for the submission of the application is 24 December 2020.
and not January 4, 2021.

In this context, the Authority notes that the chamber regulations cited below are also calendar days
the time limit for replying to the requests of the persons concerned shall be calculated:

    - According to Article 131 of the Articles of Association published on the Applicant's website, “The Chamber is managed by it

The calculation of the time limit has no effect on the Applicant's leave scheme because of the performance of duties

continuity must also be ensured by the Applicant. Nor is it possible to derogate from that obligation
Neither the Hungarian Bar Association nor the Applicant's internal rules contain any reference. THE
Nor do the austerity measures referred to by the applicant, which entered into force on 8 March 2021, qualify
because the exercise of the rights of the data subject is not a service requiring a personal appearance.

The Applicant is also obliged to organize the work in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR

III.3. Obliging the applicant to comply with the request for access

The part of the Authority's request for an obligation to comply with a request for access
because on 2 April 2021 the Applicant sent a final disciplinary decision and
the cancellation decision to the Applicant or during the proceedings before the Authority takes a decision

has already taken steps to provide the information to the Applicant. The Applicant informed the
Applicant's debt registered with the Applicant, the storage of the Applicant's personal data

assessed that the obligation to comply with his request for access had become obsolete.

III.4. Clarification of facts and legal professional privilege

The Authority shall provide the applicant with declarations regarding its procedural and access rights
makes the following remarks in this context:

The Authority has issued NAIH-2160-5 / 2021. In its order No

and Üttv. Refused to the Applicant on the grounds of his obligation of confidentiality provided for in § 11
as annexes to the response to the data subject's request to the Authority
sending

However, in the Authority's view, the individual decisions concerning the Applicant do not qualify
a lawyer's secret. Because during the disciplinary proceedings against the Applicant, the Applicant did not
performed the activity of a lawyer, but also performed the duties of a public body, therefore the obligation of confidentiality is regulated by the Üttv.
It cannot be based on the provisions of § 9.

Furthermore, in the Authority's view, the Applicant's claim that it was not possible to attach the
It made individual decisions in relation to the applicant, citing its obligation of confidentiality
is unfounded because Infotv. Pursuant to Section 71 (1), the Authority shall, in the course of its proceedings,

information which is covered by the obligation of professional secrecy and is covered by the obligation of professional secrecy

required. Infotv. However, pursuant to Section 71 (2a), the Üttv. Section 13 (3)

This is supported by the Üttv. certain laws and other judicial matters related to the entry into force of

In view of the above, the Applicant's request for confidentiality in the proceedings initiated at the request of the Applicant

could not have denied the individual decision taken in relation to the Applicant
in particular because they do not constitute a document for the purpose of defense.

The Authority, as it does not share the arguments of the Requested lawyer regarding the obligation of professional secrecy, and
interpretation of the law that the decision of the Applicant in a disciplinary case should be a lawyer's secret
nor did it consider it necessary for the applicant to be exempted from the
ask to keep it a secret.

The Authority shall take the necessary steps to obtain a document which has not been sent and to penalize failure to comply with the request.

does not comply with paragraph 1, there is no need to submit an application in this respect, the application

III.6. Legal consequences

The Authority grants the Applicant's request in part and pursuant to Article 58 (2) (b) GDPR

administrative deadline and that the procedure has been lengthy.

On this basis, the Authority waived the fine.
