## English Summary

### Facts

The Organization of Urban Transport of Thessaloniki (OASTH) was one of the largest transport company in Greece. A few months before OASTH entered in insolvency proceedings, employees of the city of Thessaloniki organized strikes during several days. Those strikes were organized, inter alia, to protest against the fact that dividends had been paid to shareholders, while some due salaries had not been paid to employees. This strike was a central political issue not only for Thessaloniki but also for the entire country. Two years after having been acquired by the Greek State, OASTH remained at the center of many political debates. Aware of this, the President of OASTH decided to implement a policy of transparency towards the public.

In 2021, several former shareholders of OASTH started contesting the return/value of the shares of OASTH. In the context of this dispute, some of the former shareholders entered into settlement negotiations with OASTH, while others got involved is a public feud with the company.

During a press conference, the identity of several former shareholders involved in the dispute was disclosed by the President of OASTH. On the same day, the names of twenty-nine former shareholders were also published in a press release written by OASTH, together with the percentage of their participation in the capital of OASTH, the date of acquisition of the shares, and the acquisition price in euros. Those information were further picked up by journalists and shared in the press and on social media.

Following the publication of these information, nine shareholders decided to exercise their right to access to their personal data, and their right to object to the processing of personal data, in accordance with Article 12 and Article 13 of the Law 2472/1997. OASTH however did not follow up on these requests, before arguing that the shareholders had not paid the administrative fee which was due to submit such requests.

In this context, twelve of the former shareholders (the Complainants) decided to lodge a complaint against OASTH with the Greek DPA, claiming that OASTH had unlawfully processed their personal data and/or had failed to answer their requests, thereby infringing the Law 2472/1997 on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data, as well as the GDPR.

### Holding

First, the Greek DPA considered that lawfulness of the processing of the personal data of the Complainants through the publication of the names of the twenty-nine former shareholders in the press release. Considering that the dispute relating to the management and future of OASTH was a matter of public interest, the Greek DPA found that the publication of the names of the former shareholders who had contested the return/value of the shares was legitimate, and outweighed the rights and interests of the shareholders in remaining anonymous. In order to balance the legitimate interest of OASTH to inform the public against the rights of the shareholders, the Greek DPA also took into account the fact that some of these former shareholders were already involved in a public feud with OASTH, while others had sent the latter an out-of-court settlement which had been made public.

The Greek DPA however found that the publication of the names of two of the Complainants was not justified for informing the public, as they were not among those who had raised claims with respect to the return/value of the shares. Hence, OASTH had no legitimate interest in disclosing their identity to the public. For this reason, the Greek DPA imposed on OASTH a fine of 3,000 EUR for the publication of these two names.

Finally, with regard to the nine Complainants who had exercised their right to access and to object to the processing of personal data, the Greek DPA found that OASTH had violated the applicable law by not properly answering these requests. The Greek DPA therefore imposed on OASTH a fine of 7,000 euros for violation of Articles 12 and 13 of Law 2472/1997.

In total, the Greek DPA therefore imposed a fine of 10,000 EUR on OASTH for violation of articles 4, 5, 12 and 13 of law 2472/1997. In parallel, the Greek DPA also issued a warning with respect to the lack of compliance of OASTH with the GDPR, and in particular the obligation of the controller to duly consider and answer data subjects' requests.
