## English Summary

### Facts

Three complainants lodged a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) alleging that Vodafone was sending messages to them (0€-invoices) after they had previously asked for the erasure of their data, once their contract was terminated.

### Holding

The AEPD held that Vodafone had violated Article 6(1) GDPR for processing personal data without consent or any other different legal basis. When imposing the fine, the AEPD took into account:

*   The type of data affected: basic identifiers such as names, surnames, phone number.
*   The relation between the processing and the business activities of the respondent.
*   The previous fines on the same grounds.
*   The lack of diligence regarding the erasure request.

The AEPD finally fined Vodafone €150,000, that was reduced to €90,000 due to the assumption of responsibility and the early payment.

        FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

        I

        By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,

the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

        II

        The claimed facts are specified in the treatment of the data of the
claimants by the claimed without standing to do so, by sending
SMS to the claimants' mobile phones informing them of the generation of

invoices in your name, when you had already terminated your contractual relationship and the
The complainant had stated: "that their data has been definitively eliminated."

        Said treatment could be constitutive of an infringement of article 6, Lawfulness
of the treatment, of the RGPD that establishes that:

        "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

        a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data

personal for one or more specific purposes;

        b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures

pre-contractual;

        (…) "

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/13

        In article 4 of the RGPD, Definitions, in its section 11, it states that:

        "11)" consent of the interested party ": any manifestation of free will,
specific, informed and unequivocal by which the interested party accepts, either through

a statement or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that
they concern him ”.

        Also article 6, Treatment based on the consent of the affected party,
of the new Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection

Personal and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), states
what:

        "1. In accordance with the provisions of article 4.11 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679, the consent of the affected party is understood to be any manifestation of will
free, specific, informed and unequivocal for which it accepts, either through a

declaration or a clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data that
concern.

        2. When the data processing is intended to be based on consent
of the affected party for a plurality of purposes, it will be necessary to record in a

specific and unequivocal that said consent is granted for all of them.

        3. The execution of the contract may not be subject to the consent of the affected party

processing of personal data for purposes that are not related to the
maintenance, development or control of the contractual relationship ”.

        Article 83.5 a) of the RGPD, considers that the infringement of "the principles
basic to the treatment, including the conditions for consent in accordance with
of articles 5, 6, 7 and 9 ”is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the

mentioned Article 83 of the aforementioned Regulation, “with administrative fines of
€ 20,000,000 maximum or, in the case of a company, of an equivalent amount

at a maximum of 4% of the total global annual turnover for the financial year
above, opting for the one with the highest amount ”.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/13

        On the other hand, the LOPDGDD for the purposes of prescription states in its article 72:
"Violations considered very serious:

        1. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that

suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in
in particular, the following:

        (…)

        b) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the

conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.

        (…) "

        III

        The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the

claimed violated article 6 of the RGPD, since it processed the
personal data of the claimants without having any legitimacy to do so,
materialized in that they continue to receive SMS sent to the mobile regarding the

billing, even though you have requested in the past the deletion of your data and the
claimed that they would no longer receive similar notices.

    It is important to highlight that this Agency transferred the
claims made by the claimants to the claimed, giving rise to the

files E / 11384/2019, E / 00232/2020 and E / 06666/2020.

    Well, on June 2, 2020, the claimed status of

solution of the errors detected after the claims of claimants 1 and 2.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/13

    Thus it is established that on June 10, 2020, the complainant states that the data of the
Claimants 1 and 2 had been canceled so they gave the incidents as

resolved.

    Taking the above into account, on July 22, 2020 a new
claim for the same facts about which the defendant stated, in the

answer to the transfer of the claim, that the issuance of invoices was due to another
error in their systems.

   Consequently, it has carried out a processing of personal data without
has proven that it has the legal authorization to do so.

        IV

        In order to establish the administrative fine to be imposed, they must
observe the provisions contained in articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD, which
they point out:

        "1. Each supervisory authority will guarantee that the imposition of fines

        2. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances

        b) intentionality or negligence in the infringement;

        c) any measure taken by the person in charge or in charge of the treatment

        d) the degree of responsibility of the person in charge of the
treatment, taking into account the technical or organizational measures that have

applied by virtue of articles 25 and 32;

        e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or the person in charge of the

treatment;

        f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to establish
remedy the violation and mitigate the possible adverse effects of the violation;

        g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;

        h) the way in which the supervisory authority learned of the infringement, in
in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, if so, in what

measure;

        i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
previously ordered against the person in charge or the person in charge of

regarding the same matter, compliance with said measures;

        j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or to mechanisms
certification approved in accordance with Article 42, and

        k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct or

indirectly, through the infringement.

        In relation to letter k) of article 83.2 of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, in its

Article 76, “Sanctions and corrective measures”, establishes that:

        "two. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU)

2016/679 may also be taken into account:

        a) The continuing nature of the offense.

        b) The linking of the activity of the offender with the performance of treatments
of personal data.

        c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the offense.

        d) The possibility that the affected person's conduct could have led to the
commission of the offense.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/13

        e) The existence of a merger process by absorption after the commission
of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.

        f) Affecting the rights of minors.

        g) Have, when not mandatory, a delegate for the protection of

data.

        h) The submission by the person in charge or in charge, with character
voluntary, to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, in those

assumptions in which there are controversies between those and any interested party. "

      In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, for the purpose of setting the amount of the fine
impose in the present case on the entity claimed by the offense typified in the
Article 83.5.a) of the RGPD for which the complainant is held responsible, in a
initial assessment, the following factors are considered concurrent:

         In the present case we are facing a serious negligent action (article 83.2
  b).

        Basic personal identifiers are affected (name, surname,

        mobile phone number) (article 83.2 g).

        The evident link between the business activity of the complained party and the
        processing of personal data of clients or third parties (art. 83.2 k in
        relationship with art. 76. 2 b) of the LOPDGDD.

         Any previously committed offense (article 83.2 e).
        The serious lack of diligence demonstrated then, after having communicated to

        the claimants who attended the right to object to the treatment of their
