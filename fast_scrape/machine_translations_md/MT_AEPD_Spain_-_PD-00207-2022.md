## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject requested the access and the erasure of their personal data from the list of insolvent persons. The data was initially handled by the data controller, but there was a posterior change of control. Even though the data subject affirmed that their requests were not properly addressed by the initial controller, the company stated that all the answers were timely provided, including the change of control over the data.

### Holding

The DPA dismissed the complaint of the data subject. Since the controller did provide timely and relevant information to the data controller and they have an outstanding debt with the controller, the complaint should not be upheld.

## Comment

The Spanish DPA highlighted that, whenever possible, alternative mechanisms should be enforced over administrative sanctioning.

Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of section 2 of article 56 in
in relation to section 1 f) of article 57, both of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 regarding the protection of
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free

circulation of this data (hereinafter referred to as GDPR); and in article 47 of the LOPDGDD.

are assigned to it in its article 57, among them, to enforce the Regulation and

about their obligations, as well as dealing with claims

in the event of exercise of the rights regulated in articles 15 to 22 of the
GDPR.

Said agreement of admission to processing determines the opening of this procedure
of lack of attention to a request to exercise the rights established in the
articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD, regulated in article 64.1 of the LOPDGDD, according to the
which:

"1. When the procedure refers exclusively to the lack of attention of a

In this case, the period to resolve the procedure will be six months from
from the date on which the claimant was notified of the admission agreement to

Procedure. After this period, the interested party may consider his
claim".

It is not considered appropriate to clarify administrative responsibilities within the framework
of a sanctioning procedure, the exceptional nature of which implies that it is opted,
whenever possible, due to the prevalence of alternative mechanisms that have

protection in current regulations.

It is the exclusive responsibility of this Agency to assess whether there are responsibilities
administrative actions that must be purged in a sanctioning procedure and, in
consequently, the decision on its opening, there being no obligation to initiate a

procedure for any request made by a third party. Such a decision must
be based on the existence of elements that justify said start of the activity

On the other hand, the request will be considered excessive when the affected party chooses a means
different from the one offered that entails a disproportionate cost, which must be

3. Sections 1 and 2 will not apply when treatment is necessary:
