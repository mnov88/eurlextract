## English Summary

### Facts

Following a complaint filed by a data subject, the Romanian DPA started an investigation against CDI Transport, a passenger transport company (controller). The data subject complained that the controller's website did not include all the necessary information in its privacy policy required by the GDPR.

During the investigation, the company did not answer the DPA's request within the legal term.

### Holding

The DPA found that the controller did not clearly inform the data subjects visiting its website about the personal data it processed, as the information required by [Article 12-22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") was not published on the website. This included information about the purpose of processing personal data, the legal basis, the controller's contact details, the retention period and the possibility for data subjects to exercise their rights.

As a result, the DPA held that the controller violated [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR"). The DPA issued a warning against the controller and ordered it to ensure that the infromation required by [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") would be communicated in a concise, transparent and easily accessible manner.

In addition, the DPA fined the controller €7,000 for its lack of collaboration during the investigation. The controller neglegted to answer the DPA's request for information within the legal term, in violation of [Article 58(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#1a "Article 58 GDPR") and [(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#1e "Article 58 GDPR").
