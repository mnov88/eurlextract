## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that the defendant had openly published his/her personal data in the entrance of the garage of the community; the claimant also attached some pictures of notice board.

### Dispute

The defendant answered to the AEPD investigation declaring that (1) the publication of such information was only addressed and available to the members of the community (and not to the general public), and that (2) it was strictly related to the interests of the community, as it referred to a court sentence on upcoming building works over common areas of the community that the claimant was not respecting. The defendant also added that, (1) as soon as it knew about the existence of this claim, the publication was immediately withdrawn, (2) a letter of apology was sent to the claimant, (3) internal safety protocols were reviewed and (4) instructions on the need to anonymously publish this kind of information has been included at the notice board. The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

The AEPD understood that the publication of the personal data of the claimant could breach the confidentiality principle, so, after considering some circumstances (the information was not only available to the members of the community, but also potentially to friends, family and third parties related to them that are no owners strictly), it imposed a warning to the defendant.
