12.05.2022 Sanction for violating the RGPD

The National Supervisory Authority completed in April 2022 an investigation at the operator LORIS FUEL SHOP SRL and found the violation of the provisions of art.29 and art.32 par. (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation (RGPD).

The operator LORIS FUEL SHOP SRL was sanctioned with a fine in the amount of 4,941.3 lei, the equivalent of 1,000 EURO.

The investigation was initiated following a complaint in which the petitioner claimed the publication on Facebook of some images in which he was caught and which came from the monitor belonging to a video surveillance system installed in a gas station in Harghita County.

During the investigation, it was found that the operator LORIS FUEL SHOP SRL, as a proxy, did not adopt sufficient appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the confidentiality of personal data processed on images recorded through the television system installed in the stations used, in especially in terms of training data controllers under its authority (employees). This led to the viewing and filming by unauthorized third parties of the images of the video cameras from the working point in Harghita County, later being revealed on a social network, thus violating the provisions of art. 29 and 32 para. (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

At the same time, during the investigation of the operator LORIS FUEL SHOP SRL, a corrective measure was applied to ensure compliance with RGPD of personal data processing operations, by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures, especially in terms of training data processors under the authority (employees or collaborators), by regularly organizing training sessions with them, in connection with their obligations regarding the processing of personal data through the video system installed in stations, the verification of access to recordings of images stored on DVR, rapid detection, management and reporting of personal data breaches.
