                                             I

       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

                                            II

       The defendant is charged with committing an offense for violation of the
## Article 6 of the RGPD, "Legality of the treatment", which indicates in its section 1 the

cases in which the processing of third party data is considered lawful:

        "1. The treatment will only be lawful if at least one of the following is met
terms:

      a) the interested party gave their consent for the processing of their data
      personal for one or more specific purposes;

      b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the
      interested is part or for the application at the request of this of measures
      pre-contractual;

      (…) "
                                            III

       Sections b), d) and i) of article 58.2 of the RGPD provide the following:

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/6

       “2 Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers
corrective measures listed below:

       (…)

       b) punish any person responsible or in charge of the treatment with
warning when the processing operations have infringed the provisions of
this Regulation; "

(...) “D) order the person in charge of the treatment that the operations of
treatment comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate,
in a certain way and within a specified period; "

       “I) impose an administrative fine in accordance with article 83, in addition or in
place of the measures mentioned in this section, depending on the circumstances
of each particular case; "

       The offense is classified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, which considers as such:

      "5. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with
with section 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

      a) The basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
      consent in accordance with articles 5,6,7 and 9. "

       Organic Law 3/2018, on Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of
Digital Rights (LOPDGDD) in its article 72, under the heading "Infractions
considered very serious ”provides:

      "1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (E.U.)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that one and, in
in particular, the following:

        (…)
       a) The processing of personal data without the concurrence of any of the
           conditions of legality of the treatment established in article 6 of the
           Regulation (EU) 2016/679. "

                                           IV

      The documentation in the file provides evidence that the
claimed, violated article 6.1 of the RGPD, since it is processing data from the
clients of the entity in which he worked, without having legitimacy to do so.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/6

      In this sense, the claimant submits the complaint made by a
client affected by the processing of her personal data without legitimizing basis, in the
message is stated "I at no time have given permission to transfer my data,

it is more thought that it was protected by the platform of protection of data ”.

      Therefore, the respondent does not accredit the legitimacy for the treatment of the

data of the claimant's clients.

                                            V

       Once the resolution proposal was formally notified, the respondent submitted

brief of allegations on March 23, 2021, stated:
said proposal in full and I accept the penalty of warning. That I have adopted the
procedures for collecting consent provided by law as provided in the
art. 6.1 GDPR.
That there are no data in my files of the claimant's clients that have not
been collected in accordance with the legitimizing basis for it, in accordance with the regulations

in art. 6.1 a) of the RGPD ”.

## Article 85 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Procedure

Common Administrative of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP),
under the heading "Termination of sanctioning procedures" provides the

following:

       "1. Initiated a sanctioning procedure, if the offender acknowledges his
responsibility, the procedure may be resolved with the imposition of the sanction
that proceeds ”.

       Therefore, based on the foregoing, the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection RESOLVES:

FIRST: IMPOSE Ms. B.B.B., with NIF \*\*\* NIF.2, for a violation of Article
6.1 of the RGPD, typified in Article 83.5 of the RGPD, a warning sanction.

SECOND: NOTIFY this resolution to Ms. B.B.B ..

In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this
Resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.

Against this resolution, which ends the administrative procedure in accordance with art. 48.6 of the
LOPDGDD, and in accordance with the provisions of article 123 of the LPACAP, the
Interested parties may optionally file an appeal for reconsideration before the
Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection within a month to

counting from the day after the notification of this resolution or directly

the fourth additional provision of Law 29/1998, of July 13, regulating the
Contentious-administrative jurisdiction, within two months from the
day following notification of this act, as provided in article 46.1 of the

referred Law.
C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/6

Finally, it is pointed out that in accordance with the provisions of art. 90.3 a) of the LPACAP,
may provisionally suspend the final resolution through administrative channels if the
interested party expresses his intention to file contentious-administrative appeal.

If this is the case, the interested party must formally communicate this fact through
writing addressed to the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, presenting it through

web /\], or through any of the other records provided for in art. 16.4 of the
