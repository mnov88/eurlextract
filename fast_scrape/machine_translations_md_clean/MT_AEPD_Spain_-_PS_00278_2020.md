## English Summary

### Facts

The defendant has impersonated the claimant in the social network Tinder, using the claimant's pictures to create a profile. The images of the claimant have been taken from the claimant's social networks profiles without his permission. The defendant also used the same pictures to impersonate the claimant on WhatsApp.

### Dispute

Is impersonating someone else on social media, through the unauthorized appropriation of personal images, in violation of Article 5(1)(a) GDPR?

### Holding

The Spanish DPA (AEPD) found that the defendant's conduct violated Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, as a broader principle to which Article 6(1) GDPR is linked, and imposed a fine of €2000 relying on Article 58(2) GDPR.

The defendant ultimately paid €1200 for the breach, by applying two reductions offered under Spanish law, for the voluntary payment of the fine and for recognising their responsibility in the breach.
