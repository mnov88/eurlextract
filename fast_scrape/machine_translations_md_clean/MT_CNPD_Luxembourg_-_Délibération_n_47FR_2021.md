## English Summary

### Facts

The processor is a transport company that installed video surveillance systems at its office. In February 2019, the Luxembourg DPA (CNPD) launched an investigation into the company's use of these video surveillance systems to assess its compliance with the GDPR.

### Holding

First, the Luxembourg DPA assessed whether the company complied with the principle of data minimisation per [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"). It started by affirming that only what is strictly necessary to achieve the pursued aims can be filmed, and that the processing operations cannot be disproportionate when assessed against their purpose. Companies seeking to lawfully install such systems are therefore required to set out the exact purposes of the processing prior to their installation.

During the investigation, the company argued the systems were installed to protect its goods and access to facilities, as well as to safeguard users and prevent accidents. The DPA nonetheless held that three cameras did not comply with the requirements under [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR").

In particular, the camera aimed at the reception, which was unlawful because workers have a right to not be constantly monitored. The camera aimed at the "smoker's corner", which was unlawful because it monitored a space reserved to employees' leisure time. Finally, the camera aimed at the public road outside the office and neighboring land, which was unlawful because it was disproportionate when assessed against the purposes of the processing.

Second, the DPA assessed whether the company complied with its information obligations under [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). It found that although the employees were notified of the existence of the video surveillance systems, visitors of the company's facilities had no access to this information.

Thus, the Luxembourg DPA held that the company (1) failed to comply with the principle of data minimisation by not limiting the field of vision of its video surveillance systems, and (2) failed to adequately inform its employees and third parties of their existence.

for other purposes.6
18. The necessity and proportionality of video surveillance is analysed on a case-by-case 
case and, in particular, with regard to criteria such as the nature of the place to be placed under 
surveillance, its location, configuration or frequency of use.7
2. In the present case
19. During the on-site visit, it was explained to the CNPD officers that the purposes of the 
of the video surveillance system are the protection of the controller's property, the protection of 
of the controller, the protection of access, as well as the safety of users and the prevention of 
prevention of accidents.

2.1. Regarding the field of view of the camera aimed at reception

against such non-compliance, nor any explanation as to why such monitoring measures might be necessary.

to install a video-surveillance system in the workplace. On the other hand, by respecting

35. The head of the investigation thus found that the audited company did not comply with the 
requirements of Article 5.1.c) of the GDPR.
36. The Panel wishes to recall that cameras intended to monitor a place of access

Similarly, outdoor cameras installed in the vicinity of or around a building should be configured so as not to capture the public highway or its surroundings, 
entrances, accesses and interiors of other neighbouring buildings that may be within their 
their field of vision.14
37. However, the Commission recognises that, depending on the configuration of the premises, it may be 
impossible to install a camera that does not include in its field of view a part of the 
part of the public highway, approaches, entrances, accesses and interiors of other buildings. In 
such a case, it considers that the controller should implement masking or blurring 
masking or blurring techniques to limit the field of view to his property.15

position on each camera that contained in its field of view a part of the public highway and/or

2. In the present case
46. The CNPD officers noted during their site visit that the presence of the video
video surveillance system is not reported to the persons concerned. Upon questioning,
it was nevertheless explained to the CNPD agents that the employees had been informed by 
an explanatory e-mail followed by a physical letter.23
In its letter of 6 May 2019, the controller clarified that the document that the employees 
received on 25 May 2018 by e-mail and physical mail is the document entitled 
"Note to all employees on personal data" and that he is working on "the implementation of an

therefore, the audited entity should be held to be in non-compliance with the requirements of Article 
13 of the GDPR with regard to third parties (Statement of Objections, 
Ad.A.1.). 
48. With regard to employees, the head of the investigation found that non-compliance with Article 13 of the 
13 of the RGPD was also established on the day of the on-site visit, as "the document 'Note to all 
to all employees on Personal Data" communicated to employees does not contain certain

49. In a letter dated 29 November 2019, the controller stated that after the departure of the 
the departure of the CNPD agents, first-level information was provided by means of 
pictograms and a short text in French, German and English to alert the public as soon as they

The pictograms would refer to a second level information notice containing all the information required under Article 13 of the RGPD available to the public and to employees on their website. With regard to employees 
specifically for employees, the controller stated that the "Note to all employees on Personal Data" provided to 
on Personal Data" communicated to employees on 25 May 2018 had been updated and 
employees would also be informed by the pictograms and the information note available on the 
on the website of the controller. At the same time, the section on the GDPR on the intranet of the 
intranet would have been updated and the staff delegation would have been informed and consulted 
at all stages of the implementation of the video-surveillance system. 
50. The Panel would first like to point out that Article 13 of the RGPD refers to the 
the obligation imposed on the controller to "provide" all the information 
information mentioned therein. The word "provide" is crucial in this case and it "means 
that the controller must take concrete steps to provide the data subject with the 
information in question to the data subject or to actively direct the data subject to the 
data subject to the location of the information (e.g. by means of a direct link, a QR code 
link, QR code, etc.). (WP260 rev. 01. paragraph 33).
51. 51. The Commission also considers that a multi-level approach to communicating 
transparency information to data subjects can be used in an offline or non-digital 
offline or non-digital context, i.e. in a real environment such as personal data collected

second level (e.g. via a QR code or a website address).
25 The 
second level of information, i.e. the set of information required under Article 13 of the 
Article 13 of the GDPR, could be provided or made available by other means,

The Panel notes, however, that all the documentation of the first and second level of information has been provided to the Commission.

all the data processed by the controller, all the legal bases applicable to the various

61. The Panel wishes to make it clear that the facts taken into account in the context of this 
decision are those found at the beginning of the investigation. Any changes to the data processing 
modifications relating to the data processing operations under investigation, even if they 
even if they make it possible to establish full or partial compliance, do not

62. Nevertheless, the steps taken by the supervised party to comply with the 
with the GDPR during the investigation procedure or to remedy the shortcomings 
by the head of the investigation in the statement of objections, are taken into account by the 
the Panel in the context of possible remedial action and/or the setting of a possible fine.

63. In the letter supplementing the statement of objections of 3 August 2020, the head of the 
proposes to the Restricted Section to impose an administrative fine on the 
amount of six thousand eight hundred (6,800) euros.
64. In his letter of 10 September 2020, the audited party considered that the amount of the fine is disproportionate to the 
disproportionate due to the absence of any intention to cause the

July 14, 2021 he indicated that he accepts the fact that he had monitored a smoking area with a camera 
in violation of the requirements of the GDPR and that he accepts the fine of EUR 6,800.29
65. In order to decide whether an administrative fine should be imposed and to decide 
the amount of the fine, the Panel shall take into account the elements 
the elements provided for in Article 83(2) of the RGPD :
- As regards the nature and gravity of the breach (Article 83.2.a) of the RGPD), it notes 
As regards the breaches of Article 5(1)(c) of the RGPD, they are 
constitute breaches of a fundamental principle of the RGPD (and of data protection law in general) 
protection law in general), namely the principle of data minimisation enshrined in 
principle enshrined in Chapter II "Principles" of the RGPD. It should be noted that at the time of 
the time of the on-site visit by the CNPD agents, a camera allowed the permanent 
surveillance of the employee working in the reception area, one camera 
surveillance of an area reserved for employees' free time, in this case a "smoking 
smoking area, while seven cameras were aimed at the surrounding grounds and/or the

- As for the failure to inform the persons concerned 
in accordance with Article 13 of the RGPD, the Panel recalls that 
information and transparency regarding the processing of personal data are essential 
transparency regarding the processing of personal data is an essential obligation for data controllers 
data controllers so that individuals are fully aware of the use that will be made of their 
their personal data, once collected. A 
failure to comply with Article 13 of the RGPD thus constitutes a breach of the rights of the 
of the data subjects. This right to information has also been strengthened under the 
under the RGPD, which shows their particular importance. It should be noted that 
that at the time of the site visit by the CNPD agents, no pictograms, posters or notices 
pictograms, posters or information leaflets could be shown to the CNPD officials.

informed of the presence of the video surveillance system in accordance with
Article 13 of the GDPR, while the document given to the employees, i.e. the

"Note to all employees on Personal Data", did not contain all the information

- As regards the criterion of duration (Article 83(2)(a) of the GDPR), the Panel 
notes that these shortcomings lasted over time, at least since 25 May 2018 and until
25 May 2018 and until the day of the on-site visit. It recalls here that two years have

- As to the question of whether the breaches were committed deliberately

that "not deliberately" means that there was no intention to commit the breach, although the

that the cooperation of the audited company throughout the investigation was good, as well as its willingness to comply with the

as soon as possible.31
66. The Panel notes that the other criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR are neither relevant nor 
are neither relevant nor likely to influence its decision on the imposition of an administrative fine and its 
administrative fine and its amount. 
67. It also notes that while several measures have been put in place by the supervised 
to remedy certain shortcomings in whole or in part, these were only adopted following the 
adopted following the inspection by CNPD officials on 20 March 2019 (see also point 61 of this 
see also paragraph 61 of this decision).
68. The Panel therefore considers that the imposition of an administrative fine is 
justified in the light of the criteria laid down in Article 83(2) of the RGPD for 
breach of Articles 5(1)(c) and 13 of the RGPD. 
69. With regard to the amount of the administrative fine, it recalls that Article 83(3) of the 
3 of Article 83 of the RGPD provides that in the event of multiple breaches, as in the case of 
case, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the amount set for the most serious 
violation. Insofar as a breach of Articles 5 and 13 of the GDPR is alleged, the maximum fine 
the maximum fine that can be imposed is EUR 20 million or 
20 million or 4% of annual worldwide turnover, whichever is higher. 
70. In the light of the relevant criteria of Article 83(2) of the GDPR mentioned above, the 
Panel considers that the imposition of a fine of six thousand eight hundred
(6,800) appears to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in accordance with the 
requirements of Article 83.1 of the GDPR.
2.2 As regards the taking of corrective measures

the Head of Investigation proposes that the Restricted Panel adopt the following corrective measures
