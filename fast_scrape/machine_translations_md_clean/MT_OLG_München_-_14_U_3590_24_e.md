## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is a credit information agency which collects information on individuals that it considers relevant to their creditworthiness and derives an overall credit rating from this.

In December 2017 and December 2020, the controller made two entries in its database regarding two default loan payments by the data subject.

In February 2022, the loans were settled. Despite this, the controller continued to store the resolved default data in its creditworthiness database and report them to third parties for three years post-resolution, in line with its internal data retention policy. The data were not used in scoring after the settlement but were visible to third parties requesting credit files.

The data subject filed a case before the court of first instance claiming that the controller’s practice significantly restricts his economic freedom of action. He sought deletion of these entries under [Article 17(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1a "Article 17 GDPR"), [Article 17(1)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1c "Article 17 GDPR"), and [Article 17(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1d "Article 17 GDPR"), asserting that the data were no longer necessary for processing. He also objected under [Article 21(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#1 "Article 21 GDPR"), invoking a special personal situation and that the storage was disproportionate, particularly given that public registers like the debtor registry (under § 882e ZPO) or insolvency announcements (under the InsBekV) require deletion much earlier.  

The controller justified the retention based on legitimate interests under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"), namely: Providing accurate creditworthiness information to lenders and third parties; Mitigating financial risk across the lending sector; and Ensuring consistency with industry best practices as captured in a Code of Conduct under [Article 40 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_40_GDPR "Article 40 GDPR"), developed in consultation with German data protection authorities, which permits a three-year storage period for resolved debts.

The court of first instance dismissed the data subjects’ claim under [Article 17(1)](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1 "Article 17 GDPR"). It ruled that the specific data were still necessary for the assessment of the creditworthiness of the data subject and that the controllers legitimate interest prevailed. The court also dismissed his arguments regarding public registers, pointing out that the GDPR itself does not provide for any retention periods.

In February 2025, the controller deleted the data subject’s data.

The data subject appealed the decision before the Higher Regional Court of Munich (Oberlandesgericht München-OLG München) seeking a declaratory relief, claiming that the court of first instance had misapplied the law and that the controller had processed his personal data unlawfully.

### Holding

The court rejected the data subject’s request for deletion and affirmed the lawfulness of the credit information agency’s practices:

First, the court held that the controller had a legitimate interest in storing the data for 3 years, which outweighed the data subject’s rights and freedoms. ([Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR")) The court referred to statistical evidence showing a higher default probability among individuals who had previously defaulted, even after resolution.

Second, the court, taking into consideration the aforementioned code of conduct, found that the three-year storage carried out by the controller was necessary (Article 17(1)(a) GDPR) and lawful (Article 17(1)(d) GDPR), stating that a shorter retention period would reduce the effectiveness of credit risk models. It also found that there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject (Article 17(1)(c) GDPR), pointing out that the data subject’s financial hardship and difficulties in obtaining credit is not considered a “special situation”[(Article 21(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_21_GDPR#1 "Article 21 GDPR")).

Third, the court distinguished the context of public registers from that of private credit information agencies, stating that their objectives differ and cannot be analogised directly. The controller was not obliged to align its data retention practices with those public law provisions.

Lastly, the court held that the appeal was unfounded.

## Comment

This judgment shows how courts balance privacy rights under the GDPR against credit information agencies’ business interests. It upheld the retention of resolved debt records for up to three years under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"), stressing the need for reliable credit scoring, but took a narrow view of what counts as a “special situation” under Article 21(1) GDPR, making it harder for individuals to get their data deleted.

This raises real concerns about long-term data control and shows the need for stronger safeguards for individuals in credit reporting. Also there does not appear to be a uniform retention period between public and private credit information agencies because purposes of retention were held to be different, though the impact on an individual is not distinguishable.

```
tenor
1. The plaintiff’s appeal against the judgment of the Regional Court of Kempten (Allgäu) of 4 October 2024, case number 62 O 1855/23 , is dismissed.

2. The plaintiff shall bear the costs of the appeal proceedings.

3. The judgment is provisionally enforceable.

Resolution

The value in dispute for the appeal proceedings is set at €10,000.00.

Reasons
A.

The plaintiff asserts claims against the defendant for the deletion of \[credit agency\] entries, the reassessment of the plaintiff's creditworthiness and claims for injunctive relief.

The defendant is a public limited company that operates a credit reporting agency for profit. It collects information on individuals it considers relevant to their creditworthiness in its own database and derives an overall credit rating, which it assesses with a base score of up to 100 and an industry score.

The defendant first entered an entry regarding the plaintiff's payment default into its database under number #1 on December 13, 2017, because, according to a report from its contractual partner "A," an amount of €3,364.47 was outstanding. The plaintiff had not fulfilled his installment payment obligation under a loan agreement since July 2017. After several reminders regarding a payment arrears of just over €200, the loan agreement was finally terminated, resulting in an amount of €3,364.47 becoming due. The plaintiff was not able to settle the remaining outstanding amount of €1,094 until 2022. In the first instance, based on a notification from the defendant, the plaintiff initially assumed a settlement date of March 23, 2022. Since its defense, the defendant has claimed that it had last been notified of settlement on February 7, 2022. The plaintiff did not object to this.

The defendant first entered an entry regarding the plaintiff's payment default into its database under number #2 on December 18, 2020. Since July 2017, the plaintiff had failed to meet his monthly installment payment obligation of €160.90 under a loan agreement with "B." After several reminders, the loan agreement was finally terminated, resulting in an amount of €5,303.40 becoming due. The plaintiff was not able to settle the remaining outstanding balance of €4,535 until 2022. In the first instance, based on a notification from the defendant, the plaintiff initially assumed a settlement date of October 25, 2022. Since filing its defense, the defendant has claimed that it was last notified of settlement on February 7, 2022. The plaintiff did not contest this.

At the time of the oral hearing in the first instance, the plaintiff's credit rating was below 50, which is considered "very critical" with regard to the risk of default. According to current practice, the defendant deletes entries regarding settled claims exactly three years after settlement. Until then, the defendant also shares information about the claims with its contractual partners.

The plaintiff is challenging this practice by the defendant, which significantly restricts his economic freedom. For example, he claims that due to the credit agency entries, he was unable to obtain an installment plan for the necessary purchase of a washing machine. He is unable to obtain an overdraft facility from his bank, and he has not received financing for the intended purchase of a condominium. In this context, the plaintiff cited amounts of €270,000 (see hearing in the first instance, page 169 of the file) and €220,000 (see hearing before the Senate, page 167 of the file).

In this context, the defendant pointed out in the first instance, without contradiction, that the plaintiff was able to take out a loan via \[a popular online payment service\] in eight cases between 2022 and 2024, for amounts ranging from €106 to €379.

To supplement the facts and issues in the first instance, reference is made to the facts of the contested decision.

The Regional Court dismissed the action. It argued that there was no claim under Article 17 (1) GDPR; in particular, the entries with a note of completion were still necessary for assessing the data subject's creditworthiness, pursuant to Article 17 (1) (a) GDPR. The GDPR itself does not stipulate any retention periods; Section 35 (2) Sentence 2 Number 4 of the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) (old version) is to be used as the fundamental starting point for determining the retention period. The assessment of Section 882e (3) ZPO regarding the deletion of entries in the debtors' register is not applicable to the present case; discharge of residual debt (Section 3 of the InsBekV) is not an option. It was not apparent that the plaintiff's legitimate interests outweighed his claims, especially since it could not be assumed that the plaintiff would not be granted real estate financing solely because of his credit agency entries \[held by the defendant\]. As a result, a recalculation of the score value is not (yet) required, and there is no risk of repetition for the injunction applications.

In his grounds of appeal, the plaintiff particularly complains about the District Court’s incorrect application of the law.

The Regional Court failed to recognize that, pursuant to Art. 5 (2) GDPR, the defendant must demonstrate and prove that it "does not violate the requirements of good faith and transparency pursuant to Art. 5 (1) (a) GDPR and the requirements of adequacy, or limitation to the necessary extent, pursuant to Art. 5 (1) (c) GDPR, when making statements regarding the plaintiff's creditworthiness." The Regional Court placed the burden of presentation and proof on the plaintiff for the defendant's conduct, namely the (arbitrary) imposition of a rigid retention period. The statistical relevance of defaults resolved more than six months ago for future defaults was disputed, and the defendant failed to provide any statistics.

The Regional Court should have examined the question of an appropriate storage period in two stages: It would correctly have come to the conclusion that a three-year storage period was unlawful per se (see in more detail the Court's reasoning p. 10 ff. = p. 14 ff. of the Court's opinion), but that in any case in the specific individual case the plaintiff's data should have been deleted after a maximum of six months (see in more detail the Court's reasoning p. 19 ff. = p. 23 ff. of the Court's opinion), this for the purpose of data minimization and in order to establish the alignment required by an indirect third-party effect of Article 3 (1) of the Basic Law with cases of discharge of residual debt (see Section 3 of the InsBekV) and the deletion of entries in the debtors' register (see Section 882e (3) No. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure). The grounds of appeal subsequently appear to primarily deal with another judgment of the first instance, although it is still stated that the court of first instance should have taken a closer look at the reasons for the one-off payment default and its effects on the plaintiff.

In the appeal proceedings, the plaintiff initially made the following requests:

1. The defendant is ordered to delete the entry concerning the settlement of the previous claim under account number #1 held by the defendant against the plaintiff dated March 23, 2022, and all related entries from its file maintained by the plaintiff.

2. The defendant is ordered to delete the entry concerning the settlement of the previous claim under account number #2 held by the defendant against the plaintiff dated October 25, 2022, and all related entries from its file maintained by the plaintiff.

3. The defendant is ordered to correct the score values ​​it maintains, which it uses to assess the plaintiff's creditworthiness, after deletion.

4. The defendant is ordered to refrain from saving or otherwise processing any entries relating to the previous claim under account number #1 held by the defendant against the plaintiff, which was marked as settled on March 23, 2022, on pain of a fine of up to EUR 250,000.00 to be determined by the court for each case of infringement, or alternatively, detention to be enforced against its legal representative (board of directors), or detention to be enforced against its legal representative (board of directors) for up to six months, or up to two years in the event of a repeat offense.

5. The defendant is ordered to refrain from saving or otherwise processing any entries relating to the previous claim under account number #2 held by the defendant against the plaintiff, which was marked as settled on October 25, 2022, on pain of a fine of up to EUR 250,000.00 to be determined by the court for each case of infringement, or alternatively, detention to be enforced against its legal representative (board of directors), or detention to be enforced against its legal representative (board of directors) for up to six months, or up to two years in the event of a repeat offense.

6. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff's out-of-court costs in the amount of EUR 973.66.

On January 25, 2025, the plaintiff received an updated copy of the data, which showed February 7, 2025, as the settlement date. On February 7, 2025, the defendant deleted the disputed entries. The plaintiff then corrected the settlement date to February 7, 2022, in a written submission dated March 18, 2025, and declared claims 1, 2, 4, and 5 settled. The defendant did not agree to this (partial) settlement declaration.

At the oral appeal hearing, the plaintiff made the above motions "with the proviso that motion 3 concerns the base score (not simply "score") and with the proviso that the amended data from the pleading of March 18, 2025, should apply and, of course, the declaration of completion with regard to motions 1, 2, 4, and 5 should be taken into account."

The defendant requests that the appeal be dismissed.

It defends the first-instance ruling, arguing that the application of a three-year deletion period leads to significantly better results in predicting the likelihood of new defaults and cannot be substituted by other information. The "debtor register" and "discharge of residual debt" scenarios cited by the plaintiff are not comparable.

B.

The plaintiff’s appeal is admissible but unfounded.

I.

The amendment of the action in the appeal court proves to be admissible.

To the extent that the plaintiff has unilaterally declared that his claim has been settled (nos. 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the motions) and thus now requests a declaration that the main legal dispute has been settled with regard to these motions, the admissibility of the amendment of the claim follows from Sections 525 and 264 No. 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff's interest in obtaining a declaration pursuant to Section 256 (1) of the Code of Civil Procedure lies in his desire to avoid an adverse cost decision.

If the clarification of the third claim in the oral appeal hearing can be understood as an amendment to the claim, its admissibility also follows from Sections 525 and 264 No. 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

II.

The action proves to be unfounded in its (declaratory) applications 1, 2, 4 and 5 because, at the time the disputed \[credit agency\] entries were deleted, the action was admissible but unfounded.

The plaintiff had no right to have the disputed entries in the defendant's database deleted because the payment defaults and their settlement were initially processed lawfully in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR (Art. 17 (1) (d) GDPR), because it was necessary to delete the data only three years after the payment default had been settled (Art. 17 (1) (a) or (d) GDPR) and because the defendant's legitimate reasons for processing outweigh the plaintiff's interest in early deletion (e.g. after six months or two years) (Art. 17 (1) (c) GDPR).

1. The personal data were initially processed lawfully by the defendant within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. This is not disputed by the plaintiff, who, according to the reply of May 13, 2024, expressly does not request "equal treatment with persons who always meet their claims in a timely manner \[...\] but rather equal treatment with persons who have received discharge from residual debt," and thus requests deletion after six months.

a) According to the ECJ's correct opinion, which the Senate agrees with, the defendant's processing of data on the solvency of affected private individuals serves "the economic interests of the \[credit agency\]" as well as "the safeguarding of the legitimate interest of the \[credit agency's\] contractual partners who wish to conclude credit-relevant contracts with individuals in assessing the creditworthiness of those individuals and thus the socio-economic interests of the credit sector" (ECJ ZD 2024, 166 para. 83). The assessment of consumers' creditworthiness before concluding credit agreements is even considered essential by both European and domestic law to protect the lender from default and the consumer from over-indebtedness and insolvency (BeckOGK/Knops, Section 505a BGB para. 8). This is demonstrated by Section 505a of the German Civil Code (BGB) and Section 18a of the German Banking Act (KWG), which implement Article 18 of the Residential Mortgage Credit Directive 2014/17/EU and Article 8 of the Consumer Credit Directive 2008/48/EC – in some cases to an excessive extent.

b) The Senate further finds that the legitimate interest in processing data on the plaintiff's payment defaults and their resolution could not have been achieved in a more respectful manner, and that the principle of data minimization was complied with. The plaintiff has not presented any evidence to the contrary, nor is any evidence otherwise apparent.

c) For the Senate, there is no question that information about payment defaults on the scale in question is of considerable relevance for assessing creditworthiness, even after they have been resolved. If someone is unable to settle four-figure debts for several years, this will still affect their creditworthiness even if the debt is finally settled.

At the same time, the defendant's processing of data on payment defaults significantly interferes with its fundamental rights under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The ECJ's reasoning regarding discharge of residual debt can be applied to the present case: "Such data \[...\] serve as a negative factor in assessing the data subject's creditworthiness and therefore constitute sensitive information concerning his or her private life \[...\]. Their processing may seriously harm the interests of the data subject, since such disclosure is likely to make the exercise of his or her freedoms significantly more difficult, in particular when it comes to meeting basic needs" (ECJ ZD 2024, 166 para. 94).

In balancing the conflicting interests described above, it can be assumed that the requirements for the lawfulness of data processing increase the longer the data are stored (ECJ, ibid., para. 95). However, it is obvious to the Senate that, at least shortly after the resolution of a payment default lasting several years and involving a mid-four-digit amount, the interest in processing the data prevails. This interest, as explained, is not only in the interest of the defendant and its customers, but also in the interest of the plaintiff, who should not be overburdened again by taking out new loans. Against this background, the fact that data relating to the payment defaults and their resolution were stored beyond the resolution date proves to be lawful.

2. The Senate considers the plaintiff's assumption that the data concerning his payment defaults should have been deleted six months after their resolution to be incorrect. The three-year retention period undertaken by the defendant was necessary (Article 17 (1) (a) GDPR) and lawful (Article 17 (1) (d) and Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).

a) The Senate considers it obvious that the risk of future payment defaults is (statistically) higher for those who have previously fallen into arrears with payments, and that this risk decreases the longer the payment default has been resolved. This generally accepted knowledge forms the basis of the above-mentioned legislation on creditworthiness assessment (Section II. 1. a)) and is undisputed between the parties.

b) The Senate further assumes that a settled payment default significantly increases the risk of a new payment default even three years after the date of settlement.

aa) The defendant, with reference to its own surveys – which were not explained in detail – and the report submitted in the first instance as Exhibit B5 \[by a well-known firm which, according to its own statements, operates in the areas of auditing, tax consulting, legal and business "or" management consulting\], has qualifiedly argued that the deletion of entries on resolved payment defaults after six months, as sought by the plaintiff, would lead to a loss of statistically relevant information: "By using a storage period of three years, a tenfold higher probability of a new payment default can be determined for the affected group compared to a deletion period of only six months. Compared to a deletion period of two years, the probability of a new payment default occurring for the affected group with a deletion period of three years is still eight times higher" (Exhibit B6 or BB4, p. 6 under no. 12).

bb) This factual submission was not rejected as being late in the first instance; the Senate can and must therefore take it into account.

cc) The plaintiff does not – as far as can be seen – dispute that the figures used by the defendant are correct; such a spurious dispute would also be inadmissible (Federal Court of Justice NJW-RR 2016, 606 para. 24). Contrary to the plaintiff's assumption (see, for example, pages 131 et seq. of the BerA) – the fact that the figures underlying the defendant's analysis originate from the (coronavirus) years 2019 to 2022 does not render them useless: First, the pandemic did occur, and the credit sector has to live with its consequences. The defendant therefore had no reason to exclude this period. On the other hand, the figures for 2019 (see page 145 of the German Federal Court of Appeals) – not yet influenced by the coronavirus pandemic – provide a clear picture: new payment defaults occurred significantly more frequently (approximately 6%) in the group of those whose payment default had already been resolved for at least two and a maximum of three years as of January 1, 2019, than in the group of persons without a previous negative entry (approximately 0.7%). These figures alone readily support the conviction that even three years after the resolution of a payment default, the probability of a new payment default is significantly increased, i.e., several times higher. The plaintiff's observation (cf. reply to the appeal dated March 18, 2025, diagram p. 8 = page 134 of the Federal Court of Appeals) that at least 94% of consumers affected by a payment default had not reported a new payment default three years after the resolution of the default is of course also correct.

c) The decisive question in the dispute is therefore how much time elapsed after the settlement of the payment defaults on February 7, 2022, until the plaintiff's interest in the undisturbed exercise of his freedoms - conceptually still detached from reasons arising from his particular situation (see below under 3., Art. 17 (1) (c) GDPR) - outweighed the economic interests of the defendant, but above all also the socio-economic interests of the credit sector (including protection of the lender against default and the borrower against financial overburdening).

aa) The Senate has taken note of the fact that the plaintiff considers storage for more than six months – also with regard to Section 882e Paragraph 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Section 3 of the Insolvency Regulations (InsBekV) (see below ee, ff) – to be no longer necessary and unlawful.

bb) The defendant refers to the code of conduct issued by the association "Die Wirtschaftsauskunfteien eV," to which it belongs, in accordance with Articles 40 et seq. of the GDPR. These now provide for staggered deletion periods (as of May 25, 2024, see Appendix BB 2). In the present case of a settled and undisputed claim, Section IV 2. a) stipulates that the data be stored for three years. The defendant has based its decision on this.

cc) These codes of conduct are not binding on the Senate (ECJ, ibid., paras. 104 et seq.). However, considering that the codes of conduct were approved by the Hessian Data Protection Commissioner (hereinafter: HBDI) (see Annex BB 3; cf. Art. 40 (5) GDPR), that the revised codes of conduct were preceded by an objection from the HBDI, and that approval was in turn preceded by a hearing of interested parties (see Annex BB 3, p. 3) and consultation with other data protection officers, the codes of conduct offer at least some guidance as to which retention periods are considered necessary and lawful by interested parties involved in the matter, subject to the specific circumstances of the respective individual case. The same applies to Section 35 of the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) in the version valid until May 24, 2018, which, in paragraph 2, sentence 2, no. 4, provided for deletion after at least three years and demonstrates how the German legislature assessed the interests involved before the GDPR came into force. A large portion of higher court jurisprudence also generally supports deletion after three years (see, for example, OLG Munich 37 U 3936/24; OLG Koblenz 5 U 1018/24 \[each submitted in appendix BB1\]; OLG Brandenburg ZD 2023, 748; doubtful OLG Oldenburg 13 W 9/24 \[see appendix of the plaintiff's side in the appeal proceedings\]).

dd) The following applies to the consideration in the present (individual) case: It is undisputed between the parties that the plaintiff was no longer able to service two loan agreements in mid-2017, which, after several reminders, led to the termination of the loan agreements and, as a result, to a payment default in the (each) mid-four-digit range. Only on February 7, 2022, was the plaintiff able to settle the remaining outstanding amounts. In view of the continued significantly higher statistical risk of renewed payment defaults (see b) and with regard to the interests described above (II. 1. a, c), the Senate considers three years of storage to be necessary and lawful in this case at least. The plaintiff's interest in regaining economic freedom can only prevail if, after a certain period of time, it can be assumed that his financial circumstances have been sufficiently consolidated. A period of three years appears appropriate in this respect.

ee) The fact that private credit agencies must delete information from a public register on the granting of a discharge of residual debt in favour of natural persons after the expiry of the storage period of the data in the public register – and thus in Germany after six months (Section 3 of the InsBekV) – does not lead to a different assessment because the cases are not comparable:

- In this case, the stored data does not come from a public register.

- It should also be considered that the discharge of residual debt is intended to allow the beneficiary to re-engage in business life after the crisis leading to the initiation of personal insolvency proceedings and the subsequent three-year period of good conduct (see ECJ, ibid., para. 98). This objective would be jeopardized, at the very least, if creditors were informed of the insolvency proceedings indirectly.

- It should also be borne in mind that lenders are significantly less deserving of protection in this situation because the beneficiaries have a "clean slate" after the discharge of residual debt, which is why the potential lender can usually reliably assess their creditworthiness simply by checking their income situation.

ff) That a shorter retention period would be necessary does not follow from Section 882e (3) No. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), according to which the deletion of an entry in the debtors' register occurs prematurely, among other things, if the creditor's claims have been fully satisfied. Firstly, the data in dispute were not taken from the debtors' register in this case. Secondly, although Section 882e (3) No. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure also intends to protect commercial transactions from insolvent and unwilling contractual partners ( BT-Drs. 16/10069, p. 35 ; OLG Oldenburg, ibid.), there are relevant differences that require a differentiated approach:

- It should first be noted that the circle of those entitled to inspect the debtor register (cf. Section 882f para. 1 ZPO) is very broad and goes well beyond the aspect of an examination of economic reliability listed in No. 2 and No. 4.

- Section 882e of the Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), which deals with the deletion of data, does not differentiate according to the amount of the underlying claim or the purpose of the access. The early deletion (with proof of completion) is a logical consequence of this "one size fits all" rule, which must ensure that the processing of the data is lawful for each affected case.

- The circle of the defendant's contractual partners, and thus also those "authorized to inspect," is significantly smaller, and the significance of the information is typically significantly greater: The defendant provides information in particular to those contractual partners who have a particularly strong interest in creditworthiness data because they are making advance payments to a private individual and thus have to calculate an economic (default) risk (in particular, banks, savings banks, cooperative banks, credit card, factoring, and leasing companies). Protecting the credit sector from payment defaults and excessive demands on borrowers thus justifies a differentiated approach.

- Against this background, the Senate considers the assumption that full satisfaction eliminates any interest in information on the part of business (see Cologne Higher Regional Court 15 U 249/24 , cited in the written submission of April 10, 2025) to be inaccurate and unrealistic. Nor can it be supported by the legislature's statement that proof of a deferral or the creditor's consent cannot lead to the deletion of the entry because this does not eliminate the business's interest in information ( BT-Drs 16/10069, p. 40 , cited by Cologne Higher Regional Court 15 U 249/24 in the written submission of April 10, 2025). The cited reference only states when the interest in information is certain to continue, but not that it ceases in the event of full satisfaction—regardless of the circumstances of the individual case.

- In view of this, there is no scope for a corresponding application of the provisions for entries in the debtors' register.

3. Deletion pursuant to Art. 17 (1) (c) GDPR is not necessary because the plaintiff has not conclusively demonstrated a "special situation" (Art. 21 (1) GDPR).

a) The term "special situation" within the meaning of Art. 21 (1) GDPR refers to atypical situations (Paal/Pauly/Martini, 3rd ed. 2021, GDPR Art. 21 para. 30) that differ in an extraordinary, specific, and individual way from the situation of other persons (see Ehmann/Selmayr/Kamann/Braun, 3rd ed. 2024, GDPR Art. 21 para. 20). The plaintiff's submissions do not indicate such an atypical situation. The fact that the plaintiff could not simply purchase a washing machine on credit (complaint, p. 4) is surprising given the intended purchase of a condominium for €270,000 (this figure was stated by the plaintiff at the hearing before the Kempten Regional Court) or €220,000 (this figure was stated by the plaintiff to the Senate, see page 167 of the Court of Appeal), but by no means atypical in view of the previous payment defaults. It is obvious that someone who does not have the means to purchase a washing machine in cash would have difficulty finding financing for a condominium. It is implausible and not conclusive to argue that the disputed \[credit agency\] entries alone would have prevented financing. The plaintiff has provided no details regarding either his financing efforts or his financial circumstances. Furthermore, it is not apparent why the plaintiff would be more in need of protection than other persons in a comparable situation.

b) Finally, it would be assumed that there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which outweigh the interests, rights and freedoms of the plaintiff (Article 17 (1) (c) GDPR; see OLG Munich 37 U 3936/24).

III.

The request for correction of the so-called base score submitted in section 3 cannot be successful because the defendant's argument can only be understood to mean that the entries concerning the plaintiff's payment defaults, which were deleted on February 7, 2025, are automatically excluded from the calculation of the base score upon deletion. The plaintiff's claim arising from the deletion was thus fulfilled immediately; it was never justified.

IV.

In the absence of a claim in the main proceedings, there is also no claim to pre-trial legal fees.

V.

The decision on costs is based on Section 97 Paragraph 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

The determination of the provisional enforceability of the contested judgment was made in accordance with Section 708 No. 10 ZPO, 711 , 713 ZPO.

The appeal to the Federal Court of Justice was denied because the Senate had to weigh the merits of each individual case and because, to date, no higher court decisions have deemed a deletion period of less than three years necessary for data on payment defaults not derived from public registers, regardless of the individual case. The decision of the Cologne Higher Regional Court ( 15 U 249/24 ), cited in the brief of April 10, 2025, only concerns "payment defaults that are entered or could be entered in the debtors' register pursuant to Section 882b of the Code of Civil Procedure." The parties have not submitted any submissions regarding an entry in the debtors' register, nor regarding the existence of the requirements of Section 882c of the Code of Civil Procedure.

The value in dispute for the appeal proceedings was determined in application of Sections 47 and 48 of the GKG.
