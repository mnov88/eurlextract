## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject was a customer of Bankinter (the controller). On 15 July 2021, the data subject accessed their online banking account in order to check a payment. They discovered that they could also view another person's banking information on the account. The data subject then contacted the controller's customer service department. However, they did not receive any news nor was the incident corrected. Therefore, the data subject complained about the security breach to the Spanish DPA.

The DPA initiated a sanctioning procedure and carried out an initial investigation.

### Holding

First, the DPA held that the controller was responsible, in accordance with [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"), for implementing the appropriate technical and organisational measures and ensuring a level of security appropriate to the risk in order to safeguard the confidentiality of the data. The controller violated [Article 32 GDPR,](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") by allowing the data subject access to personal data of a third party via an online banking account.

Second, the DPA recalled that the GDPR does not establish a list of security measures that are applicable according to the data that are processed, but rather establishes that the controller shall apply technical and organisational measures that are appropriate to the risk of the data being processed. For that purpose, it is necessary to take into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, the risks of likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

In the present case, the controller alleged that they granted special relevance to the protection of the confidentiality of the information under its control, for which it developed codes, policies and procedures aimed at guaranteeing the protection of said information. However, this statement was not accepted by the DPA, which argued that it was obvious from the incident that the technical and organisational measures implemented failed.

The DPA initially proposed a fine of €60,000 for breach of confidentiality and €40,000 for not adopting adequate technical and organisational measures. However, due to voluntary payment, the overall sum was reduced to €80,000.

                           FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

                                           Yo
       By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the GDPR recognizes to each
control authority, and as established in articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to solve this procedure.

       Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The
procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed
by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, for the
regulatory provisions dictated in its development and, as soon as they are not
contradict, on a subsidiary basis, by the general rules on the
administrative procedures.”

                                           II

       The denounced facts materialize in the visualization, when accessing the
monthly statement of your account on the claimant's website, not just your data

personal but to the data of a third person (account number and movements
of the same), violating the duty of confidentiality motivated by an incident of
security due to breach of technical and organizational measures.

       Article 58 of the GDPR, Powers, states:

       "two. Each supervisory authority shall have all the following powers
corrections listed below:

       (…)
       b) penalize any person in charge or person in charge of the treatment with
       warning when the processing operations have infringed the
       provided in this Regulation;
       (…)”

       First of all, article 5, Principles relating to treatment, of the GDPR
states that:

       "1. Personal data will be:

       (…)

       f) processed in such a way as to guarantee adequate security of the
       personal data, including protection against unauthorized processing or
       illicit and against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application
       of appropriate technical or organizational measures ("integrity and
       confidentiality").
       (…)”

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/19

                                          II
       1. First, the defendant in writing 02/25/2022 alleged that the
12/27/2021, through the Agency's electronic headquarters, responded to the

Transfers of Claim and Request for Information, as reflected in those in the
File itself containing a copy of the response offered and that in the
Initiation Agreement, it is indicated that no response has been received to the Transfers of
Claim and Information Request.

       Obviously it is an error because the defendant is true that he answered, such

and as stated in the file, although such circumstance is contrary to what is alleged by
the defendant would not have implied the inadmissibility of the claim or non-compliance
of the norms that regulate the procedure in light of the information offered by the
same.

       Secondly, in a brief of 04/07/2022, it alleged that the defendant did not
There was no record or procedure with the AEPD that corresponds to the
reference numbers (PS/00634/2021 or E/12527/2021) and requested confirmation of the
existence of said error and, in particular, that the reference to "the documents
obtained and generated that are part of procedure E/12527/2021” was also
erroneous, there being no other procedure or documents of which Bankinter has

proof (otherwise, the Agency is requested to provide Bankinter with this
information together with the complete administrative file); and "it is corrected
formally said error, so that said Agreement is rectified in the file”.

       On 02/07/2022, the defendant was notified of the Commencement Agreement

Sanctioning Procedure, appearing in the header of the same the reference to the
File No.: EXP202104875, that is, the same one that appears in the Proposal that is
issues and numbering produced by the internal system.

       Subsequently, the defendant has requested a copy of the file and will have been able to

verify that the documents that make up the administrative file are
correspond to those provided by the claimant, those generated by the AEPD and the
provided by the claimant.

       Likewise, on 03/29/2022 the opening of the test period was notified and the
Contrary to the previous letter, there is a reference to the disciplinary procedure

File No. PS/00634/2021 and in the second point of the AGREEMENT, it is indicated
requirement that the defendant himself indicated in his allegations to the initiation agreement; in
regarding the reference to the aforementioned numbers both of the disciplinary procedure
and the file are figures provided by the internal application system and that nothing
have to do with different files (thus the number of disciplinary procedure

is a code number provided by the system in relation to the file
procedural) but that have nothing to do with files or documents other than
those that the defendant has in his possession and that are part of the file
administrative, so there is no other procedure or other documentation of
which Bankinter is not aware of.

       In short, the unique file number that appears on the settlement agreement
home includes all the internal numbers that identify the procedures carried out with

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/19

above, which all refer to the same claim; what he could
check upon receipt of the copy of the entire file

       2. As we pointed out in the previous foundation, article 5, Principles
regarding treatment, establishes in its letter f) the following:

       “The personal data will be:

       (…)

       f) processed in such a way as to guarantee adequate security of the
personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and
against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application of measures
appropriate technical or organizational ("integrity and confidentiality")

       (…)”

       What the GDPR comes to point out is that the technical and organizational measures
adopted must be aimed at preventing unauthorized access or use of said
data and the equipment used in the treatment.

       In this same sense, Recital 39 states that "... All
reasonable measures to ensure that the data is rectified or deleted
personal information that is inaccurate. Personal data must be processed in a way that
ensure adequate security and confidentiality of personal data,
including to prevent unauthorized access or use of such data and equipment

used in treatment.
       This principle is reinforced in recital 49 of the GDPR, stating that the

processing of personal data will be carried out..."to the extent strictly necessary
and provided to ensure the security of the network and information, that is, the
capacity of a network or an information system to resist, at a certain level
of trust, to accidental events or illegal or malicious actions
that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of the
personal data stored or transmitted (…).”

       The documentation in the file offers clear indications that the
claimed, violated article 5 of the GDPR, duty of confidentiality, by enabling the

visualization in your monthly bank statement, not only the movements of your
account, but also those relating to a third person.

       As it appears in the proven facts, a copy of the extract is provided
comprehensive monthly corresponding to June 2021 in which the movements of
the account of which the claimant is the holder, as well as the movements related to
a second account owned by a third person.

       The duty of confidentiality, previously the duty of secrecy, must
understood that its purpose is to prevent leaks of data not
consented by the holders of the same.

         The duty of confidentiality is an obligation that is incumbent not only on the
responsible and in charge of the treatment but to anyone who intervenes in any
treatment phase and complementary to the duty of professional secrecy.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/19

       The defendant himself in his brief of 04/07/2022 has stated that "In
Actually, the situation was caused by an error when managing the change of
ownership of the Other Account (as the Claimant himself stated in the Brief).

       Access to the Other's information had not been completely withdrawn.
Account (of which he had been co-owner) at the time of the change of ownership of the
itself, to the extent that the information that

appeared in the Claimant's "monthly statement" document, to exclude that
regarding the Other Account” and, furthermore, that “when he received the Transfers of
Complaint and Information Request, Bankinter was able to understand exactly what
happened, undoing the previous misunderstanding and adopted measures to solve the
incidence” (underlining corresponds to the AEPD).

       Therefore, it is considered that the defendant is responsible for the infringement of the
article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, infringement typified in its article 83.5.a) of the aforementioned
regulation.

                                          IV.

       Article 83.5 a) of the GDPR, considers that the infringement of "the principles
principles for treatment, including the conditions for consent under
of articles 5, 6, 7 and 9” is punishable, in accordance with section 5 of the
mentioned article 83 of the aforementioned GDPR, "with administrative fines of €20,000,000
maximum or, in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to 4% as

maximum of the overall annual total turnover of the previous financial year,
opting for the one with the highest amount”.

       The LOPDGDD in its article 72 indicates: "Infractions considered very serious:

       1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and the infractions that
suppose a substantial violation of the articles mentioned in that and, in

particular, the following:

       a) The processing of personal data in violation of the principles and guarantees
       established in article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
       (…)”

                                           V
       Secondly, article 32 of the GDPR "Security of treatment",
states that:

       "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as risks of

variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,

which may include, among others:

       a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/19

       b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
       c) the ability to restore availability and access to data

       quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;
       d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness
       technical and organizational measures to guarantee the safety of the
       treatment.

       2. When evaluating the adequacy of the level of security, particular attention should be paid to
take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data
personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or

unauthorized access to such data.
       3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct pursuant to article 40 or to a

certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the
present article.

       4. The person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to
ensure that any person acting under the authority of the controller or the
manager and has access to personal data can only process such data

following the instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the
Law of the Union or of the Member States”.

                                            SAW

       The violation of article 32 of the GDPR is typified in article
83.4.a) of the aforementioned GDPR in the following terms:

       "4. Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, according to
with paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 10,000,000 or,

in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:

       a) the obligations of the person in charge and the person in charge according to articles 8,

       11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43.
       (…)”

       For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 73, for prescription purposes, qualifies
of "Infringements considered serious":

According to what is established in article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
are considered serious and will prescribe after two years the infractions that suppose a
substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the
following:

       (…)
       g) The breach, as a consequence of the lack of due diligence,
       of the technical and organizational measures that have been implemented in accordance with
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 9/19

       to what is required by article 32.1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679”.
       (…)”

       The facts disclosed in this claim materialize
also in the breach of technical and organizational measures, violating the

data confidentiality.

                                          VII
       1. The GDPR defines personal data breaches as
“all those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or
accidental or illegal alteration of personal data transmitted, stored or processed

otherwise, or unauthorized disclosure of or access to such data.”

       The documentation provided to the file shows that the defendant has
violated article 32 of the GDPR, when a security incident occurred by allowing
access to the claimant to the personal data of a third party, when viewing in their area

personnel from the entity's website the movements of another person's account.

       It should be noted that the GDPR in the aforementioned precept does not establish a list of
the security measures that are applicable according to the data that is
object of treatment, but it establishes that the person in charge and the person in charge of the
treatment will apply technical and organizational measures that are appropriate to the risk

that entails the treatment, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of
application, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, the risks of
probability and seriousness for the rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.

       In addition, security measures must be adequate and
proportionate to the risk detected, noting that the determination of the measures

technical and organizational procedures must be carried out taking into account: pseudonymization and
encryption, the ability to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability and
resiliency, the ability to restore availability and access to data after a
incident, verification process (not audit), evaluation and assessment of the
effectiveness of the measures.

       In any case, when evaluating the adequacy of the security level,
particular account of the risks presented by data processing, such as
consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data
personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data and that could cause damages
physical, material or immaterial.

       In this sense, recital 83 of the GDPR states that:

"(83) In order to maintain security and prevent processing from infringing the provisions of
this Regulation, the controller or processor must assess the risks

inherent to the treatment and apply measures to mitigate them, such as encryption. These
measures must ensure an adequate level of security, including the
confidentiality, taking into account the state of the art and the cost of its application
regarding the risks and nature of the personal data to be
protect yourself. When assessing risk in relation to data security, considerations should be

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/19

take into account the risks arising from the processing of personal data,
such as the destruction, loss or accidental or unlawful alteration of personal data
transmitted, stored or processed in another way, or communication or access not

authorized to said data, susceptible in particular to cause damages
physical, material or immaterial.

       2. In the present case, the defendant has alleged that he has granted a special
relevance to the protection of the confidentiality of the information under its control, for
which has developed codes, policies and procedures aimed at guaranteeing the

protection of said information, listing below a series of measures
implanted, surprising him that the AEPD accused him of a violation of art. 32 GDPR.

       However, such a statement cannot be accepted; it seems obvious that said
incident has occurred, that is, the technical and organizational measures implemented

failed due to a security incident when allowing the visualization by the
claimant of the movements of the account of a third party in his personal area of the
website of the entity, violating the principle of confidentiality.

       In accordance with the proven facts and the documentation contained in the
file, the claimant addressed the defendant by sending him an e-mail on 07/16/2021,

stating that "Yesterday ... I accessed my personal account on the website of
Bankinter in order to consult a payment made last month. I was
reviewing the movements of my account when, what is my surprise to discover that
The movements of another account of which I am not the owner also appear. that other
According to the figure, the account corresponds to a "current or pension account...

       I sense that the person who owns that gold pension account is the person with whom
share the ownership of a payroll account where we deposited our
corresponding payroll (my ex-partner). A possible explanation of these facts, the
more predictable, is that during the steps taken at the time by the office of
Bankinter so that we could put an end to joint ownership of the payroll account and pass

to each have their own payroll account, there was some oversight on the part of the

exactly what happened, adopting measures to solve the incident because the
The claimant in his claim document and in the extracts provided made it clear:
identified the type of account: "That other account, as shown, corresponds to a

account "current gold pension..." and to the owner of the same "I sense that the person who owns
of that gold pension account is the person with whom to share the ownership of a
payroll account where we entered our corresponding payroll (my
ex partner)..,".

       The Supreme Court in a judgment of 02/15/2022 states that: "The obligation to

adopt the necessary measures to guarantee the security of personal data
cannot be considered an obligation of result, which implies that produced a
leaking of personal data to a third party there is responsibility regardless
of the measures adopted and the activity carried out by the person responsible for the file
or the treatment.

       In the obligations of result there is a commitment consisting of the
fulfillment of a certain objective, ensuring the achievement or proposed result,
In this case, guarantee the security of personal data and the absence of
security leaks or breaches.
       In obligations of means, the commitment acquired is to adopt
technical and organizational means, as well as deploy diligent activity in its

implantation and use that tends to achieve the expected result with
that can reasonably be classified as suitable and sufficient for its achievement,
for this reason they are called obligations "of diligence" or "of behavior".
       The difference lies in the responsibility in both cases, because while
that the obligation of result responds to a harmful result due to the failure of the

security system, whatever its cause and the diligence used. In the
obligation of means is enough to establish technically appropriate measures and
implement and use them with reasonable care.
       In the latter, the sufficiency of the security measures that the
responsible has to establish has to be related to the state of technology

at all times and the level of protection required in relation to the data
treated, but a result is not guaranteed.”

       The Court confirms that the design of the technical means is not sufficient
and organizational requirements, since it is also necessary to correctly
implementation and proper use.

       Therefore, the responsibility of the defendant is determined by the incident
of security revealed by the claimant, since he is responsible for taking
decisions aimed at effectively implementing the technical and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk

to ensure the confidentiality of the data, restoring its availability and preventing
access to them in the event of a physical or technical incident. However, from the
documentation provided shows that the entity has not only breached this
obligation, but also the adoption of measures in this regard is unknown, despite
of having given transfer of the claim presented.

       Pursuant to the foregoing, it is estimated that the defendant would be
allegedly responsible for the infringement of the GDPR: the violation of article 32,

necessarily the commission of another or others, only the sanction must be imposed
corresponding to the most serious offense committed".

       However, such argumentation cannot be accepted; the specific standard in
data protection, that is, the GDPR, establishes in its article 83.3 that:

       "3. If a person in charge or a person in charge of the treatment fails to comply

Article 76, "Sanctions and corrective measures", establishes that:

the instruction of the procedure, in order to set the amount of the fine to
