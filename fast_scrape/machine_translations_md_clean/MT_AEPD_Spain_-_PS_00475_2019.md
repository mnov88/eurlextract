## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a sanction procedure started by the AEPD against the defendant due to a complaint submitted by a Spanish citizen stating that he/she had exercised his/her right to erasure over the personal data processed by the defendant, but he/she received a commercial phone call by the defendant afterwards.

### Dispute

The defendant answered to the AEPD investigation requests stating that (i) it never received any exercise of the right by the complainant, (ii) the complainant was not its customer (and so there was no possibility of erasing his/her data), (iii) it answered the complainant by postal mail in that sense, and (iv) that there is no real evidence that it made such commercial phone call to the complainant. The AEPD started the corresponding sanction procedure.

### Holding

Without prejudice to the results of the final investigations corresponding to the sanction procedure, the AEPD understood that the defendant could have infringed the right to erasure of the complainant as per Article 17 GDPR, as well as his/her right as a consumer to refuse unsolicited commercial phone calls, as per Article 21 GDPR in connection with Article 48(1)(b) of the Spanish Telecommunications General Law. Consequently, after considering some aggravating circumstances \[(i) the absence of intentionality but the existence of significant negligence, and (ii) the disclosure of basic personal data\], the AEPD understood that, in case the sanction procedure resulted in a successful decision, this infringement would be fined with 5,000 € to the defendant. In this sense, the AEPD offered the defendant the possibility to settle the issue before the decision takes place by agreeing to a voluntary payment of part of the fine with two possible discounts: (i) early voluntary payment (4,000 €) and acknowledging of its liability (3,000 €). The defendant only agreed to the early voluntary payment but it did not acknowledge its liability, so it paid 4,000 € and the sanction procedure was closed by the AEPD.
