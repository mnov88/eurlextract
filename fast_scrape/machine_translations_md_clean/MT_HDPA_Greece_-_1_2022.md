## English Summary

### Facts

In 2019 a data subject submitted a complaint to the Hellenic DPA (HDPA) against a Greek company "Egnatia Odos S.A." for its refusal to provide the complainant with a photographic material and a copy from a Book of Recorded Events in relation to a non-payment of a toll fee they were charged with.

The company stated that it was unable to provide such information to third parties without any procedural order. The HDPA informed the company that according to [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR"), the data subject has the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her is being processed. The HDPA also noted that, the controller had a time limit in order to respond to the data subject's request according to Article 12(3) GDPR.

The company then only provided the claimant with a copy of the Book of the Recorded Events, since the photographic material of that day did not exist because of a technical problem.

The HDPA called the company to express its opinions concerning the incident. The company stated that it had communicated constantly with the data subject, and had sent them the copy from the Book of the Recorded Events which according to them was sufficient in order to prove a violation of a toll fee payment.

### Holding

The HDPA held that the company not only refused to answer the data subject's request, but also tried to mislead the subject by stating that it was not required to provide data to third parties without a procedural order.

The HDPA held that it had previously informed the company about its right of access obligations in a recommendation regarding a similar incident that took place before the GDPR entered into force, and that these requirements had not changed substantially since the GDPR entered into force.

The HDPA also highlighted that the data subject should have not be considered a third party, and that under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") it is irrelevant for what purpose the subject exercises the right of access, as this provision doesn't lay down any conditions in this regard.

The HDPA fined the company €1000 for violations of [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and [Article 12(3)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR") by not granting the data subject their right of access in due time.
