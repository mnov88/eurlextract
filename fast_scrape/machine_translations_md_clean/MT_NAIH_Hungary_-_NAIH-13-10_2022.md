## English Summary

### Facts

On 7 June 2021, the data subject filed a complaint with the DPA, as they became aware that the data controller – the Family Counselling and Child Protection Centre of Budapest, District III (Óbuda) – forwarded an audio recording of domestic violence (abuse) to the competent Child Welfare Centre, and this recording also contained the voice of the data subject. The recording was originally made and sent by the data subject’s estranged wife.

On 14 June 2021, the data subject exercised their right of access with the controller in person. As the audio material was not made available during the visit, the data subject requested it to be sent via e-mail. The controller refused to provide the file despite multiple further requests by the data subject.

However, in a letter dated 1 July 2021, the controller informed the data subject that the audio material requested by him was not physically part of the file, but it was available in file format. The audio material was then sent electronically to the competent Child Welfare Centre and subsequently deleted. The data subject therefore requested the DPA to declare that the controller unlawfully processed and transmitted their personal data to the Child Welfare Centre and that it unlawfully refused him request for access.

In its reply to the DPA, the controller stated that it stored the audio recording. Allegedly, the complete file was transferred to the Child Welfare Centre pursuant to [Article 6(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1e "Article 6 GDPR"). The controller also stated that it subsequently considered the storage and transmission of the audio recording to be an error, and therefore took immediate action to delete the e-mail containing the audio recording.

In relation to the data subject's requests for a copy of the audio recording, the controller stated that on 17 and 18 June 2021, it wrongly refused to disclose the audio recording. The controller contemplated at first that it was not competent to process the information of the data subject and because if that, it was transferred to the Child Welfare Centre. As for the audio recording, the controller instead found that it was not entitled to process the audio recording is and therefore deleted it based on [Article 5(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1b "Article 5 GDPR").

### Holding

The DPA stated that an audio recording containing the voice of the estranged wife and the voice of the data subject is considered to be personal data shared between the data subject and the estranged wife.

The DPA further stated that the controller, as a family and child welfare centre, performs a public task related to the protection of children. Therefore, it is entitled to process the data of parents in relation to the upbringing of children. As the audio recording submitted as evidence by one of the parents in the guardianship proceedings is part of the file, the DPA considered that the data controller's processing was lawful. Therefore, the DPA rejected the part of the complaint seeking a redress for the unlawful transfer.

However, in the DPA's view, following the transfer of the file on 17 June 2021, the further processing of this audio recording by the controller became unnecessary due to lack of competence. By failing to take action after the transfer, the controller unlawfully processed the audio recording in the period between the transfer of the file and the deletion of the audio recording on 2 July 2021. The controller thereby infringed [Articles 5(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1b "Article 5 GDPR") and [6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR").

The DPA further emphasised that the controller wrongly claimed that the audio recording was not part of the file, i.e. that it had not acted fairly, thus infringing [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR") on transparent and fair processing. The DPA considered the non-disclosure of personal data to be such a serious infringement that it was justified to publish the present decision with the name of the controller included.

However, the DPA also took into consideration several mitigating factors, such as that the controller provides social and child welfare services for persons in need. It also took into account that the controller itself admitted that it had wrongly claimed that the audio recording was not part of the file. For these reasons, the DPA decided not to impose a fine and to issue a warning.

ARC. Decision

The Applicant requested that the Authority establish that the Respondent handled it without authorization and

forwarded his personal data to the Children's Welfare Center and unlawfully refused
your access request.

IV.1. The legality of the handling and transmission of the audio recording

                                                  8IV.1.1. According to Article 4, point 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation, it is the voice of a natural person
personal data, the transmission and storage of the audio file containing the audio recording is the general rule
according to article 4, point 2 of the data protection decree, it is considered data management.

According to the document attached by the Applicant, on May 19, 2021, he registered the \[…\]
sent by email on May 14, 2021, entitled "support of abuse.mp3"
audio file. The audio recording containing the voice of the victim and the Applicant is the Applicant and the
it is classified as the shared personal data of the victim.

The Applicant, as a family and child welfare center, within the framework of child protection care
performs a public task related to the protection of children related to official measures,
during which the Gyvt. On the basis of § 135, subsection (2), point b), parents are entitled to raise children

to manage your related data, especially regarding your lifestyle and educational behavior.

The Respondent later considered that the handling of the audio recording was illegal, as Gyvt.
according to or other official procedure was not necessary.

Because in the guardianship proceedings, or for the purpose of initiating the guardianship proceedings, one of the parents
the audio recording submitted as evidence by - in the same way as the document or the statement - the document material

are part of, therefore the Data processing of the Respondent was lawful according to the Authority.

Based on the above, the Authority determined that the child was the Applicant of the audio file
handled it in the course of fulfilling its public duty related to the investigation of the causes of its endangerment,
and it was forwarded as part of the documents by the competent Children's Welfare Center
for, therefore the Respondent did not violate Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
paragraph, since for its management until the existence of its competence, after that
according to Article 6 (1) point (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation

had a legal basis. For this reason, the Authority rejects the request for unlawful data transmission
rejected the directed part.

According to the Authority's point of view, after the transfer of the documents on June 17, 2021, jurisdiction
in its absence, the further processing of this audio recording by the Requested has become pointless, therefore, because of the transmission
did not take action until July 1, 2021, or until July 2, 2021, the Applicant's personal
audio recording containing your data between the transfer of the documents and the deletion of the audio recording on July 2, 2021

handled it without authorization during the period, thereby violating Article 5 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
b) and Article 6 (1). For this reason, the Authority considers the request illegal
approved the part aimed at establishing data management.

for the legality of data management. According to Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation,

meets the legal requirements for data management, if it is able to fulfill its obligation to certify this
to do, and provides sufficient certainty for the Authority, the trial court, and also for the data subject
able to demonstrate the existence of these conditions.

It follows that if the data controller cannot prove that the data subject has objected

its data management would have met the data protection requirements during the examined period, it does not
fulfills the basic requirement of accountability, thereby violating general data protection
Article 5 (2) of the Decree. For data controllers, it is from the planning of data management

                                                  9 from the start of data processing until the deletion of personal data
they must perform an operation in such a way that they can prove how they answered at any moment
and data protection regulations. The principle of accountability is, therefore, not just a process in general
can be interpreted at the level, all specific data management activities, a specific stakeholder
also applies to the management of your personal data.

Since the purpose of the data management has ceased, the Requested party is justified in deleting the audio material
performed, but during the procedure he was unable to properly confirm the date of deletion to the Authority,
because he attached to the Authority a protocol prepared after the Authority's inquiry,
in which you have marked a delete date when the audio file has not actually been transmitted by the
For the Child Welfare Center. Taking this into account, the Authority ex officio established that a
With this behavior, the respondent violated Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
