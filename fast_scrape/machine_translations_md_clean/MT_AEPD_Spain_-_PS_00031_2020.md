## English Summary

### Facts

The company called the complainant offering them a deal on hotels; they claimed to have obtained the complainant's telephone number and consent to call the complainant by contacting a friend of the complainant via Whatsapp. The consent of the complainant themselves had not been obtained. The complainant then objected to the contact made by the company and no further contact was made.

### Dispute

Was the company in breach of any data protection laws?

### Holding

In its decision, the AEPD held that the company had violated a provision in Spanish law, Article 48(1)(b) of the 2014 Telecommunications Law (Ley 9/2014 General de Telecomunicaciones). The fine was issued on this basis. However, the AEPD also noted that the complainant had a right to object to processing for marketing purposes under Article 21 GDPR. Despite no further contact being made the company, the AEPD still fined the company for the initial establishment of contact, which took place without the complainant's consent. The fine was initially €1500, but was reduced €1200 of the basis of the company's voluntary early payment of a fine. Under Spanish law, such a payment entails the waiver of any action or appeal in administrative proceedings against the sanction.
