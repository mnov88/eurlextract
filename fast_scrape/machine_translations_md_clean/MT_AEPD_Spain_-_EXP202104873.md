## English Summary

### Facts

Two customers of INDECEMI (the controller) were separately involved in a customer complaint procedure through the controller's website. At some point, they received an email addressed to them containing personal data of the other customer (name, surname, national identification number, address, telephone, and email address). One the customers (the data subject) reported this incident to the controller. Additionally, the data subject complained about this occurrence to the Spanish DPA.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA first noted that the controller was processing personal data in accordance with [Article 4(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR "Article 4 GDPR") by the collection, registration, use, etc. of personal information of natural persons, such as, name, identification number, number, phone number, email address etc.

Further, the DPA held that the data subject's personal data were improperly disclosed to another customer by the controller. Consequently, the DPA found a violation of the principle of confidentiality under [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR").

The DPA stated that the existence of a security breach does not automatically imply the imposition of a fine, but requires an analysis of the due diligence of managers and security measures applied. In this case, the complaint forms were mishandled while no evidence existed of appropriate security measures taken by the controller. Hence, the DPA held that [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") was also violated.

The DPA imposed a €3,000 fine for the infringement of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and a €2,000 fine for violation of [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). The DPA took into account mitigating circumstances, such as the fact that only two persons were affected by the confidentiality breach and that the controller, as a small business owner, did not handle vast amounts of personal data.

consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data

personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or
unauthorized access to such data.

3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct pursuant to article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element
