## English Summary

### Facts

A company selling furniture with its main establishment in France undertook an investigation by the French DPA. The investigation was performed both online and on-site. It revealed that the company had no data retention procedures in place, and that personal data was not regularly deleted or archived. The investigation also revealed that the company did not provide its customers with information about the legal basis for processing, nor about the data retention period. Lastly, the investigation revealed that customer accounts belonging to data subjects who had requested data erasure, had in fact not been deleted but instead simply deactivated.

The French DPA, acting as lead supervisory authority, sent a draft order to the other supervisory authorities involved. The Berlin supervisory authority objected in accordance with [article 60(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_60_GDPR "Article 60 GDPR") and requested that the draft order be turned into a draft penalty, and more specifically an administrative fine. The furniture company contested this objection, arguing that the company had very few sales in Germany.

### Holding

The French DPA first held that the Berlin DPA's objections to the draft decision had been reasonable, and that the number of sales in Germany was irrelevant under Chapter VII GDPR. The French DPA amended its original draft to a draft penalty.

The French DPA subsequently held that the lack of an implemented data retention procedure constituted a breach of [article 5(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"). The lack of information about the legal basis date retention procedures provided in the online store constituted a breach of [article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). The DPA noted that the link between these two breaches did not prevent them from being sanctioned as separate breaches.

The DPA furthermore held that the obligation to comply with requests for erasure under [article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR") had been breached.

The DPA imposed an administrative fine of EUR 120,000.

    -

with             addressing the session last.

The Restricted Committee adopted the following decision:

    I. Facts and proceedings, 1.             (hereinafter “the company”) is a public limited company with a Board of Directors
    and with share capital of            located at                                                Its

    main activity is the sale of furniture on the Internet and in store.

 2.             started its business in 2007 and has approximately           employees. In 2020, it

    generated turnover of               with a net loss of            .

 3.             markets its products in France and several European Union countries from the

    website“                     ” (hereinafter “the website”). It alsohas twostores inFranceowned
    by its subsidiary,

 4. Pursuant to Decision No. 2019-084C dated 24 April 2019 of the Chairman of the Commission
    nationale de l’informatique et des libertés (hereinafter “CNIL” or “the Authority”), a CNIL
    team carried out an online investigation into the processing accessible from the domain

                        on 9 May 2019, and an on-site investigation at               on 5 June 2019.
    The purpose of these investigations was to verify the company’s compliance with all the
    provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27

    April 2016 (hereinafter “the Regulation” or “GDPR”) and with amended Act No. 78-17 of 6
    January 1978 on data protection (hereinafter “the amended Act of 6 January 1978” or “the
    French Data Protection Act”).

 5. In particular, the investigations focused on the processing of personal data of the company’s
    customers and prospective customers. The checks performed concerned the retention periods
    of the personal data, the information brought to the attention of the data subjects concerning the

    processing carried out by the company, compliance with data subjects’ requests for erasure of
    their data, the obligation to provide a legal act for the processing operations carried out on
    behalf of the data controller as well as the obligation to ensure data security.

6. At the end of the checks, report no. 2019-084/1 and no. 2019-084/2 were notified to
    in two letters dated 15 May and 11 June 2019. The company sent the Authority the additional

    documents requested at the end of the investigation by email on 12 June 2019.

7. By email of 22 August 2019, the company sent the investigation team several additional
    documents, relating in particular to the change in the company’s name, the privacy policy

    displayed in store or in emails sent at the time of the creation of a user account.

8. As the investigations establishedthe cross-border nature of the processing concerned, the CNIL

    informed all European supervisory authorities on 1 July 2020, in accordance with Article 56 of
    the GDPR, of its competence to act as lead supervisory authority. Seven authorities declared
    themselves involved in this procedure, within the meaning of Article 4 (22) of the GDPR.

9. On 5 October 2020, the CNIL Chairman submitted a draft order to the seven authorities
    concerned. Following this communication, the Berlin authority raised a relevant and reasoned,      objection within the meaning of Article 60 of the GDPR, requesting that the draft order be
      transformed into a draft penalty, and more specifically an administrative fine. In support of this
      request, the authority concerned pointed out, in particular, the number of data subjects and the

      duration of the violations.

10. In order to examine these elements, the Authority’s Chairman appointed

                     as rapporteur on 12 April 2021, pursuant to Article 39 of Decree No. 2019-536
      of 29 May 2019 implementing the amended Act of 6 January 1978 (hereinafter the “Decree of
      29 May 2019”).

11. At the end of his investigation, on 7 July2021, the rapporteur sent               a report detailing
      the breaches of the GDPR that he considered to have occurred in this case and indicating to the

      companythat,inviewofthesummerbreak,it hadanadditionalperiodtothe onemonthinitially
      provided for in which to submit its written observations pursuant to the provisions of Article
      40 of the Decree of 29 May 2019. It was also given a letter informing it that the case file was

      on the agenda of the Restricted Committee of 16 September 2021.

12. This report proposed to the Authority’s Restricted Committee to impose an injunction to make
      the processingcompliant with theprovisions ofArticles 5(1)(e),13, 17, 28and32 of the GDPR,

      accompanied by a penalty per day of delay at the end of a three-month period following
      notification of the Restricted Committee’s decision, as well as an administrative fine. It also
      proposed that this decision be made public and that the company no longer be identifiable by

      name upon expiry of a two-year period following its publication.

13. On 3 September 2021, the company submitted observations through its counsel.

14. The company and the rapporteur presented oral observations at the Restricted Committee’s
      session.

          II.    Reasons for the decision

15. According to Article 56(1) of the Regulation “the supervisory authority of the main
      establishment or sole establishment of the controller or processor shall be competent to act as
      lead supervisory authority regarding the cross-border processing carried out by that controller

      or processor, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 60”.

 16. In this case, the Restricted Committee found, firstly, that the company’s registered office has

      been in France since the creation of the company in 2007, that the company has been entered
      in the Trade and Companies Register in France since its inception and that it does not have any
      other establishment in the EU.

 17. It follows from the above that the CNIL is competent to act as the lead supervisory authority
      for the cross-border processingimplemented bythis company, in accordance with Article 56(1)
      of the Regulation., 18. In accordance with the cooperation and consistency mechanism provided for in Chapter VII of
      the GDPR, on 1 July 2020, CNIL informed all European supervisory authorities of its

      competence to act as the lead supervisory authority concerning the cross-border processing
      carried out by the company, thus opening the notification procedure for the relevant authorities
      in this case.

 19. The supervisory authorities of the following countries were affected by this procedure:
      Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

 20. Pursuant to Article 60(5) of the GDPR, the revised draft decision adopted by the restricted
      formation was transmitted to these supervisory authorities on 15 December 2021.

 21. On 29 December 2021, none of the supervisory authorities concerned had raised any relevant
      and reasoned objections to the draft decision, so that, pursuant to Article 60(6) of the GDPR,
      they are deemed to have approved it.

     A. Regarding the proceedings

 22. In defence, the company contests the objection made by the Berlin supervisory authority to the
      CNIL’s draft order, by which the authority requested the company be given an administrative
      fine. The company considers that it should have been the subject of an order, as initially

      proposed by the CNIL, and not penalty proceedings before the Restricted Committee.

 23. In particular, the company expresses its surprise at the importance given to Berlin’s objection,
      while the sales made bythe companyin Germany only represented 3.7% of its turnover in 2020

      with a German customer base of 11,168 customers.

 24. The Restricted Committee notes first of all that, as part of the cooperation process set up by the
      GDPR, all supervisory authorities concerned within the meaning of Article 4(22) of the GDPR
      may issue relevant and reasoned objections to the draft decision submitted to them by the lead

      supervisory authority. It is then the responsibility of the lead supervisory authority to decide
      whether to uphold or reject the objections made, which was done in this case by the CNIL’s
      Chairman, in accordance with the provisions of Article 52 of Decree No. 2019-536 of 29 May
      2019.

25.   The Restricted Committee then notes that the criteria for determining whether a supervisory
      authority is concerned are set out in Article 4(22) of the GDPR and that, therefore, the turnover
      of a company in a Member State of the European Union or the number of customers concerned
      are irrelevant, provided that these criteria are met, which is the case here.

 26. In addition, while indicating that the assessment of the follow-up given to the objection made
      by Berlin’s supervisoryauthoritywas the responsibilityof the CNIL’s Chairman, the Restricted
      Committee emphasises that this objection was part of the cooperation and consistency

      mechanism provided for in Chapter VII of the GDPR intended to ensure harmonisation of the
      implementation of this regulation, in particular regarding the application of supervisory
      authorities’ enforcement policy.,27. Finally, the RestrictedCommitteenotes that,with regardtotheobjectionrelatingto the absence
      of a prior order, the Conseil d’Etat ruled (EC, 9 October 2020, SERGIC, no. 433311) that it
      “clearly emerges \[from the provisions of Article 20 of the amended Act of 6 January 1978\], that

      the imposition of a penalty by the CNIL’s Restricted Committee is not subject to CNIL’s
      Chairman giving the data controller or its data processor a prior order. \[…\]”.

28. In light of these elements, the Restricted Committee considers that the CNIL has complied with

      the procedure applicable under the national provisions and the GDPR.

    B. Regarding the breach of the obligation to specify and comply with a personal data
        retention period in proportion to the purpose of the processing in accordance with
        Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR

29. According to Article 5(1)(e) of the Regulation, personal data must be “kept in a form which

      permits identificationofdata subjects for nolongerthanis necessary for thepurposes for which
      the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the
      personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
      or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject

      to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this
      Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (“storage
      limitation”)”.

30. The rapporteur noted that during the on-site investigation of 5 June 2019, the company had
      indicated to the investigation team that no retention period for personal data of customers (who
      are according to the company the persons who have created an account and placed an order) or
      prospective customers (who are according to the company the persons who contact
      in order to obtain information on the products and services offered and who subscribe to the

      newsletter) had been determined or implemented by the company. The company also informed
      the investigation team that it did not carry out any regular deletion or archiving of such data at
      the end of a defined period, thereby retaining it in an active database, while its processing was
      no longer necessary in view of the purpose for which it was initially collected.

31. In defence, in its observations of 3 September 2021, the company firstly argued that a data
      retention period policy applicable to customers and prospective customers was defined from
      the on-site investigation on 5 June 2019, so that it could not be accused of any breach under the
      definition of retention periods. However, it admits that at the time of the investigation there was

      no functionality to determine the date of a user’s or prospective user’s last activity on their
      account and that this element was therefore not taken into account.

32. The company also indicated that the data of customers and prospective customers used for the

      purposes of marketing or managing their account was now stored in the active database until
      their account is deleted or, in the event of inactivity, for three years from the last time they
      signed into their account, their last contact with the company or their last order online or in
      store. At the end of those periods, the company specified that only the data necessary for pre-
      litigation or litigation purposes is retained and archived until the date corresponding to the

      statutory time limit justifying their retention, after which they would be deleted.,33. According to the Restricted Committee, with regard to the definition of retention periods
      applicable to the data of             s customers and prospective customers, it should first be
      noted that on the date of the investigation of 5 June 2019, the company indicated to the
      investigation team that it had not determined and implemented any retention period for the

      personal data of customers and prospective customers.

34. The Restricted Committee then notes that the investigation team observed the presence, in an
      active database, of personal data of 550,645 customer accounts created since the start of the

      business in 2007. The company informed the investigation team that it kept in a database the
      personal data for 310,198 user accounts created without any order having been placed for more
      than three years or relating to 128,712 user accounts created but not having placed an order
      since 2007.

35. Therefore, whereas the Restricted Committee notes that                  now implements retention
      periods, compliance with which makes it possible to comply with the provisions of Article
      5(1)(e) of the GDPR – by ensuring that the data is not stored for longer than necessary in view
      of the purposes for which it is processed – it considers, in any event, that on the day of the

      investigation, the company had not defined and implemented any satisfactory retention period
      policy, or data deletion procedure at the end of the period for which the processing of the data
      was necessary and justified, or even an archiving procedure, and that it therefore kept personal
      data for excessive periods.

36. With regard to all of these elements, the Restricted Committee considers that the breach of
      Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR is established.

37. It points out, however, that the changes made by the company during the penalty proceedings

      enabled its compliance with the Regulations.

    C. Regarding the breach of the obligation to inform individuals pursuant to Article 13 of
        the GDPR

38. Article 13 of the GDPR requires the data controller to provide, at the time the data is collected,
      informationonits identityand contact details andthat of its data protectionofficer, thepurposes
      and legal basis of the processing, the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data,

      information on transfers of personal data where applicable, the retention period of the personal
      data, the rights of individuals and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

39. The rapporteur notes that, during the checks carried out online on 9 May 2019 and then on site
      on 5 June 2019, the investigation team found that the information made available to users of
      the website and customers, during their visit to the store, was not complete within the meaning

      of Article 13 of the Regulation. Certain mandatory information provided for by this Article –
      namely the legal bases for processing and the data retention periods – was not brought to the
      attention of the data subjects on the                     website or in store, either through the

      “Privacy Policy” on the website or the document entitled “Privacy and protection of personal
      data collected in store” placed on the store’s sales counter.,40.   In its observations in defence, the company did not dispute that no information on the legal
      bases was made available to the data subjects in its privacy policy. However, it argued that the
      document entitled “Privacy and protection of personal data collected in store” placed on the

      store’s sales counter did not contain information on the legal bases of processing because its
      “purpose was togivethemain information” whilereferringtotheamendedprivacypolicymade
      available on the                      website, which constitutes additional information and is

      more complete. The company also argued that the lack of information related to data retention
      periods was only a repeat of the breach of the principle of limiting retention periods.

 41. The company added that it had drafted, as part of the proceedings, a new privacy policy which
      now includes all the missing information, and which has been made available on the
                    website in order to provide information that complies with the requirements of the

      GDPR.

 42. The Restricted Committee first of all notes that, with regard to information relating to the legal
      bases, the company acknowledged that such information was not present in the privacy policy

      accessible from the                 website and to which the information document on data
      protection, located in the store, refers as stated by the investigation team.

 43. The Restricted Committee also notes that, until the penalty proceedings, the data subjects were
      not informed of all the legal bases of the processing carried out, in breach of the provisions of
      Article 13 of the GDPR.

 44. The Restricted Committee then notes that the investigation team found, during the investigation
      of 5 June 2019, that the information on retention periods was not included in the privacypolicy.

      The company also acknowledged this specifying that the information was incomplete due to no
      definition and implementation of a personal data retention period policy.

 45. Under such circumstances, the Restricted Committee considers that the breach of Article 13 of
      the GDPR is established on this point, since the information on the retention periods is among
      the information that must be communicated, in that it makes it possible to guarantee fair and

      transparent processing of the personal data concerned. Thus, for example, information on
      retention periods allows data subjects to know how long the data is kept by the controller and,
      consequently, for how long they can exercise their right of access.

 46. The Restricted Committee also considers that the link between the company’s failure to
      implement data retention periods and the lack of information for individuals does not prevent
      these two breaches existing as such.

 47. In light of the above, the Restricted Committeeconsiders that the companydid not complywith
      the provisions of Article 13 of the GDPR.

 48. The Restricted Committee nevertheless notes that, as part of the penalty proceedings, the
      company demonstrated having made its privacy policy compliant, which now contains the,      notices concerning retention periods for the data processed and complete information on the
      legal bases of the processing, to which the information document displayed in store refers.

  D. Regarding the breach of the obligation to comply with requests to delete personal data
      pursuant to Article 17 of the GDPR

49. Under Article 17 of the GDPR, the data subject has the right to “obtain from the controller the
      erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall

      be obliged to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds
      applies:
      a) the personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or
      otherwise processed;

      b) the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a)

      of Article 6(1) (...) and where there is no other legal ground for the processing;
      c) the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no

      overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing
      pursuant to Article 21(2) (...)”.

50.   The rapporteur notes that during the investigation on 5 June 2019, the investigation team was
      informed that when an individual requests the deletion of their account, the company
      deactivates the account in question, preventing the individual from logging in and blocking the

      sending of marketing messages. The team thus noted the presence in the database of the
      personal data of a customer of the company who had previously made a request by email for
      deletion. Access to their account had simply been disabled.

  51. In defence, the company first demonstrated the deletion of the data of the customer who had
        exercised their right to erasure of data after the CNIL’s investigation. It then stated that it had

        taken various measures to improve its internal procedure for managing requests to exercise
        rights, by centralising the receipt of requests, by putting a form for exercising rights online
        andbycreatingtheemail address “dp                     ”,dedicatedtoquestionsaboutpersonal

        data and managed by the company’s data protection officer. In addition, the company
        indicated that it had developed a document containing letter templates for responding to
        requests to exercise rights, including a letter for responding to requests for erasure.

  52. The Restricted Committee notes that at the time of the investigation of 5 June 2019, when a
        request for deletion was sent to it, the company simply deactivated the account of the data
        subject without deleting their personal data, namely their surname, first name, email address,

        postal address and telephone number, which was actually observed by the CNIL’s team
        during the checks.

  53. However, the Restricted Committee notes that when a person requests the erasure of their
        personal data, the data controller or its data processor must, in principle, actually delete the
        data once the conditions set out in Article 17 of the GDPR are met.,54. The Restricted Committee considers that whereas, after a request for deletion, certain
      personal data of customers may be kept in intermediate storage for specific purposes, in
      particular for legal obligations or evidential purposes or when the company has an overriding

      legitimate ground, that which is not necessary in order to comply with such obligations or
      purposes must be deleted after the exercise of this right, provided that the conditions laid
      down in Article 17 of the GDPR are met.

55. In view of the foregoing, the Restricted Committee considers that the breach of Article 17 of
      the GDPR is established.

56. However, it notes that, as part of the penalty proceedings, the company has demonstrated
      having taken measures to ensure compliance with this regulation.

  E. Regarding the failure to provide a legal act for the processing operations carried out on
     behalf of the data controller pursuant to Article 28 of the GDPR

57. Article 28 of the Regulation provides that the processing carried out by a data processor on

      behalf of a controller is governed by a contract which defines the subject-matter and duration
      of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data, the
      categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. This contract also

      provides for the conditions under which the data processor shall carry out the processing
      operations on behalf of the data controller.

58. The rapporteur notes that, regarding the relations with its processors, the company sent two
      quotes countersigned with                  whichdid not containanyof the clauses laiddown
      in Article 28 of the GDPR and did not provide any legal act to govern its processing

      relationship with                   .

59. In defence, the company disputes these facts, and indicates that an agreement relating to the

      data processing had been signed by                  on 17 April 2018, but that it had not been
      sent to the investigation team due to the inaccurate nature of its request for supporting
      documents made in the on-site investigation report. The company acknowledges the absence
      of an act to govern its relationship with                  .

60. The Restricted Committee notes that the data controller and the processor must enter into a
      contract which includes all the mandatory information laid down in Article 28 of the GDPR

      in order to organise their respective relationships and data protection obligations.

61. In this case, the Restricted Committee notes that the processing relationship with

                      was governed by a legal act at the time of the investigation carried out on 5
      June 2019, under the provisions of Article 28 of the GDPR. However, on the day of the
      investigation, the processing relationship with                        - which collects and

      records, on behalf of             , customer data for the purposes of creating a customer
      account at the time of their visit to the store - was not governed by any legal act.,62. The Restricted Committee therefore considers that on the dayof the investigation, the breach
      relating to Article 28 is established as regards the processingrelationship between
      and                     due to the absence of a contract specifying in particular the data

      controller’s rights and obligations and the conditions under which the data processor should
      carry out the processing operations on behalf of the data controller.

63. It nevertheless highlights that, as part of the penalty proceedings, the company provided
      evidenceofaprocessingagreementsignedwith                          on26August 2021, which
      meets the requirements of Article 28 of the GDPR.

  F. Regarding the breach of the obligation to ensure the security of personal data pursuant

     to Article 32 of the GDPR

64. Under Article 32 of the GDPR: “1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of

      implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk
      of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the
      controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational

      measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as
      appropriate:
      a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;

      b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of
      processing systems and services;

      c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in

      the event of a physical or technical incident;

      d)a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and
      organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing\[…\]”.

65. Firstly, the rapporteur notes that at the time of the online investigation carried out on 9 May

      2019, authentication when creating a customer account on the                         website
      was based on a password composed only of a single numeric character, such as “1”, without
      any criteria for the complexity of the password being provided.

66. In defence, the company does not dispute these facts, but maintains that the security
      obligation resulting from Article 32 of the GDPR is a best efforts obligation, not a

      performance obligation, so the controller’s security obligation is to implement measures to
      reduce risks to an acceptable level, without it being compulsory, or even possible, to obtain
      a level of security so that the risks have no effect. The company also emphasises that the

      assessment of compliance with the security obligation by the controller requires
      consideration of the impact on the data subjects and its severity according to the categories
      of personal data concerned by the processing. It argues that, in the course of its business, it

      only collected and processed standard personal data, without any serious impact for the data
      subjects.,67. The Restricted Committee considers that the length and complexity of a password remain
      basic criteria for assessing its strength. It noted in this respect that the need for a strong
      password is also highlighted by ANSSI.

68. For the sake of clarity, the Restricted Committee notes that in order to ensure a sufficient
      level of security and satisfy the password strength requirements, when authentication relies

      solely on an identifier and password, the CNIL recommends, in its Decision No. 2017-012
      of 19 January2017, that the password have at least twelve characters - containing at least one
      upper-case letter, one lower-case letter, one number and one special character - or at least

      eight characters - containing three of these four characters - if it is accompanied by an
      additional measure such as, for example, the timing of access to the account after several
      failures (temporary suspension of access, the duration of which increases as attempts are

      made), setting up a mechanism to guard against automated and multiple attempts (e.g. a
      “captcha”) and/or locking the account after several failed login attempts.

69. Inthis case,the RestrictedCommitteeconsiders that,in viewof the rules governingpassword

      composition, the strength of the passwords accepted by the company - containing one single
      number, such as “1”, with no criteria for the complexity of the password being provided -
      was too weak, risking the related accounts and personal data they contain being

      compromised.

70. The Restricted Committeealso considers that thelackof collectionof so-calledsensitivedata

      by the company, which indicates only collecting identifying or contact data, does not prevent
      the occurrence of malicious acts such as phishing, which is mainly based on the use of
      accurate and directly identifying data in order to create confusion for the user who is the
      subject of it.

71. In these circumstances, the Restricted Committee considers that the respondent company’s
      password management policy was not sufficiently robust and binding to ensure data security
      within the meaning of Article 32 of the GDPR.

72. However, it notes that, in the course of the penalty proceedings, the company indicated that,
      with regard to user accounts, it now requires a strong password comprising a minimum of

      twelve characters, including at least one upper-case letter, one lower-case letter, one numeric
      character and one special character, which was corroborated by supporting documents.

73. Secondly, the rapporteur notes that the hash function used for the storage of account
      passwords of customers using the                      website was obsolete (MD5).

74. In defence, the company does not dispute these facts.

75. The Restricted Committee emphasises that since the algorithm of this hash function is
      obsolete and has for a long time had well-known vulnerabilities, making it liable to be easily

      “broken”, this hash function no longer guarantees the integrity and confidentiality of
      passwords in the event of a brute force attack after compromise of the servers hosting them.
      Thus, the use of this algorithm would allow a person with knowledge of the hashed password,      to decrypt it without difficulty in a very short time (e.g. by means of freely accessible
      websites that allow the value corresponding to the password hash to be retrieved).

76. In these circumstances, in view of the risks incurred by the individuals mentioned above, the
      Restricted Committee considers that the hash function used by the company did not make it
      possible to guarantee the securityof the data of its 550,000 customers, within the meaning of

      Article 32 of the GDPR.

77. However, it notes that, as part of the penalty proceedings, the company demonstrated having

      implemented a satisfactory hashing function, in BCRYPT, for all customers’ account
      passwords.

78. Thirdly, the rapporteur notes that the company’s employees accessed the “read/write”

      version of            ’s database via a joint account for four employees, which is not a
      satisfactory measure to ensure data security.

79. In defence, the company argues that the rapporteur did not take into account the complexity
      of the password kept secret between the four employees authorised to access the “read/write”
      version of the database, nor of the authentication system based on the network addresses

      allowing for traceability of the access and actions of these four authorised employees.

80. The Restricted Committee notes that assigning a unique identifier per user and prohibiting

      shared accounts are among the essential precautions to guarantee effective traceability of
      access to a database. It also emphasises that the use of shared access by several people does
      not make it possible to accurately attribute the actions carried out on the equipment in the

      event of simultaneous login-in, complicating for example audits of the use of the shared
      account. In this sense, ANSI recommends using, by default, individual administration
      accounts and specifies that generic accounts on the equipment should not be used, or then
      exceptionally and restricted to a very limited number of administrators, since only the

      creation of individual accounts allows for the implementation of a relevant access control
      and the attribution of the actions carried out by each of the administrators.

81. In this case, the sharing of the account allowing access to the “read/write” version of the
      database by four employees does not make it possible to guarantee proper authentication of
      users and, consequently, effective management of accreditations and proper traceability of

      access. The Restricted Committee observes that, for example, in the event of deletion or
      modification of data in the database, it would be complicated to attribute responsibility to
      one of the four authorised individuals if several of them were connected at the same time to

      this generic account.

82. Therefore, such a lack of traceability of access does not allow for the identification of
      fraudulent access or of the individual causing the deterioration or deletion of personal data.

83. In these circumstances, the Restricted Committee considers that the use of a joint account
      shared by four employees does not guarantee data security within the meaning of Article 32
      of the GDPR.,84. It notes, however, that the company justified, during the proceedings, having set up a single
      sign-on system for each user from the creation of individual accounts for access to the

      database in order to ensure more detailed traceability of database access.

85. In view of all the above elements, the Restricted Committee considers that the breach of
      Article 32 of the GDPR is established.

86. However, the Restricted Committee notes that, as part of the penalty proceedings, the
      company has demonstrated having taken all measures to ensure compliance with this

      regulation.

       III.    Regarding corrective powers and their publication

87. Under the terms of Article 20 III of the amended Act of 6 January 1978:

     “When the controller or its processor fails to comply with the obligations resulting from
     Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or this law, the chairman of the CNIL may also,
     if applicable, after sending the warning provided for in point I of this article or, where

     applicable,inadditionto anorderprovidedforinII,contacttheCNIL’sRestrictedCommittee
     with a view to the announcement, after adversarial proceedings, of one or more of the
     following measures: \[…\]

     2. An injunction to make the processing compliant with the obligations resulting from
     Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 or this law or to comply with the requests made
     by the data subject to exercise their rights, which may be accompanied, except in cases where
     the processing is implemented by the State, with a penalty fine not exceeding 100,000 euros

     per day of delay from the date fixed by the Restricted Committee; \[…\]
     7. With the exception of cases where the processing is implemented by the State, an
     administrative fine may not exceed 10 million euros or, in the case of a company, 2% of the

     total annual global turnover of the previous financial year, whichever is the greater. In the
     cases mentioned in 5 and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, these
     upper limits shall be increased, respectively, to 20 million euros and 4% of the turnover. In

     determining the amount of the fine, the Restricted Committee shall take into account the
     criteria specified in the same Article 83.”

88. Article 83 of the GDPR states that “Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the
      imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article in respect of infringements of this
      Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 shall in each individual case be effective,

      proportionate and dissuasive”, before specifying the elements to be taken into account when
      deciding whether to impose an administrative fine and when deciding on the amount of that
      fine.

89. Firstly, on the principle of imposing a fine, the company maintains that such a measure is
      not justified. The company asserts that it has complied with its legal obligations and that it,      has cooperated with the CNIL in a diligent manner and in good faith since the start of the
      proceedings. It therefore argues that imposing an administrative fine would go against the
      principles of the need for penalties and proportionality. It points out in particular that it has

      never been penalised by the Restricted Committee, that the aforementioned breaches do not
      inanywayconstituteadeliberatebreachoftheGDPR,thatthedatasubjectshavenotsuffered
      any damage, and that no specific data referred to in Articles 9 and 10 of the GDPR is

      concerned.

90. The Restricted Committee notes that, in imposing an administrative fine, it must take into

      account the criteria specified in Article 83 of the GDPR, such as the nature, gravity and
      duration of the infringement, the measures taken by the controller to mitigate the damage
      suffered by the data subjects, the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority and

      the categories of personal data concerned by the infringement.

91. Firstly, the Restricted Committee notes that the company has demonstrated significant
      negligence with regard to the fundamental principles of the GDPR, since five breaches have

      been established, in particular concerning the principle of limiting the data retention period,
      the obligation to inform data subjects of the processing of their personal data and the
      obligation to respect their rights.

92. The Restricted Committee then notes that at least some breaches have been established over
      a period of several years and have affected a large number of people, almost 550,000

      individuals, established in France and in six other Member States of the European Union.

93. The Restricted Committee also notes that, within the framework of the penalty proceedings,
      thecompany’scooperationwith thesupervisoryauthoritymeetstheobligationofcooperation

      laid down in Articles 31 of the GDPR and 18 of the Act and cannot constitute a level of
      cooperation exceeding that which is reasonably expected. Therefore, the company’s
      cooperation with the CNIL as part of the penalty proceedings cannot be considered as an

      extenuating circumstance when imposing an administrative fine.

94. In addition, the Restricted Committee notes that whereas the company only processes

      standard personal data, it is still required to implement appropriate technical and
      organisational measures in order to ensure a level of security for this data appropriate to the
      risk, in accordance with Article 32 of the GDPR and in accordance with the principles set out

      in Article 5 of the GDPR.

95. Finally, the Restricted Committee notes that compliance measures were only put in place by
      the company following the penalty proceedings and that they did not exempt it from its

      responsibility for the past.

96. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that an administrative fine should be

      imposed in view of the breaches of Articles 5(1)(e), 13, 17, 28 and 32 of the GDPR., 97. Secondly, with regard to the amount of the fine, the company considers that the amount of
       the fine proposed by the rapporteur is disproportionate in view of its economic situation. It
       highlights its poor financial situation and specifies that a high fine would have a significant

       impact on its business and economic development, particularly in terms of job creation.

 98. TheRestrictedCommitteenotesthatArticle83(3) oftheRegulationprovidesthatintheevent

       of multiple breaches, as in the case in point, the total amount of the fine may not exceed the
       amount set for the most serious breach. Insofar as the company is alleged to be in breach of
       Articles 5(1)(e), 13, 17, 28 and 32 of the GDPR, the maximum fine that can be imposed is

       20 million euros or 4% of annual worldwide turnover, whichever is higher.

 99. The Restricted Committee also notes that administrative fines must be dissuasive but
       proportionate. In particular, it considers that the company’s activity and financial situation

       must be taken into account when determining the penalty and, in particular, in the case of an
       administrative fine, its amount. In this regard, it notes that the company reports turnover in
       2019 and 2020 of approximately23 million euros, then approximately30 million euros, with

       a net loss of -932,078 euros and then -1.7 million euros, respectively.

100. In view of this information, the Restricted Committee considers that imposing a fine of

       120,000 euros seems justified for the breaches of Articles 5(1)(e), 13, 17, 28 and 32 of the
       GDPR.

101. Thirdly, an injunction to make the processing compliant with the provisions of Articles
       5(1)(e), 13, 17, 28 and 32 of the GDPR was proposed by the rapporteur when the report was
       notified.

102. The company argues that the actions it has taken in relation to all the breaches identified
       should lead to no further action in respect of the Rapporteur’s proposed injunction.

103. The Restricted Committee considers that the company has taken the necessary measures to
       ensure compliance. Consequently, the Restricted Committee considers that there are no
       longer grounds to impose an injunction for these points.

                                      FOR THESE REASONS

    The CNIL’s Restricted Committee after having deliberated, intends to:

           impose an administrative fine against                 for an amount of 120,000 (one
            hundred and twenty thousand) euros in respect of the breaches of Articles 5(1)(e),
            13, 17, 28 and 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of
            the Council of 27 April 2016.,This decision may be appealed before the French Conseil d’Etat within two months of its

notification.
