## English Summary

### Facts

A group of workers at a educational centre filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA (AEPD) against their regional Department for Public Education and Universities.

The Department was in the process of implementing a biometric identification system for their workers. Such system was meant to be a voluntary way of identification for the teachers of the centre.

### Holding

The AEPD found that the controller had not properly informed the workers about the biometric system. When the workers asked about the information listed under Article 13 GDPR, they only received a generic answer saying that the personal data were being processed in accordance with the data protection law, and that the contracts made with the providers of the service were also compliant.

The AEPD noted that the processing was not illegal. The controller had a legal basis for the processing (the performance of a contract), and was also relying in one of the exceptions from Article 9(2) GDPR, required for the processing of special categories of data: the processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject in the field of employment. Such obligations originate in the [Spanish Workers' Statute](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-11430); its Article 20(3) allows the employer to use different methods of control and surveillance to verify that the employee effectively complies with their duties and obligations.

However, the AEPD remarked that neither the information provided to the workers nor the answer to their latter request for such information were appropriate, specially in light of a processing of personal data of a sensitive nature, such as biometric data.

The AEPD therefore concluded that the controller had violated Article 13 GDPR, by not providing the information listed by the Article to their workers. The AEPD only issued a warning to the controller.

The authority took into account the actions that the controller took during the course of the proceeding to mitigate the infringement: the stopped the processing and the use of the system, they deleted all the collected data, and they compromised to involve the DPO in further similar projects, as well as to carry out a data protection impact assessment and to devise new data protection protocols.

        Likewise, there is the response made to the claimant in which it is indicated in
two points, as it appears in the proven facts, that the personal data

the companies that have access to the files containing the aforementioned data have

It follows that neither the information transmitted nor the channel used was the most
adequate given the quality and specialty of the data that were in question,
having made a greater effort in the information and communication policy
cation about the intended treatment.

        In the first place, it should be noted that the implementation and integration of a
issue of time control based on fingerprint by the employer, must be
informed the employees in a complete, clear, concise manner and, in addition, the aforementioned information
training must be completed with reference to both the legal bases that give

openness to this type of access control, as well as to the basic information to which it
reference in article 13 of the RGPD.
        In the case examined, the response offered by the training center to the writer

submitted by the claimant, related to the aforementioned control by means of transfer
with fingerprint, it cannot be considered as the most suitable.

        Second, the installation of a control system based on the collection
and treatment of the fingerprint of the employees implies the treatment of their data

        As for the fingerprint, it is also data that must be qualified.

consideration when they have been “obtained from a specific technical treatment

that allow or confirm the unique identification of said person, such as images

        This means that, in accordance with article 9.1 of the RGPD, in the case of
Therefore, the specific regime envisaged for the special categories of
data provided for in article 9 of the RGPD.

        In this sense, recital 51 of the RGPD highlights the nature of
restrictive with which the processing of these data can be admitted:

        “(51) ... Such personal data should not be processed, unless it is allowed
its treatment in specific situations contemplated in this Regulation,
given that Member States may lay down specific provisions
ficas on data protection in order to adapt the application of the rules of the

ment, especially with regard to the conditions of lawfulness of the treatment. I know
must explicitly establish exceptions to the general prohibition of treatment

of these special categories of personal data, among other things when the in-
the person concerned gives their explicit consent or in the case of specific needs, in
particularly when the treatment is carried out within the framework of legitimate activities by
certain associations or foundations whose objective is to allow the exercise of
fundamental liberties.

        And recital 52 indicates that

        “(52) Likewise, exceptions to the prohibition to treat categories must be authorized

        In accordance with these considerations, the processing of biometric data from
special categories will require, in addition to the concurrence of one of the legal bases
cases established in article 6 of the RGPD, some of the exceptions provided in the

Article 9.2 of the RGPD.
        The analysis of the legal basis of legitimacy to carry out this treatment comes
of article 6 of the RGPD, regarding the legality of the treatment, which in its section 1, letter

b) states: “The treatment will be lawful if at least one of the following con-
terms: (…) b) the treatment is necessary for the performance of a contract in which
the interested party is a party or for the application at his request of pre-contractual measures

        By virtue of this precept, the treatment would be lawful and would not require the consent of

public employees, the Administration has to process certain data
to which the RGPD refers, in its article 9, as “special categories of data

        On the other hand, and as highlighted in recital 51 of the same RGPD,
insofar as biometric data is of a special category in the cases
of biometric identification (art. 9.1 RGPD), it will be necessary for one of the
the exceptions provided in article 9.2 of the RGPD that would allow lifting the prohibition

collective agreement in accordance with the law of the Member States that establishes

adequate guarantees of respect for fundamental rights and the interests of the
interested".

        In Spanish law, article 20 of the Consolidated Text of the Statute of
workers (TE), approved by Royal Legislative Decree 2/2015, of October 23,
bre, provides for the possibility for the employer to adopt surveillance and control measures
to verify compliance with the labor obligations of its workers:

their dignity and taking into account, where appropriate, the actual capacity of the workers

       And in the Basic Statute of the Public Employee, approved by Royal Decree Le-

proportionality such as the determination of the existing risks and the measures to

tity, since they make the characteristics of the human body legible by means of
machines and are subject to further use. "

       In relation to them, the Opinion specifies that it is possible to distinguish different types of
treatments by stating that “Biometric data can be processed and stored in
different ways. Sometimes the biometric information captured from a person is stored
It is cooked and treated raw, which makes it possible to recognize the source from which it comes without

special knowledge; for example, a photograph of a face, a photograph of a
fingerprint or a voice recording. Other times, raw biometric information
captured is treated in such a way that only certain characteristics or traits are extracted and
they are saved as a biometric template. "

       The processing of these data is expressly permitted by the RGPD when
