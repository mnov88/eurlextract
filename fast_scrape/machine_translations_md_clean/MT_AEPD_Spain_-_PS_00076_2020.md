## English Summary

On 20/09/2019, the AEPD received a complaint against BANKIA SA for retaining the claimant's personal data despite the fact that the claimant ceased to be their client 16 years ago. On 5/11/2019 the AEPD asked BANKIA to remedy the situation however BANKIA claimed that their actions were in accordance with data protection regulations and did not solve the problem or update their data retention policy until March 2020.

### Dispute

Did BANKIA SA violate the purpose limitation stipulated in Article 5.1(b) GDPR by retaining records of the claimant's personal data, 16 years after their last commercial relationship?

### Holding

The AEPD held that BANKIA was charged with infringing Article 5.1(b) of the GDPR, for processing data in a manner that did not meet a specified, explicit and legitimate purpose. The blocked data was also accessible by workers from the office of BANKIA, which infringed Spanish Law on the Organic Law on Data Protection and Guarantee of Digital Rights (Article 32.2).

In determining the fine, the following aggravating factors under Article 83 GDPR were considered: unintentional but significant negligent action and the fact that basic personal identifiers (i.e. name, surname, address, telephone) of the claimant were affected. Nevertheless, an attenuating circumstances in the Spanish Law on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administration (Article 83) stated that the voluntary payment of the proposed penalty prior to the resolution of the proceedings, led to a reduction of 20% in the penalty.

On 20 August 2020, BANKIA S.A. paid 40,000 euros thereby applying the above-mentioned reduction. In doing so, BANKIA implied recognition of their responsibility and waived any action or appeal through administrative channels, against the sanction. Subsequently, the AEPD decided to terminate the procedure.
