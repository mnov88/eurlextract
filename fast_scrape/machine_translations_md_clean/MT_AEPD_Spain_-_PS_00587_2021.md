## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject spent half of a day at La Paz hospital’s emergencies room as a patient. During this visit, access to the data subject's medical files was carried out by a nurse who was not providing health care to the data subject and who was working in another department in the same hospital but had access to the system with their personal key. The data subject submitted a complaint before the Spanish DPA against the Regional Health Minister of Madrid (the controller) due to unlawful access to their medical record. The incident was investigated internally at the hospital and the conclusions lead to a recognition of a confidentiality data breach. For that incident, the nurse was reprimanded.

Once the Spanish DPA decided to start an investigation for a violation of the GDPR, the controller claimed that the hospital had appropriate organisational and technical measures according to the National Security Scheme. For instance, all the user's activities are registered, which allows for the identification of the staff member who accessed the medical records, as well as the assessment of unlawful activities. The controller also claimed the establishment of, among others, audits in cases of data breaches, the system’s segmentation by profiles to limit the access of different users to what is necessary (data minimisation), the signature of confidentiality agreements by the employees, and an informative banner warning about possible illegitimate access everytime an employee tried to access files. In the same line, the controller stated that the hospital provides training on security and data protection.

### Holding

The DPA stated that most of the security measures described were inefficient for the prevention of unlawful access. The activities register and the audits were measures to react after the incident; the banner only had informational purposes and did not prohibit access to illegitimate users. Finally, the confidentiality agreement did not, in itself, prevent illegitimate access. Regarding the segmentation of profiles, the DPA stated that it could be taken as the only valid and effective measure.

However, the controller did not implement measures which would only allow employees access to medical records of patients to whom they are providing health care (and not general access between different departments). The DPA mentioned the national regulation on patient’s autonomy and rights and obligations regarding informed consent and medical record (_[Ley 41/2002, de 14 de noviembre](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2002-22188), básica reguladora de la autonomía del paciente y de derechos y obligaciones en materia de información y documentación clínica_) and interpreted that a medical record is a tool whose main purpose is to guarantee the appropriate health care to the patient and to which, only health personnel providing a diagnosis or treatment are entitled to access (Article 16). Furthermore, medical care sites must implement measures taking into consideration the patients assigned to each professional, the health department where they work, and their working shifts (since the same nurse can be working in one department for a determined week and then move to another one), to avoid the access to medical records by professionals who are not assigned to those patients. The DPA suggested the use of an IT app which controls access to medical records by determining if the request is legitimate, considering the user’s specialisation, shift or work tasks at that moment. This also should be complemented with the respective audits of the system.

In this case, the access was performed by a nurse working in the surgery room, whereas the patient was being treated in the emergency room. This demonstrated the lack of appropriate security measures. Furthermore, the same controller recognised the unlawful conduct by sanctioning the nurse. The DPA highlighted the fact that medical records belong to the special category of data whose processing is prohibited unless one of the exceptions listed in [Article 9(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR") applies. This condition increases obligation to ensure an adequate level of security as well as integrity and confidentiality by the controller. The Spanish DPA found a violation of [Articles 5(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR "Article 58 GDPR") and [32 GDPR.](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR")

Finally, the DPA reprimanded the controller for violations of [Articles 5(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). According to national law, the DPA is not allowed to fine public entities. Notwithstanding, the DPA exercised the power of [Article 58(2)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2d "Article 58 GDPR") and imposed a corrective measure and ordered the controller to establish appropriate measures to align the security level to [Articles 5(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") following the proposed measures in its decision.

## Comment

The DPA based their decision on a precedent [(PS-00250/2021](https://www.aepd.es/es/documento/ps-00250-2021.pdf)) in which the Health System of Extremadura was reprimanded for unlawful access to a medical record by a nurse without authorisation or justification for it.

of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (in

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/26

hereinafter, LPACAP), for the alleged infringement of article 5.1.f) of the GDPR and article
32 of the GDPR, typified in articles 83.5 and 83.4 of the GDPR, respectively.

The startup agreement was sent, in accordance with the rules established in the Law
39/2015, of October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of the
Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), by means of electronic notification,
being received on January 5, 2022, as stated in the certificate that works
on the record.

SIXTH: Once the initiation agreement was notified, the claimed party submitted a written

allegations in which, in summary, he stated:

-that the Hospital Responsible for Data Treatment, Hospital Universitario La
Paz (HULP), conducted an investigation into the facts, concluding after it that
there were improper accesses to your medical record during the interval in which the
complainant was in the ER (3:46 a.m. until 10:12 a.m. of the same

discharge date: June 13, 2020),

-That there are adequate and sufficient security measures for the management of
Clinical Histories, every time the activities of the users are recorded, retaining
the information needed to monitor, analyse, investigate and document

improper or unauthorized activities, allowing the identification at all times of the
person acting, counting the center with a protocol established for such purposes, in
which includes a process of reactive and proactive audits, the latter being
on a monthly basis and following a specific structure and follow-up, to attend to
the requirements of the Ministry of Health in case of improper access to

medical records,

-that they have a Security Policy at the level of the Ministry of Health, which
provides specific organizational measures for the maintenance of confidentiality
of the information accessed by the workers of the organization,

-that in the medical records management system there is a segregation of profiles
for the use of the tool, based on the performance of the work of each of
positions.

The document that establishes the assignment of Users and standard profiles is attached, in the

which state that: "it can be verified that due compliance is given at the beginning
minimum privilege, in accordance with the provisions of Annex II \[op.acc.3\] of the
National Security Scheme limiting each user to a strictly minimum
necessary to fulfill its obligations. In addition, the privileges are limited in a way
that users only access information necessary for the fulfillment of their

functions.

Therefore, there are different user models defined, such as:

• Administrative User
• Medical User (one per specialty)

• Nursing user (midwives, supervisors, nurses)
• Query User (only gives access to see the information, but does not allow registration)
• User for other non-medical groups

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 6/26

The user models are made up of different profiles, and each profile
allows access to certain functions or powers, always having

present that, according to Law 41/2002, of November 14, basic regulation of the
patient autonomy and rights and obligations in terms of information and
clinical documentation, in its article 16 it is indicated that the clinical history is a
instrument intended primarily to ensure adequate assistance to the
patient, that is, the clinical history must be accessible in such a way that it can be
ensure that adequate care is provided to each patient, taking into account

the diversity of health professionals existing in the center. For example, in the
cases of emergencies, this medical history must be accessible to ensure the
vital interests of every citizen.

When a professional joins the center, they are assigned the model user

established, but if the professional changes their functions or requires new functions,
must have the approval of the Directorate. In the event that a user claims
new functions and there is no established model user, Management values the
relevance of creating a new model user.

Thus, and as we can see in the protocol, there are no generic users,

but rather, they are users created according to the functions they have
assigned, being the univocal and nominal access for each professional with their number of
Personal ID.”

-that they have signed a Confidentiality Commitment, through which they

informs the worker at the time of formalizing his contract with the hospital, about the
mandatory security and privacy policies for employees of the
Hospital,

-that training is provided regarding the security of personal data

staff,

-that the claimed party acknowledged its error and apologized to the claiming party,
indicating the lack of intentionality when accessing your information, from what they understand
that security measures, both technical and organizational, carried out by
the person in charge of the Treatment, are optimal and valid to guarantee the security and

confidentiality of patient data.

SEVENTH: On March 11, 2022, the instructor of the procedure issued
proposed resolution for infringement of the provisions of article 5.1 f) of the GDPR.

The aforementioned resolution proposal was sent, in accordance with the rules established in

Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), by means of electronic notification,
being received on March 12, 2022, as stated in the certificate that works
on the record.

EIGHTH: On March 28, 2022, the respondent entity submitted a written

allegations to the Resolution Proposal, in which, in summary, he stated in relation to
with the established security measures that, in application of the National Scheme

concerned, would have reached the conclusion that SERMAS had established
sufficient security measures.

NINTH: In view of the facts considered proven and in accordance with the
powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Regulation of

Data Protection, hereinafter GDPR), grants each control authority and according to
the provisions of articles 47 and 48.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5,
Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter,
LOPDGDD) and in use of the power provided for in article 90.2 of Law 39/2015, of 1
October, of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations,

On August 23, 2022, the claimed party is notified of the consideration of
that, from the proven facts, not only the violation of article 5.1.f) of the
GDPR, but also that of article 32 of the same legal text.

TENTH: Once the Resolution Proposal was notified, the claimed party submitted a written
of allegations in which, in summary, he stated that an adequate provision of the
health care implies the participation of several services of the same center for the

achievement of the ultimate goal of the well-being and health of the patient, which, in fact, in the
health practice, it is common for an emergency service to lead to a
operating room service, in which it would be strictly necessary to preserve the
vital interests of the affected person, that the health personnel of both services have
immediate access to the patient's medical history in order to provide an adequate

emergency health care.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/26

They provide a report issued by the University Hospital of La Paz in which it is indicated, in
relation to the measure proposed by the AEPD that each of the professionals
could have access to the medical records only of those patients on whom

which carry out their activity, that said measure is extremely complex and difficult
to apply both at a technical and organizational level, and above all from the point of view

professional can carry out their activity in a plant or specialty and the next day

Therefore, they consider that health personnel should have access to the different

patients can exercise their right to Free Choice of Specialist, Free Choice
Health Center, request one according to opinion or be channeled at optional request
to a different center to carry out a test or treatment not included in the portfolio
service center of origin. In these situations, health professionals,

have to be able to access the patient's complete medical record in order to offer a
adequate care for the sick.

Lastly, they deem it necessary for the profiles of the configuration system to come
configured as they are up to now since it is the best way to pre-

preserve the health of patients who come to the hospital where care is provided
and indicate that there is already a strong segregation of profiles for the use
of the tool, based on the performance of the work of each one of the positions, limited
giving each user access to the minimum.

In view of all the proceedings, by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection
In this proceeding, the following are considered proven facts:

                                 PROVEN FACTS

FIRST: On November 22, 2020, the claimant filed a

claim before the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, for the alleged access
due to her medical history, by a co-worker.

SECOND: The Hospital Responsible for Data Treatment, carried out a
investigation of the facts, concluding after it that there were accesses
undue to her medical history during the interval in which the complainant

was in the ER (3:46 a.m. until 10:12 a.m. of the same day that
is discharged: June 13, 2020).

                           FUNDAMENTALS OF LAW

                                            Yo

In accordance with the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), grants each

control authority and as established in articles 47 and 48.1 of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to initiate and resolve

this procedure, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "Procedures
processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions

                                           II
In response to the allegations presented by the respondent entity to the Agreement of

beginning of the disciplinary procedure, the following should be noted:

The GDPR defines, in a broad way, "data security breaches
personal" (hereinafter security bankruptcy) as "all those violations of the
security that cause the destruction, loss or accidental or unlawful alteration of
personal data transmitted, stored or processed in another way, or the

unauthorized communication or access to said data.”

In the present case, it is clear that there was a data security breach
in the circumstances indicated above, categorized as breach of
confidentiality, as a consequence of exposure to a third party, of the

personal data relating to the health of the complaining party.

Article 32 of the GDPR states the following:

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as risks of

variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which may include, among others:

a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data
b) the ability to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience
permanent treatment systems and services;
c) the ability to restore the availability and access to the personal data of
quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;

d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of the
technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the treatment.

2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration will be given to
take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data

personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or
unauthorized access to such data.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/26

3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct pursuant to article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved under article 42 may serve as an element
to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the

present article.

4. The controller and the processor shall take measures to ensure that
any person acting under the authority of the controller or processor and

instructions of the person in charge, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the Law of

The aforementioned article provides that "the controller and the person in charge of the treatment
apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of
risk-appropriate security. Consequently, it does not adopt a closed relation of

technical and organizational measures, but these must be the appropriate ones in
function of the level of risk previously analyzed.

That said, article 32.1 includes an obligation of means and not an obligation
of result. Indeed, it indicates that "the person responsible and in charge of the treatment applied

The technological evolution and sophistication of systems for unauthorized access to systems
data issues means that the regulations cannot unconditionally impose
a total assurance of the absence of breaches of integrity or confidentiality.
But it does require that those responsible for the treatments must carry out an analysis of
risks and the implementation of an "adequate security level" for them.

Therefore, this duty is characterized as an obligation of means. He has so declared
The Supreme Court found in its recent judgment of February 15, 2022:

      “The obligation to adopt the necessary measures to guarantee the security
      of personal data cannot be considered an obligation of result, which

      implies that a leak of personal data to a third party exists

      In obligations of means, the commitment acquired is to adopt

      technical and organizational means, as well as deploying a diligent activity
      in its implementation and use that tends to achieve the expected result with

      The difference lies in the responsibility in both cases, because while
      in the obligation of result, responds to a harmful result due to the failure of the
      security system, whatever its cause and the diligence used. In the
      obligation of means is enough to establish technically appropriate measures and
      implement and use them with reasonable care.

      In the latter, the sufficiency of the security measures that the person responsible
      has to establish has to be related to the state of technology in

      Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to

      We have already reasoned that the obligation that falls on the person responsible for the file

      measures to guarantee the security of personal data is not a
      obligation of result but of means, without the infallibility of the
      measures taken. Only the adoption and implementation of mea-
      technical and organizational measures, which according to the state of technology and in re-
      relation to the nature of the treatment carried out and the personal data in

      matter, reasonably allow to avoid its alteration, loss, treatment or
      Unauthorized access."

Having established the foregoing, that is, that the obligation of means imposed by article 32 of the
GDPR consists of adopting security measures in the treatment, tending to

avoid the production of a security breach in it. These obligations of-
must be established based on the risks that have been analyzed, and taking
into account the state of technology at all times and the level of protection required
do in relation to the personal data processed.

Accordingly, the analysis should be performed to determine if the in-
compliance consists of determining whether the measures were sufficient to prevent
address the risk of a security breach. In this case, it should be checked whether the measures
were adequate to ensure that unauthorized access to the history did not occur.

depending on whether such access actually occurred, or not.

It is necessary to analyze the allegations made in this procedure by the COUNCIL-
HEALTH RIVER. In relation to the security measures established:

    - In application of the National Security Scheme, the activities are recorded

    - An information box (banner) appears warning that access to the platform

And in relation to other considerations he states:

    - The appropriate investigations were carried out, which led to the actions

    - The mitigating measures carried out by the Hospital, in response to the request for
        the affected, have consisted of a warning

Finally, it mentions the Disciplinary procedure of the AEPD Procedure Nº:
AP/00056/2014. In said resolution issued on February 9, 2021, the AEPD had
opportunity to rule on possible improper and unjustified access to history

concerned, would have reached the conclusion that SERMAS had established measures

In relation to these allegations, the following must be stated:

Of the five security measures described, it can already be ruled out from the outset that
four of them can be effective in preventing unauthorized access. In
In the first place, the registration of accesses or the performance of audits are measures to
react a posteriori, once the access has occurred. Second, the bank
ner has only informative purposes, without preventing the professional from continuing in
if the access was not justified. Finally, the commitment to confi-

dentiality also does not prevent, by itself, unauthorized access.

Only the segmentation of access profiles to medical records could con-
be considered a valid and effective tool for the avoidance of events such as the
case you The MINISTRY OF HEALTH provides a very detailed annex with the profiles

of each of the types of professional category, distinguishing between ad-
ministerial and health, and within this last category, by types and specialties of
staff.

However, a measure that would be basic is not reflected in the document, and that is that
each of the health professionals could have access to the medical records

only of those patients on whom they deploy their care activity.

In this sense, article 16 of Law 41/2002, of November 14, basic regulation
autonomy of the patient and rights and obligations in terms of information
tion and clinical documentation provides that “1. The clinical history is an instrument

primarily aimed at ensuring adequate care for the patient. The prof-
care professionals of the center who carry out the diagnosis or treatment of the patient
patient have access to the patient's clinical history as a fundamental tool for
your proper assistance.
2. Each center will establish the methods that allow access to

the clinical history of each patient by the professionals who assist him” (underlining
is ours).

From reading this precept it is clearly inferred that, although the clinical history is
the instrument to provide health care to the patient, which must remain due to
duly guaranteed, so is the fact that access can only occur

to the clinical history by the professionals who assist you, not in general, but
with a particular character carrying out the diagnosis or treatment of the patient.

Let us remember that the assumption of fact that has given rise to this procedure con-
access by a nursing person from the Operating Room Service

regarding a patient who received medical assistance in the Emergency Department.

It is true that, as the interested party affirms, "the clinical history is an instrument destined
fundamentally to guarantee adequate care for the patient, that is, the
medical history must be accessible in such a way that it can be ensured that it is provided

adequate assistance to each patient", but it is no less so that they can implement-

aspect of a patient on whom care activity is not entrusted to
guna. The strong segregation of profiles that they say they have implemented has not prevented
giving access to a patient's clinical history, by a nurse who did not

I was entrusted with the treatment of the patient. This indicates the absence of measures
of adequate security.

The lack of adoption of a measure such as the one described means that it cannot be considered
that there are security measures that provide an adequate level of protection
to existing risks. In fact, the MINISTRY OF HEALTH itself recognizes the

illegality of the conduct, since he processed a disciplinary file against
the person who made the improper access, and which concluded with the imposition of a
warning.

In relation to the precedent invoked (exp. AP/00056/2014), it should be noted that

(LOPD)

The system established by the previous LOPD differs substantially from that established by
the current GDPR. While the former established a system of security measures

legally established (in conjunction with the RLOPD) to be understood
Once the security obligations have been fulfilled, the current GDPR is based on the
principles of proactive responsibility and data protection by design, that is,
in the establishment of the measures that are necessary based on the risks
valued inherent to a certain treatment. There is therefore no number

rus clausus of measures that the data controller must adopt, but rather
These must be established on a case-by-case basis, based on the risk analysis and the
data that is being processed.

In this regard, article 5.2 of the GDPR establishes, after listing the principles
regarding the protection of personal data, the following:

      "two. The data controller will be responsible for compliance with the dis-
      listed in section 1 and able to demonstrate it ("proactive responsibility")."

And regarding the principle of data protection by design, the GDPR requires:

      "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of the application and the nature of
      nature, scope, context and purposes of the treatment, as well as the risks of different

In response to the latest allegations made by the respondent entity, it should be
point out the following:

First of all, we are dealing with a special category of personal data

Recital 51 provides, regarding the special categories of personal data,

that:

 "Special protection deserves personal data that, by its nature, is
particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms,
since the context of their treatment could entail significant risks for the

explicit consent or in the case of specific needs, in particular

when the treatment is carried out in the framework of legitimate activities by

It is a priority to determine the role played by the Ministry of Health.

It follows that the person responsible for the processing of the data that is part of the
clinical history is the health center, public or private; they have the obligation to
prepare it, guard it and implement the necessary security measures so that it does not

Not allowed.
The GDPR explicitly introduces the principle of liability (article 5.2 GDPR),
that is, the person responsible for the treatment will be responsible for compliance with the

provided for in paragraph 1 of article 5 and must be able to prove it
“proactive responsibility”.

Report 0064/2020 of the Legal Office of the AEPD has emphatically expressed
that "The GDPR has meant a paradigm shift when addressing the regulation of the
right to the protection of personal data, which is based on the

principle of "accountability" or "proactive responsibility" as indicated by
repeatedly by the AEPD (Report 17/2019, among many others) and is included in the
Explanation of reasons for the Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of
Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (LOPDGDD)”.

The requested party, in its capacity as the data controller, should
have adopted and implemented, proactively, the technical and
organizational measures that are appropriate to evaluate and guarantee a level of
appropriate security to the probable risks of diverse nature and severity

linked to the health data processing carried out.

For these purposes, article 24 of the GDPR under the heading "Responsibility of the
responsible for the treatment" provides:

       "1. Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing,
       as well as risks of varying probability and severity for the rights

       the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the application, for
       part of the person responsible for the treatment, of the appropriate protection policies

       of data. (…)”

For its part, article 25 of the GDPR under the heading "Data protection from the
sign and by default" provides:

       "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of the application and the nature of

       freedoms of natural persons, the data controller will apply, both
       at the time of determining the means of treatment as at the time

       of the processing itself, appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as the
       pseudonymization, designed to effectively apply the principles of

       defect, the personal data are not accessible, without the intervention of the per-
       sona, to an indeterminate number of natural persons. (…)”

Likewise, the LOPDGDD in article 28.1 states that:

       "Those responsible and in charge, taking into account the elements enumerated
       two in articles 24 and 25 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, will determine the

In summary, this principle requires a conscious, diligent, committed and
proactive on the part of the person responsible for all data processing

In the present case, the defendant entity is charged with the lack of implementation of
the technical and organizational measures necessary to guarantee a level of security
appropriate to the risk derived from the treatment of patient health data (category

From the foregoing, it is evident that the defendant, as the person responsible for the ob-
object of study, has not shown the diligence that was required to establish

the security measures that are necessary to avoid the filtration or diffusion of
this type of data to third parties. In this sense, the configuration of technical measures
and organizational processes must be carried out so that, prior to carrying out the
processing of personal data, it is guaranteed that you can only have access to

For the purposes of the limitation period for infringements, article 72 of the LOPDGDD,

                                  GDPR Article 32

Article 32 of the GDPR, security of treatment, establishes the following:

         1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as risks of
variable probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals
physical, the person in charge and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and

appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which may include, among others:

          a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;

          b) the ability to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
          c) the ability to restore availability and access to data
quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;

          d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness
of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the treatment.

         2. When evaluating the adequacy of the level of security, particular attention should be paid to
take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
consequence of the destruction, loss or accidental or illegal alteration of data

personal information transmitted, preserved or processed in another way, or the communication or
unauthorized access to said data (The underlining is from the AEPD).

Recital 75 of the GDPR lists a series of factors or assumptions associated with
risks to the guarantees of the rights and freedoms of the interested parties:

“The risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, serious and
variable probability, may be due to data processing that could cause
physical, material or immaterial damages and losses, particularly in cases in which
that the treatment may give rise to problems of discrimination, usurpation of
identity or fraud, financial loss, damage to reputation, loss of

confidentiality of data subject to professional secrecy, unauthorized reversal of the
pseudonymization or any other significant economic or social harm; in the
cases in which the interested parties are deprived of their rights and freedoms or are
prevent you from exercising control over your personal data; In cases where the data
personal treaties reveal ethnic or racial origin, political opinions, religion

or philosophical beliefs, union membership and genetic data processing,
data relating to health or data on sexual life, or convictions and offenses
criminal or related security measures; in cases where they are evaluated
personal aspects, in particular the analysis or prediction of aspects related to the
performance at work, economic situation, health, preferences or interests
personal, reliability or behavior, situation or movements, in order to create or

use personal profiles; in cases in which personal data of
vulnerable people, particularly children; or in cases where the treatment
involves a large amount of personal data and affects a large number of
interested.”

In the present case, as established in the facts and in the framework of the file
E/05028/2021, the AEPD requested to provide the date and time of the accesses, the details of the
type of data accessed, as well as supporting documentation of the
existing justification for such accesses. In the documentation provided, the
The defendant only acknowledges the existence of said accesses, although he does not pronounce

about the legitimacy of these nor does it provide a copy of the required investigation.

The consequence of this implementation of deficient security measures was the
exposure to a third party of personal data relating to the health of the
complaining party. That is, the affected person has been deprived of control over their
personal data relating to your medical history.

It should be added that, in relation to the category of data to which a third party
someone else has had access, they are in the special category according to what
provided in art. 9 of the GDPR, a circumstance that implies an added risk that is
must be assessed in the risk management study and that the degree requirement increases

of protection in relation to the security and safeguarding of the integrity and
confidentiality of these data.

This risk must be taken into account by the controller who must
establish the necessary technical and organizational measures to prevent the loss of

control of the data by the person responsible for the treatment and, therefore, by the
holders of the data that provided them.

           11, 25 to 39, 42 and 43; (…)”

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 "Infractions" establishes that
"The acts and behaviors referred to in sections 4,
5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result
contrary to this organic law”.

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 73 "Infractions considered serious"
of the LOPDGDD indicates:

"Based on what is established in article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
