## English Summary

### Facts

In October 2018, the data subject requested access under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") from a credit information company (later merged into another entity). The company provided a three-page response, listing basic personal data, addresses, financial details, and references to sources. It also denied conducting automated decision-making within the meaning of [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR").

The data subject lodged a complaint with the Austrian DPA in December 2018, claiming the access was incomplete and failed to explain how data were linked to processing purposes, recipients, or legal bases. He also argued that automated decision-making and profiling (credit scoring) were taking place, contrary to the company’s denial.

The DPA failed to decide within the statutory time limit, leading the data subject to file a procedural complaint. The case was then transferred to the BVwG.

### Holding

The BVwG partly upheld the complaint. It found that the company had violated [Article 15(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1a "Article 15 GDPR") by failing to provide sufficiently specific information about the purposes of processing, and [Article 15(1)(h) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1h "Article 15 GDPR") by not giving meaningful information about the logic, significance, and consequences of automated credit scoring. The Court therefore ordered the company to supply, within four weeks, both clearly defined purposes of processing and a real explanation of how the scoring system works, its scope, and its intended effects on the data subject.

## Comment

The ruling makes clear that controllers cannot meet [Article 15(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1a "Article 15 GDPR") with vague statements such as “your data is processed for credit assessment”; the purposes must be specific and understandable.

Similarly, under [Article 15(1)(h) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1h "Article 15 GDPR"), generic references to credit scoring are insufficient as data subjects must receive meaningful information about how the scoring logic operates and what consequences it carries.

By linking this to [Article 22 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_22_GDPR "Article 22 GDPR"), and in line with the CJEU’s SCHUFA decision (C-634/21), the Court confirmed that credit scoring qualifies as automated decision-making and therefore triggers heightened transparency duties.

On November 5, 2018, the respondent provided the complainant with a three-page statement. The first page of this statement contained the following information about the complainant, citing the individual sources (commercial register; two address publishers/direct marketing companies; research): name, four addresses, gender, date of birth, nationality, professional and income status, payment method, key figures (estimated income for 2012), and two requests from inquiring companies in the Roman 40 sector – on January 1, 2016, and April 22, 2018 – within the last three years. The second and third pages of this statement also included general information on, among other things, the purposes of processing, the categories of personal data, the recipients of the data, the retention period, the rights of data subjects and the right to lodge a complaint, and the origin of the data. Furthermore, it was expressly stated that automated decision-making pursuant to Article 15, paragraph 1, letter h, in conjunction with Article 22, paragraph 1 and 4 GDPR does not take place at the respondent's office.

The information dated November 5, 2018, is as follows (formatting not reproduced faithfully):

3. Since the complainant considered the information provided to be incomplete and not in accordance with the requirements of Article 15 GDPR, he filed a complaint pursuant to Article 77 GDPR and Section 24 of the Data Protection Act (DSG) (data protection complaint) with the Data Protection Authority (DSB, the authority in question before the Federal Administrative Court) on December 19, 2018. In summary, he argued that the information on the specifically processed data did not include all of the data categories or subcategories listed on the second page, or that some information was missing as to whether or not data on the previously specified data categories and subcategories was available. The information also did not indicate which of the processed data would be processed for which purposes (credit information and/or marketing data) or whether all of the processed data was necessary for all purposes. 3. Since the complainant considered the information provided to be incomplete and not in accordance with the requirements of Article 15 of the GDPR, he filed a complaint with the Data Protection Authority (DSB, the authority sued before the Federal Administrative Court) on December 19, 2018, pursuant to Article 77 of the GDPR and Section 24 of the Data Protection Act (DSG). In this complaint, he summarized that the information on the specifically processed data did not include all of the data categories or subcategories listed on the second page, or that some information was missing as to whether or not data on the previously specified data categories and subcategories was available. The information also did not indicate which of the processed data would be processed for which purposes (credit information and/or marketing data) or whether all of the processed data was necessary for all purposes.

Furthermore, no information was provided regarding the legal basis for the processing, and incomplete information was provided regarding the origin and recipients of the data. Furthermore, it should be noted that the respondent has expressly admitted in other complaint proceedings before the competent authority that automated decision-making takes place, and it can also be clearly deduced from the respondent's statements that profiling within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR is also being carried out. Furthermore, no information was provided regarding the legal basis for the processing, and incomplete information was provided regarding the origin and recipients of the data. Furthermore, it should be noted that the respondent has expressly admitted in other complaint proceedings before the competent authority that automated decision-making takes place, and it can also be clearly deduced from the respondent's statements that profiling within the meaning of Article 22 GDPR is also being carried out.

4. At the request of the authority concerned, the respondent submitted a statement on March 28, 2019, in which it stated that the information provided was not incomplete. With regard to the sources cited, the complainant should have known from various other proceedings that these were XXXX and XXXX. Data relating to research was data that was collected manually and internally. Regarding the information that the complainant was meeting his previous payment obligations in the agreed manner, this was a standard statement if, as in his case, there were no negative payment experiences. Regarding the recipients of the personal data, it was stated that the data had been retrieved by the company XXXX. 4. At the request of the authority concerned, the respondent submitted a statement on March 28, 2019, in which it stated that the information provided was not incomplete. Regarding the sources cited, the complainant should have been aware from various other proceedings that these were roman 40 and roman 40. Data relating to research was collected manually and internally. Regarding the information that the complainant was fulfilling his previous payment obligations in the agreed manner, this was a standard statement if, as in his case, there were no negative payment experiences. Regarding the recipients of the personal data, it was stated that the data was retrieved by the company roman 40.

5. The complainant responded to this in his statement of April 10, 2019, after being granted the opportunity to be heard by the authority in question regarding the results of the investigation. This statement summarized that the respondent had still not provided complete information about the personal data it processed. The Commission did not provide any information about how it specifically assesses the complainant's creditworthiness or which personal data concerning the complainant had been transmitted to third parties in this regard. The information provided by the respondent regarding the processing purposes and the legal basis for the processing remains incomplete, especially since no additional information was included in the respondent's statement.

Enclosed with the statement were, among other things, information letters from XXXX dated February 6, 2017, from XXXX dated January 16, 2019, and February 5, 2019, as well as an undated information letter from XXXX. Enclosed with the statement were, among other things, information letters from roman 40 dated February 6, 2017, from roman 40 dated January 16, 2019, and February 5, 2019, as well as an undated information letter from roman 40.

6. On January 13, 2020, the complainant filed a default appeal pursuant to
Article 130, paragraph 1, item 3 of the Federal Constitutional Act (B-VG) alleging a breach of the authority's duty to make a decision. The data protection complaint at issue in these proceedings was filed on December 19, 2018, and thus more than twelve months ago. The deadline granted to the authority under Section 73, paragraph 1 of the General Administrative Procedures Act (AVG) was thus exceeded by more than double, thus breaching the authority's duty to make a decision. 6. On January 13, 2020, the complainant filed a default appeal pursuant to
Article 130, paragraph 1, item 3 of the Federal Constitutional Act (B-VG) alleging a breach of the authority's duty to make a decision. The data protection complaint at issue in these proceedings was filed on December 19, 2018, and thus more than twelve months ago. The deadline granted to the respondent authority under Section 73, Paragraph 1, of the Administrative Procedures Act (AVG) was thus exceeded by more than double, thus violating the respondent authority's obligation to make a decision.

7. Subsequently, by letter dated April 29, 2020, the respondent authority submitted the appeal against default, along with the associated files of the administrative proceedings, to the Federal Administrative Court for a decision and issued a statement stating that, at the time the appeal against default was filed, the six-month deadline for making a decision had already expired and that the appeal against default was therefore justified. The respondent authority was unfortunately unable to make the decision within the deadline stipulated in Section 16, Paragraph 1 of the Administrative Procedures Act (VwGVG) due to the increased workload and the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which is why jurisdiction was transferred ex lege to the Federal Administrative Court. Subsequently, the respondent authority submitted the appeal against default, along with the associated administrative proceedings files, to the Federal Administrative Court for a decision by letter dated April 29, 2020, and issued a statement stating that, at the time the appeal against default was filed, the six-month deadline for a decision had already expired and that the appeal against default was therefore justified. The respondent authority was unfortunately unable to make the decision within the deadline stipulated in Section 16, Paragraph 1, of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG) due to the increased workload and the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which is why jurisdiction had been transferred ex lege to the Federal Administrative Court.

8. By letter dated April 21, 2022, the Federal Administrative Court sent the respondent the complainant's statement of April 10, 2019, including the attachments, the complainant's default appeal of January 13, 2020, and the letter from the authority concerned in the course of the submission of the file dated April 29, 2020. It stated that, in the Federal Administrative Court's view, the information provided proved to be inconclusive and incomplete, and requested the respondent to comment on it.

9. The respondent submitted statements by written submissions dated May 3, 2022, and May 19, 2022, in each of which it stated that the data protection complaint was directed against XXXX and that this company had been merged into XXXX by merger agreement dated September 16, 2021. XXXX was deleted on September 29, 2021, and consequently, XXXX is now the respondent. 9. The respondent submitted statements in written submissions dated May 3, 2022, and May 19, 2022, respectively, in which it was initially stated that the data protection complaint was directed against roman 40 and that this company had been merged into roman 40 by merger agreement dated September 16, 2021. Roman 40 was deleted on September 29, 2021, and consequently, roman 40 is now the respondent.

Regarding the alleged incompleteness of the information on the processed data, the respondent essentially stated that the complainant had been provided with an extract containing the personal data processed concerning him. This information listed all data, and the respondent did not hold any further data on the complainant.

Regarding the alleged incompleteness of the information regarding processing purposes, it is noted that on the second page of the data disclosure, the respective data categories for which the data of the respective data subject may be stored are listed for the respective processing purposes, namely the provision of credit information and the provision of marketing information. Whether corresponding data exists for the data types can be determined from the list on the first page of the data disclosure. Furthermore, the processing purposes are explicitly stated, namely, the purpose of providing credit information and the purpose of providing marketing information, which corresponds to the trade licenses held by the respondent pursuant to Section 152 and Section 151 of the Trade Regulation Act (GewO). The processing activity is also carried out on this basis and thus within the scope of the respondent's legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Regarding the alleged incompleteness of the information on processing purposes, it is noted that on the second page of the data disclosure, the respective data categories for which data of the respective data subject may be stored are listed for the respective processing purposes, namely the provision of credit information and the provision of marketing information. Whether corresponding data is available for the data types can be determined from the list on the first page of the data disclosure. Furthermore, the processing purposes are explicitly stated, namely the provision of credit information and the provision of marketing information, which corresponds to the trade licenses held by the respondent pursuant to Section 152 of the Trade Regulation Act (GewO) and Section 151 of the Trade Regulation Act (GewO). The processing activity is also carried out on this basis and thus within the scope of the respondent's legitimate interest pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

The respondent correctly states in its data disclosure that automated decision-making, including profiling, does not occur pursuant to Art. 15 (1) (h) in conjunction with Art. 22 (1) and (4) GDPR. It is of the legal opinion that the provision of credit scores to the respondent's customers does not constitute profiling within the meaning of the cited provisions. No credit score ratings are available for the complainant in this case and therefore could not have been provided or disclosed. However, it is possible that corresponding credit scores for the complainant would be generated based on inquiries from the respondent's customers. In this case, information on age, gender, residential address, participation in companies, education, as well as geographical information and payment experience would be included in the calculation. It is correct that the data provided by the respondent to the payment service provider XXXX included credit scores. These were reported as having "very good creditworthiness" due to the lack of outstanding payments. The respondent correctly stated in its data disclosure that automated decision-making, including profiling, pursuant to Article 15, paragraph 1, letter h, in conjunction with Article 22, paragraph 1 and 4 GDPR, does not take place. It is of the legal opinion that the provision of credit scores to the respondent's customers is not to be considered profiling within the meaning of the cited provisions. No credit score ratings are available for the complainant at this time, and therefore such ratings could not have been provided or disclosed. However, it is possible that corresponding credit scores for the complainant could be created based on inquiries from the respondent's customers. In this case, information on age, gender, residential address, participation in companies, education, as well as geographical information and payment history would be included in the calculation. It is true that the data provided by the respondent to the payment service provider Roman 40 included credit scores. These were reported as "very good creditworthiness" due to the lack of outstanding payments.

If the Federal Administrative Court should find that the respondent's information was initially incomplete or incorrect, it should be acknowledged that the information has now been answered on all points, so that the proceedings should be discontinued in accordance with Section 24, Paragraph 6 of the Data Protection Act.If the Federal Administrative Court should find that the respondent's information was initially incomplete or incorrect, it should be acknowledged that the information has now been answered on all points, so that the proceedings should be discontinued in accordance with Section 24, Paragraph 6 of the Data Protection Act.

For the purposes of evidence, the examination of the managing director of the respondent XXXX was requested.For the purposes of evidence, the examination of the managing director of the respondent Roman 40 was requested.

10. The respondent's statement of May 19, 2022, including the attachments, was sent to the complainant by letter from the Federal Administrative Court dated July 6, 2022, for information and possible submission of a statement.

11. The complainant submitted a statement on July 25, 2022, in which he stated that, at the time of filing the appeal against default, the question of whether any further data relating to him would be processed was no longer a matter of the proceedings. Contrary to the statements in the respondent's statement, there was no clear correlation between the data actually processed and the processing purposes pursued by the respondent. He acknowledged that the respondent processed his data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The complainant acknowledges that the respondent apparently has no further concrete information regarding the origin of the complainant's data and has subsequently merely speculated as to whether and which of the complainant's data are being processed or deleted by XXXX. Although the respondent's statements regarding how the information on payment behavior came about are also incomprehensible to the complainant, he has taken note of them, so that this aspect is not relevant to the proceedings before the Federal Administrative Court. Regarding the incompleteness of the information regarding the recipients of the data, it should be noted that it has since been clarified that the transmission was actually carried out by the respondent and that the information originally provided by XXXX was incorrect. Furthermore, in its letter of February 5, 2019, to the XXXX Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, XXXX described in detail the procedure for using the scoring values transmitted by the respondent. XXXX stated that the score values submitted by the respondent were third-party data and that XXXX was unaware of the logic of the score calculation. The complainant could therefore only obtain further explanations regarding the calculation of the score from the respective credit agency, i.e., from the respondent. The automated acceptance or rejection of an end customer (here, the complainant) was based on the automated check of whether a target score value corresponds to or exceeds the respective actual score value. The determination of the target value was a trade secret and was made jointly with the respondent. 11. The complainant submitted a statement on July 25, 2022, in which he stated that upon filing the default appeal, it was no longer a matter of the proceedings whether any further data relating to him would be processed. Contrary to the statements in the respondent's statement, there is no clear correlation between the data actually processed and the processing purposes pursued by the respondent. The complainant acknowledges that the respondent processes his data on the basis of Article 6, paragraph 1, letter f, GDPR. The complainant acknowledges that the respondent apparently has no further concrete information about the origin of the complainant's data and subsequently merely speculates about whether and which of the complainant's data is being processed or deleted by roman 40. Although the respondent's statements regarding how the information on payment behavior came about are not comprehensible to the complainant, he has taken note of them, so that this aspect is not relevant to the proceedings before the Federal Administrative Court. Regarding the incompleteness of the information regarding the recipients of the data, it should be noted that it has since been clarified that the transmission was actually carried out by the respondent and that the information originally provided by roman 40 was incorrect. Furthermore, in a letter dated February 5, 2019, to the roman 40 Data Protection and Freedom of Information Officer, roman 40 described in detail the procedure for using the scoring values transmitted by the respondent. Thus, roman 40 stated that the score values transmitted by the respondent were third-party data and that roman 40 was unaware of the logic of the score calculation. Therefore, the complainant could only obtain further explanations regarding the calculation of the score value from the respective credit agency, i.e., from the respondent. The automated acceptance or rejection of an end customer (here, the complainant) is based on the automated check of whether a target score value corresponds to or exceeds the respective actual score value. The determination of the target value was a trade secret and was made jointly with the respondent.

Contrary to the respondent's allegations, the decision in question regarding the complainant was therefore not (and certainly not significantly) influenced by a human being, and it was therefore clearly an automated decision within the meaning of Article 22 GDPR. Contrary to the respondent's allegations, the decision in question regarding the complainant was therefore not (and certainly not significantly) influenced by a human being, and it was therefore clearly an automated decision within the meaning of Article 22 GDPR.

Regarding the application of Section 24 (6) of the Data Protection Act, the complainant summarized that he continued to be aggrieved, which is why a violation of his rights had to be established in any event. The application for an award of the costs of the appeal proceedings before the respondent authority is withdrawn. Regarding the application of Section 24, Paragraph 6, of the Data Protection Act, the complainant summarized that he continues to be aggrieved, which is why a violation of his rights must be established in any event. The application for an award of the costs of the appeal proceedings before the respondent authority is withdrawn.

12. The complainant's statement of August 25, 2022, including the attachments, was sent to the respondent for information by letter from the Federal Administrative Court dated August 25, 2022. The respondent was also requested to clarify why it no longer has access to the complainant's personal data transmitted to the recipient.

13. On October 7, 2022, the respondent received a statement in which it stated, in particular, that it only provides a calculated score and that this calculated score is not stored in the respondent's file system. Each access to the file system is logged and stored for seven years. The specific query result is also stored for seven years. The respondent has now conducted a search of its own business correspondence with customers based on inquiries in 2016 and 2018. In both correspondences, a rating of 2.02 and a traffic light score of 2 were provided. The creditworthiness is therefore to be assessed as very good. No further information is available that could be provided to the complainant. The respondent has also specified the respective categories of data that could be processed for each of its purposes, i.e., the collection of credit information and the collection of marketing information. In no case is the respondent involved in the decision as to whether a business relationship is entered into with a person. The respondent is also not involved in any possible setting of thresholds.

14. In a letter dated November 7, 2023, the Federal Administrative Court announced that, by order of the Business Allocation Committee of the Federal Administrative Court dated October 20, 2023, the present appeal proceedings were transferred from the previously responsible Court Division W245 and reassigned to Court Division W108, effective November 7, 2023. The parties to the proceedings were given two weeks to submit additional comments on the subject matter of the proceedings.

15. On November 23, 2023, the complainant received a statement in which he referred to his previous submissions and suggested that the ECJ's decision of December 7, 2023, in Case C-634/21, be taken into account in the present proceedings.

16. On December 22, 2023, the respondent submitted a statement in which he referred to his previous submissions, again provided information (already provided) in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR, and further argued that he continued to hold, even in light of the ECJ's judgment of December 7, 2023, in Case C-634/21, that there was no automated decision-making, including profiling, within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR. While in the case underlying the ECJ, rating values were used to decide on a loan application, namely to assess whether a loan could be granted or not, a different purpose was present in the present case. Rating values for the complainant were provided twice, once in 2016 and once in 2018, to customer XXXX. The data was not provided for the purpose of reviewing the granting of a loan, but was exclusively attributable to the e-commerce sector. The sole reason for providing the data in the e-commerce sector was to check whether the information provided by a customer was correct and, in some cases, to assess the payment method of the potential contractual partner (payment method management). As already explained, this involved not only the information provided by the respondent, but also the customer's own experiences or third-party sources. A decision regarding payment method control, which in this case may have been made when providing a score during the data transfers in 2016 and 2018 (whether such a decision was actually made at all cannot be assessed), would in any case not have resulted in any significant disadvantages for the complainant, especially since the assessment would only have included whether the purchaser even existed or whether the information regarding his address was correct, how likely a payment default was, and which payment method should be used. While negative consequences for the person concerned are conceivable in the event of a loan being refused, a possible poor rating when making a distance purchase could, in the worst case, result in the goods having to be paid for upon receipt, or a bank transfer having to be made in advance, or possibly no payment by instalments being granted. This in no way constitutes a decision that would significantly disadvantage the complainant, which is, however, a prerequisite for the applicability of Art. 22 GDPR. 16. On December 22, 2023, the respondent submitted a statement in which it referred to its previous submissions, again provided (already provided) information pursuant to Article 15 GDPR, and further argued that it continued to maintain, even in light of the ECJ judgment of December 7, 2023, Case C-634/21, that there was no automated decision-making, including profiling, within the meaning of Article 22 GDPR. While in the case underlying the ECJ, rating values were used to decide on a loan application, namely to assess whether a loan could be granted or not, a different purpose existed in the present case. Rating values for the complainant were provided to customer Roman 40 twice, once in 2016 and once in 2018. The provision of the data was not intended to review the granting of credit, but was exclusively attributable to the e-commerce sector. The sole reason for providing the data in the e-commerce sector was to verify whether the information provided by a customer was correct and, in some cases, to assess the payment method of the potential contractual partner (payment method management). As already explained, this would not only take into account the information provided by the respondent, but also the customer's own experiences or third-party sources. A decision regarding payment method management, which may have been made in the context of providing a score during the data transmissions in 2016 and 2018 (whether such a decision was actually made at all cannot be assessed), would in any case not have resulted in any significant disadvantages for the complainant, especially since the assessment would only have included whether the customer even existed, whether the information regarding their address was correct, how likely a payment default was, and which payment method should be used. While a loan rejection could potentially have negative consequences for the person concerned, a potentially poor credit rating when making a distance purchase could, in the worst case, result in the goods being paid for upon receipt, a bank transfer being required in advance, or possibly no installment payments being granted. This in no way constitutes a decision that would significantly disadvantage the complainant, which is, however, a prerequisite for the applicability of Article 22 GDPR.

Nevertheless, the respondent could provide the following information regarding the calculation of the complainant's credit rating: Data from the complainant's creditworthiness (in particular, payment history, debt collection procedures, real estate auctions, insolvency proceedings), environmental data (data from participating companies), and sociodemographic data (e.g., age, professional training) are taken into account in determining the credit rating. Regarding the weighting, it should be noted that information on income, payment method, and industry are the main factors determining the score, with no, few, or long-ago payment defaults having a positive impact on the rating/score. Further information on the weighting, in particular the detailed provision of the calculation logic, constitutes a material trade secret of the respondent.

As before, the questioning of the managing director of respondent XXXX was requested as a witness, and it was stated that, if certain necessary information had not been included in the information provided by the respondent on November 5, 2018, the information was now in any case complete, precise, and transparent within the meaning of Art. 12 GDPR. Regarding personal scoring, detailed information regarding the influence of data on the scoring process is enclosed with this statement (and this information is also transmitted to the complainant), so that the procedure is to be followed in accordance with Section 24, Paragraph 6 of the Data Protection Act. As before, the questioning of the managing director of the respondent, roman 40, was requested as a witness, and it was stated that, if certain necessary information had not been included in the information provided by the respondent on November 5, 2018, the information is now in any case complete, precise, and transparent within the meaning of Article 12 of the GDPR. Regarding personal scoring, detailed information regarding the influence of data on the scoring process is enclosed with this statement (and this information is also transmitted to the complainant), so that the procedure is to be followed in accordance with Section 24, Paragraph 6 of the Data Protection Act.

17. The Federal Administrative Court forwarded the respondent's statements of October 7, 2022, and December 22, 2023, to the complainant for information and, if appropriate, for the complainant to submit a statement.

18. The complainant submitted a statement on January 25, 2024, in which it stated that the respondent had apparently knowingly provided incorrect information in its previous statements regarding the completeness of the information provided to the complainant and the extent of the personal data processed by the respondent with regard to the complainant, especially since a submitted rating of 2.02 and a traffic light score of 2 had now been announced, while earlier statements had expressly stated that the assessments/ratings submitted to third parties were no longer available at the time of the complainant's request.Since the respondent's statements apparently cannot be trusted, he requests that the Federal Administrative Court inspect the respondent's existing data processing operations to clarify whether the information provided by the respondent is now complete, and, as part of the witness examination of XXXX requested by the respondent, question him under oath regarding the completeness of the information provided by the respondent. With regard to the provision of information pursuant to Art. 15 (1) (h) GDPR, it is now clear, based on the most recent clarification by the ECJ in its decision in Case C-634/21, that the automated creation of probability values regarding the ability of data subjects to meet future payment obligations constitutes an automated decision if this probability value is crucial for determining whether a third party to whom this probability value is transmitted establishes, implements, or terminates a contractual relationship with the data subject. This is precisely the case in the present case. The statements made by XXXX and its data protection officer in the letter dated January 16, 2021, clearly demonstrate that the score value communicated by the respondent is the decisive basis for the decision on the establishment and implementation of the contractual relationship by XXXX. This is not changed by the fact that, according to the respondent's statements, the respondent was not involved in determining the applicable limit. The respondent's additional argument in this regard, namely that the ECJ did not restrict its decision to the granting of loans, is incomprehensible. Quite the contrary, the ECJ expressly pointed out that, especially in the typical case of a credit report (as in the present case), the legal opinion apparently still held by the respondent would lead to data subjects being unable to effectively assert their right to information pursuant to Art. 15 (1) (h) GDPR. In this context, the statement in the opinion that it is not even possible for the respondent to provide information about the logic involved and the scope of the intended effects because it has no knowledge of them is also completely incomprehensible. The general and merely exemplary statements in the opinion of December 22, 2023, do not constitute information within the meaning of Art. 15 (1) (h) GDPR, because such information must in any case be sufficiently specific to enable the respective data subject to assert any other rights under the GDPR. Even if the calculated score values are not stored in the respondent's filing system, according to the case law of the ECJ, there is an obligation to provide information about the score values that could be calculated by the respondent even in such cases. Against this background, it can therefore be assumed that the respondent must in any case also provide information about which probability values or assessments result from the data it processes, and that it must also provide the information pursuant to Art. 15 (1) (h) GDPR. 18. The complainant submitted a statement on January 25, 2024, in which it stated that the respondent had apparently knowingly provided incorrect information in its previous statements regarding the completeness of the information provided to the complainant and the extent of the personal data processed by the respondent with regard to the complainant, especially since a submitted rating of 2.02 and a traffic light score of 2 had now been announced, although earlier statements had expressly stated that the assessments/ratings submitted to third parties were no longer available at the time of the complainant's request. Since the respondent's statements apparently cannot be trusted, he requests that the Federal Administrative Court inspect the respondent's existing data processing operations to clarify whether the information provided by the respondent is now complete, and, within the framework of the witness examination of roman 40 requested by the respondent, question him under oath regarding the completeness of the information provided by the respondent. With regard to the provision of information pursuant to Article 15, paragraph 1, letter h, GDPR, it is now clear, based on the most recent clarification by the ECJ in its decision in Case C-634/21, that the automated creation of probability values regarding the ability of data subjects to meet future payment obligations constitutes an automated decision if this probability value is crucial for determining whether a third party to whom this probability value is transmitted establishes, implements, or terminates a contractual relationship with the data subject. This is precisely the case in the present case. From the statements made by roman 40 and its data protection officer in the letter dated January 16, 2021, it is clear that the score value communicated by the respondent is the decisive basis for the decision on the establishment or implementation of the contractual relationship by roman 40. This is not changed by the fact that, according to the respondent, the respondent was not involved in determining the applicable limit. The respondent's additional argument in this regard, namely that the ECJ did not restrict its decision to the granting of loans, is incomprehensible. Quite the contrary, the ECJ expressly pointed out that, especially in the typical case of a credit report (as in the present case), the legal opinion apparently still held by the respondent would lead to data subjects being unable to effectively assert their right to information pursuant to Article 15, paragraph 1, letter h, GDPR. In this context, the statement in the opinion that it is not even possible for the respondent to provide information about the logic involved and the scope of the intended effects because it has no knowledge of them is also completely incomprehensible. The general and merely exemplary statements in the opinion of December 22, 2023, do not constitute information within the meaning of Article 15, paragraph 1, letter h, GDPR, because such information must in any case be sufficiently specific to enable the respective data subject to assert any other rights under the GDPR. Even if the calculated score values are not stored in the respondent's filing system, according to the case law of the ECJ, there is an obligation to provide information about the score values that could be calculated by the respondent even in such cases. Against this background, it can therefore be assumed that the respondent must also disclose which probability values or assessments would result from the data it processed, and that it must also provide the information pursuant to Article 15, paragraph 1, letter h, GDPR.

19. The Federal Administrative Court sent the complainant's statement of January 24, 2024, to the respondent for information by way of a hearing of the parties and requested that it submit the "detailed information regarding the influence of data on the scoring" regarding the personal scoring referred to in the statement of December 22, 2023, to the Federal Administrative Court within two weeks.

20. The respondent submitted a written submission dated April 19, 2024, entitled "Notification and Reply," in which it stated that the "information sheet" entitled "Personal Scoring Data" contained information on the scoring value or rating value, on data influencing the creditworthiness environment, on data influencing the environment, and on sociodemographic information. The list contained in the information sheet specifically indicated which data must be available for a specific score to be assigned. A score of 2 was last calculated for the complainant in 2018 on behalf of XXXX. Scores of 1 to 3 are based on positive payment experiences (no payment defaults) and authorization to pursue a specific professional activity. Subsequently, a distinction is made between scoring values of 1 to 3 depending on the available sociodemographic data. For example, a higher risk of default is assumed for young individuals or companies, and the scoring value is set higher accordingly. The complainant is therefore aware of all data used to determine the scoring value, as well as the weighting. Further information on the weighting, in particular a detailed provision of the calculation logic (algorithm), would constitute a material trade secret of the respondent. Currently, no scoring values for the complainant are available or processed, which is why there is no automated decision-making process that could affect the complainant. The calculation logic for a fictitious calculation process cannot be provided. 20.

The list contained in the information sheet, in particular, indicates which data must be available for a specific value to be assigned. A score of 2 was last calculated for the complainant in 2018 on behalf of roman 40.

Subsequently, a distinction is made between scoring values of 1 to 3 depending on the available socio-demographic data. For example, a higher risk of payment default is assumed for young individuals or companies, and the scoring value is set higher accordingly. The complainant is therefore aware of all data used to determine the scoring value and the weighting. Further information on the weighting, in particular a detailed provision of the calculation logic (algorithm), would constitute a material trade secret of the respondent. Currently, no scoring values for the complainant are available or processed, and therefore no automated decision-making process exists that could affect the complainant. The calculation logic for a fictitious calculation process cannot be provided.

The "information sheet" reads as follows (formatting not reproduced faithfully):

21. In his statement of May 7, 2024, the complainant stated that neither the statement of December 22, 2023, nor the submitted "information sheet" contained any concrete information about the assessments made with regard to the complainant. As far as can be seen, this document merely represents a general and exemplary list of possible factors influencing the outcome of an assessment. In a decision dated September 8, 2020, the authority concerned explained in detail that information pursuant to Art. 15 (1) (h) GDPR must contain the parameters/input variables of a calculated assignment, their influence on the calculated assignment, information on how the parameters/input variables were determined, an explanation as to why the data subject was assigned to a specific assessment result, and a list of the profile categories that are possible for assignment, or similar information of equivalent information content that enables the data subject to exercise their rights to rectification, erasure, and review of legality. Furthermore, the authority concerned also clarified in the aforementioned decision that such information cannot be refused with a blanket reference to trade and business secrets. The information provided by the respondent in this context to date clearly does not meet these requirements. According to the case law of the ECJ, information resulting from or generated by the processing of personal data must also be disclosed. This does not involve "fictitious" or "theoretical" calculation processes; rather, the respondent itself refers on its website to the allegedly "leading risk rating models" it uses and advertises the "world's largest payment experience pool with a history spanning 35 years." Corresponding assessments are carried out fully automatically and using the data processed by the respondent in specific XXXX databases (XXXX and XXXX). 21.

22. By reference for a preliminary ruling dated February 11, 2022, VGW-101/042/791/2020-44, (filed with the ECJ on March 16, 2022, corrected by letter dated March 23, 2022), the Vienna Administrative Court referred the following questions to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling (formatting not reproduced faithfully):

23. By letter dated May 15, 2024, the Federal Administrative Court announced its intention to stay the present appeal proceedings pending the ECJ's preliminary ruling in Case C-203/22 on the request from the Vienna Administrative Court of February 11, 2022, VWG-101/042/791/2020-44, pursuant to Section 38 of the General Administrative Procedure Act (AVG) in conjunction with Section 17 of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), and provided the respondent with the opportunity to submit a written statement. The respondent was also sent the respondent's statement of May 7, 2024, for information and any comments it might have. In a letter dated May 15, 2024, the Federal Administrative Court announced its intention to stay the present appeal proceedings pending a preliminary ruling by the ECJ in Case C-203/22 on the request from the Vienna Administrative Court of February 11, 2022, VWG-101/042/791/2020-44, pursuant to Section 38 of the General Administrative Procedure Act (AVG) in conjunction with Section 17 of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), and provided the respondent with the opportunity to submit a written statement. The respondent received the appellant's statement of May 7, 2024, for information and any comments it might have.

24. In a written submission dated May 27, 2024, the appellant stated that it had no objections to the intended stay.

25. The respondent submitted a statement on June 12, 2024, in which it also did not oppose the intended suspension of the complaint proceedings and further argued that the complainant failed to recognize that the information sheet now provided was not the only information the complainant had received. The complainant had been provided with all the information he had requested, namely the parameters/input variables, profile categories, and (through the information sheet) explanations of the weighting. The complainant had been provided with all the information necessary to exercise his rights under the GDPR, but it was unclear what additional information the complainant needed to be able to assert his rights accordingly. The complainant's requests for evidence were deemed to be irrelevant.

26. By order of July 1, 2024, W108 2230691-1/39Z, the Federal Administrative Court stayed the present proceedings pending a preliminary ruling by the ECJ in Case C-203/22.

27. In its judgment of February 27, 2025, Case C-203/22, the ECJ ruled (formatting not reproduced faithfully):

"1. Article 15(1)(h) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) is to be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of automated decision-making (including profiling) within the meaning of Article 22(1) GDPR, the data subject may, as part of the right to be provided with "meaningful information about the logic involved," require the controller to explain to them, on the basis of the relevant information, in a precise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form, the procedures and principles used in the automated processing of their personal data to obtain a specific result. – for example a credit profile – were specifically applied. “1. Article 15, paragraph 1, letter h of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) is to be interpreted as meaning that in the case of automated decision-making (including profiling) within the meaning of Article 22, paragraph 1, GDPR, the data subject can require the controller, as part of the right to be provided with “meaningful information about the logic involved”, to explain to them, on the basis of the relevant information, in a precise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, the procedures and principles specifically applied in the automated processing of their personal data to obtain a specific result – for example a credit profile.

2. Article 15(1)(h) of Regulation 2016/679 is to be interpreted as meaning that, in cases where, in the opinion of the controller, the information to be communicated to the data subject pursuant to that provision includes third-party data protected by the GDPR or trade secrets within the meaning of Article 2(1) of Directive (EU) 2016/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on the protection of undisclosed know-how and confidential business information (trade secrets) against their unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure, the controller must transmit that allegedly protected information to the competent supervisory authority or court, which must weigh the competing rights and interests in order to determine the scope of the data subject’s right of access provided for in Article 15 of the GDPR.’ 2. Article 15(1)(h) of Regulation 2016/679 is to be interpreted as meaning that, in cases where, in the opinion of the controller If, in the controller's opinion, the information to be communicated to the data subject pursuant to this provision contains third-party data protected by the GDPR or trade secrets within the meaning of Article 2(1) of Directive (EU) 2016/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on the protection of undisclosed know-how and confidential business information (trade secrets) against unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure, the controller shall transmit this allegedly protected information to the competent supervisory authority or court, which shall weigh the conflicting rights and interests in order to determine the scope of the data subject's right of access provided for in Article 15 of the GDPR.

The ECJ states in part (formatting not reproduced faithfully):

“49 In order to ensure that the data subject is able to fully understand the information communicated to him or her by the controller, Article 12(1) GDPR requires the controller to take appropriate measures to provide, in particular, the data subject with those data and information in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 May 2023, Austrian Data Protection Authority and CRIF, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph 38). “49 In order to ensure that the data subject is able to fully understand the information communicated to him or her by the controller, Article 12(a), (b), (s), (1) GDPR requires the controller to take appropriate measures to provide, in particular, the data subject with those data and information in a concise, transparent, intelligible and in an easily accessible form, using clear and plain language (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 May 2023, Austrian Data Protection Authority and CRIF, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph 38).

50 An examination of the context of Article 15(1)(h) GDPR thus confirms the interpretation resulting from the analysis of the expressions used in that provision, according to which ‘meaningful information about the logic involved’ in an automated decision-making process, within the meaning of that provision, includes all relevant information on the process and principles of automated processing of personal data to achieve a specific result and, in addition, due to the requirement of transparency, that information must be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form.50 An examination of the context of Article 15(1)(h) GDPR thus confirms the interpretation resulting from the analysis of the expressions used in that provision, according to which ‘meaningful information about the The "logic involved" in automated decision-making within the meaning of this provision must include all relevant information on the procedure and principles of automated processing of personal data to achieve a specific result and, in view of the requirement of transparency, this information must also be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form.

51 Finally, as regards the purpose of the GDPR, it should be noted that its objective is, in particular, to ensure a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Article 16 TFEU, which is enshrined as a fundamental right in Article 8 of the Charter and complements the right to private life, enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 October 2024, Schrems (Communication of data to the general public), C-446/21, EU:C:2024:834, paragraph 45 and the case-law cited). 51 Finally, as regards the purpose of the GDPR, it should be noted that its objective is, in particular, to ensure a high level of protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to the protection of personal data, guaranteed by Article 16 TFEU, which is enshrined as a fundamental right in Article 8 of the Charter and the right to a private life enshrined in Article 7 of the Charter is complemented (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 October 2024, Schrems (communication of data to the general public), C-446/21, EU:C:2024:834, paragraph 45 and the case-law cited).

52 Thus, as is clear from recital 11 thereof, the GDPR aims to strengthen and precisely define the rights of data subjects (judgment of 4 May 2023, Austrian Data Protection Authority and CRIF, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph 33 and the case-law cited).

53 As regards, specifically, the right of access provided for in Article 15 of the GDPR, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, it must enable the data subject to verify whether the data concerning him or her are accurate and whether they are being processed lawfully (judgments of 4 May 2023, Austrian Data Protection Authority and CRIF, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph 34, and of 26 October 2023, FT (Copies of the patient file), C-307/22, EU:C:2023:811, paragraph 73).53 As regards, specifically, the right of access provided for in Article 15 of the GDPR, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, it must enable the data subject to verify whether the data concerning him or her are accurate and whether they are being processed lawfully (judgments of 4 May 2023, Austrian Data Protection Authority and CRIF, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph 34, and of 26 October 2023, FT (Copies of the patient file), C-307/22, EU:C:2023:811, paragraph 73).

54 This right of access is necessary to enable the data subject to exercise, where appropriate, their right to rectification, their right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’) and their right to restriction of processing, which they are entitled to under Articles 16, 17 and 18 of the GDPR, respectively, as well as their right to object to the processing of their personal data provided for in Article 21 of the GDPR or their rights to a judicial remedy or to compensation for damages provided for in Articles 79 and 82 of the GDPR (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 May 2023, Austrian Data Protection Authority and CRIF, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph 35). 54 This right of access is necessary to enable the data subject to exercise, where appropriate, their right to rectification, their right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’) and their right to restriction of processing, which they are entitled to under Articles 16, 17 and 18 of the GDPR, respectively. as well as to exercise their right to object to the processing of their personal data provided for in Article 21 of the GDPR or their rights to a judicial remedy or to compensation provided for in Articles 79 and 82 of the GDPR (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 May 2023, Austrian Data Protection Authority and CRIF, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph 35).

55 In particular, in the specific context of the adoption of a decision based solely on automated processing, the right of the data subject referred to in Article 15(1)(f) of the GDPR is intended to ensure that h GDPR is primarily intended to enable the data subject to effectively exercise the rights conferred on him or her by Article 22(3) GDPR, namely the right to express his or her point of view and the right to contest the decision.55 Particularly in the specific context of the adoption of a decision based solely on automated processing, the data subject's right to receive the information referred to in Article 15(1)(b),(u),(c),(h),(s),(t), and(h) GDPR is primarily intended to enable the data subject to effectively exercise the rights conferred on him or her by Article 22(3) GDPR, namely the right to express his or her point of view and the right to contest the decision.

56 If data subjects who are subject to an automated decision, including profiling, are not able to understand the reasons for that decision before expressing their point of view or contesting that decision, those rights would not fully achieve their purpose of protecting those data subjects against the specific risks to their rights and freedoms that are presented by the automated processing of personal data (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 December 2023, SCHUFA Holding and Others (Scoring), C-634/21, EU:C:2023:957, paragraph 57). 56 If data subjects who are subject to an automated decision, including profiling, are not able to understand the reasons for that decision before expressing their point of view or contesting that decision, those rights would not fully achieve their purpose of protecting those data subjects against the specific risks to their rights and freedoms that are presented by the automated processing of personal data (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 December 2023, SCHUFA Holding and Others (Scoring), C-634/21, EU:C:2023:957, paragraph 57). December 2023, SCHUFA Holding and Others \[Scoring\], C-634/21, EU:C:2023:957, paragraph 57).

57 According to Recital 71 of the GDPR, where the data subject is subject to a decision based solely on automated processing and which significantly affects him or her, the data subject must have the right to an explanation of that decision. As the Advocate General explained in point 67 of his Opinion, Article 15(1)(h) GDPR therefore provides the data subject with a genuine right to an explanation of the functioning of the automated decision-making mechanism to which he or she has been subjected and of the result of that decision. 57 According to Recital 71 of the GDPR, where the data subject is subject to a decision based solely on automated processing and which significantly affects him or her, the data subject must have the right to an explanation of that decision. As the Advocate General explained in point 67 of his Opinion, Article 15(1)(h) GDPR thus provides the data subject with a genuine right to an explanation of the functioning of the automated decision-making mechanism to which that person has been subjected and of the result of that decision.

58 From an examination of the objectives of the GDPR, and in particular of Article 15(1)(h) GDPR, it follows that the right to "meaningful information about the logic involved" in automated decision-making, within the meaning of that provision, must be understood as a right to an explanation of the procedure and principles applied in the automated processing of the data subject's personal data in order to arrive at a particular result – such as a credit profile – on the basis of those data. In order for the data subject to effectively exercise the rights granted to them by the GDPR, and in particular Article 22(3) thereof, the relevant information must be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form within the framework of this explanation.58 From an examination of the objectives of the GDPR, and in particular Article 15(1)(h) GDPR, it follows that the right to "meaningful information about the logic involved" in automated decision-making within the meaning of this provision is to be understood as a right to an explanation of the procedure and principles used in the automated processing of the data subject's personal data to arrive at a specific result—such as a credit profile—on the basis of those data. In order for the data subject to effectively exercise the rights granted to them by the GDPR, and in particular Article 22(3) thereof, the relevant information must be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form within the framework of this explanation.

59 Neither the mere transmission of a complex mathematical formula (such as an algorithm) nor the detailed description of each step of an automated decision-making process meets these requirements, as neither constitutes a sufficiently precise and comprehensible explanation.

60 As is clear from page 28 of the Guidelines on automated individual decision-making, including profiling, for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679, referred to in paragraph 45 of the present judgment, the controller should, first, find simple ways to inform the data subject of the considerations or criteria underlying the decision-making process. Second, the GDPR obliges the controller to provide meaningful information about the logic involved, "not necessarily a detailed explanation of the algorithms used or the disclosure of the entire algorithm."60 As is clear from Session 28 of the Guidelines on automated individual decision-making, including profiling, for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679, referred to in paragraph 45 of the present judgment, the controller should find simple ways to inform the data subject about the considerations or criteria underlying the decision-making process. Second, the GDPR obliges the controller to provide meaningful information about the logic involved, "not necessarily a detailed explanation of the algorithms used or the disclosure of the entire algorithm."

61 The "meaningful information about the logic involved" in automated decision-making within the meaning of Article 15(1)(h) GDPR must therefore describe the procedure and principles specifically applied in such a way that the data subject can understand which of their personal data were used and how in the context of the automated decision-making process in question, without the complexity of the steps involved in the automated decision-making process being such that the controller could be released from its obligation to provide explanations.61 The "meaningful information about the logic involved" in automated decision-making within the meaning of Article 15(1)(h) GDPR must therefore describe the procedure and principles specifically applied in such a way that the data subject can understand which of their personal data were used and how in the context of the automated decision-making process in question, without the complexity of the steps involved in the automated decision-making process being such that the controller could be released from its obligation to provide explanations.

62 As regards, more specifically, profiling such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the referring court might, in particular, consider it sufficiently transparent and comprehensible to inform the data subject of the extent to which a variation in the personal data taken into account would have led to a different result.

63 Furthermore, as regards the question whether the information communicated must enable the data subject to verify the accuracy of the personal data concerning him or her that form the basis of the automated decision-making process, it should be noted that the right to access those data is not based on Article 15(1)(h) of the GDPR, but on the introductory sentence of Article 15(1) of the GDPR, which guarantees the data subject the right to verify the accuracy of those data. This follows from the case-law cited in paragraph 53 of the present judgment.63 Furthermore, as regards the question whether the information communicated must enable the data subject to verify the accuracy of the personal data concerning him or her that form the basis of the automated decision-making, it should be noted that the right to access those data is not based on Article 15(1)(h) of the GDPR, but on the introductory sentence of Article 15(1) of the GDPR, which guarantees the data subject the right to verify the accuracy of those data; this follows from the case-law cited in paragraph 53 of the present judgment.

64 Finally, as regards the referring court’s finding that D & B’s CK is based on Article 15(1)(h) of the GDPR, In order to contest the Commission’s view, first, that the information communicated pursuant to Article 1(h) of the GDPR is inaccurate, since, on the basis of the ‘actual’ profiling, CK must be regarded as lacking financial capacity, even though that information suggests the opposite, it should be noted that, although, according to the referring court, the non-compliance thus established is due to the fact that D & B did not inform CK of the profiling concerning her which had been carried out for the mobile operator and on the basis of which CK was refused the conclusion or renewal of a contract, that fact could be remedied by means of the right to access the credit profile thus drawn up. In this regard, it is clear from the Court’s case-law that personal data generated by the controller itself fall within the scope of Article 14 of the GDPR (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 November 2024, Másdi, C-169/23, EU:C:2024:988, paragraph 48).64 Finally, as regards the referring court’s finding that the information communicated to CK by D & B pursuant to Article 15A, b, s, 1(h) of the GDPR is inaccurate, since, according to the ‘actual’ profiling, CK must be considered to have no financial means, even though that information suggests the opposite, it should be noted that, although, according to the referring court, the non-compliance thus established is due to the fact that D & B did not inform CK of the profiling concerning her that had been carried out for the mobile operator and on the basis of which CK was refused the conclusion or renewal of a contract, that fact was not relied upon by way of the right of access to the The credit profile would have to be remedied. In this regard, it follows from the case law of the Court of Justice that personal data generated by the controller itself fall within Article 14 of the GDPR (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 November 2024, Másdi, C-169/23, EU:C:2024:988, paragraph 48).

65 However, an explanation of the differences between the result of such "actual" profiling – assuming it was carried out – and the result communicated to CK by D&B, which, according to D&B, was arrived at by "equivalent weighting" of the data concerning CK, does indeed fall within the scope of "meaningful information on the logic involved" in the profiling thus created. In line with the considerations in paragraph 58 of the present judgment, D&B would therefore have to explain, in a precise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form, the procedure and principles on the basis of which the "actual" profiling was carried out.

…

69 Furthermore, according to Recital 63 of this Regulation, the data subject’s right of access to personal data concerning him or her that has been collected should not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others, such as trade secrets or intellectual property rights, and in particular software copyright.

70 However, this must not lead to the data subject being denied any information. Article 23(1)(i) GDPR essentially provides that a restriction of the scope of the obligations and rights provided for, inter alia, in Article 15 GDPR is only possible if such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.70 However, this must not lead to the data subject being denied any information. Article 23(1)(i) GDPR essentially provides that a restriction of the scope of the obligations and rights provided for, inter alia, in Article 15 GDPR is only possible if such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The exercise of the rights and obligations provided for in Article 15 of the GDPR is only possible if such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

71 With regard to the related right to receive a copy, enshrined in Article 15(4) GDPR, the Court has already held that its exercise should not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others, such as trade secrets or intellectual property rights, and in particular, copyright in software (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 May 2023, Austrian Data Protection Authority and CRIF, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph 43). 71 With regard to the related right to receive a copy, enshrined in Article 15(4) GDPR, the Court has already held that its exercise should not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others, such as trade secrets or intellectual property rights, and in particular, copyright in software (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 May 2023, Austrian Data Protection Authority and CRIF, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph 43).

72 In this context, the Court has held that, in the event of a conflict between the exercise of the right to full and comprehensive access to personal data, on the one hand, and the rights or freedoms of other persons, on the other, the rights in question must be balanced. Where possible, the methods of transferring personal data must be chosen which do not infringe the rights or freedoms of others, provided that such considerations "must not lead to a refusal to provide the data subject with any information," as follows from recital 63 of the GDPR (judgment of 4 May 2023, Austrian Data Protection Authority and CRIF, C-487/21, EU:C:2023:369, paragraph 44).

73 As regards the question of how the right of access under Article 15(1)(h) of the GDPR may be implemented in a way that safeguards the rights and freedoms of other persons, it should be noted that, according to case-law, a national court may consider that personal data must be transmitted to it by parties or third parties in order to enable it to weigh up the interests at stake in full knowledge of the facts and in compliance with the principle of proportionality. That assessment may, where appropriate, lead it to authorise the full or partial disclosure to the other party of the personal data thus communicated to it if it considers that such disclosure does not go beyond what is necessary to ensure the effective exercise of the rights conferred on individuals by Article 47 of the Charter (judgment of 2 March 2023, Norra Stockholm Bygg, C-268/21, EU:C:2023:145, paragraph 58).73 As regards the question of how the right of access under Article 15(1)(h) GDPR may be implemented in a way that safeguards the rights and freedoms of others, it should be noted that, according to case-law, a national court may consider that personal data of parties or third parties must be communicated to it in order to enable it to weigh up the interests at stake in full knowledge of the facts and in compliance with the principle of proportionality. This assessment may, where appropriate, lead it to authorize the full or partial disclosure to the other party of the personal data thus transmitted to it if it considers that such disclosure does not go beyond what is necessary to ensure the effective exercise of the rights conferred on individuals by Article 47 of the Charter (judgment of 2 March 2023, Norra Stockholm Bygg, C-268/21, EU:C:2023:145, paragraph 58).

74 As the Advocate General observed in point 94 of his Opinion, that case-law can be fully applied to a situation where the information which must be made available to the data subject in the exercise of the right of access guaranteed by Article 15(1)(h) of the GDPR is liable to adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other persons, in particular because it contains personal data of third parties protected by the GDPR or a trade secret within the meaning of Article 2(1) of Directive 2016/943. In this case, too, this information must be transmitted to the competent supervisory authority or court, which must weigh the conflicting rights and interests in order to determine the scope of the data subject's right to access the personal data concerning him or her.74 As explained by the Advocate General in point 94 of his Opinion, this case law can be fully applied to the case where the information that must be provided to the data subject within the framework of the right of access guaranteed by Article 15(1)(h) of the GDPR is likely to adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other persons, in particular because it contains personal data of third parties protected by the GDPR or a trade secret within the meaning of Article 2(1) of Directive 2016/943. In this case, too, this information must be transmitted to the competent supervisory authority or court, which must weigh the conflicting rights and interests in order to determine the scope of the data subject's right to access the personal data concerning him or her.

75 As regards the need to determine this on a case-by-case basis, Article 15(1)(h) GDPR precludes, in particular, the application of a provision such as Section 4(6) of the Data Protection Act, which fundamentally excludes the data subject’s right to information provided for in Article 15 GDPR if the information would jeopardise a business or trade secret of the controller or of a third party. A Member State cannot definitively prescribe the outcome of a balancing of the conflicting rights and interests prescribed by Union law and carried out on a case-by-case basis (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 December 2023, SCHUFAHolding and Others (Scoring), C-634/21, EU:C:2023:957, paragraph 70 and the case-law cited therein)."75 With regard to the need to determine this on a case-by-case basis, Article 15(1)(h) GDPR precludes, in particular, the application of a provision such as paragraph 4(6) DSG, which fundamentally excludes the data subject's right to information provided for in Article 15 GDPR if the information would jeopardise a business or trade secret of the controller or a third party. A Member State cannot definitively prescribe the outcome of a balancing of the conflicting rights and interests prescribed by Union law and carried out on a case-by-case basis (see, to that effect, judgment of December 7, 2023, SCHUFAHolding and Others \[Scoring\], C-634/21, EU:C:2023:957, para. 70 and the case law cited therein)."

28. The Federal Administrative Court subsequently announced that the preliminary ruling by the ECJ, which had given rise to the stay of the appeal proceedings, had been issued and that the proceedings were thus deemed to have continued. The Federal Administrative Court gave the parties the opportunity to submit written comments by way of a hearing. The Federal Administrative Court extended the deadline for submitting comments from March 20, 2025, to April 17, 2025, at the respondent's request.

29. The complainant submitted a statement in a written submission dated April 17, 2025, in which he summarized that the respondent had not provided any further information and that, therefore, the Federal Administrative Court would have to decide on the outstanding points of complaint. The ECJ's legal opinion in judgment C-203/22 fully corresponds to the complainant's previous submissions; it is therefore obvious that the information provided so far by the respondent does not comply with the requirements of Article 15(1)(h) GDPR and that the complaint should therefore be upheld. 29. The complainant submitted a statement in a written submission dated April 17, 2025, in which he summarized that the respondent had not provided any further information and that, therefore, the Federal Administrative Court would have to decide on the outstanding points of complaint. The ECJ's legal opinion in judgment C-203/22 fully corresponds to the complainant's previous arguments; it is therefore obvious that the information provided so far by the respondent does not comply with the requirements of Article 15, paragraph one, letter h, GDPR and that the complaint should therefore be upheld.

30. The respondent also submitted a statement on April 17, 2025, in which it summarized the information previously provided to the complainant in connection with the creditworthiness assessment and the calculation of the rating/score, and stated that the complainant had already received all the necessary data and information pursuant to Art. 15 (1) (h) GDPR. The ECJ came to the clear conclusion that neither a mathematical formula (algorithm) nor a detailed description of each step of the automated decision-making process needed to be provided. Should the Federal Administrative Court, however, take a different view, according to which further information and data, in particular the specific calculation method, should be disclosed, the respondent again objects that this would disclose trade secrets worthy of consideration (within the meaning of Article 2(1) of Directive 2016/943), and therefore submits the alternative motion below that further information and data should only be provided to the Federal Administrative Court (black box) and that the Federal Administrative Court should weigh the conflicting interests in order to determine the specific scope of the right to information. 30. On April 17, 2025, the respondent also submitted a statement in which it summarized the information previously provided to the complainant in connection with the assessment of creditworthiness and the calculation of the rating/score and stated that the complainant had already received all the necessary data and information pursuant to Article 15, paragraph 1, letter h, GDPR. The ECJ comes to the unequivocal conclusion that neither a mathematical formula (algorithm) nor a detailed description of each step of the automated decision-making process needs to be provided. However, should the Federal Administrative Court take a different view, according to which further information and data, in particular the specific calculation process, would have to be disclosed, the respondent again argues that this would disclose trade secrets worthy of consideration (within the meaning of Article 2, No. 1 of Directive 2016/943) and therefore submits the alternative request below that further information and data be provided only to the Federal Administrative Court (black box), and that the Federal Administrative Court weigh the competing interests to determine the specific scope of the right to information.

31. By letter dated April 22, 2025, the Federal Administrative Court sent the complainant's statement of April 17, 2025, to the respondent by way of a hearing of the parties, for information and any comments by April 29, 2025 at the latest, and requested the respondent, within the same deadline, to submit to the Federal Administrative Court all other available information and data, including explanations of the procedure and principles of automated processing of the complainant's personal data, in particular the functioning of the algorithm and the result in an intelligible form, as well as all information enabling the accuracy and admissibility of the automated decision-making to be verified, including the considerations or criteria underlying the decision-making and their weighting, as well as information on which of the personal data were used and how in the context of the automated decision-making, and an explanation of why the complainant was assigned a particular assessment result. Protected information was to be marked accordingly and the respective interest in confidentiality was to be specifically explained. The Federal Administrative Court stated that, in view of the already extended deadline for submitting a response to the ECJ judgment of February 27, 2025, Case C-203/22, which already required the submission of the above-mentioned information and data, the deadline set appeared to be reasonable.

32. On April 25, 2025, the respondent submitted a "request" in this regard, stating that the respondent had provided all information and data available to it regarding the complainant and requesting information on which of the provided information and data the Federal Administrative Court considered insufficient.

33. On April 29, 2025, the complainant submitted a response in which he summarized that the information provided by the respondent still did not comply with the ECJ's requirements. The submitted documents, neither individually nor collectively, provide any concrete information regarding the data actually used in calculating the score for the complainant, nor regarding the procedure chosen by the respondent in calculating the score.

34. In a submission dated April 29, 2025, the respondent requested that the deadline for submitting a response be extended by four weeks, to April 29, 2025 at the latest.

35. The complainant's response dated April 29, 2025, was sent to the respondent and the authority being sued by the Federal Administrative Court.

II. The Federal Administrative Court considered:

1. Findings:

The explanations above under point I. regarding the procedural course (administrative proceedings) and the facts of the case are used as a basis. regarding the course of the proceedings (administrative proceedings) and the facts of the case.

2. Evaluation of evidence:

These findings are derived from the administrative files and the court files in question. The factual circumstances relevant to the decision have been clarified – for example, the extent of the information provided by the respondent is clear from the respondent's statements and is not disputed – and the relevant investigation results and documents are contained in the submitted administrative files and the court files.

In this regard, it should be noted that the respondent, with hg. In a letter dated April 22, 2025, the complainant was specifically requested to submit to the Federal Administrative Court all other available information and data, including explanations of the procedure and principles of automated processing of the complainant's personal data, in particular also of the functioning of the algorithm and the result in an intelligible form, as well as all information that makes it possible to verify the correctness and admissibility of the automated decision-making, including the considerations or criteria underlying the decision-making and their weighting, as well as information on which of the personal data were used in what way within the framework of the automated decision-making, and an explanation of why the complainant was assigned a specific assessment result, whereby protected information was to be marked accordingly and the respective interest in confidentiality was to be specifically explained. However, the respondent subsequently neither submitted any further information or data, nor specifically demonstrated the actual existence of trade secrets, but merely submitted a general "request" to the Federal Administrative Court, in which - contrary to the submissions in the opinion of April 17, 2025 - it was stated that the respondent had provided all information and data available to it regarding the complainant and requested information as to which of the provided information and data the Federal Administrative Court considered insufficient. However, in view of the detailed hg. Instruction of April 22, 2025 – there is no doubt as to what additional information the respondent would have had to submit, especially since the respondent's obligation to transmit this (allegedly protected) information to the Federal Administrative Court already arises from the ECJ judgment of February 27, 2025, Case C-203/22, and the respondent itself submitted the request for the provision of further information and data (black box) to the Federal Administrative Court in its statement of April 17, 2025. The respondent cannot therefore invoke any lack of clarity. The complainant also understood the Federal Administrative Court's instruction and emphasized in its statement of April 29, 2025, that the procedure outlined by the Federal Administrative Court complies with the requirements of the ECJ decision in Case C-203/22. Against this background, there was therefore no reason to answer the respondent's "request" and to comply with the respondent's (repeated) request for an extension of the deadline by a further four weeks. Furthermore, the information and data requested or self-provided (regarding the actual existence of trade secrets) were not submitted to the Federal Administrative Court by the respondent even after this deadline had expired. The fruitless expiry of a deadline set by a party for itself to submit evidence (in this case: provision of further information and data solely to the Federal Administrative Court \[black box\] so that it can determine the scope of the right to information) means that the Federal Administrative Court can make its decision without further delay (cf. VwGH 08.03.1994, 91/08/0133). It should be noted in this regard that the respondent with hg. In a letter dated 22 April 2025, the complainant was specifically requested to provide the Federal Administrative Court with all other available information and data, including explanations of the procedure and principles of automated processing of the complainant’s personal data, in particular of the functioning of the algorithm and the result in an intelligible form, as well as all information that makes it possible to verify the accuracy and admissibility of the automated decision-making, including the considerations underlying the decision-making process.Criteria and their weighting, as well as information on which of the personal data were used in what way within the framework of automated decision-making, and an explanation as to why the complainant was assigned a particular assessment result, whereby protected information was to be marked accordingly and the respective interest in confidentiality was to be specifically explained. However, the respondent subsequently neither submitted any further information or data nor specifically explained the actual existence of trade secrets, but merely submitted a general “request” to the Federal Administrative Court in which – contrary to the arguments in the statement of April 17, 2025 – it was stated that the respondent had provided all information and data available to it on the complainant and a request was made as to which of the information and data provided the Federal Administrative Court considered to be insufficient. However, in view of the detailed hg. Instruction of April 22, 2025 – there is no doubt as to what additional information the respondent would have had to submit, especially since the respondent's obligation to transmit this (allegedly protected) information to the Federal Administrative Court already arises from the ECJ judgment of February 27, 2025, Case C-203/22, and the respondent itself submitted the request for the provision of further information and data (black box) to the Federal Administrative Court in its statement of April 17, 2025. The respondent cannot therefore invoke any lack of clarity. The complainant also understood the Federal Administrative Court's instruction and emphasized in its statement of April 29, 2025, that the procedure outlined by the Federal Administrative Court complies with the requirements of the ECJ decision in Case C-203/22. Against this background, there was therefore no reason to answer the respondent's "request" and to grant the respondent's (repeated) request for an extension of the deadline by a further four weeks. Furthermore, the requested or self-provided information and data (regarding the actual existence of trade secrets) were not submitted by the respondent to the Federal Administrative Court even after the expiration of this deadline. However, the fruitless expiration of a deadline set by a party for the submission of evidence (here: providing further information and data solely to the Federal Administrative Court \[black box\] so that it could determine the scope of the right to information) means that the Federal Administrative Court can make its decision without further delay (cf. VwGH March 8, 1994, 91/08/0133).

This establishes the essential facts for the decision. There is therefore no need for further clarification of the facts by taking further evidence, such as the inspection of the respondent's existing data processing operations and/or the requested examination of the respondent's managing director as a witness, as requested by the complainant, and thus the conduct of an oral hearing.

3.2. Regarding the procedural requirements:

3.2.1. Regarding the admissibility of the appeal due to a breach of the obligation to decide (default appeal) and the jurisdiction of the Federal Administrative Court:

According to Section 73 (1) of the Administrative Court Act (AVG), unless otherwise provided in the administrative regulations, the authorities are obligated to issue a decision on applications from parties (Section 8) and appeals without undue delay, but no later than six months after their receipt. According to Section 73 (1) of the Administrative Court Act (AVG), unless otherwise provided in the administrative regulations, the authorities are obligated to issue a decision on applications from parties (Section 8) and appeals without undue delay, but no later than six months after their receipt.

According to Section 8 (1) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), a default appeal can only be filed if the authority has not decided the matter within six months, or if a shorter or longer decision period is provided for by law. The time limit begins on the date the application for a decision on the merits is received by the legally designated body. The appeal must be dismissed if the delay is not due to the authority's predominant fault. According to Section 8, Paragraph 1, of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), an appeal based on default may only be filed if the authority has not decided the matter within six months, or within that six months if a shorter or longer decision period is provided for by law. The time limit begins on the date the application for a decision on the merits is received by the legally designated body. The appeal must be dismissed if the delay is not due to the authority's predominant fault.

Predominant ("objective") fault on the part of the authority is to be assumed if it was not prevented from making its decision by the party's culpable conduct or by insurmountable obstacles (cf. VwGH 24.11.2022, Ra 2022/01/0247, with reference to VwGH 19.06.2018, Ra 2018/03/0021, with further references). Predominant ("objective") fault on the part of the authority is to be assumed if it was not prevented from making its decision by the party's culpable conduct or by insurmountable obstacles (cf. VwGH 24.11.2022, Ra 2022/01/0247, with reference to VwGH 19.06.2018, Ra 2018/03/0021, with further references).

In the present case, the respondent authority did not decide on this administrative matter within the six-month decision-making period, nor did it demonstrate that it was prevented from making the decision due to the party's negligent conduct or insurmountable obstacles. Instead, it argued, to the contrary, that the appeal against default was justified and that, due to the increased workload and the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the respondent authority was unfortunately unable to subsequently issue the decision, which is why jurisdiction was transferred ex lege to the Federal Administrative Court.

The appeal against default filed on January 13, 2020, is therefore admissible, which is why the Federal Administrative Court now has jurisdiction to decide on the data protection complaint (see VwGH September 19, 2017, Ro 2017/20/0001, with reference to VwGH May 27, 2015, Ra 2015/19/0075). The appeal against default filed on January 13, 2020, is therefore admissible, which is why the Federal Administrative Court now has jurisdiction to decide on the data protection complaint (see VwGH September 19, 2017, Ro 2017/20/0001, with reference to VwGH May 27, 2015, Ra 2015/19/0075).

3.3.2. Applied to the present case, this means the following:

3.3.2.1. First, it should be noted that the subject matter of the proceedings is exclusively an alleged violation of the right to information pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR. Therefore, neither the authority concerned nor the Federal Administrative Court was required to examine in the present case whether, as also alleged by the complainant, some of the complainant's data—addresses and previous positions held by the complainant, which have been out of date or terminated for many years—are being processed by the respondent, which are in any case not necessary to achieve the stated processing purposes. In his statement of July 25, 2022, the complainant himself also states that the question of whether the processing of such data is permissible is not the subject of these appeal proceedings. 3.3.2.1. First, it should be noted that the subject of these proceedings is exclusively an alleged violation of the right to information pursuant to Article 15 of the GDPR. Therefore, neither the authority concerned nor the Federal Administrative Court was required to examine in the present case whether – as also alleged by the complainant – some of the complainant's data – addresses and previous positions held by the complainant, which have been out of date or have ended for many years – are being processed by the respondent, which are in any case not necessary to achieve the stated processing purposes.

This information must be provided so that the purpose of this data subject right can be fulfilled, namely to provide the data subject with insight into whether and how their personal data is being processed (Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation, Art. 15 GDPR \[as of December 1, 2020, rdb.at\], para. 2). The claim ranges, so to speak, from the "whether" of data processing (Article 15 (1) Hs. 1 GDPR) to the "how" (Article 15 (1) Hs. 2 lit. a-h, (2) GDPR) to the "what" (Article 15 (1) Hs. 2, (3) GDPR). This information must be provided so that the purpose of this data subject right can be fulfilled, namely to give the data subject insight into the "whether and how" of the processing of their personal data (Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Article 15, GDPR \[as of December 1, 2020, rdb.at\] para. 2). The claim ranges, so to speak, from the "whether" of data processing (Article 15, paragraph 1, sentence 1 GDPR) to the "how" (Article 15, paragraph 1, sentence 2, letters a, -, h,, paragraph 2, GDPR) to the "what" (Article 15, paragraph 1, sentence 2, paragraph 3, GDPR).

If the controller processes data of the data subject, they must provide information about the specific characteristics, including additional information, and hand over a copy of the data themselves (Article 15 (1) (a) to (h), (2), (3), and (4) GDPR; Haidinger in Knyrim, DatKomm Article 15 GDPR \[as of December 1, 2021, rdb.at\], para. 27; Jahnel, Commentary on the General Data Protection Regulation Article 15 GDPR \[as of December 1, 2020, rdb.at\], paras. 2, 14 et seq.). If the controller processes data of the data subject, they must provide information about the specific characteristics, including additional information, and hand over a copy of the data themselves (Article 15 (1) (a) to (h), (2), (3), and (4) GDPR; Haidinger in Knyrim, DatKomm Article 15, GDPR \[As of December 1, 2021, rdb.at\] para. 27; Jahnel, Commentary on Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR \[As of December 1, 2020, rdb.at\] para. 2, 14 et seq.

It is undisputed that the respondent confirmed to the complainant in a letter of information dated 5 November 2018 that the complainant's personal data was being processed, that the respondent had provided a copy of the personal data being processed, and further that the respondent had provided complete information about the categories of personal data being processed (Article 15 (1) (b) GDPR), the planned duration for which the personal data would be stored or, if this is not possible, the criteria for determining this duration (Article 15 (1) (d) GDPR) and the rights of the data subject and the existence of a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Article 15 (1) (e) and (f) GDPR). The complainant further admitted to having received (subsequently) complete information about the recipients to whom the personal data were disclosed (Article 15 (1) (c) GDPR), the legal basis for the processing and the origin of the data (Article 15 (1) (g) GDPR). It is undisputed that the respondent confirmed to the complainant in a letter of information dated 5 November 2018 that the complainant’s personal data was being processed, that the respondent had provided a copy of the personal data being processed, and further that the respondent had provided complete information about the categories of personal data being processed (Article 15, paragraph one, letter b, GDPR), the planned duration for which the personal data would be stored or, if this is not possible, the criteria for determining this duration (Article 15, paragraph one, letter d, GDPR) and the rights of the data subject and the existence of a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Article 15, paragraph one, letters e and f, GDPR). The complainant further acknowledged having (subsequently) received complete information about the recipients to whom the personal data were disclosed (Article 15, paragraph 1, letter c, GDPR), the legal basis for the processing, and the origin of the data (Article 15, paragraph 1, letter g, GDPR).

The complainant's data protection complaint of December 19, 2018, was therefore to be dismissed as unfounded in this regard, especially since, according to the case law of the Administrative Court, there is no longer any scope for establishing a violation under Article 15 GDPR in the case of subsequent (even if late) provision of information (cf. VwGH October 19, 2022, Ro 2022/04/0001, and VwGH March 6, 2024, Ro 2021/04/0030 to 0031). The complainant's data protection complaint of December 19, 2018, was therefore to be dismissed as unfounded in this regard, especially since, according to the case law of the Administrative Court, there is no longer any scope for establishing a violation under Article 15 GDPR in the case of subsequent (even if late) provision of information (cf. VwGH 19.10.2022, Ro 2022/04/0001, and VwGH 06.03.2024, Ro 2021/04/0030 to 0031).

3.3.2.2.2. Regarding information about the purposes of processing (Article 15 (1) (a) GDPR):

According to Article 15 (1) (a) GDPR, the purposes of processing within the meaning of Article 5 (1) (b) GDPR must be disclosed. According to the principles governing processing set out in Article 5 (1) (b) GDPR, personal data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and may not be further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes. These purposes must be communicated to the data subject by the controller. The purposes of processing are clear when they are sufficiently defined and fulfill a certain limiting function (cf. Hötzendorfer/Tschohl/Kastelitz in Knyrim, DatKomm Art. 5 GDPR \[as of May 7, 2020, rdb.at\] para. 25). According to Article 15, paragraph 1, letter a, GDPR, the purposes of processing within the meaning of Article 5, paragraph 1, letter b, GDPR must be disclosed. According to the principles governing processing set out in Article 5, paragraph 1, letter b, GDPR, personal data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and may not be further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes. These purposes must be communicated to the data subject by the controller. The purposes of processing are clear when they are sufficiently defined and fulfill a certain limiting function (cf. Hötzendorfer/Tschohl/Kastelitz in Knyrim, DatKomm Article 5, GDPR \[as of May 7, 2020, rdb.at\], para. 25).

Article 12 (1) GDPR follows the same line, but in more detail, and requires a "precise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language" (cf. also Souhrada-Kirchmayer in Jahnel, Datenschutzrecht \[2017\], Das Rechtsinformationen nach der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung, p. 86). Without sufficient clarity in the definition of purposes, the principle of purpose limitation would be ineffective. A too vague definition of the purposes would also contradict the transparency requirement of Art. 5 (1) (a) GDPR (see Heberlein in Ehmann/Selmayr, GDPR Art. 5 para. 14). Purposes such as "improving user-friendliness," "marketing purposes," "IT security purposes," or "future research" are too general and do not meet the criterion of sufficient specificity. As a rule of thumb, it is advisable to state a purpose in more than three words, but without resorting to excessive, confusing, and complicated formulations (Hötzendorfer/Tschohl/Kastelitz in Knyrim, DatKomm Art. 5 GDPR \[as of May 7, 2020, rdb.at\] para. 26). Article 12, paragraph 1, GDPR, which requires a "precise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language," goes in the same direction, but in more detail (see also Souhrada-Kirchmayer in Jahnel, Datenschutzrecht \[2017\], Das Informationsrecht nach der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung, p. 86). Without sufficient clarity in the definition of the purpose, the principle of purpose limitation would be ineffective. A too vague definition of the purposes would also contradict the transparency requirement of Article 5, paragraph 1, letter a, GDPR (see Heberlein in Ehmann/Selmayr, GDPR Article 5, para. 14). Purposes such as "improving user-friendliness," "marketing purposes," "IT security purposes," or "future research" are too general and do not meet the criterion of sufficient specificity. As a rule of thumb, it is advisable to state a purpose in more than three words, but without resorting to excessive, confusing, and complicated formulations (Hötzendorfer/Tschohl/Kastelitz in Knyrim, DatKomm Article 5, GDPR \[as of May 7, 2020, rdb.at\] para. 26).

The review of the lawfulness of processing is therefore only possible if the data subject is clearly aware of which data is being processed by which processor for which purpose.

However, this does not apply to the present case: In this context, the respondent states that it processes data "to provide its customers with information services. This includes information on the economic performance of legal and natural persons ('credit information') as well as the transmission of data for the purposes of address trading, advertising, and market analysis ('marketing data')." The respondent then explains which categories of personal data fall under "credit information" and which fall under "marketing information" (credit information: "name, gender, date of birth, marital status, address and contact details, interests and purchasing behavior, payment history, family composition, financial data, lifestyle data, occupation, education, and further training"; marketing information: "name, gender, date of birth, marital status, address and contact details, interests and purchasing behavior, family composition, financial data, lifestyle data, occupation, education, and further training"). The respondent's data disclosure only reveals whether it processes data corresponding to the listed categories. The respondent ultimately "specified the respective categories of data that may be processed for each of the purposes pursued, i.e., the collection of credit information and the collection of marketing information."

However, the respondent has not sufficiently defined the processing purposes:

Information about the purposes pursuant to Art. 15 (1) (a) GDPR must precisely specify the specific purpose(s) in the specific case of the requesting data subject. It is not sufficient to state the general purposes of the controller without clarifying which purpose(s) the controller is pursuing in the specific case of the requesting data subject. If processing is carried out for multiple purposes, the controller must clarify which categories of data are processed for which purpose(s) (see Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access, Version 1.0., Adopted on 18 January, para. 112). To fulfill the request for information, it may therefore be necessary to assign the purposes to the specific data, or possibly data categories, if otherwise a legality check by the data subject would not be possible (Haidinger in Knyrim, DatKomm Art. 15 GDPR \[as of December 1, 2021, rdb.at\] margin number 37/1). Information about the purposes pursuant to Article 15, paragraph 1, letter a, GDPR must precisely state the exact purpose(s) in the specific case of the requesting data subject. It is not sufficient to state the general purposes of the data controller without clarifying which purpose(s) the data controller is pursuing in the current case of the requesting data subject. If processing is carried out for multiple purposes, the controller must clarify which data categories are processed for which purpose(s) (see Guidelines 01/2022 on data subject rights - Right of access, Version 1.0., Adopted on 18 January, para. 112). To fulfill the request for information, it may therefore be necessary to assign the purposes to the specific data, or possibly data categories, if otherwise a legality check by the data subject would not be possible (Haidinger in Knyrim, DatKomm Article 15, GDPR \[as of 1 December 2021, rdb.at\] para. 37/1).

Against this background, it can be stated that the respondent cites the general processing purposes – providing credit information and marketing information – which correspond to the businesses it conducts pursuant to Section 152 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) (credit information agency) and Section 151 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) (address publisher and direct marketing company), and that the explanations (in its information dated 5 November 2018) indicate that the personal data are processed for both purposes. The respondent has also listed the categories of personal data that are processed for each purpose. Against this background, it can be stated that the respondent cites the general processing purposes – providing credit information and marketing information – which correspond to the businesses it conducts pursuant to Section 152 of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO) (credit information agency) and Section 151 of the German Trade Regulation Act (Address publisher and direct marketing company), and that the explanations (in its information dated 5 November 2018) indicate that the personal data are processed for both purposes. The respondent also listed the categories of personal data processed for the respective purposes.

In the present case, however, the allocation of data categories to the purposes proves to be insufficient, especially since the data categories listed are almost identical – with the exception of the category "payment experience," which is assigned exclusively to credit information; the remaining data categories are assigned to both "credit information" and "marketing information" – and furthermore, different data sources are present. However, the information provided by the respondent does not indicate which of the processed data from each data source is processed for which purpose(s) (credit information and/or marketing information). It is particularly important to note here that some of the complainant's processed data comes from address publishers and direct marketing companies (e.g., regarding the complainant's addresses and income), and this data is processed pursuant to Section 151 (1) of the German Data Protection Act (GDPR).6 GewO (German Trade Regulation Act). Accordingly, address publishers and direct marketing companies may only transmit marketing information and classifications collected for marketing purposes to third parties if the third parties unequivocally declare that they will use these analysis results exclusively for marketing purposes. The respondent may therefore use the data originating from address publishers and direct marketing companies (in this case: some addresses and the complainant's income) exclusively for marketing purposes. However, this or such an allocation is not apparent from the information provided by the respondent. If the processing is carried out for multiple purposes (as stated by the respondent here), the controller must clarify which data categories are processed for which purpose(s). Consequently, the complainant's view that compliance with this restriction can only be verified on the basis of a concrete allocation of this data to the individual processing purposes can be followed. To fulfill the request for information, it was and is therefore necessary that the different purposes (here: provision of credit information and marketing information) be assigned to the specific data (regarding the various addresses and income), since otherwise a legality check by the complainant is not possible. The information provided by the respondent therefore did not and does not meet the requirements of Art. 15 (1) (a) GDPR. In the present case, however, the assignment of the data categories to the purposes proves to be insufficient, especially since the data categories listed are almost identical – with the exception of the "payment experience" category, which is assigned exclusively to credit information, the remaining data categories are assigned to both "credit information" and "marketing information" – and furthermore, different data sources are present. However, the information provided by the respondent does not indicate which of the processed data from the respective data source is processed for which purpose(s) (credit information and/or marketing information). It is particularly important to note here that some of the complainant's processed data originates from address publishers and direct marketing companies (e.g., regarding the complainant's addresses and income), and this data is subject to a usage restriction pursuant to Section 151, Paragraph 6, of the German Trade Regulation Act (GewO). Accordingly, address publishers and direct marketing companies may only transmit marketing information and classifications collected for marketing purposes to third parties if the third parties unequivocally declare that they will use these analysis results exclusively for marketing purposes. The respondent may therefore use the data originating from address publishers and direct marketing companies (here: some addresses and the complainant's income) exclusively for marketing purposes. However, this or such an allocation is not apparent from the information provided by the respondent. However, if the processing is carried out for multiple purposes (as stated by the respondent here), the controller must clarify which data categories are processed for which purpose(s). Consequently, the complainant's view that compliance with this restriction can only be verified by specifically allocating this data to the individual processing purposes can be accepted. To fulfill the request for information, it was and is therefore necessary that the different purposes (here: providing credit information and marketing information) be allocated to the specific data (regarding the various addresses and income), as otherwise a legality review by the complainant is not possible. The information provided by the respondent therefore did not and does not comply with the requirements of Article 15, paragraph 1, letter a, GDPR.

The complaint was therefore upheld in this regard and it was found that the respondent had violated the complainant's right to information by failing to provide sufficient information about the processing purposes pursuant to Art. 15 (1) (a) GDPR and, furthermore, the respondent was ordered to provide the complainant with sufficiently specific information about the processing purposes pursuant to Art. 15 (1) (a) GDPR within four weeks, failing which the court would enforce the decision (see the recent VwGH decision of 6 March 2024, Ro 2021/04/0030-4 to 0031-5 on the power to make a determination). The complaint was therefore upheld and it was determined that the respondent violated the complainant's right to information by failing to provide sufficient information about the processing purposes pursuant to Article 15, paragraph 1, letter a, GDPR. Furthermore, the respondent was ordered to provide the complainant with sufficiently specific information about the processing purposes pursuant to Article 15, paragraph 1, letter a, GDPR within four weeks, failing which the court would have to enforce the decision (see the recent VwGH decision of March 6, 2024, Ro 2021/04/0030-4 to 0031-5).

3.3.2.2.3. Regarding the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, pursuant to Article 22 (1) and (4) GDPR and – at least in these cases – the provision of meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject (Article 15 (1) (h) GDPR): 3.3.2.2.3 Regarding the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, pursuant to Article 22 (1) and (4) GDPR and – at least in these cases – the provision of meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the scope and intended effects of such processing for the data subject (Article 15 (1) (h) GDPR):

First of all, it should be noted that in the present case – contrary to the respondent's statements – automated decision-making is involved in the preparation of a credit assessment of the complainant/the calculation of a score.

According to the case law of the ECJ, Article 22(1) GDPR is to be interpreted as meaning that an ‘automated individual decision’ within the meaning of that provision exists if a probability value based on personal data relating to a person with regard to that person’s ability to meet future payment obligations is created automatically by a credit agency, provided that this probability value is crucial for determining whether a third party to whom this probability value is transmitted establishes, implements or terminates a contractual relationship with that person. According to the case law of the ECJ, only this interpretation can close a legal gap with regard to the right to information, namely, that the credit agency refuses a right to information under Art. 15 (h) GDPR due to the lack of a decision under Art. 22, but the contractual partner is unable to provide the necessary information (ECJ December 7, 2023, C-634/21, SCHUFA). According to the case law of the ECJ, Article 22, paragraph 1, GDPR is to be interpreted as meaning that an "automated individual decision" within the meaning of this provision exists if a probability value based on personal data relating to a person regarding that person's ability to meet future payment obligations is automatically generated by a credit agency, provided that this probability value decisively determines whether a third party to whom this probability value is transmitted establishes, performs, or terminates a contractual relationship with that person. According to the case law of the ECJ, only this interpretation can close a legal gap with regard to the right to information, namely that the credit agency denies a right to information under Article 15(h) GDPR due to the lack of an Article 22 decision, but the contractual partner is unable to provide the necessary information (ECJ December 7, 2023, C-634/21, SCHUFA).

In the present case, it should be noted that the respondent automatically creates a probability value based on the complainant's personal data with regard to his ability to meet future payment obligations (score value) and - according to the complainant's statements in this regard, which have remained undisputed by the respondent with reference to the letter from the data protection officer of XXXX dated 16 January 2021 - the score value calculated for the complainant significantly influences the decision of the respondent's customer as to whether to conclude or execute a contract with the data subject, thus constituting an automated decision in the individual case within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR.In the present case, it should be noted that the respondent automatically creates a probability value based on the complainant's personal data with regard to his ability to meet future payment obligations (score value) and - according to the complainant's statements in this regard, which have remained undisputed by the respondent with reference to the letter from the data protection officer of Roman 40 dated January 16, 2021 – the score calculated for the complainant significantly influences the respondent's customer's decision as to whether to conclude or execute a contract with the data subject, thus resulting in an automated decision in the individual case within the meaning of Article 22 GDPR.

On the question of which information falls within the scope of Art.15 (1) (h) GDPR, the ECJ ruled that this concerns all information relevant to the procedure and principles of automated processing of personal data to achieve a specific result on the basis of these data, including information on the scope and intended effects. The data subject has a genuine right to an explanation of the functioning of the automated decision-making mechanism to which he or she has been subjected and of the result to which this decision has led. Neither the mere transmission of a complex mathematical formula (such as an algorithm) nor the detailed description of each step of an automated decision-making process meets these requirements, as neither constitutes a sufficiently precise and comprehensible explanation. The "meaningful information about the logic involved" in an automated decision-making process within the meaning of Article 15 (1) (h) GDPR must therefore describe the procedure and the principles specifically applied in such a way that the data subject can understand which of his or her personal data were used and in what way in the context of the automated decision-making process in question, without the complexity of the steps to be carried out in the context of automated decision-making being able to release the controller from his or her obligation to provide explanations. Specifically concerning profiling such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the referring court could, in particular, consider it sufficiently transparent and comprehensible to inform the data subject of the extent to which a deviation from the personal data taken into account would have led to a different result (ECJ 27 February 2025, C-203/22, paras. 43 et seq.). Regarding the question of which information falls within the scope of Article 15(1)(h) GDPR, the ECJ ruled that this includes all information relevant to the procedure and principles of automated processing of personal data to achieve a specific result on the basis of those data, including information on the scope and intended effects. The data subject has a genuine right to an explanation of the functioning of the automated decision-making mechanism to which that person has been subjected and the result to which that decision has led. Neither the mere transmission of a complex mathematical formula (such as an algorithm) nor the detailed description of each step of an automated decision-making process meets these requirements, as neither constitutes a sufficiently precise and comprehensible explanation. The "meaningful information about the logic involved" in an automated decision-making process within the meaning of Article 15, paragraph 1, letter h of the GDPR must therefore describe the procedure and principles specifically applied in such a way that the data subject can understand which of their personal data were used and how in the context of the automated decision-making process in question, without the complexity of the steps involved in the automated decision-making process being able to release the controller from its obligation to provide explanations. Specifically concerning profiling such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the referring court could, in particular, consider it sufficiently transparent and comprehensible to inform the data subject of the extent to which a deviation from the personal data taken into account would have led to a different result (ECJ 27 February 2025, C-203/22, paras. 43 et seq.).

Against this background, it follows that the respondent must, in any event, provide the complainant with information about the parameters/input variables used, their weighting, and information on how the parameters/input variables were determined, the functioning of the algorithm, and the result in an intelligible form, as well as an explanation of why the complainant was assigned a specific assessment result (rating of 2.02 and traffic light score of 2), in order to enable the complainant to verify the accuracy and legitimacy of the automated decision-making process.

The information provided by the respondent to date is – as the complainant correctly states – in any case too general and not specifically related to the complainant, whereby the information does not comply with the requirements of Art. 15 GDPR, which were specified in the cited case law of the ECJ, especially since only data categories or general "statistical values" which were included in the calculation of the rating value, but not the processed data specifically concerning the complainant, were disclosed, a concrete weighting of the various (unspecified) data which were included in the calculation of the rating value was not described, only a score value from the years 2016 and 2018 was disclosed and with regard to the profile categories (which include creditworthiness environment, \[general\] environmental data and socio-demographic data) only a rough outline of the influence of the data \[positive, negative, neutral\]) was communicated, which does not provide a sufficiently precise and comprehensible explanation of the functioning of the mechanism of automated decision-making to which this person was subjected and the result. which led to this decision. The information provided regarding the scope and intended effects is also – as the complainant correctly points out – only general and apparently exemplary in nature, with the impact of the data (categories) processed in each case only inadequately described. Furthermore, the respondent has not provided any information on the extent to which a deviation from the complainant's personal data taken into account would have led to a different result. The information provided by the respondent cannot therefore be considered sufficiently transparent and comprehensible. The information provided by the respondent to date is – as the complainant correctly states – in any case too general and not specifically related to the complainant, whereby the information does not comply with the requirements of Article 15 GDPR, which were specified in the cited case law of the ECJ, especially since only data categories or general "statistical values" which were included in the calculation of the rating value were disclosed, but not the data processed specifically concerning the complainant, a concrete weighting of the various (unspecified) data which were included in the calculation of the rating value was not described, only a score value from the years 2016 and 2018 was disclosed and with regard to the profile categories (which include creditworthiness environment, \[general\] environmental data and socio-demographic data) only a rough outline of the influence of the data \[positive, negative, neutral\]) was communicated, which does not provide a sufficiently precise and comprehensible explanation of the functioning of the mechanism of automated decision-making to which this person was subjected and the result. which led to this decision. The information provided regarding the scope and intended effects is also – as the complainant correctly states – only general and apparently exemplary in nature, with the impact of the respective data (categories) processed only inadequately described. The respondent also has no information on the extent to which a deviation from the complainant's personal data taken into account would have led to a different result. The information provided by the respondent cannot therefore be considered sufficiently transparent and comprehensible.

In summary, the respondent must specifically explain which of the complainant's personal data were used and how in the context of the automated decision-making process in question, and how the complainant's assessment result was specifically arrived at. The respondent would have to, in the words of the ECJ in the aforementioned judgment, explain in a precise, transparent, understandable, and easily accessible manner the procedure and principles on which the actual profiling (here, the rating value of 2.02 and the traffic light score of 2) was based in order for its information to comply with the requirements of Article 15(1)(h) GDPR. In summary, the respondent must specifically explain which of the complainant's personal data were used and how in the context of the automated decision-making process in question, and how the complainant's assessment result was specifically arrived at. The respondent would have to, in the words of the ECJ in the aforementioned judgment, explain in a precise, transparent, understandable, and easily accessible manner the procedure and principles on which the actual profiling (here, the rating value of 2.02 and the traffic light score of 2) was based in order for its information to comply with the requirements of Article 15(1)(h) GDPR.

In this regard, it should also be noted that the respondent in the proceedings only generally asserts the existence of trade secrets, but has not made any concrete submissions regarding the conditions for the existence of trade secrets, let alone has it transmitted the allegedly protected information to the authority concerned or to the Federal Administrative Court.As stated in the assessment of evidence, the respondent failed to comply with the Federal Administrative Court's order in this regard and did not provide any (protected) information and data to the Federal Administrative Court. Therefore, the respondent was unable to provide concrete evidence of the existence of trade secrets in the proceedings before the Federal Administrative Court. Against this background, the Federal Administrative Court is unable to determine in this specific case that the limitation of the scope of the complainant's right to information guaranteed under Art. 15 (1) (h) GDPR, as ultimately sought by the respondent, constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure. Furthermore, in its decision of February 27, 2025, Case C-203/22, the ECJ stated that even the existence of trade secrets may not lead to the data subject being denied any information. In this regard, it should also be noted that the respondent only generally asserted the existence of trade secrets in the proceedings, but did not provide any specific arguments regarding the requirements for the existence of trade secrets, let alone provide the allegedly protected information to the authority concerned or the Federal Administrative Court. As explained in the assessment of the evidence, the respondent failed to comply with the Federal Administrative Court's order in this regard and did not provide any (protected) information and data to the Federal Administrative Court. Thus, the respondent was unable to provide concrete evidence of the existence of trade secrets in the proceedings before the Federal Administrative Court. Against this background, the Federal Administrative Court is unable to determine in this specific case that the limitation of the scope of the complainant's right to information guaranteed under Article 15(1)(h) of the GDPR, as ultimately sought by the respondent, constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure. Furthermore, in its decision of February 27, 2025, Case C-203/22, the ECJ held that even the existence of trade secrets may not lead to the data subject being denied any information.

The complaint was therefore also upheld in this regard and it was found that the respondent had violated the complainant's right to information by failing to provide meaningful information about the logic involved as well as the scope and the intended effects of the automated decision-making process concerning the complainant's data (calculation of credit scores). The respondent was ordered to provide the complainant with meaningful information about the logic involved as well as the scope and the intended effects of the automated decision-making process concerning the complainant's data (calculation of credit scores) within four weeks, under penalty of execution. The complaint was therefore also upheld in this regard and it was found that the respondent had violated the complainant's right to information by failing to provide meaningful information about the logic involved as well as the scope and the intended effects of the automated decision-making process concerning the complainant's data (calculation of credit scores). credit scores), and the respondent was ordered to provide the complainant with meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the scope and intended effects of the automated decision-making concerning the complainant's data (calculation of credit scores) pursuant to Article 15, paragraph 1, letter h, GDPR, within four weeks, failing which the decision would be executed.

For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that, from the point of view of the Federal Administrative Court, the obligation to act on the part of the respondent as prescribed in the present decision is sufficiently clear and can therefore also be specified in an enforceable manner (see also the published decision of 23 October 2019, W256 2217011-1/11E and the request for a preliminary ruling from the Vienna Administrative Court of 11 February 2022, GZ VGW-101/042/791/2020-44).For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that, from the point of view of the Federal Administrative Court, the obligation to act on the part of the respondent as prescribed in the present decision is sufficiently clear and can therefore also be specified in an enforceable manner (see also the published decision of 23 October 2019, W256 2217011-1/11E and the request for a preliminary ruling from the Vienna Administrative Court of 11 February 2022, GZ VGW-101/042/791/2020-44).

3.4. Pursuant to Section 24 (1) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the Administrative Court must hold a public oral hearing upon request or, if it deems it necessary, ex officio. Pursuant to Section 24(4) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court may – unless otherwise provided by federal or state law – dispense with a hearing, notwithstanding a party's request, if the records indicate that the oral argument is unlikely to provide further clarification of the legal matter, and neither Article 6(1) of the ECHR nor Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights preclude the dispensation of the hearing. Pursuant to Section 24(4) of the Administrative Court Act (VwGVG), the administrative court may – unless otherwise provided by federal or state law – dispense with a hearing, notwithstanding a party's request, if the records indicate that the oral argument is unlikely to provide further clarification of the legal matter, and neither Article 6(1) of the ECHR nor Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights preclude the dispensation of the hearing.

Such a case exists here: In the present case, the facts relevant to the decision are established and clarified based on the records. According to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, an oral hearing is not required to resolve legal issues. Therefore, the ECHR and the Charter of Fundamental Rights do not preclude waiving an oral hearing. For these reasons, it was also not necessary to hold a public oral hearing ex officio.

Regarding B)

According to Section 25a, Paragraph 1 of the Administrative Court Act (VwGG), the administrative court must state in its judgment or decision whether the appeal on points of law is admissible pursuant to Article 133, Paragraph 4 of the Federal Constitutional Constitution Act (B-VG). The judgment must be briefly reasoned.

The present decision does not depend on the resolution of a legal issue of fundamental importance. There is neither a lack of case law of the Administrative Court, nor does the present decision deviate from the case law of the Administrative Court; furthermore, the present case law of the Administrative Court cannot be considered inconsistent. There are also no other indications of the fundamental importance of the legal issues to be resolved. For all significant legal issues, the Federal Administrative Court can rely on established case law of the Administrative Court or on an already clear legal situation. Nor is it apparent that the specific case raises a legal issue that has significance beyond the (concrete) individual case at hand. Based on this, a legal issue of fundamental importance cannot be affirmed in this respect either. It was therefore necessary to declare that the appeal on points of law is inadmissible pursuant to Article 133(4) of the Federal Constitutional Law (B-VG).
