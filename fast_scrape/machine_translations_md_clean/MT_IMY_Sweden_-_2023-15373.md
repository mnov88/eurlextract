## English Summary

### Facts

After a complaint by some tenants of apartments in a building, the data subjects, concerning unauthorized camera surveillance in apartment building in Malmo and impairment of data subjects´ right of information, the Swedish DPA started an investigation.

The investigation revealed eighteen cameras in all entrances to the buildings, garage, shared wet rooms, with some pointing towards some apartment doors. The data subjects unsuccessfully requested information about the data processed to the controller, as the information on the controller´s website was not exhaustive.

When the DPA requested the same information, the controller replied that they took over the camera system from the previous owner of the building and that, given that the neighborhood had precedents with bicycle thefts, attempted burglaries, storage break-ins, car break-ins and vandalism, the cameras were installed for safety reasons. It was specified that the recording activated through motion detection and that no real time surveillance or audio recording took place. Moreover, the data was stored for 14 days and only three people had access to the footage.

### Holding

The DPA considered two main issues: the legal basis for the presence of the eighteen cameras under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"), and the possible violations of the right of information under [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

**Violation of [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR")**

First, the DPA considered that interest required was legitimate, as protecting property, health and life falls within the scope of [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"). Second, the DPA conceded that alternative and less invasive measures were taken previously and that these measures did not have the same efficacy as camera surveillance. Third, the DPA considered that CCTV surveillance in residential environments is, as a starting point, very sensitive from a privacy point of view.

However, this privacy interest varies on the basis of the specific areas of surveillance. The DPA considered each of the surveilled areas and found:

\- in relation to entrances and stairwells: the interest of residents in not being monitored outweighs the controller´s interest when surveilling he entrances and stairwells.

\- in relation to basements, bicycles storage rooms, laundry rooms, corridors, garbage rooms and storage rooms: the risk of privacy invasion is reduced in these areas. However, there should have been actual incidents at these sites for an actual interest in camera surveillance. Here, the controller´s interest in camera surveillance of these areas does not outweigh the residents' interest in not being monitored.

\- in relation to the garage: camera surveillance in the garage is less sensitive. Moreover, considering that the burglaries took place in the garage with cars being stolen, the company has a legal basis under [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR").

Therefore, overall the DPA found that the controller only has a legal basis for the data camera surveillance that ongoing in the garage, and thus, that a violation of [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") occurred in relation to the other cameras.

**Violation of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR")**

The DPA found that the controller failed to respond effectively to the information request as required both under [Article 13(1) and (2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

In relation to the controller´s argument that data subjects already were in possession of the information about the processing as they were available in the website, the DPA considered that, while at the beginning information on the presence of cameras was provided to the data subjects, the lack of updating of some information (for example: who was the data controller, the contact details) entailed a violation of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

**Fine**

In light of these considerations, the DPA found a violation of [Article 6(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") and [13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") and deemed it appropriate to fine the controller SEK 200,000 (EUR 17,366).

                               2. Statement of the supervisory matter

                               2.1 Background

                               IMY has initiated supervision of Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB (the company) with the aim of investigating a
                               complaint that the company conducts unauthorized camera surveillance in apartment buildings on
                               Limhamnsvägen 22a in Malmö as well as shortcomings in its obligation to provide information.

                               2.2 What emerged in the case

                               The appellant has essentially stated the following. The appellant lives in the rental property at
                               Limhamnsvägen 22a in Malmö where extensive camera surveillance is carried out. There is
                               cameras at three main entrances, at elevators and at apartment doors on the ground floor as well

                               several cameras in the basement corridor next to the entrance to the storage room, laundry room and sauna.
                               There are also several cameras in the garage, bicycle storage, garbage room, recycling room and
                               indoors at the entrance at the rear of the property. The complainant has contacted the landlord

                               regarding the extent of camera surveillance and the lack of information. There is
                               no physical information on site, or otherwise, such as visitors and tenants
                               can take part in. The complainant believes that there should be information in general about treatment

                               of personal data to the tenants, such as logging the use of tags for

                               1
                               regarding the processing of personal data and on the free flow of such data and on the cancellation of aver med
                               directive 95/46/EC (general data protection regulation). The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 3(16)
                               Date: 2024-12-11

                               entry. The area where the property is located is generally very quiet without further ado
                               problem, therefore the scope of the camera surveillance should be done in a way that
                               minimizes the uptake in relation to the problems. In December 2022, the appellant received

                               response from the landlord that they should review the need for information regarding
                               the camera surveillance. The complainant has not received any concrete information about measures and
                               therefore do not feel safe about personal data, which is collected through

                               camera surveillance, is processed correctly and securely and in accordance with the data protection regulation.

                               The company has essentially stated the following. In connection with the company taking over

                               the property on November 1, 2022, they also took over the operation of
                               the camera surveillance system. It is unknown when the surveillance began, an extensive one
                               system reconstruction took place in 2013. The area has historically had problems with

                               incidents in the form of e.g. bicycle thefts, attempted burglaries, warehouse burglaries, car burglaries,
                               vandalism and graffiti in public areas. Most incidents have been investigated
                               successfully.

                               The company operates camera surveillance at Limhamnsvägen 22a in Malmö and is
                               personal data controller for the processing of personal data. The camera surveillance takes place

                               with 18 cameras that are mounted in the garage, basement, storage room, operation, laundry room and
                               garbage room. The cameras are aimed at the garage, basement entrance to the gym, bicycle storage,
                               central heating, outside office, corridor to laundry room and garage, stairwell A-C, basement

                               on staircase C, storage room and garbage room. The camera surveillance takes place around the clock because
                               incidents and crimes occur at all hours of the day, on weekdays and weekends.
                               Recording takes place when motion is detected with all cameras. None happens

                               real-time monitoring and no audio recording. There have been burglaries and vandalism
                               during varying times of the day, hence the choice of time for the surveillance. Image material
                               saved for 14 days due to the fact that there is only one trustee and the office does not have
                               fixed staffing hours. It can also take time to detect an incident. Three people have

                               access to recorded footage.

                               The purpose of the surveillance is to counter and prevent crime, create a safe living environment,

                               document documentation in the event of incidents and counteract large costs in the event of extensive
                               missorting and nuisance due to vermin. Furthermore, the camera surveillance takes place in
                               deterrent purpose. The cameras are appreciated by the tenants and they have one

                               deterrent function in terms of burglary and attempted fraud. The company has generally received
                               a positive impression from the residents regarding the camera surveillance.

                               The company has received, among other things, a documented balancing of interests, a blueprint which
                               shows where cameras are mounted, screenshots from all cameras, copy of older ones
                               signs and new signs, map image, group structure that the company is part of, a

                               compilation of incidents and police reports taken from the police and a copy
                               on privacy policy.

                               2.3 The extent of IMY's review of the matter

                               IMY's review of the case is limited to the questions about it

                               personal data processing that the camera surveillance entails, since 1 November 2022,
                               has had a legal basis according to the data protection regulation and if the company has fulfilled the requirement
                               on information according to § 15 of the Camera Surveillance Act (2018:1200) and the obligation to

                               provide information in accordance with Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation. IMY's review in this
                               supervisory matters do not include whether the company's camera surveillance is carried out in accordance with the others
                               current regulations in the data protection regulation. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 4(16)
                               Date: 2024-12-11

                               3. Justification of the decision

                               3.1 Which legislation applies to current camera surveillance?

                               Camera surveillance typically means that personal data is processed. If
                               and to what extent it is permissible for camera surveillance to be regulated in
                               the data protection regulation and the camera surveillance act.

                               3.1.1 The Data Protection Regulation
                               According to Article 2.1, the Data Protection Regulation shall be applied to the processing of

                               personal data that is fully or partially processed automatically. Of Article 4.1 i
                               the data protection regulation states that any information relating to an identified or
                               identifiable natural person is a personal data. According to Article 4.2, treatment is intended

                               an action or combination of actions concerning personal data, for example
                               collection, registration, storage, reading and deletion.

                               If a surveillance camera films an identifiable person, or someone else
                               personal data, personal data is processed and the rules in
                               the data protection regulation must be followed. IMY states that the company's surveillance cameras

                               films identifiable persons and that the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation thereby
                               applies to current personal data processing.

                               The personal data controller must identify the legal basis in Article 6 i
                               the data protection regulation before the camera surveillance begins, and is responsible - both
                               towards the registered and in relation to the supervisory authority - because the principles
                                                                                                                2
                               if the processing of personal data in Article 5 of the data protection regulation is complied with.
                               The principle of liability in Article 5.2 of the Data Protection Regulation means that it
                               personal data controller must be able to demonstrate that Article 5.1 has been complied with, which means that

                               the application of the data protection regulation often needs to be documented.

                               3.1.2 The Camera Surveillance Act

                               The Camera Surveillance Act (2018:1200), is a supplementary law in relation to
                               data protection regulation. It appears from § 3 § 1 of the Camera Surveillance Act that with
                               camera surveillance means a television camera, another optical-electronic instrument or a
                               comparable equipment which, without being operated on site, is used in a

                               in such a way as to involve permanent or regularly repeated personal surveillance.

                               The current camera surveillance is not operated on site and involves a permanent

                               surveillance of residents and other visitors to the property. IMY assesses that also
                               the camera surveillance act is therefore applicable to the surveillance in question.

                               3.2 Is the company responsible for personal data?

                               According to Article 4.7 of the Data Protection Ordinance, personal data controller means the

                               natural or legal person who, alone or together with others, decides
                               the purposes and means for the processing of personal data. Crucial to the question of
                               who is responsible for personal data is who or who have decided why and how

                               the processing takes place, and exerts an influence on which personal data is collected
                               and processed, how long they are stored and who has access. The assessment of who

                               2 Prop. 2017/18:105, New Data Protection Act, p. 47 f. Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 5(16)

                                Date: 2024-12-11

                                or who is responsible for personal data for certain processing must always be based on them
                                the actual circumstances of the specific case. 3

                                Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB has stated that the company is responsible for personal data

                                the processing of personal data that takes place through current camera surveillance on
                                Limhamnsvägen 22a in Malmö. IMY believes that this is supported in the investigation and assesses

                                because the company is responsible for personal data for the person in question
                                the processing of personal data in the sense referred to in Article 4.7 i

                                data protection regulation.

                                3.3 Has the camera surveillance had a legal basis in
                                data protection regulation?

                                In order for the processing of personal data to be legal, there must be support in at least one
                                on the legal grounds stated in Article 6.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. The company has

                                stated that current camera surveillance is supported by the legal basis stated in the article
                                6.1 f of the data protection regulation, which is the so-called balancing of interests. There is

                                three prerequisites that must all be met for the camera surveillance to work
                                can take place with the support of Article 6.1 f of the data protection regulation: The

                                personal data controllers must be able to demonstrate 1) that there is a legitimate interest, 2) that
                                the current processing of personal data is necessary to achieve that interest,
                                and 3) that the legitimate interest (guarding interest) weighs in a balance

                                heavier than the basic freedoms and rights of the data subjects (privacy interest) on
                                the place. 4

                                3.3.1 Is there a legitimate interest?

                                In order for the interest that the surveillance intends to protect to be considered justified, it needs
                                it normally has support in relevant national law or in EU law. A

                                condominium association that wants to protect the property, health and life of the condominium owners
                                can be considered to have such a legitimate interest. Protecting property, health and life can
                                constitute a legitimate interest in camera surveillance, provided it is in question

                                of an actual interest and not an interest which is fictitious or speculative at the time
                                for the processing of personal data. This usually means that a crime must have occurred

                                or other incidents which mean that there is a concrete need for surveillance.

                                The company has stated that the purpose of the camera surveillance is to increase security and
                                security for the tenants, prevent and investigate crime and protect the property

                                property. The company has also stated that the monitoring is done as a deterrent.
                                The surveillance makes it more difficult to break into apartments, attics and basements because
                                people are watched on the way out with any stolen goods. It appears from the investigation

                                that since 2019 there have been incidents in the form of i.a. car break-in, theft,
                                vandalism, graffiti, burglary and attempted burglary. IMY assesses that the company has one

                                legitimate interest in conducting camera surveillance to increase security and
                                security for tenants, preventing and investigating crime and protecting property.

                                3.3.2 Is the camera surveillance necessary to achieve the legitimate interest?

                                That the camera surveillance carried out must be necessary means that it is justified
                                the interest cannot reasonably be protected as effectively in other ways as in smaller

                                taken into account if the cameras have been used in a way that limits the intrusion into it
                                the personal integrity that the surveillance entails without jeopardizing it for the sake of it

                                the effectiveness of the surveillance, which includes an assessment of whether it is, for example,
                                enough that the camera surveillance is limited to certain places or times.
                                Necessity must be tested together with the principle of data minimization in the article

                                5.1 c of the data protection regulation, which means that personal data collected must
                                be adequate, relevant and not too extensive in relation to the purposes for which

                                they are treated.

                                From the investigation into the matter, it appears that alternative measures have been taken by
                                restrict access to the property using access systems with tags, upgrade

                                of stronger gate automation, installation of grilles in front of doors and motion detectors for
                                automatic lighting and improvement of lighting. There is lighting at the basement entrance

                                which is turned on when there is movement due to people moving close to tenants
                                balconies during the evening. The measures were taken by previous owners and have not been reduced
                                the incidents to a sufficient extent according to the company. The company states that in the areas where

                                cameras are installed, it has had a deterrent function regarding burglary and
                                attempted fraud. IMY states that previous property owners have taken alternative measures

                                and less privacy-sensitive measures to camera surveillance and that the surveillance
                                according to the company has had a deterrent effect. IMY assesses that even if the company

                                neither has limited the coverage in time or coverage area, e.g. By
                                masking, with the aim of reducing the invasion of privacy, the surveillance can be considered to be

                                necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the company and the residents.

                                3.3.3 Does the security interest outweigh the privacy interest at the site?
                                That the legitimate interest that the surveillance intends to protect (the surveillance interest)

                                in a balance must weigh more heavily than the basic free and
                                rights (the interest in privacy), means that the personal data controller must
                                evaluate the risks of infringement of the data subject's rights. The decisive criterion is

                                the intensity of the infringement for the data subject's rights and freedoms, which i.a. can
                                is defined based on the information content, the scope, the situation in question and the
                                                                  8

                                the balance between the privacy interest and the surveillance interest must also be taken into account

                                its personal data.

                                With regard to the privacy interest, IMY notes the following. All camera surveillance means
                                an intrusion into the individual's privacy. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has i
                                guidelines, which are indicative of how the provisions of the data protection regulation should

                                interpreted, stating that data subjects should not reasonably expect to be subject to surveillance
                                in residential areas. IMY believes that camera surveillance in residential environments such as

                                starting point is very sensitive from a privacy point of view. The privacy interest varies
                                however, depending on the specific area of coverage.

                                Regarding the surveillance interest, the company has stated that many people move in

                                the area where the property is located. Partly because it i.a. is there a beach in
                                the vicinity that many people visit. The company refers to information in

                               The Crime Prevention Council's latest edition of Crime statistics, reported crimes 2023. I
                               edition shows that in metropolitan municipalities such as Malmö is reported in large numbers
                               crime due to the high throughput of non-residents in

                               municipality, which explains the high crime rate in the area. The company has received
                               with a compilation of 25 incidents that occurred in the area where the property is
                               located during the period 13 September 2017 and 13 December 2023. The company has

                               also submitted a compilation of incidents and police reports
                               relating to the year 2019 up to and including the year 2024, taken from the police, which occurred in the area where
                               the property is located and the area around the property. The company has further stated that

                               the police are not allowed to hand out reports and events relating to the property. IMY
                               considers that the company has shown that there were crimes and incidents in the area there
                               the property is located. However, it has not been shown that these crimes and incidents have occurred

                               in the property or in the places in the property that are guarded. IMY therefore does not consider that
                               the basis that the company submitted affects IMY's assessment
                               the surveillance interest in the property in question where the company operates camera surveillance.

                               Entrances and stairwells
                               Camera surveillance that takes place inside the entrance or in the stairwell of apartments is seen

                               generally as particularly sensitive to privacy because the residents are monitored when they
                               coming to and leaving their residences. It enables mapping of the residents
                               habits, visits and social circle. It is now a question of camera surveillance around the clock

                               entrances to all stairwells, both stairwells A, B and C, and one more basement entrance
                               the property by a gym. Within the catchment area of stairwell B there is also one
                               guest apartment, which means that several different people can be met by the security, which

                               increases the privacy interest somewhat. The interest in privacy is somewhat weakened by it
                               the fact that the surveillance is partly aimed at protecting the people who become
                               subject of the surveillance. In an overall assessment, IMY considers that
                               the privacy interest in entrances and stairwells weighs heavily.

                               With regard to the surveillance interest, IMY notes the following. The company has left one
                               account of crimes and incidents that occurred during the period 13 May 2019 to and including

                               by 31 December 2023. The documentation shows that a burglar alarm has been triggered in stairwell B
                               and C due to unauthorized access, an alarm about suspected unauthorized access i
                               stairwell B, burglary in stairwell B, alarm about unauthorized access in stairwell B, alarm at

                               scaffolding on the outside of the property, broken windowpanes to the stairwell and a
                               police intervention in an apartment which resulted in damage to the apartment and stairwell. The company
                               has further stated that unauthorized access to the property occurs three to four times a year

                               through emergency exits damaged as a result and that damage in the form of
                               graffiti has occurred in the stairwells. The company has stated that there have been problems
                               in the then owner's property portfolio in Malmö with unauthorized access, i

                               especially drug addicts, which caused insecurity for tenants. IMY notes that
                               there have been incidents and crimes in the property, e.g. problems with unauthorized access
                               in the property, which IMY understands affects the safety of the residents. However, IMY believes that

                               these are incidents that are not of a sufficiently serious nature to
                               the security interest in entrances and stairwells shall be considered to outweigh
                               the privacy interest at the site. In an overall assessment, IMY considers that

                               the security interest in entrances and stairwells is relatively light.

                               In light of the incidents that occurred at the locations, IMY assesses that

                               the surveillance interest at the site weighs relatively lightly. Considering the weighty
                               the privacy interest at the locations, IMY assesses that the company's interest in
                               camera surveillance of entrances and stairwells does not outweigh the residents' interest in that

                               do not be monitored by cameras there. The Swedish Data Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 8(16)
                                Date: 2024-12-11

                                IMY therefore believes that the camera surveillance of entrances and stairwells cannot be supported
                                a balancing of interests according to Article 6.1 f of the data protection regulation. Neither has it
                                emerged that it would be possible to support the surveillance on someone else legal

                                basis in Article 6.1 of the data protection regulation. The company has thus treated
                                personal data in violation of Article 6.1 of the data protection regulation.

                                Basement, storage, operations, laundry room, garbage room and corridors to the sites
                                Camera surveillance of bicycle storage, garbage rooms, storerooms and the like are not considered the same
                                sensitive to privacy such as camera surveillance in connection with apartments, because they

                                residents do not have to pass through these spaces to get to and from their homes,
                                nor does it stay there for long periods of time. However, IMY notes that
                                the company operates extensive camera surveillance around the clock in the property. The residents

                                because of this cannot escape the camera surveillance, which speaks for a higher risk of
                                breach of privacy. However, the risk of privacy breaches is somewhat reduced in the case of
                                the surveillance of said spaces, especially during later evening and night time, then

                                residents to a lesser extent can be assumed to stay on the sites. The interest in privacy
                                is somewhat weakened by the fact that the surveillance is partly aimed at protecting them
                                persons who have been subject to surveillance. IMY assesses that the privacy interest in

                                basement, storage, operation, laundry room, garbage room and corridors to the sites weigh relatively heavily.

                                With regard to the surveillance interest, IMY notes the following. Of the account of crime and

                                incidents that the company has provided show that there has been an alarm about a suspect
                                unauthorized access to the power station, alarm that the door to the waste room has been broken open and alarm about
                                damaged door to garbage room probably due to attempted burglary. In addition to these incidents

                                has there been vandalism in the form of graffiti on the sites. IMY notes that it
                                it is required that there is an actual interest in monitoring, i.e. it should have occurred actual
                                incidents in the places that are monitored by cameras. IMY believes that the company has shown that it
                                there have been incidents at some locations that are monitored, but not at all locations. The

                                are not mainly about recurring incidents either. IMY assesses
                                all in all, that even if some incidents have occurred, the security interest weighs in
                                places relatively easily.

                                Overall, IMY assesses that the company's interest in camera surveillance of basements, storerooms,
                                operation, laundry room, garbage room and corridors to the places do not weigh more than the occupants

                                interest in not being camera-surveillance there.

                                IMY therefore considers that the camera surveillance of the basement, storeroom, operation, laundry room, garbage room

                                and corridors to the sites cannot be supported on a balance of interests according to Article 6.1 f
                                in the data protection regulation. Nor has it emerged that it would be possible to
                                support the monitoring on any other legal basis in Article 6.1 of the Data Protection Regulation.

                                The company has thus processed personal data in violation of Article 6.1 i
                                the data protection regulation also in this part.

                                Garage
                                IMY also considers here that camera surveillance of garages is less sensitive, because
                                individuals do not need to pass these spaces to get to their homes, and do not

                                rather stays there for longer periods of time. This means that the privacy interest
                                weighs slightly lighter on the spot.

                                With regard to the surveillance interest, IMY states the following. The investigation shows that
                                the garage door was hit on one occasion in 2023, the garage was burglarized in 2019 and
                                in 2023 when cars were robbed of steering wheels and headlights. IMY notes that in

                                the garage contains property susceptible to theft, which differs from other places in the property, Privacy Protection Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 9(16)

                                Date: 2024-12-11

                                for example, basement and laundry room. It is a different kind of place that
                                guarded and other property that must be protected than in the property in general, which affects

                                the assessment of the security interest, which is considered to weigh more heavily in the garage than in the others
                                places in the property.

                                IMY therefore assesses that the company's interest in camera surveillance of the garage, even if a
                                incident is a number of years back in time, weighs somewhat more than the interest of the residents

                                not to be monitored by cameras there. The company thus has a legal basis according to Article 6.1 f i
                                the data protection regulation regarding the monitoring of the garage.

                                IMY's summary assessment

                                In summary, IMY assesses that the company has a legal basis according to Article 6.1 f i
                                the data protection regulation for the camera surveillance that takes place in the garage. On the contrary
                                the company lacks a legal basis according to Article 6 of the Data Protection Ordinance for its monitoring i

                                other.

                                3.4 Has the company fulfilled the requirement for information and its obligation
                                to inform?

                                3.4.1 The requirement for information according to the Camera Surveillance Act

                                Section 15 of the Camera Surveillance Act sets out a requirement to provide information on
                                camera surveillance must be provided through clear signage or on something else effective

                                way. The provision refers to the actual use of camera surveillance equipment and
                                not the processing of personal data that the monitoring entails. The provision
                                contains no requirements regarding what information must be provided and

                                the obligation to provide information may thus be considered fulfilled if the person conducting the surveillance
                                in a clear way provides information that camera surveillance takes place in a certain location.

                                From the investigation into the matter, it appears that there are signs on the entrance doors, at the gate and the door

                                as well as on the facade. The company has submitted a drawing of the basement including garage
                                and a drawing of all stairwells (A, B and C). The drawings show that signs
                                sits at all entrances to the property.

                                IMY assesses that the company has provided information about the surveillance through clear

                                signage and thereby fulfilled the information requirement in Section 15 of the Camera Surveillance Act.

                                3.4.2 The information obligation in the data protection regulation
                                IMY must also assess whether the company has lived up to its obligations to inform
                                the processing of personal data according to Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation. Article 13 i

                                the data protection regulation regulates which information must be provided when
                                the personal data is collected from the data subject. In case of camera surveillance is considered
                                                                                   13
                                personal data is collected from the data subject.

                                13 Article 29 working group, Guidelines on transparency according to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, WP260rev.01, point 26 and
                                EDPB's Guidelines 3/2019, point 110. However, see the Court of Appeal in Stockholm's judgment of 26 January 2023 in case no. 1552-22 in
                                which the Court of Appeal judged that it is not Article 13 but Article 14 that should be applicable to camera surveillance.
                                The judgment has been appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (case no. 870-23) and has thus not gained legal force. With
                                taking into account the position that the EDPB's guidelines have according to the regulation and pending a legally binding decision
                                does IMY base its assessment on the EDPB's guidelines and that it is Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation that must be applied in
                                the case. In the case, the Supreme Administrative Court (HFD) has requested a preliminary ruling from the EU Court regarding
                                article 13 or 14 is applicable in case of monitoring with a body-worn camera. The Swedish Privacy Agency Diary number: IMY-2023-15373 10(16)
                               Date: 2024-12-11

                               According to Article 13.1 of the Data Protection Regulation, the personal data controller shall, when
                               the personal data is obtained, provide information to the registrant about e.g. following.

                                    • The identity and contact details of the person in charge of personal data.
                                    • Contact details for any data protection officer.
                                    • The purposes of the processing for which the personal data is intended as well as

                                        the legal basis for the processing.
                                    • If the legal basis is Article 6.1 f (balancing of interests), which is justified
                                        interest the processing aims to safeguard.

                                    • The recipients or the categories of recipients who are to take part
                                        the personal data, where applicable.

                               According to Article 13.2 of the data protection regulation, the personal data controller shall, at
                               the collection of the personal data, provide information to the registrant about i.a.
                               following.

                                    • The period during which the personal data will be stored or the criteria
                                        which is used to determine this period.

                                    • That there is a right to request access to the personal data controller
                                        and correction or deletion of personal data or restriction of processing
                                        relating to the data subject or to object to processing.

                                    • That the registered person has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

                               From article 13.4 it appears that points 1, 2 and 3 of article 13 shall not be applied if and in

                               insofar as the data subject already has the information.

                               The investigation shows that when the company took possession of the property in 2022, it is on the signage
                               lack of information about i.a. the purpose of the personal data processing

                               (the camera surveillance), the identity of the personal data controller (the company),
                               contact details for the person in charge of personal data (the company), a statement that they
                               monitored can exercise their rights according to the data protection regulation, for how long

                               image material is stored and reference to where to find out more about
                               the processing of personal data.

                               During the course of the inspection, the signs were updated, however, without the company's involvement.
                               On the new signs, information about the personal data controller has been missing
                               identity (the company) and contact details of the person in charge of personal data (the company) at

                               the signs. IMY notes that the company has stated that the signage will
                               clarified with information that the company is responsible for personal data
                               the camera surveillance.

                               The company has stated that information about the processing of personal data that is ongoing at
                               camera surveillance is provided to those registered via the company's website which

                               updated on June 4, 2024 with full information. On August 29, 2024
                               the website was updated with i.a. additional information about the purpose of
                               the camera surveillance and a clarification that the company is responsible for personal data.

                               Those registered have previously been referred to the company's property manager's website with
                               information about the camera surveillance. That information has been available since

                               on November 1, 2022. The website was redesigned and the information updated
                               November 27, 2023. At that time there was no information about who it was

                                occurring cases. There was also missing information that the registered have the right to
                                of the person in charge of personal data (the company) request deletion of personal data or to

                                object to treatment.

                                The property manager has informed orally in connection with showing apartments

                                about the camera surveillance and referred to the company's website for more information.
                                The manager has also informed all new tenants about the camera surveillance
                                and where they can find more information about it. Information about camera surveillance does not have

                                sent out in physical form to the registered and not provided to the registered on
                                other way.

                                IMY assesses that there have been deficiencies in the first and second layers of information,
                                but there is not a total lack of information about the processing of personal data. IMY
                                states that even if the property manager when showing apartments orally has

                                informed that camera surveillance takes place and referred to the company's website for more
                                information, other than the residents are also staying in the guarded spaces, such as guests
                                to the residents, craftsmen, etc. These have thus been referred to the signs about

                                camera surveillance. The signs about camera surveillance have been updated during the inspection
                                time as well as the website with information about the camera surveillance. Although the new ones
                                the signs and website contain more information than before, IMY finds that

                                there are still some deficiencies in the first layer of information. On
                                the camera surveillance signs are missing information about the personal data controller
                                identity (the company) and contact details for the company, in the form of an email address or
                                phone number. According to IMY, this information can be obtained with relatively simple means

                                be added to the existing signs. IMY assesses overall that the information
                                which has been submitted does not meet all requirements according to Article 13.1 and 13.2 i
                                data protection regulation.

                                IMY therefore states that since 1 November 2022 the company has processed
                                personal data in violation of Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation.

                                3.5 Choice of intervention

                                In the event of violations of the data protection regulation, IMY has a number of corrective measures
                                powers, including reprimands, injunctions and penalty charges. It follows from
                                article 58.2 a–j of the data protection regulation.

                                IMY shall impose penalty fees in addition to or in lieu of other corrective measures
                                as referred to in Article 58(2) of the Data Protection Regulation, depending on the circumstances i

                                each individual case. If it is a question of a minor violation, the supervisory authority may,
                                under recital 148 of the Data Protection Regulation, issue a reprimand instead of imposing one
                                penalty fee. Consideration must be given to aggravating and mitigating circumstances i

                                the case, such as the nature, severity and duration of the breach and previous
                                violations of relevance.

                                Each supervisory authority must ensure that the imposition of administrative
                                penalty charges in each individual case are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The
                                stated in Article 83.1 of the Data Protection Regulation. In article 83.2, the factors that must

                                Date: 2024-12-11

                                taken into account in determining whether an administrative penalty fee should be imposed and at
                                the assessment of the size of the penalty fee.

                                When assessing the amount of the penalty fee, among other things, must be taken into account

                                article 83.2 a (the nature, severity and duration of the violation), c (the measures
                                which the personal data controller has taken) and k (other aggravating or
                                mitigating factor for example direct or indirect financial gain).

                                The EDPB has adopted guidelines on the calculation of administrative penalty fees according to

                                the data protection regulation which aims to create a harmonized method and principles
                                for calculation of penalty fees.  14

                                According to article 83.5 of the data protection regulation, in the event of violations of articles 6 and
                                13 of the data protection regulation administrative penalty fees are imposed on up to

                                EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of companies, of up to 4 percent of the total global
                                the annual turnover during the previous budget year, depending on which value is the highest.

                                When determining the maximum amount of a penalty charge to be imposed on a company

                                shall the definition of the concept of company be used as used by the EU Court of Justice
                                application of Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU (see recital 150 i
                                data protection regulation). The court's practice shows that this includes every unit

                                that carries out economic activities, regardless of the legal form of the entity and the way of doing so
                                financing as well as even if the unit in the legal sense consists of several physical or
                                                    15
                                legal persons.

                                The rules for group liability in EU competition law revolve around the concept
                                economic unit. A parent company and a subsidiary company are considered part of the same
                                economic entity when the parent company exercises decisive influence over

                                the subsidiary. The decisive influence (ie control) can be achieved either through
                                ownership or by agreement. Jurisprudence shows that one hundred percent or almost

                                100% ownership implies a presumption for control to be considered to exist.
                                However, the presumption can be rebutted if the company provides sufficient evidence that
                                                                                              16
                                proof that the subsidiary acts independently on the market.

                                3.5.1 A penalty fee must be imposed

                                IMY has found that the company has violated Article 6.1 of the data protection regulation by
                                without legal basis to conduct camera surveillance in the company's property on Limhamnsvägen

                                22a in Malmö during the period 1 November 2022–11 December 2024. The company has further
                                processed personal data in violation of Article 13 of the Data Protection Regulation by

                                not fulfill the requirement for information to the registered regarding the camera surveillance.

                                IMY states that the processing of personal data through camera surveillance of

                                private persons in direct connection with their homes has taken place without a legal basis. Against this one
                                background, IMY assesses that it is not a question of such minor violations as

                                referred to in recital 148 of the data protection regulation. IMY thus finds that a penalty fee
                                cannot be replaced by a reprimand.

                                The European Court of Justice has clarified that it is required that the person in charge of personal data has committed a
                                Violation intentionally or negligently to administrative penalty fees

                                14EDPB Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR (finally adopted on 24 May

                               Date: 2024-12-11

                               must be enforceable according to the data protection regulation. The European Court of Justice has stated that
                               data controllers may be subject to penalty fees for actions if they cannot

                               are deemed to have been unaware that the conduct constituted a breach, regardless of whether they
                               were aware that they violated the provisions of the data protection regulation.      17

                               IMY notes that the company, in its capacity as a personal data controller, is responsible for it
                               personal data processing that takes place within the company and for it to take place in accordance with

                               the data protection regulation through the principle of responsibility in article 5.2. IMY has
                               assessed that the company has not complied with the data protection regulation regarding the requirements for

                               legal basis and the information to be provided to data subjects. Against the background of
                               The statement of the European Court of Justice mentioned above and taking into account previous supervisory decisions
                                        18
                               from IMY and the investigation into the case, it appears that the company cannot be considered to have been
                               unaware that the action could constitute a violation of the data protection regulation.
                               Against this background, IMY believes that the company has been negligent in relation to them

                               violations of the data protection regulation that have been established. There is thus
                               prerequisites for imposing an administrative sanction fee on the company.

                               3.5.2 Amount of the penalty fee

                               IMY states that Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB according to the latest information available
                               group structure from December 2022 is a wholly owned subsidiary within a group

                               ownership is one hundred percent in the subsidiaries, which in turn own one hundred percent
                               ownership in its subsidiaries.

                               Against the background of what has been reported above, one hundred percent or almost

                               one hundred percent ownership a presumption for control to be considered to exist and that
                               the parent company and the subsidiaries must be taken into account in the calculation.

                               The company has stated that information about the group structure of which the company is a part deviates
                               the following way. Granit Bostad 4 Duvan AB has been merged into Granit Bostad Duvan AB,

                               Granit Bostad 4 Korpen AB has been merged into Granit Bostad Korpen AB and Granit

                               acquired; Granit Bostad Slottstaden AB and Granit Bostad Villandia AB. The company has
                               further stated that the company acquired more properties in 2023, which meant that

                               net sales for 2023 increased to SEK 274,053,000. The company's results had at the same time

                                decrease in value of the property portfolio. The property value decreased by 360,251,000

                                SEK in 2023, which resulted in a negative net result of minus SEK 318,734,000.

                                With regard to the financial changes that took place during the year, IMY does the following
                                assessment. According to the data protection regulation's provision on calculation of
                                administrative penalty fee, the calculation must be made based on the total global
                                                                                20
                                the annual turnover during the previous budget year. The negative net result in 2023
                                shall therefore not affect the calculation of the penalty fee. IMY thus does not find
                                reason to disregard the provision and the penalty fee must be calculated based on this

                                the total annual turnover.

                                IMY assesses that the annual turnover to be used as a basis for its calculation

                                the administrative sanction fee that Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB can be imposed is
                                all the companies reported above that are part of the group with Granit Bostad AB as
                                parent company. Annual reports for the financial year 2023 for the company show that

                                the total turnover amounts to SEK 274,053,000. 4% of that amount is
                                SEK 10,962,120. Since this amount is lower than EUR 20,000,000 shall
                                the penalty fee is set at an amount between 0 and 20,000,000 EUR.

                                As regards the assessment of the seriousness of the infringements, there is one
                                beginning factors which mean that there are reasons to take the violations more seriously.

                                The personal data processing has intended camera surveillance of residents in direct
                                connection to their homes and visitors to residences. Camera surveillance has been carried out

                                around the clock with a large number of cameras of large parts of the property for a longer period
                                time. The company has guarded entrances and stairwells in the property, which has meant that they
                                residents have been monitored every time they have moved to and from their homes and it has

                                has not been possible to avoid being monitored by cameras. That the people who are met by
                                the monitoring has not received all the information that the company has been obliged to
                                providing has further entailed a risk that the data subject did not become aware of

                                their rights or that they have exercised their rights to a lesser extent than they did
                                have the right to according to the data protection regulation.

                                IMY notes at the same time that the company has shown that there have been some problems with
                                burglary of the garage and has had a legitimate interest as well as taken other measures to
                                come to terms with this, which means that it has not been deliberate

                                violations. IMY also states that the surveillance was limited to the residents
                                and visitors. During the course of the inspection, the company has updated signs
                                camera surveillance and their website with information about camera surveillance and more

                                information than before and have thus attempted to take corrective action to comply
                                the information obligation.

                                In the light of the above circumstances, IMY assesses that, in total, it concerns
                                for violations of a low level of seriousness. The starting point for the calculation of

                                the penalty fee should therefore be set low in relation to the current maximum amount.

                                In addition to assessing the seriousness of the violations, IMY must assess whether they exist

                                any aggravating or mitigating circumstances that become relevant
                                the amount of the penalty fee. IMY assesses that there is no further aggravating factor or

                                Date: 2024-12-11

                                mitigating circumstances, in addition to those taken into account in the assessment of
                                the degree of seriousness above, which affects the amount of the penalty fee.

                                In light of the nature and seriousness of the violations, the IMY decides that it
                                the administrative sanction fee for Granit Bostad Beritsholm AB can stay
                                200,000 kroner. IMY considers this amount to be effective, proportionate and

                                deterrent in the present case.

                                3.5.3 Injunction

                                According to Article 58.2 d, the supervisory authority has the authority to issue a
                                personal data controller to ensure that the processing takes place in accordance with the regulations
                                in the data protection regulation and if required in a specific way and within a specific

                                period.

                                Because the surveillance, as far as the investigation shows, is still ongoing, it is

                                urgent that the company ceases the surveillance that is not permitted. It exists therefore
                                reason to, based on Article 58.2 d of the data protection regulation, order the company to
                                cease camera surveillance of all places in the property, with the exception of the garage.

                                According to IMY, it is also important that the company takes measures to ensure that they
                                registrants receive correct and complete information regarding it
                                personal data processing through camera surveillance that takes place. IMY decides with support

                                of article 58.2 d of the data protection regulation that the company must be ordered to, no later than four
                                weeks after this decision takes effect, take steps to ensure that

                                         1. the company ceases the camera surveillance of all places in the property
                                             except the garage,

                                         2. there is information about the company's identity on the camera surveillance signs

                                             and contact information for the company, in the form of an email address or telephone number.

                                That measures must have been taken no later than four weeks after this decision came into force

                                means that if the decision is not appealed, action must have been taken no later than four weeks after
                                that the appeal period has expired.
