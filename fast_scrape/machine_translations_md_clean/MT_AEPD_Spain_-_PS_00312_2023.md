## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject was the victim in a rape case that had garnered public attention. She complained to the Spanish DPA (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos - AEPD) that the controller, Atresmedia Corporación de Medios de Comunicación, S.A., had published an unaltered audio recording of her speaking in court.

An investigation by the DPA confirmed multiple instances where the audio recording was not distorted before publication, and the DPA sent the controller an urgent request to either take down the recordings or alter them so as to render the data subject's voice unrecognizable. The controller complied, removing or distorting instances of the recording both published and archived.

### Holding

The DPA first confirmed that publishing a voice recording is processing of personal data. A voice is a personal attribute unique to each person and thus falls under the definition of personal data in Article 4(1)GDPR. Furthermore, a voice can reveal identifiers like age, sex, state of health, culture, and emotional state. This combined with the fact that [Article 4(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#2 "Article 4 GDPR") includes "transmission" and "dissemination" in the definition of processing means that publishing a recording of a person's voice is processing of personal data.

The DPA then considered the balance of fundamental rights at stake, noting that [Article 85 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_85_GDPR "Article 85 GDPR") mandates the reconciliation of the right to freedom of information with the right to privacy. The DPA held that the identifying characteristics of the victim were unrelated to the public's news interest in criminal proceedings. Thus, the principle of data minimisation (Article 5(1)(c) GDPR) required the controller to implement measures to avoid voice recognition, like distorting the recording or reading a transcript.

For violating [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"), the DPA fined the controller €50,000. In its assessment of the fine, the DPA noted three aggravating factors per [Article 83(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2 "Article 83 GDPR"): (1) the seriousness of revealing sensitive data of a person who has already been the victim of a violent crime against sexual integrity, (2) the negligence displayed in failing to implement appropriate safeguards for news subjects, and (3) the disclosure of a special category of data. The fine was ultimately reduced by 40% because the controller acknowledged responsibility and paid before resolution of the sanctioning procedure.

## Comment

This case is similar to cases PS/00191/2022 ([https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=AEPD\_(Spain)\_-\_PS/00191/2022)](https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=AEPD_\(Spain\)_-_PS/00191/2022\)) and PS / 00192/2022 ([https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=AEPD\_(Spain)\_-\_PS-00192-2022)](https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=AEPD_\(Spain\)_-_PS-00192-2022\)), also judged by the AEPD, since several telecommunications companies published the voice of the complainant without the proper adoption of measures to prevent her identity from being linked to the content.

The complaining party reported that several media outlets had
published on their websites the audio of the statement before the judge of a victim of
a multiple rape, to illustrate the news regarding the holding of the trial in a
case that was very media. The complaining party provided links to the news

published on the websites of the claimed media.

On May 10, 2021, a new letter was received from the party
claimant stating that he had been able to verify that there were means that had
eliminated that information, although it accompanied publications made by some

media outlets on Twitter where it was still available.

FIFTH: Received a letter from ATRESMEDIA on March 23, 2023,
warned that a computer error had occurred at the time of notification,
that had affected the text of the resolution made available to said media

communication on December 29, 2022. The resolution received by ATRESMEDIA
It only had the first 17 pages of a text with a total of 53
pages. Although the text of the resolution signed by the Director of the AEPD was
totally correct, said error had affected the text notified to the media
communication, which was incomplete.

Consequently, despite the fact that the resolution issued by the Director of the AEPD on
December 27, 2022 was a valid act, it could not be effective, given that the
notification made on December 29, 2022 had been incomplete and had

limitation period contemplated in article 72 of the LOPDGDD.

                                    Competence

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR) recognizes each
control authority and as established in articles 47, 48.1, 64.2 and 68.1 of the
Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Protection of Personal Data and

guarantee of digital rights (hereinafter, LOPDGDD), is competent to
initiate and resolve this procedure the Director of the Spanish Protection Agency
of data.

Likewise, article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: “The procedures

processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency will be governed by the provisions
in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in this organic law, by the provisions
regulations dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with a
subsidiary, by the general rules on administrative procedures.”

                              Voice as personal data

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/19

A person's voice, according to article 4.1 of the GDPR, is personal data when
make it identifiable, and its protection, therefore, is the object of said RGPD:

“Personal data”: any information about an identified natural person or
identifiable ("the interested party"); An identifiable natural person shall be considered any person

whose identity can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of
an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, data of
location, an online identifier or one or more elements of identity
physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social of said person;”

The voice is a personal and individual attribute of each physical person that is defined

for its height, intensity and timbre. Endowed with unique and singular distinctive features that
individualize it directly, associating it with a specific individual, it is molded
when speaking, being able to know, through it, the age, sex, state of health of the
individual, his way of being, his culture, his origin, his hormonal, emotional and
psychic. Elements of the expression, the idiolect or the intonation, are also data of

personal character considered together with the voice.

For this reason, report 139/2017 of the Legal Office of this Agency states that “the
image just as a person's voice is personal data, just as it will be
any information that allows you to determine, directly or indirectly, your identity
(…)”

In fact, the Judgment of the National Court dated March 19, 2014 (rec.
176/2012) says that “a person's voice constitutes personal data, as
As can be deduced from the definition offered by article 3.a) of the LOPD,
as
<<any information concerning identified natural persons or

identifiable>>, a question that is not controversial.”

Article 4.2 of the GDPR defines “processing” as: “any operation or set
of operations carried out on personal data or sets of personal data,
whether by automated procedures or not, such as collection, registration,
organization, structuring, conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction,

consultation, use, communication by transmission, dissemination or any other form of
enabling access, collation or interconnection, limitation, deletion or destruction.”

The inclusion of a person's voice in journalistic publications, which identifies or
makes a person identifiable, involves processing personal data and, therefore
Therefore, the person responsible for the treatment that carries out the same is obliged to comply with

the obligations for the data controller set forth in the RGPD and in
the LOPDGDD.

                                           II

                           Right to data protection

This procedure begins because the claimed party published, on the websites
website referred to in the facts, the audio of the statement before the judge of a victim of
a multiple rape, to illustrate the news regarding the holding of the trial in a

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 5/19

case that was very media. The victim's voice could be seen clearly
recount in all crude details the multiple rape suffered. All of this constitutes
processing of personal data of the victim.

People have the power of disposal over their personal data, including

his voice, as well as its diffusion, resulting, without a doubt, deserving of
protection of the person whose personal data is disclosed in violation of the law
legal.

Thus, STC 292/2000, of November 30, provides that "the content of the right
Fundamental to data protection consists of a power of disposal and control

on personal data that empowers the person to decide which of those data
provide to a third party, be it the State or an individual, or which can this third party
collect, and which also allows the individual to know who owns that personal data
and for what, being able to oppose that possession or use. These powers of disposition and
control over personal data, which constitute part of the content of the right

fundamental to data protection are legally specified in the power of
consent to the collection, obtaining and access to personal data, its subsequent
storage and treatment, as well as its use or possible uses, by a third party, whether the
State or an individual. And that right to consent to knowledge and treatment,
computer or not, of personal data, requires as complements
essential, on the one hand, the ability to know at all times who has access to

those personal data and what use they are subjecting them to, and, on the other hand, the power
oppose that possession and uses.”

In this sense, and regardless of the legal basis that legitimizes the
treatment, all data controllers must respect the principles of
treatment included in article 5 of the RGPD. We will highlight article 5.1.c) of the

GDPR which states that:

"1. Personal data will be

c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
that are processed (“data minimization”);”

However, we are faced with a fundamental right that is not absolute,
since, if necessary, the Fundamental Right to Data Protection can
give in to the prevalence of other rights and freedoms also constitutionally
recognized and protected, such as, for example, the Fundamental Right to Freedom of
Information, weighing it case by case.

However, in the present case, as we will explain, it must be considered that the
treatment carried out by the claimed party within the framework of freedom of
information has been excessive, as there is no prevailing public information interest in
the dissemination of the voice of the victim - without providing any added value to the information

maintaining the victim's real voice (without distorting, for example) -, under which pretext
It seems that those data have been disclosed; voice that, added to the fact that it is
a very high-profile case, makes the victim clearly identifiable. When weighing the
competing interests and, taking into account the concurrent circumstances of this case,
that is, the particularly sensitive nature of personal data and the intense

                                Right to information

relationship with the Fundamental Right to the Protection of Personal Data, even
when the equal degree of protection of both constitutional rights is recognized,

evaluate and weigh all the elements at play.

Now, preponderance does not mean prevalence when, taking into account all the
concurrent circumstances in a specific case, the limits set are exceeded
normatively and jurisprudentially.

In this sense, the Article 29 Working Group in its Opinion 06/2014 on the
concept of legitimate interest of the data controller under the

Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC, when examining the legal basis of the legitimate interest of the
article 7.1.f) of Directive 95/46/EC, fully transferable to the current art. 6.1.f) of the
GDPR, includes the right to freedom of expression or information as one of the
cases in which the question of legitimate interest may arise, asserting that “without

             Limits to the Fundamental Right to Freedom of Information.

That said, the Fundamental Right to Freedom of Information is also not
absolute. We can observe very clear limits established by the courts in the
civil sphere, in relation to the Right to Honor, Personal and Family Privacy and
the Image itself.

Thus, we will cite, for all, STC 27/2020, of February 24, 2020 (recourse of
amparo 1369-2017) that provides, in relation to the image of a person, and
starting from the uncontroversial fact that makes it identifiable, that “…the question
debated is reduced to pondering whether the non-consensual reproduction of the image of a

anonymous person, that is, someone who is not a public figure, but who acquires
suddenly and involuntarily a role in the newsworthy event, in this case as
victim of his brother's failed murder attempt and subsequent suicide
of this, represented an illegitimate interference in their fundamental right to their own
image (art. 18.1 CE).

…that criminal events are newsworthy events, even with
independence of the private subject nature of the person affected by the news. Without
However, the limit is in the individualization, direct or indirect, of the victim, since

This data is not of public interest because it is not relevant to the information
that is allowed to be transmitted (SSTC 20/1992, of February 20; 219/1992, of
December; 232/1993, of July 12; 52/2002, of February 25; 121/2002, of 20
May, and 127/2003, of June 30). Thus, it is currently recognized by Law 4/2015, of 27
of April, of the crime victim statute, in force since October 28, 2015,
when he warns of the need "from the public powers \[to offer\] a

response as broad as possible, not only legal but also social, to the victims,
not only reparation of damage in the framework of a criminal process, but also
minimizing other traumatic effects on the moral that his condition can
generate, all this regardless of their procedural situation. Therefore, the present
Statute, in line with European regulations on the matter and with the demands that

raises our society, claims, based on the recognition of the dignity of
victims, the defense of their material and moral assets and, with it, those of the group of
the society". In cases such as those raised in this appeal, this Court must
give relevance to the prevalence of the right to the image of the victim of the crime
against information freedoms, since graphic information became idle or
superfluous because the photograph of the victim lacks real interest for the transmission of

the information, in this case the apparent accomplishment of a homicide and subsequent
suicide” (emphasis added).

We will add the STS, from its First Civil Chamber, 272/2011 of April 11, 2011
(rec. 1747/2008), in which, regarding the data necessary to provide a

information and limits to the public interest states that "b) Trivial information is not
protects (ATC 75/2006), but the fact of providing unnecessary data in a case of
rape (full name, last name initials, street portal where
the victim lived) that have no community relevance, do not respect the reservation, only
seek to satisfy curiosity, produce disturbances or annoyances and reveal

unnecessarily forms aspects of personal and private life, allowing neighbors,
close persons and family members the full identification of the victim and the knowledge
with great detail of an act that seriously violates his dignity (STC
185/2002) or about a disease that is of no public interest and directly affects
direct to the irreducible scope of intimacy and that is revealed to the effect of a pure
joke or joke (STC 232/1993);”.

Likewise, the STS, of its First Civil Chamber, Sentence 661/2016 of 10
November 2016 (rec. 3318/2014), in relation to the collection and disclosure in court
of the image of a victim of gender violence established that “1.) The
interest of the questioned information nor the right of the defendant television network

to broadcast images recorded during the oral trial of the criminal case, since they do not
There is no limitation in this regard agreed upon by the judicial body.

2.) The only controversial point is, therefore, whether the identification of the plaintiff
as a victim of the crimes prosecuted in said criminal case, through first

shots of his face and the mention of his first name and place of residence, was
also included in the fundamental right of the television channel
demanded to transmit truthful information or, on the contrary, was limited by the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 8/19

fundamental rights of the plaintiff to her personal privacy and her own
image.

3.) Regarding this issue, jurisprudence has recognized the general interest and the
public relevance of information on criminal cases (sentence 547/2011, of 20
July), which are accentuated in cases of physical and psychological abuse (sentences
128/2011, of March 1, and 547/2011, of July 20), but has also pointed out,
regarding the identification of the people involved in the trial, that the
accused and the victim are not on an equal footing, since in terms of

That one does allow a complete identification, and not only by his initials, due to the
nature and social significance of the crimes of mistreatment (sentence 547/2011,
of July 20).

\[…\]

6.) In short, the defendant television network should have acted with the prudence of the
diligent professional and avoid broadcasting images that represented the
recurring in the foreground, either by refraining from broadcasting the corresponding shots,
either using technical procedures to blur their features and prevent their
recognition (ruling 311/2013, of May 8). Similarly, it should also

avoid mentioning his first name, because this information, insufficient on its own to
constitute illegitimate interference, became relevant when pronounced on screen
simultaneously with the image of the plaintiff and add the mention of her
location of residence, data all of which are unnecessary for the essence of the content
of information, as demonstrated by the news about the same trial published at the

next day in other media. 7.) The identification of the plaintiff through her
image and personal data indicated and its direct link to an episode of
gender violence and other serious crimes, when disclosure was foreseeable
Simultaneous or subsequent data referring to how the victim and her aggressor met
and the way in which the criminal acts occurred, supposes that the loss of the

anonymity would violate both the plaintiff's right to her own image, by the
emission of their physical features, such as their personal and family intimacy, to the extent that
that some reserved data, belonging to his private life (who went to the Internet
to start a relationship or the intimate content of some of their talks), lacking
offensive entity in a situation of anonymity, they began to have it from the moment
in which any person who watched those news programs and who resided in the

location of the victim could know who they were referring to, so that the damage
psychological damage inherent to his condition as a victim of crimes was added to the moral damage
consisting of the disclosure of information about his private life that he had not consented to
make public.” (underlining is ours).

As we can see, a clear reference is made to the excessive treatment of
personal data (some of which are not of an intimate nature) to provide the
information, considering them unnecessary at all points in attention to the
concurrent circumstances. Sometimes the courts refer to intimate data,
but sometimes it is personal data that is not intimate, such as, for

For example, the image of a natural person obtained from a photograph published in a
social network or name and surname.

  Balance between the Fundamental Right to Freedom of Information and the Right
             Fundamental to the Protection of Personal Data.

In the specific case examined, as we have indicated, the claimed party
published, on the websites referred to in the facts, the audio of the statement before the
judge of a victim of multiple rape, to illustrate the news of a very
media.

Thus, it is not a question, as in other cases examined by jurisprudence, of endowing
of prevalence to a fundamental right over another, having to choose which one has more
weight in a specific case. If not, rather, to find a balance between
both to achieve the achievement of the purpose of the first without undermining the second.
The reconciliation of both rights is nothing new, since the legislator

European Union mandates such reconciliation in article 85 of the GDPR.

As we have seen previously, the Fundamental Right to Freedom of
Information is not unlimited, since the jurisprudential interpretation when confronted
with other rights and freedoms does not allow the same in any case and to the full extent,
but, nevertheless, the prevalence that the courts usually give it can be seen

limited by other fundamental rights that must also be respected. Thus
observes its limitation when the personal data provided was unnecessary for the
essence of the information content.

We must consider the special circumstances present in the case

examined. This is a very young woman who has suffered multiple rape. In
In the published recording, you can hear her recounting, with great emotional charge, the
sexual assault suffered in all crudeness, narrating (...).

Furthermore, we cannot lose sight of the victim status of the woman whose voice, with

all the nuances exposed, has been spread.

Let us remember, for purely illustrative purposes, that Law 4/2015, of April 27,
of the Statute of the victim of crime provides for a special need for protection of
victims of crimes against sexual freedom or sexual indemnity, as well as
victims of violent crimes, both circumstances that occur in the alleged

examined.

In this case, the situation of the victim must be considered (who is not in the
same level of equality as the accused) and what it means to spread their voice with
all its nuances, as well as the special protection that the

legal system that, without restricting the supply of information, must be made
compatible with the principle of data minimization, applicable to the form, the
medium in which the information is supplied and disseminated due to the immediate impact on the data
personal and identification of the victim.

Precisely because the evident public information interest in the news is not denied,
given the general interest in criminal cases, in this specific case, it is not about
undermine the Fundamental Right to Freedom of Information due to the prevalence
of the Fundamental Right to the Protection of Personal Data, but of

guaranteed. That is, the media's freedom of information is not called into question.
of communication but the weighing with the right to data protection based
to the proportionality and need to publish the specific personal data of the voice. Such
situation could have been resolved with the use of technical procedures to

prevent voice recognition, such as, for example, distorting the voice of
the victim or the transcript of the story of the multiple rape, security measures
both, applied depending on the case in an ordinary way by the means of
communication.

At the most we must mean that the victim is an anonymous person and our

Constitutional Court, by all STC 58/2018 of June 4, affirms that the
public authorities, public officials and public figures or persons dedicated to
activities that entail public notoriety “voluntarily accept the risk of
that their subjective personality rights are affected by criticism, opinions
or adverse disclosures and, therefore, the right to information reaches, in relation to

with them, their maximum level of legitimizing effectiveness, insofar as their life and conduct
morals participate in the general interest with a greater intensity than that of those
private people who, without a vocation for public projection, see themselves
circumstantially involved in matters of public importance, to which
It is necessary, therefore, to recognize a higher level of privacy, which prevents

to public figures".

The STJUE (Second Chamber) of February 14, 2019, in case C 345/17, Sergejs
Buivids mentions various criteria to weigh between the right to respect for
privacy and the right to freedom of expression, among which are “the
contribution to a debate of general interest, the notoriety of the affected person, the

object of the report, the previous behavior of the interested party, the content, form and
the repercussions of the publication, the manner and circumstances in which it was obtained
information and its veracity (see, in this sense, the ruling of the ECtHR of 27
June 2017, Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v. Finland,
CE:ECHR:2017:0627JUD000093113, paragraph 165).

In such a way that for a matter to be considered of general interest,
public relevance, they will be not only for the person who intervenes, but also for the
matter to which it refers. Both requirements must concur, resulting, at greater
abundance of what was meant in the previous section, that in the case examined
the victim is not a public person; rather the contrary, it is of great interest that
is recognized by third parties, so it may entail a new penalty

to the one already suffered. The victim is an anonymous person and must remain so, in such a way that

In the present case, (i) we are not dealing with a person of public relevance, in the
sense that such relevance is sufficient to understand that it supposes, ex lege, a

dispossession of your fundamental right to the protection of your personal data, and (ii)
Although we are dealing with facts “of public relevance”, in the sense that they are revealed
as “necessary” for the presentation of ideas or opinions of public interest, that
need does not reach the provision of data that identifies the victim.

For this reason, and as the Supreme Court expresses in its ruling (civil) 697/2019, of 19
December 2019, the formation of a free public opinion does not require, nor justify,
that the fundamental right to one's own image is affected \[in this case the protection

of personal data\] with that gravity and in a way that does not maintain the necessary
connection with the identification of the person subject to the information.

It is worth mentioning the non-compliance with point 1 of the Digital Pact for the
protection of people, signed by the entities involved, which establishes that
"The signatories of the Charter will refrain from identifying the victims in any way.
