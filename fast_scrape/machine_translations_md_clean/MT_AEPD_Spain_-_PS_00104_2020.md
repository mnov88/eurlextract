## English Summary

### Facts

On 26/12/2018 AEPD received a complaint against XFERA MOVILES, S.A (YOIGO). The reason for the complaint is the fact that the claimant was able to access the data of a third party (personal data, invoices, telephone numbers and calls) in his personal space on the website of the company (miyoigo.yoigo.com). In the same way, the third party could, using its own password, manage the claimant's data. The claimant repeatedly asked YOIGO and the distributor to solve this situation, without obtaining any solution. AEPD requested information from YOIGO to clarify the facts. After a first evasive response, there was no response to a second request.

### Dispute

Did YOIGO violate the principle of integrity and confidentiality (Art. 5 GDPR, further developed in article 32.1 GDPR) by allowing the complainant to visualize and modify the personal data of a third party?

### Holding

AEPD considered that YOIGO processed the personal data of the claimant in violation of the principle of integrity when it managed the change of ownership of a telephone line. It also considered that the principle of confidentiality was breached, since the personal data of the claimant, at least the mobile phone number, was revealed to a third party, also client of YOIGO. These principles are specified in article 32 GDPR (security of processing).

In determining the amount of the fine, certain aggravating factors of article 83 GDPR were considered. The lack of diligence in processing personal data, their recidivism and the lack of response to the request for information by the AEPD determined the amount of the fine in EUR. 55,000. Nonetheless, two attenuating circumstances of the Spanish Law on Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (Article 85) could be applied, which may respectively reduce the fine by 20%. The first mitigating factor is to acknowledge their responsibility within the time allowed for the submission of claims. The second mitigating factor is, at any time prior to the resolution of the proceedings, to make voluntary payment of the proposed penalty.

On June 11, 2020, YOIGO proceeded to pay the sanction in the amount of EUR 33,000 applying therefore the two previously mentioned reductions. This implied the recognition of their responsibility and the resignation to any action or appeal in administrative channels against the sanction. After these events, the AEPD decided to terminate the procedure.

LEGAL FOUNDATIONS
I
By virtue of the powers conferred on each individual by Article 58(2) of the GPRS, the
supervisory authority, and as established in Articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD,
the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate
and to resolve this procedure.
II
Article 5 of the RGPD deals with the principles that should govern the
processing of personal data and mentions among them those of "integrity and
confidentiality". The precept states:
"1. Personal data shall be:
 (…)
 (f) Treated in such a way as to ensure adequate safety of the
personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing
against their accidental loss, destruction or damage, by the application of measures
appropriate techniques or organisational arrangements (<<integrity and confidentiality>>)"
The principle of integrity is developed through Articles 32 to 34 of the
RGPDs in Section II of Chapter IV under the heading "Security of
personal data". Article 32, "Security of processing", provides:
"Taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs, and the nature, extent, context and purposes of the processing, as well as the varying degrees of probability and seriousness of risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the

The documentation in the file provides solid evidence that the
processed the complainant's personal data in violation of the principle of
integrity, Article 5(1)(f) in connection with Article 32(1)(b) and (c), both of the GPRS,
when he handled the change of ownership of a mobile line that had been requested by the
claimant, as the new owner, and its hitherto owner, Ms. B.B.B.
Likewise, there is evidence that, as a consequence of such action, the following was violated
the principle of confidentiality (Article 5.1.f, GPRS) as they were disclosed to a
third party, also a customer of the claimant, personal data of the claimant, at least
the mobile phone number subject to the change of ownership that the operator linked to
that person.
It is accredited that on 29/11/2018 the claimant and Mrs. B.B.B. requested
before a YOIGO distributor the change of ownership in favor of the first in line
mobile \*\*\*TELÉFONO.1 that belonged to the latter. Work in the file copy of the
customer copy of the document, with the YOIGO anagram, of change of
ownership in which the personal data of the old and the new owner are recorded.
With respect to the claimant, in addition to NIF, name and two surnames, the postal address and
e-mail and the twenty-digit bank account for the direct debit of the
bill payment.
Furthermore, several points show that, on the occasion of the change of
ownership of the line requested by the claimant, the respondent did not apply the measures
organisational and technical measures necessary to ensure the security of the data processed.

They also show that the defendant had knowledge of the facts, at least,

quickly to the affected person in the availability of their data, in short, to guarantee
the integrity of the personal data processed.
Furthermore, it is proven that the claimant provided the SAC de YOIGO with the
name, surname, ID card and telephone number of the third party - also a customer of
operator - to which he linked the mobile line number that was the subject of the request for change of
ownership. Whether this data is visible to the claimant, as he claims, or not,
it seems clear that the claimant's mobile phone number was disclosed to the third party
that was the subject of a change in ownership. As the claimant has explained the third

Article 58 of the RGPD, "Powers", says in point 2:
"Each supervisory authority shall have all the following corrective powers
indicated below:
(…)
"(i) to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of
each individual case;"
It should be taken into consideration in order to determine the sanction to be imposed, the provision of article 83.3. of the RGPD according to which "If a person responsible or in charge
processing operations intentionally or negligently failed, in respect of the same processing operations or linked operations, to comply with several provisions of this
Regulations, the total amount of the administrative fine shall not exceed
provided for the most serious infringements'.
In similar terms, Article 29.5. of Law 40/2015, on the Legal System
of the Public Sector indicates that "When the commission of an infraction necessarily results in the commission of another or others, only the sanction corresponding to the most serious infraction committed should be imposed". (The underlining is from the AEPD)
In view of the above, the provisions of Articles 83(1) and 83(2) must be complied with
of the RGPD, precepts that they indicate: 
Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines under this Article for infringements of this Regulation by the person responsible or in charge, on a voluntary basis, to

such as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damages
that have suffered;
(b) the intentional or negligent nature of the infringement;
(c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to

(h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in
in particular whether the person responsible or the person in charge notified the infringement and, if so

(j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or to
certification approved in accordance with Article 42, and
(k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
case, such as the financial benefits obtained or the losses avoided, directly
or indirectly, through the infringement."
With regard to article 83.2 (k) of the RGPD, the LOPDGDD, article 76, "Sanctions and corrective measures", provides:
 "In accordance with the provisions of Article 83(2)(k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account

of the procedure, in order to determine the amount of the administrative fine to be imposed on the
claimed as responsible for a violation of articles 5.1.f, of the RGPD
-as set out in Article 83(5)(a) of the said regulation and 5(1)(f) in relation to Article 32(1)(b)
