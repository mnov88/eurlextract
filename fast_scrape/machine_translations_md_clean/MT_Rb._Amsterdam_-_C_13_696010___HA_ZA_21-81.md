## English Summary

### Facts

Five Uber drivers from the United Kingdom, and one from the Netherlands, argued that they had been wrongfully accused of fraudulent activity and consequently dismissed by Uber by solely algorithmic means in the sense of Article 22 GDPR.

The Uber drivers were represented by the App Drivers & Couriers Union ('ADCU') and Workers Info Exchange ('WIE').

### Holding

The Court issued a default judgment as Uber was not present at the hearing.

It:

*   considered Uber's decisions regarding the finding of fraudulent activity, the violation of its terms and conditions, and the employees' consequent dismissal, unlawful;
*   ordered Uber to reinstate the drivers' accounts within one week of the service of the judgment;
*   ordered Uber to pay the drivers a penalty of €5,000 for each day or part thereof that it does not comply with the main order, up to a maximum of €50,000;
*   ordered Uber to pay each driver damages, totalling €100,474.

## Comment

A default judgment is a binding judgment that may be issued without the execution of a full hearing if the defendant (in this instance, Uber), although notified, fails to reply to the court and does not appear at the court hearing.

The WIE has highlighted that the judgment represents the first time a court has ordered the overturning of an automated decision to dismiss workers from employment.

However, Uber has argued that the default judgment was not correctly served, stating "Uber only became aware of this default judgment \[on April 8\] due to representatives of the ADCU not following proper legal procedure. With no knowledge of the case, the court handed down a default judgment in our absence, which was automatic and not considered." Uber is now making an application to have the default judgment dismissed and have its case heard.

Notably, Uber pointed to a different judgment issued 2 weeks later by the same Court on 11 March 2021, [Rb. Amsterdam - C/13/692003/HA RK 20-302](/index.php?title=Rb._Amsterdam_-_C/13/692003/HA_RK_20-302 "Rb. Amsterdam - C/13/692003/HA RK 20-302"), which partially found in Uber's favour on similar issues. In the March judgment, the Court held that Uber's contract termination procedure does not constitute automated decision making under Article 22 GDPR.

This was reported by various media publications, linked in the 'Further Resources' section below.
