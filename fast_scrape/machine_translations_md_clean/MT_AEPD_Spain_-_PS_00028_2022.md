## English Summary

### Facts

On 31 March 2021, the City Council of Getafe (controller) published an Excel sheet on its website. This Excel sheet contained personal data of vehicle owners who had requested an address change. The Excel sheet included several categories of data, such as name, surname, tax identification number, ID number and vehicle registration number. The Excel sheet had thirty-six entries, but the vast majority of the data subjects that were mentioned were included several times in the list. It later turned out that seventeen people were affected by the breach. The controller had wanted to publish a call for a plenary session, but instead published this Excel document by accident.

On 31 March 2021, the data subject informed both the controller and the Spanish DPA of this breach. After this, the controller unlinked the Excel sheet from its website, so that it would not be available when navigating the controller website. There was therefore no way to reach the Excel sheet any longer by navigating the controller's website. It became clear later that no specialised IT personnel had worked on this solution.

However, the Excel sheet itself was not deleted from the internet and stayed online as an "orphan document". This meant that the Excel sheet could still be accessed, when typing the exact URL of the Excel sheet in the browser. People, who were aware of the exact URL, could therefore potentially still access the Excel sheet. The DPA confirmed that it was still possible to access the file on the controller's website on 1 December 2021. The controller deleted the file on 24 January 2022.

Despite the fact that the Excel sheet stayed online for several months after the initial complaint, the controller stated that it was unlikely that any data had been retrieved by unauthorised third parties, because the Excel sheet could only be accessed through the exact URL and not through any linking on the controller's website. This was also the reason why the controller decided not inform the affected data subjects. Also, the controller had not identified any serious harm as a result of this data breach.

### Holding

_First_, the DPA found a violation of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"), since the publication of the Excel sheet enabled unauthorised access to the personal data of the data subjects, in violation of the principle of confidentiality.

_Second_, the DPA found a violation of [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). The DPA held [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") requires the controller to have a complete protocol that must not only prevent the occurrence of the contingency, but, once it has occurred, react to the materialisation of the risk, so that the controller can guarantee the security of the processing. In this case, the controller failed to notice that the Excel sheet stayed online on the controller's website. The DPA also considered the fact that the controller did not involve IT services in this process, which the DPA considered 'obvious' in a situation like this. Furthermore, the DPA found that the controller had failed to make an appropriate assessment of the risks as a result of the breach. The controller also should have considered potential further risks as a result of the breach. The controller's argument that no data subjects were affected by the breach was disregarded by the DPA.

_Third_, the DPA found a violation of [Article 33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR"), because the controller failed to assess the level of severity of the data breach after it had occurred. In this case, the DPA found that there were risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects because of the breach. The controller should have notified the DPA, regardless of the fact whether harm had been caused to the data subjects.

On the basis of Articles 72 and 73 of the Spanish Data Protection Act - LOPDGDD, the DPA classified the infringements of [Articles 32](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR") and [33 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_33_GDPR "Article 33 GDPR") as "serious" offences, whilst the violation of [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") was considered a "very serious" offence. The DPA issued warnings for all of the above violations.

The Spanish DPA fined Mapfre, an insurance company, for a violation of Article 6 GDPR for processing personal data for an insurance policy without a legal basis. The initial fine was €30,000, but the procedure was closed after the voluntary payment of €24,000 by the controller.
The controller in this decision is Mapfre, a Spanish insurance company.   
In June 2021, the data subject requested access to his personal data. After two months, the controller had not provided an answer.    
According to the information which was later provided by the controller, the data subject was listed as the holder of nine insurance policies and had been responsible for submitting three insurance claims. However, the data subject claimed that he never had any contract with the controller. He requested the controller to block his data and provide him the proof that he took the insurance policies and authorised the processing of his data. In response, the controller stated that the personal data had been blocked. Additionally, The controller stated that the personal data it possessed was either provided by the data subject himself or had been generated as a result of his relationship with the controller.    
On 9 September 2022, the data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA. During the proceeding, the latter requested information from the controller. This additional information revealed that the data subject was registered in the controller's systems as a policyholder of one single automobile insurance. However, there were also eight other policies in which the data subject was mentioned as an employee of the 'Usual driver'. According to the controller, the data subject had acted as the responsible person/manager for the eight insurance policies where the employer was the policyholder. The data subject was the person of contact of the controller regarding these eight insurance policies.   
It appeared that the single insurance where the data subject was mentioned as the policyholder had been a mistake. However, according to the controller, the data subject had to be aware of all the insurance policies. With regard to the single policy, where the data subject himself was the policyholder, the controller stated that the data subject had submitted a copy of his ID, driving licence and other documentation in order to formalise the insurance. Regarding the eight other policies where the data subjects was mentioned as the regular driver, the controller stated that the data subject had underwritten these insurance policies and therefore had to be aware of their existence.  
The controller also stated that the single policy was concluded by an insurance agent and that this insurance agent had not acted according to the instructions provided by the controller.
The main issue stems from the single policy in which the data subject was mentioned as the policyholder. The DPA confirmed that the insurance agent, who had sold this insurance, was a processor acting on behalf of the controller. However, the DPA also determined that it was the controller who was liable for this issue. The fact that this processor did not comply with the technical instructions from the controller did not exonerate the controller from its liability.
Since the controller was liable for the processing, the DPA determined that the controller had processed the data of the data subject without being able to demonstrate that it had the legal authority to do so. Therefore, the controller would have to prove that the data subject had actually applied for the insurance and that all the requirements were fulfilled. However, the controller was apparently not able to do so. In the single insurance policy, the data subject was mentioned as the policyholder, despite the fact that he never consented to the contract for this insurance. Therefore, there was no legitimate basis for the processing. This resulted in a violation of Article 6(1) GDPR.
The initial penalty for this violation was €30,000, but the procedure was ended after the voluntary payment of €24,000 by the controller, in accordance with Spanish administrative law.
The data subject requested 'the blocking of his personal data' in this decision. This refers to Article 32 of the Spanish data protection Act.

Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of
Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), the claimed party submitted a written
of allegations in which, in summary, it states that: "First, MAPFRE ESPAÑA
has a sufficient legal basis for the processing of the personal data of the
claimant. This basis of legality is based on the contractual relationship established with
the policyholder, FURCORENT company, and consequently with all the
figures involved in this, as indicated in article 99 of Law 20/2015,
management, supervision and solvency of insurance companies and
reinsurance companies (LOSSEAR), where it is stated: "insurance companies

injured parties, as well as their successors without the need for their
consent for the sole purpose of guaranteeing the full development of the insurance contract and compliance with the
insurance contract and compliance with the obligations established in this Law and
in the development provisions". The contractual relationship is established with the
company FURCORENT through the issuance of the different policies and the
perfection of the contract through the payment of the first premium of these

certain information of the policyholder that allows him to assess the risk

contract (aggravations, risk reduction, exclusions, inaccurate statements,
falsehood, etc.). At this point the FURCONRENT policyholder was aware of his
obligation to declare true data knowing that the factors related to the
policyholder, owner, drivers and the vehicle are taken into account for the
risk assessment and premium calculation. Consequently, in the event of
reserve or inaccuracy in your statement the insurer's benefit will be reduced
proportionally to the difference between the agreed premium and that which would have been applied if the true entity of the risk
applied if the true entity of the risk was known. that have been omitted due to bad faith, MAPFRE
due to bad faith, MAPFRE SPAIN will be released from the payment of the benefit.

In the case examined, the regulations set forth and the statements
made by the claimed party, it can be inferred that the latter acts as the party responsible for the
treatment.
In article 4.8 of the GDPR, the person in charge of the treatment is defined as the person
physical or legal entity, public authority, service or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the data controller.
personal on behalf of the data controller.
All processing of personal data carried out by a manager must be governed by a
contract or other legal act under Union or State law

members entered into between the person in charge and the person in charge, as stipulated in the
Article 28, paragraph 3, of the GDPR.
In this regard, Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of "responsible for the
treatment" and "in charge of the treatment" in the RGPD, adopted by the CEPD, on 7
July 2021, detail the following:
"Although the elements provided for in Article 28 of the Regulation constitute its
essential content, the contract must serve so that the person in charge and the person in charge
clarify, by means of detailed instructions, how these will be applied in practice
fundamental elements. Therefore, the treatment contract should not be limited to
reproduce the provisions of the GDPR, but must include more information
specific and specific information about how the requirements will be met and the degree of
security that will be required for the processing of personal data object of the treatment contract.
treatment contract. Far from being a merely formal exercise, negotiation and
stipulation of the conditions of the contract serve to specify the details of the
treatment."
They add that "In general, the treatment contract establishes who is the party
determinant (the controller) and who, the party that follows the
instructions (the person in charge of the treatment)". Now, "If a party decides in the
practice how and why personal data is processed, that party will be the one
responsible for the treatment, even if the contract stipulates that it is the person in charge".
To determine the responsibility of the claimed party, it is necessary to take into account
that, if a processor infringes the Regulation when determining the purposes and
means of treatment, will be considered responsible for the treatment with respect to
said treatment (article 28, paragraph 10, of the GDPR).
Regarding the "Ends and means" the aforementioned guidelines include the following
considerations:
"(...)
Dictionaries define the word end as an "anticipated result that is pursued
or that guides the planned action" and the word medium as the "way in which
obtains a result or achieves an objective".
(...)
The determination of ends and means is equivalent to deciding, respectively, the
why and how of treatment: in a particular treatment operation, the controller is the party that determines why and how of treatment.
The controller is the party that determines why the processing takes place.
treatment (i.e. "for what purpose" or "for what") and how this objective will be achieved
(ie, what means will be used to achieve it). A natural or legal person who
thus influences the processing of personal data participates, therefore, in the
determination of the purposes and means of such treatment in accordance with the
definition provided for in article 4, point 7, of the GDPR.
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/18
The data controller must decide both on the end and on the means
treatment, as described below. Consequently, it cannot
limit itself to determining the end: it must also make decisions about the means of the
treatment. In contrast, the party acting as processor can never determine
the end of the treatment. In practice, if a data controller uses a
person in charge to carry out the treatment on behalf of that person, the person in charge
You will usually be able to make some of your own decisions about how to do this. He
CEPD recognizes that the person in charge of the treatment can enjoy a certain margin of
maneuver to make some decisions about treatment. In this sense, it is
necessary to clarify what degree of influence on the "why" and "how" entails that
an entity is considered responsible for the treatment and to what extent can the
person in charge of treatment to make their own decisions.
(...)"
In this case, taking into account the above, it can be concluded that the
The mere fact that the data processor fails to comply with Mapfre's instructions does not
release the defendant from liability. It has not proven that the
person in charge of the treatment was acting as the person in charge, since the
Treatment has been carried out following the instructions of the person in charge.
Thus, the claimed party violated article 6.1 of the GDPR, since it made the
treatment, without proving that he had contracted legitimately, had
of your consent for the collection and subsequent processing of your personal data, or there is
personal, or there is some other cause that makes the treatment carried out lawful.
Consequently, it has processed the personal data of the party
claimant without having proven that he has the legal authorization to do so.
Article 6.1 of the GDPR states that processing "will be lawful if it is necessary for the
performance of a contract to which the interested party is a party.
It was therefore essential that the claimed party accredit before this Agency that the
claimant had taken out said policy.
The claimed party has contributed to this Agency the issued policies: \*\*\* POLICY.2;
\*\*\* POLICY.3; 2\*\*\*POLICY.4; \*\*\* POLICY.5; \*\*\* POLICY.6; \*\*\* POLICY.7; \*\*\* POLICY.8;
\*\*\* POLICY.9, in which all of them appear as policyholder the
company FURCORENT and as their habitual driver the claimant
identifying as an employee.
However, Mapfre certifies that the policy 0\*\*\*POLIZA.101 contains the part
claimant as policyholder.
In its defense, the requested entity has stated that the mediator has with Mapfre
a treatment manager contract and that, in this case, has breached the
technical instructions for issuance and contracting established by Mapfre, providing the
custom treatment contract
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 11/18
Well, the responsibility falls on the data controller (Mapfre), not
on the person in charge (the agent) except in the case of article 28.3 of the
GDPR in which the person in charge was acting as responsible
Therefore, it is considered that the claimed entity has violated article 6 of the GDPR,
for carrying out a processing of personal data without legitimacy.
                                            II
Article 6.1 of the GDPR establishes the assumptions that allow the use of
processing of personal data.
"1. Processing will only be lawful if it meets at least one of the following
conditions:
a) the interested party gave his consent for the processing of his personal data
for one or more specific purposes;
b) the treatment is necessary for the execution of a contract in which the interested party
is part of or for the application at the request of the latter of pre-contractual measures;
c) the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation applicable to the
responsible for the treatment;
d) the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another
Physical person.
e) the processing is necessary for the fulfilment of a mission carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of public powers.
public or in the exercise of public powers conferred on the data controller;
f) the treatment is necessary for the satisfaction of legitimate interests pursued
by the person in charge of the treatment or by a third party, provided that on said interests do not outweigh the interests of the data controller
interests do not outweigh the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
interested party that require the protection of personal data, in particular when the interested party is a child.
interested is a child.
The provisions of letter f) of the first paragraph shall not apply to the treatment
carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their functions."
On this question of the legality of the treatment, Recital 40 also affects
of the aforementioned GDPR, when it provides that "For the treatment to be lawful, the
Personal data must be processed with the consent of the interested party or on
some other legitimate basis established in accordance with Law, either in the present
Regulation or by virtue of another Law of the Union or of the Member States to which
referred to in this Regulation, including the need to comply with the legal obligation
applicable to the data controller or the need to perform a contract with
to which the interested party is a party or in order to take measures at the request of the
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 12/18
concerned prior to the conclusion of a contract".
It should be noted that in one of the insurance contracts, as acknowledged by the party
claimed, the claimant party appears as the policyholder, and did not consent to the contracting
therefore, there is no legitimizing basis for those included in article 6
of the GDPR.
The GDPR applies to personal data, which is defined as "personal data":
any information about an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject");
An identifiable natural person shall be considered any person whose identity can be
be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier, such as
for example a name, an identification number, location data, a
online identifier or one or more elements of physical identity,
physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social of said person.
Hence, the claimant's data was processed without a legitimizing basis.
                                            IV.
In accordance with the evidence available at the present time of
agreement to start the disciplinary procedure, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction, it is considered that the facts exposed fail to comply with the provisions of the
article 6.1. of the RGPD, for which it could suppose the commission of an infraction
typified in article 83.5 of the GDPR, which provides the following:
 Violations of the following provisions will be penalized, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of maximum EUR 20,000,000 or,
in the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
total annual global business volume of the previous financial year, opting for
the highest amount:
a) the basic principles for the treatment, including the conditions for the
consent under articles 5, 6, 7 and 9;
b) the rights of the interested parties in accordance with articles 12 to 22; \[...\]".
The LOPDGDD, for the purposes of the prescription of the infringement, qualifies in its article 72.1
very serious infringement, in this case the limitation period is three years,
<<b) the processing of personal data without the fulfilment of any of the conditions of
legality of the treatment established in article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679>>
                                            V
In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the
provisions of articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR, precepts that state:
"Each control authority will guarantee that the imposition of administrative fines
under this Article for infringements of this Regulation

28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/18
indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are effective in each individual case,
proportionate and dissuasive."
"Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or in
individual case, in addition to or in lieu of the measures contemplated in
Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding to impose a fine
administration and its amount in each individual case shall be duly taken into account:
        a) the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence, taking into account the
        nature, scope or purpose of the processing operation in question
        as well as the number of stakeholders affected and the level of damage and
        damages they have suffered;
        b) intentionality or negligence in the infraction;
        c) any measure taken by the controller or processor
        to alleviate the damages and losses suffered by the interested parties;
        d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or the person in charge of the
        processing, taking into account the technical or organisational measures that have
        applied under articles 25 and 32;
        e) any previous infringement committed by the person in charge or in charge of the
        treatment;
         f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority in order to put
        remedy the breach and mitigate the potential adverse effects of the breach;
        g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
        h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement,
        in particular if the person in charge or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in such a
        case, to what extent;
        i) when the measures indicated in article 58, paragraph 2, have been
        previously ordered against the person in charge or in charge in question
        in relation to the same matter, compliance with said measures;
        j) adherence to codes of conduct under article 40 or to mechanisms
        of certification approved in accordance with article 42, and
        k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
        case, such as the financial benefits obtained or the losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the
        or indirectly, through the infraction."
Regarding section k) of article 83.2 of the GDPR, the LOPDGDD, article 76,
"Sanctions and corrective measures", provides:
       "2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
may also be taken into account:
      (a) The continuing nature of the offence.
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 - Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/18
      b) Linking the activity of the offender with the performance of processing
of personal data.
      c) The benefits obtained as a consequence of the commission of the infraction.
      d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have led to the
commission of the offence.
      e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of
the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.
      f) The affectation of the rights of minors.
      g) Have, when it is not mandatory, a data protection delegate.
      h) The submission by the person in charge or in charge, with character
voluntary, alternative conflict resolution mechanisms, in those
cases in which there are controversies between those and any interested party."
From the documentation provided, it can be deduced that only one

By virtue of the sectoral regulations, it is possible to be exempted from liability because the

Likewise, it is considered appropriate to graduate the sanction to be imposed in accordance with the
following criteria established in article 83.2 of the GDPR:
As a mitigation:

       76.2.b) of the LOPDGDD. The development of business activity
