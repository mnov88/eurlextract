## English Summary

### Facts

Following the investigations carried out in November 2019 on Taksi Helsinki’s processing, the Tietosuojavaltuutetun toimisto found several serious GDPR violations regarding the processing of customers’ audio and video personal data.

### Dispute

The Tietosuojavaltuutetun toimisto raised six data protection law issues regarding the processing of both audio and video data which can be summed up as below: - Does the controller process audio and video data for security purposes in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR? - Does the controller process audio and video data in accordance with 5(1)(c) GDPR? - Does the information provided to data subjects regarding the security camera and the automated decision making process comply with Article 12 GDPR? - Did the controller identify the actors playing a role in the processing, with respect to Articles 4(7), (8) and Articles 26, 28 GDPR (processor, controller, joint controllership)? - Did the controller maintain a record of processing activities according to Article 30 GDPR? - Did the controller perform a data protection impact assessment prior to the implementation for the security camera system, as prescribed under Article 35 GDPR?

  

### Holding

First, the Tietosuojavaltuutetun toimisto decided that the controller was not able to demonstrate that the processing of video and audio data for security purposes complies with Article 5 (1) (a) and Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. Thus, the controller failed to comply with the accountability principle under Article 5 (2) GDPR. Second, the data protection authority pointed out that the recording of images and sound in all of the company’s cars did not comply with the principle of data minimisation under Article 5(1)(c) GDPR. The recording of the image would have fit the purposes of safety and the investigation of criminal offences and damages which might have occurred, as claimed by the controller. Regarding the information to be provided to the data subjects, the data protection authority ruled that several pieces of information were missing, such as the right to lodge a complaint and whether the provision of personal data is a legal or contractual requirement, (Article 13 (2) and (e) GDPR). The authority also stated that there was no link between the controller’s privacy policy and the information about the loyalty program website targeting the consumer. This prevents the data subject from exercising their GDPR rights during the processing, and results in an incomprehensible overview of the processing of personal data by the controller in the context of the automated decision making for the loyalty program. Thus, the authority held that the controller did not comply with Article 12 GDPR. In identifying the controller or processor, in particular the role of the taxi drivers in the processing at stake, the authority held that Taksi Helsinki did not defined what personal data it processes as a controller. Thus, the authority decided that Taksi Helsinki failed to demonstrate its compliance with Article 26 GDPR. Furthermore, Article 30 GDPR does not require that a report of the processing activities has to be drawn in a specific form other than in writing. However, a report has to be drawn in a document and cannot only subsist in the privacy statements that the data controller provided. Thus, Taksi Helsinki violated Article 30 GDPR. Lastly, the authority decided that the controller did not carried out any impact assessment. Thus, the controller breached Article 35 GDPR.

Grounds for the decision of the Assistant Data Protection Supervisor
1. Legitimate under Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation
advantage as a basis for addressing security camera surveillance and the lack of
test
Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation lists the situations in which the processing of personal data may take place
can be considered legal. According to paragraph 1 (f) of that Article, one of these situations

rights and freedoms override such benefits, especially if the data subject is a child (later
legitimate interest).
According to recital 47 of the General Data Protection Regulation, such a legitimate interest may exist

such that the data subject is a customer of or employed by the controller.
According to the same paragraph, the existence of a legitimate interest must in any event be

at the time and in the context that personal data may be processed for that purpose. eTEN
the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could override the interests of the controller if the
processed in circumstances where the data subject cannot reasonably expect further processing.
According to Article 5 (1) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation, personal data must be
lawfully, properly and transparently for the data subject. Article 2 of the same article
paragraph 1, the controller shall be responsible for it and shall be able to demonstrate that paragraph 1
has been complied with (the so-called obligation to demonstrate).
The application of a legitimate ground of priority under the General Data Protection Regulation requires
on the one hand the legitimate interests of the data controller or third-party evaluation of the existence and
on the other hand, an assessment of whether the legitimate interest of the controller overrides the interests of the data subject or
rights or freedoms. The existence of a legitimate interest of the controller may be demonstrated by this
with the so-called balance test. 
The Office of the Data Protection Supervisor has included in its guidelines published on 24 May 2018
the use of its legitimate interest as a legal basis. In particular, the performance of the balancing test

The statement received from the controller indicates that it has not prepared or documented a

and Article 6 (1) (f).
The EDPS draws attention to the fact that the opinion of the Data Protection Board of 25 February 2002
This Decision concerns the processing of audio data in the context of security camera surveillance. Now under evaluation
the processing of personal data and the technology used in connection therewith have changed
significantly, so that the controller cannot rely on
the decision of the panel and the assessments made in the context of the impact of the
the interests, rights or freedoms of data subjects, as such. 
Nor can the data controller’s claim that the general data protection regulation
application of Article 6 (1) (f) of this Regulation, including those relating to the balancing test
requirements, the legal situation would be so unclear that compliance could not be required by the
from suppliers. The EDPS draws attention to the fact that the information contained in the balancing test
and the obligation to document in accordance with the obligation to demonstrate is defined in the
protection regulation and that the general data protection regulation does not require a balancing test in a particular
in terms of. The EDPS also draws attention to the controller's argument
that the website of the Office of the Data Protection Officer contains a comprehensive and practical
how the balance test can be performed.
2. The processing of audio and video data in the context of security camera surveillance
in the light of the principle of minimization set out in Article 5 (1) (c) of the Regulation
According to Article 5 (1) (c) of the General Data Protection Regulation, personal data must be:
appropriate and relevant and limited to what is necessary in
for which they are processed (the so-called data minimization principle).
According to recital 39 of the General Data Protection Regulation, ‘… personal data should be

of view. This requires, in particular, that the retention period for personal data be as short as possible.
Personal data should only be processed if the purpose of the processing cannot reasonably be achieved
by other means. "
The report received from the controller and any other report obtained by the EDPS’s office is
ests. The Office of the EDPS has not been provided with unambiguous information on whether the
the controller intended to process both audio and video data in the context of security camera
conjunction. 
On the basis of the report provided by the controller and the publicly available information, it is
that the controller has been aware that the audio data will be processed in some of its transmission

said housing. The controller may be deemed to have taken steps to terminate the processing
December 20, 2019, when it called the cars covered by its brokerage service for voice recording operations
to deactivate. 
Although the controller has reformulated the purposes of the processing as the case progressed,
safety and the investigation of criminal offenses and damage can be considered as the basis for the
common elements for the purposes of security camera surveillance when such processing
based on a legitimate interest. Until the controller has taken steps to
to eliminate flight and when voice recording has still been used in some cars, processing
purposes, the report provided by the controller and publicly available must be considered
including monitoring of operational processes on the basis of privacy statements. 
In its report, the controller has not provided any justification as to why it has processed the
in addition to the data, audio data in some of their cars. On the other hand, the controller has
argued at a later stage that the processing of audio data was an error. As above
it has emerged that this is inconsistent with other clarification received in the case.
Since, on the basis of the controller’s report, it processes image data in all its cars,
the processing of image data shall be deemed to be its normal processing and the processing of
van beyond this.
The security camera surveillance practice indicated by the controller, in which only part of its
In addition to image data, voice data and data from the controller are also recorded.
On the basis of this report, it can be concluded that the processing of audio data has not been necessary
for the purposes defined by it and that it has been able to achieve the security camera
the purposes of the processing of personal data which it has defined for the purposes of
by.
Accordingly, the EDPS considers that the processing of the controller's voice data is secure.
In addition to image data in the context of camera surveillance, there has been no
accordance with the principle of data minimization in paragraph 1 (c) and has not been able to
demonstrate compliance with the same section of the General Data Protection Regulation
in accordance with Article 5 (2) of that Regulation.
3. Transparency of processing as required by Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
in this way
Article 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation requires the controller to take appropriate action
measures to provide the data subject with the information in accordance with Articles 13 and 14 and Articles 15 to 22 and

4. Actors involved in the processing of personal data 
According to Article 4 (7) of the General Data Protection Regulation, “controller” means the
a list of any person or entity, authority, agency or other body, alone or jointly

As described above, the controller has provided a general privacy statement, recordable

In accordance with Article 30 (1) (e) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the controller is

The EDPS also considers, firstly, that the General Data Protection Regulation does not
require that a report on the processing operations be drawn up in a specific form other than that
