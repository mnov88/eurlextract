## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject made an access request to a job portal for accessing the assessment that the company had carried out on her regarding her application to a job. The job offer was a blind offer, so the claimant did not know which company was behind the offer.

The job portal alleged that they did not store any of the data from the candidates or the companies, and that the companies were not allowed either to store or process any data outside the portal. Therefore, they could not give the data subject any data, given that they did not have any.

They said, however, that they could help the data subject contact the company that made the offer.

### Holding

The AEPD concluded that, even if the portal did not have any data _per se_, the right to access includes the communications of such data and the recipients to which it is disclosed. Therefore, the controller should at least provide this information.

In their holding, they ordered the controller to comply with the right to access in this sense.

Considering the claim made on August 18, 2020 before this Agency by Mr.
A.A.A. , against ADEVINTA SPAIN, S.L., for not having been duly attended to your
Right of access.

The procedural actions provided for in Title VIII of the Law have been carried out.
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the following have been verified

                                       FACTS

before this Agency and on the exercise of the right exercised, states that, participated

in a personnel selection procedure in InfoJobs and requested them, access to the
assessment made to your CV by the company that had offered the job,
since he did not know the entity that convened the position, he also points out that, given the
anonymous nature of the bidding company, you cannot exercise your right of access
before the company that processed your data, because the complainant does not provide them.

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of the LOPDGDD, which has provided for a
mechanism prior to the admission for processing of claims made before
the AEPD, consisting of transferring them to the Data Protection Delegates
designated by those responsible or in charge of the treatment, for the intended purposes
in article 37 of the aforementioned norm, or to these when they have not been designated,

transferred the claim to the claimed entity to proceed with its
analysis and respond to the complaining party and this Agency within a period of
month.

In summary, the defendant made the following allegations, they do not participate in the

selection process or in the evaluation of candidatures and that it does not request that
information in any case.

That the offers published with a "blind profile" of the company, the protection policy of
data explicitly informs the user about this point.

That the company in question cannot incorporate the CV into its database or extract the
the system itself, so there was no data communication, and there is no possibility
to request any right of access to third parties.

What is Infojobs who is responsible for the information, custody and facilitates

its users the exercise of their rights, and does not make any communication without their
explicit consent (when the job offers so require). Within
this framework of action, client companies that use Infojobs to recruit, only

have temporary access to candidate data, but do not have any rights
to extract that information or process it in other systems, nor of course they can
use the information for purposes other than those related to the
selection process. As the personal data of the affected party is related to said
candidacy solely and exclusively responsibility of Infojobs, so there is no
possibility of requesting the exercise of rights to any other entity, such and how the

candidate requested

That it does not store any information related to the subjective assessment of the
candidate and his selection process by client companies as
the affected party claims.

exist, in which it affects the complaining party, all selection process is managed
within the Infojobs environment, the other case, which is the one mentioned by the claimant
but not applicable to your case, the selection process is managed outside the environment of
Infojobs, allowing the client to store the data of the
candidate.

That both types of inscriptions have different characteristics.

That the use of the service that is established in these cases the obligation of the client to
use the data of the candidates who apply for their offers only to
manage that specific selection process and always within the environment of the

claimed and once the selection process is closed, the client is not authorized to
use said data for other selection processes or to keep any type of data
of said candidacies. Therefore, and since client companies only
can temporarily view the candidate data, but cannot extract it or
process them in other systems, there should be no candidate data on that

selection process on any other platform or system.

That the claimed is solely responsible for the data and these should not be found
in systems other than the Infojobs platform. Therefore, any right
access to your personal data related to this selection process must

be attended exclusively by the claimed.

That the complaining party was informed that the company's assessment of its
candidacy does not exist, nor is it data that the platform processes or stores.

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

That Infojobs client companies can view the candidate's data, and
they can advance it in the selection process or discard it, but not enter data
relating to the evaluation of the candidacy. Therefore, it is not possible to satisfy the

User request or provide data that has not been received or stored.

That I know from the user's privacy area, it is implemented in a
automated to extract your personal data available on the portal and data from
third parties that may intervene as data controllers, and

That recruiters' ratings do not exist on the platform and should not
exist in any other because the client, taking into account the conditions of use, does not

However, information regarding the identity of the company can be extracted from the
