## English Summary

### Facts

A pharmacist (data subject) was disciplinary sanctioned by the pharmacists' association for having used certain commercial practices prohibited in this profession. The data subject contested this decision with several courts. This led the controller to amend the rules of professional conduct.

Following this change, the data subject considered that the sanction was now illegal and requested the controller to erase the mention of its sanction from all registers and to stop processing this data. The controller considered that the sanction had not been made illegal and refused to delete the sanction from the registers. This led the data subject to lodge a complaint with the Belgian DPA.

The data subject considered that the unlimited retention of sanctions was inappropriate, that the controller had breached [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR") by refusing to delete her data and that the principles set out in [Article 5 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") had been violated. It added that the disciplinary sanction was included in the notion of conviction within the meaning of [Article 10 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_10_GDPR "Article 10 GDPR").

In its defence, the controller explained in particular that unlimited retention was prescribed by national regulation and that [Article 17](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR") included exceptions that applied to the case in point. It added that it had taken steps to improve data processing.

### Holding

The DPA analysed the respect of each principle for each purpose of the processing.

As to the lawfulness of the processing, the DPA considered that each purpose had to have a legal basis. The processing in question had several purposes and the DPA considered that for some of them there was no adequate legal basis, in breach of [Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1a "Article 5 GDPR"), in particular when the controller wrongly relied on national regulations.

As for the storage limitation, it must not exceed what is necessary for each purpose. Here, the DPA considered that unlimited storage was not necessary for all purposes, for example to manage disciplinary cases, it was not necessary to retain data for an unlimited period and that the controller was in breach of [Article 5(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1e "Article 5 GDPR") by not having a reasonable personal data retention policy.

As regards purpose limitation, the DPA considered that the controller had not sufficiently specified the purposes, in breach of [Article 5(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1b "Article 5 GDPR").

As for minimisation, the DPA concluded that there had been a breach of [Article 5(1)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"), in particular because all the data relating to a sanction could be consulted to check the eligibility of a candidate for election to the pharmacists' association, which was not necessary.

As for the principle of accuracy, the DPA considered that the controller should review the sanctions after the amendment of the professional conduct regulations to assess whether the sanction was maintained. By failing to do so, the controller was in breach of [Article 5(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1d "Article 5 GDPR").

As for Article 10, the DPA did not follow the data subject's argument. It held that a minor disciplinary sanction such as that in the case in point was not a criminal conviction within the meaning of [Article 10 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_10_GDPR "Article 10 GDPR").

As for [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR"), the DPA held that the processing operations were unlawful, which meant that the data subject was entitled to request the erasure of her data under [Article 17(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR#1d "Article 17 GDPR") without the exceptions applying.

In conclusion, the DPA found a breach of [Articles 5(1)(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"). It ordered the controller to comply with the erasure request and fined €30,000.

  Royal Decree no. 80, art. 13. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 5/49

        I.1.2. The context of the case

 11. A disciplinary sanction - namely a reprimand - was pronounced against the

       complainant in second instance by the French-speaking Appeal Board on December 22, 2016.

       This sanction was adopted following the violation of the essential principles of the

       profession of pharmacist due to the following commercial practices: advertisements

       advertisements, the installation of advertising banners on a website and the use of

       Google AdWords services. The plaintiff lodged an appeal in cassation against this

       decision but the Court of Cassation rejected the appeal on January 5, 2018.

           er
 12. On September 1, 2017, the complainant, alongside other pharmacists, filed a complaint

       with the Belgian Competition Authority (hereinafter “ABC”) to denounce the practices

       restrictive of the defendant, both because of its normative policy and the exercise of its

       disciplinary mission. In response to these complaints, the CBA issued two rulings

       closure, subject to the adoption of undertakings by the defendant in the first
                                                                19
       decision and a transaction in the second decision. One of the commitments offered by

       the defendant sought to reform the Code of Pharmaceutical Ethics (hereinafter “the Code”)

       in order to remedy restrictive interpretations of competition by the authorities

       disciplinary matters in matters of advertising and commercial practices, or to review all five

       years the Code taking into account the decision-making practice of the disciplinary councils in a

       to avoid restrictive interpretations of competition by them. 20

                                                                                               21
 13. As a result of these decisions, the Respondent adopted a new Code in January 2020.

 14. On January 27, 2020, the plaintiff friends ordered the defendant to proceed with the erasure

       in “all registers, files and other ‘criminal records’ of the Order, any

       information in connection with the reprimand pronounced on December 22, 2016, and to cease all

       processing involving this personal data”. 22According to the complainant, the decision of 22

       December 2016 pronounced by the Respondent’s Francophone Appeal Board would be the

       result of an anti-competitive practice sanctioned as such by the ABC. This

       decision would be unlawful and the processing of the data contained in such a decision

       would therefore violate the GDPR.

 15. In this formal notice, the complainant cites two damages suffered: her sanction

       prevent him from being eligible for election to the Provincial Council, the Appeals Council and the

19 Belgian Competition Authority, decision of October 15, 2019, ABC-2019-P/K-34 and decision of October 15, 2019, ABC-
2019-P/K-35. ; Complainant exhibits 8 and 9. ; Exhibits 4 and 5 of the defendant.

       National Council and this sanction could be taken into account as an aggravating factor

       in any future disciplinary decisions. 23

 16. Finally, the complainant alleges several breaches of the provisions of the GDPR: the

       defendant would have violated both the principles of data minimization, accuracy and

       limitationofpreservation,becausethepreservationofanillegaldisciplinary decision would

       not relevant or necessary, that the principle of transparency enshrined in Articles 12, 13
             24
       and 14. Regarding the absence of a retention period, it indicates that the Order would not have

       not set a retention period for disciplinary data, as required by article 5.1.e of the

       GDPR. Disciplinary sanctions would therefore never be erased. The Complainant

       therefore requested the erasure of the disputed data in accordance with Article 17.1.d of the

       GDPR.

                                                                                     25
 17. On April 22, 2020, the Respondent responded to the Complainant's request. In summary, according to

       the defendant, there is no reason to consider that the disciplinary sanction taken against

       the complainant is invalidated by the decisions of the CBA and the adoption of the new Code. THE

       data would remain adequate, relevant and necessary since they allow

       the assessment of recidivism in the context of new disciplinary cases and

       applications to become an internship supervisor and are also used to assess the conditions

       eligibility for the different councils. The retention of disciplinary sanctions is

       always relevant in view of the annual requests from universities that verify the past

       ethics of internship supervisor candidates. In addition, the table of pharmacists,

       containing the disciplinary sanctions, is only accessible to a limited number of

       people. The defendant indicates that he can avail himself of two exceptions provided for in

       Article 17, paragraph 3 of the GDPR, namely, on the one hand, a legal obligation of the Order to

       process this data (art. 17.3.b GDPR) and, on the other hand, the defense of its rights in court (art.

       17.3.e GDPR).

 18. In the same letter, the Respondent also stated that he was beginning to reflect on

       the principle of limitation of data retention.

23For the influence of an existing disciplinary decision on the part of a pharmacist on a future decision, the council of
the complainant recalls that “a decision of December 12, 2017 of the Provincial Council of Liège imposed on Mrs. X a
suspension of the right to practice the profession for a period of three days, justifying this serious sanction by the existence of a
sanction for previous similar behavior (publicity). Admittedly, this suspension never came into force because
Mrs. X appealed against this decision and the procedure before the Appeal Board was suspended following the complaint before
the competition authority, but it is a good illustration of the risk. (point 4 of the appendix to the complaint filed on March 24, 2022). There
Litigation Chamber notes the absence of proof of this damage.
24The complainant points out in her email of January 27, 2020 that the Order never provided the mandatory information

CONCERNING THE TREATMENTS FOLLOWED BY THE ORDER OR THE disciplinary bodies depending on it, THEIR
implementation and the rights related thereto or that no information relating to the GDPR is made available to
25pharmaciens on the Order's website in order to inform them of the processing of data concerning them.

respondent's reply. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 7/49

    I.2. Procedure

        I.2.1. Admissibility of the complaint

 19. As indicated in point 1, on March 24, 2022, the complainant lodged a complaint with

       ODA.

 20. On April 7, 2022, the complaint was declared admissible by the Service de Première Ligne on the
       of articles 58 and 60 of the LCA and the complaint is transmitted to the Litigation Chamber in

       pursuant to Article 62, § 1 of the LCA.

        I.2.2. Object of the complaint

 21. In her complaint, 26 the complainant regrets that, following her request of January 27, 2020, the

       defendant did not erase the disputed data. She regrets that the principle of registration

       ad vitam aeternam of any sanction in a disciplinary file is still in force

       despite the promises of reflection announced by the defendant in April 2020 and complains that

       the personal disciplinary file of a pharmacist is accessible without restriction of access.

       It opposes the reasoning of the Order which justifies the unlimited preservation of the sanctions
       because of their relevance for assessing recidivism in new cases and

       evaluate applications for internship supervisors.

 22. The complainant points to other breaches of the provisions of the GDPR. The defendant would

       violated the fundamental principles enshrined in Article 5, paragraph 1 of the GDPR as well

       than Article 10 of the GDPR since, according to the complainant, data relating to the sanction
       disciplinary data must be assimilated to judicial data and require measures of

       adequate guarantees. Finally, the defendant would also have violated Article 17 of the GDPR by

       refusing to erase the disputed data despite his formal notice (points 14 to 16).

 23. The Complainant's claims regarding the disputed data are as follows:

       I.2.3. Substantive examination by the Litigation Chamber

          er er
24. On September 1, 2022, the Litigation Chamber decides, pursuant to Article 95, § 1, 1° and

      of article 98 of the LCA, that the case can be dealt with on the merits.

25. The same day, the parties concerned are informed by registered mail of the

      provisions as set out in Article 95, § 2 and Article 98 of the LCA. They are

      also informed, pursuant to Article 99 of the LCA, of the deadlines for transmitting their

      for the submissions in reply of the complainant on October 21, 2022 and finally that for the

      Respondent's submissions of November 4, 2022.

26. In this same letter, the Litigation Division invites the parties to present their

      arguments on the following allegations:

           - Violation of the principles of purpose limitation, minimization of data,

               accuracy and limitation of storage (Article 5.1.b, 5.1.c, 5.1.d and 5.1.e of the

               GDPR);

           - Violation of the principle of legality (article 5.1.a of the GDPR);

           - Violation of Article 10 of the GDPR on the processing of judicial data;

           - Violation of Article 17 of the GDPR relating to the request for erasure.

27. On September 1, 2022, the complainant acknowledged receipt of the letter sent on September 1

      2022 informing the parties that the Litigation Chamber has decided to proceed with an examination

      of the substantive complaint.

28. On September 2, 2022, the Respondent acknowledges receipt of the aforementioned letter, agrees to

      LCA. On the same day, the defendant requests a copy of the file (art.95,§2,3°LCA), which

      is sent to them on September 8, 2022.

       I.2.4. Arguments of the parties Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 9/49

29. On September 30, 2022, the Litigation Chamber receives the submissions in response from the

      respondent. A summary of his full argument will be detailed in paragraphs 45 and

      following.

           I.2.4.1. The complainant's position

30. On October 20, 2022, the Litigation Chamber receives the conclusions in reply of the
      complainant. His argument can be summarized as follows.

          1. Regarding compliance with the principle of the storage limitation (article 5.1.e of the GDPR)

31. The complainant considers that the unlimited retention of personal data

      relating to the disciplinary sanctions adopted by the defendant, that is to say throughout the

      career of a pharmacist, is excessive. This excessive nature would also be reinforced

      by the fact that the defendant does not distinguish between the degrees of seriousness of the

      sanctions adopted: a minor sanction, in this case the sanction of reprimand
      pronounced in December 2016, should not be kept for the entire duration of the

      career of a pharmacist.

32. The Complainant accuses the Respondent of hiding behind the lack of precision in the

      retention period law for not adopting a retention period
      adequate and emphasizes that it would be up to the data controller to fill the

      deficiency of the law under Article 5.2 and recital 39 of the GDPR).

          2. Regarding compliance with the principle of purpose limitation (Articles 5.1.b of the GDPR)

33. The complainant considers that the ad vitama eternam conservation of data, in this case the

      sanction of reprimand, would violate the principle of minimization: a piece of data is only relevant

      and adequate for the pursuit of a purpose only during the retention period justified by

      this same purpose. The complainant admits that the Order may sanction at a given time
      unethical behavior, due to its legal mission. However, she

      do not realize that this appreciation given at a given moment is permanent and affects

      the professional life of the pharmacist "until \[his\] death" without the possibility of deletion or

      reappraisal.

          3. Regarding compliance with the principle of data minimization (article 5.1.c of the GDPR)

34. As to the principle of purpose limitation, the complainant links compliance with this principle to the

      principle of retention limitation: data stored for too long could not
      be processed again for its original purpose. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 10/49

            4. Regarding compliance with the principle of accuracy (Article 5.1.e of the GDPR)

 35. The Complainant argues that the principle of accuracy of personal data should

       be examined with regard to the purpose for which the data is processed and insists on the

       distinction to be made between the “veracity” of the data (which, according to her, refers to reliability) and
       “the accuracy of the data” (which refers to the link between the data and the purpose of the processing).

       So that true data can become inaccurate within the meaning of the GDPR when it is no longer

       relevant to the purpose initially pursued. Therefore, keeping a

       disciplinary sanction is acceptable to assess the recidivism, but only for a

       time.

            5. Regarding compliance with the principle of lawfulness (Art. 5.1.a of the GDPR)

 36. According to the Complainant, the principle of lawfulness must be applied in combination with the other

       principles of Article 5. Therefore, the shortcomings attributed by the plaintiff in the

       defendant would lead to the violation of the principle of legality. To support his point, the

       complainant relies on the Google Spain judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter
       “the CJEU”) which would deduce the unlawful nature of data processing “not only from the

       fact that these data are inaccurate but, in particular, also because they are

       inadequate, irrelevant or excessive in relation to the purposes of the processing, whether

       are not updated or that they are kept for a period exceeding that

       necessary, unless their conservation is necessary for historical, statistical or

       scientists”.7

 37. Next, referring to the Respondent's privacy statement, the

       complainant contests the basis of certain processing operations on the basis of the lawfulness of the interest

       legitimate within the meaning of Article 6.1.f of the GDPR. The Respondent could not rely on such a basis

       of lawfulness because of its mission of public interest. In addition, the criteria for the duration of

       retention of data would be too vague. This imprecision would lead to the violation of the

       principles of loyalty and transparency.

 38. According to the Complainant, the processing carried out by the Respondent should be based on a

       legal obligation (article 6.1.c) or on a mission of public interest (article 6.1.e of the GDPR).

            6. Regarding compliance with Article 10 of the GDPR

 39. For the complainant, the ethical sanctions, because of their characteristics and

       their consequences, in particular on the ability to exercise the profession, must be

       included in the concept of criminal convictions and offenses within the meaning of Article 10

       of the GDPR. Therefore, for the plaintiff, the defendant should have provided guarantees

       appropriate for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

27CJEU, judgment of May 13, 2014, Google Spain SL and Google Inc, C-131/12, §92. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 11/49

          7. Regarding compliance with Article 17 of the GDPR

40. According to the complainant, the retention of personal data would no longer be
      necessary with regard to the purposes for which they were collected and the data

      would be treated without rules as to their retention period. Therefore, the defendant would have

      had to follow up on his request to delete the disputed data. Rejecting his request

      to exercise his right to erasure, the defendant would have violated the provisions of Article

      17.1 a), d) and e) GDPR.

41. The Complainant contests the justifications put forward by the Respondent for not following up

      his right to delete personal data. First, the defendant

      invokes a legal obligation, making it necessary to process the disputed data (art.

      17.3.b). The defendant considers itself legally bound to process this data on the basis of

      several duties:

          - The maintenance of the list of pharmacists as well as the exercise of the functions

              of the College of Pharmacists (articles 8, 12, 14 and 15 of AR no. 80);

          - The transmission of data relating to a disciplinary sanction to the FPS Health

              public as part of the permanent federal database of

              health professionals (based on articles 97 and following of the law

              coordinate of 10 May 2015 relating to health care professions).

              data request rosters and opt-out information
              temporary or permanent right to practice health professionals;

          - The transmission of disciplinary sanctions to the other Member States via the

              IMI system (based on article 114/1 of the law of 10 May 2015). This basis of

              data requires information on the restriction of the exercise of professionals
              health.

42. Secondly, the defendant justifies its refusal to delete the personal data

      plaintiff's staff by the need to continue to process the disputed data in the
      defense of his rights in court (art. 17.3.e GDPR). The plaintiff who lodged an appeal

      in annulment against certain provisions of the Code of Ethics before the Council of State,

      the defendant would need to process the disputed data in the context of this

      procedure.

43. As to the first justification put forward by the Respondent, the Complainant denied the need

      to transmit the data in question to comply with these legal obligations: the

      minor sanctions would not be data collected by these databases.

      114/1 of the law of May 10, 2015 would not require the communication of character data

      personnel relating to a minor disciplinary sanction because such data would not enter

      not in the information covered by the obligation of this article. Article refers to restrictions Decision on substance 77/2023 – 12/49

       or prohibitions from practicing, which a reprimand would not be. About the bank

       permanent federal health care professional ethical sanctions

       would not be part of the information to be communicated. Only temporary withdrawals or

       should be mentioned, which does not justify the transmission of data

       contentious.

 44. Finally, with regard to the second justification relating to the exercise of the defendant's rights to

       defend in court the proceedings still pending between the parties before the Council of State

       refers to the Code of Ethics, a code adopted by the National Council, the normative body of the

       respondent. According to the complainant, the management of disciplinary sanctions would be the responsibility of the

       disciplinary bodies of the defendant and not of its normative body. The complainant submits

       that the defendant would not respect the distinction established by law between its organs

       of its normative body by invoking this exception to erasure for
       retain disciplinary action.

            I.2.4.2. The defendant's position

 45. On November 4, 2022, the Litigation Chamber receives the summary conclusions of the

       respondent.

           To. Regarding compliance with the principle of storage limitation (article 5.1.e of the GDPR)

 46. The defendant established the criteria in order to determine the duration of the retention of the data

       of a personal nature that he is required to process in a general manner: “The Person in charge of the

       Processing retains Personal Data (i) for as long as it is

       necessary or relevant for the purposes indicated above, (ii) for the period during

       required by law, or (iii) for as long as legal litigation or investigations may
                  28
       take place. » . These criteria would meet the requirement of Article 13.2.a of the GDPR.

 47. With regard to the disputed data, the defendant considers that their retention period is

       reasonable since the processing of personal data relating to the sanction

       disciplinary action against the complainant would have started when the sanction decision became

       effective, after the appeal in cassation, i.e. on February 5, 2018. The disputed data

       would thus have been kept for a period of less than five years.

 48. Furthermore, more generally, the Respondent indicates that the disciplinary sanctions

       are kept until the end of the pharmacists' career, because Royal Decree no. 80 obliges them to do so.

 49. The Respondent argues that it has undertaken a reflection on the retention period of the
       disciplinary sanctions since 2020.

28Pages 34 to 35 of the Respondent's summary submissions Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 13/49

           b. Regarding compliance with the principle of purpose limitation (Articles 5.1.b of the GDPR)

 50. The Respondent considers that the disputed data was collected and processed for

       a specific, explicit and legitimate purpose, namely compliance with the legal obligations of the

       disciplinary defendant. The disputed data would have been processed

       subsequently in a manner compatible with the aforementioned purpose.

           vs. Regarding compliance with the principle of data minimization (article 5.1.c of the GDPR)

 51. The disputed data processed would be relevant for the purposes of processing

       for which they are intended (i.e. the management of the disciplinary file, the evaluation of

       eligibility conditions for counsel for the defendant). In addition, access to data

       contentious is restricted. This principle is therefore not infringed.

           d. Regarding compliance with the principle of accuracy (Article 5.1.e of the GDPR)

 52. The Respondent emphasizes that the disputed data, including the sanction, were

       recorded, following the appeal in cassation and that the decisions adopted by the ABC and
       the adoption of the new Code of Ethics would not have rendered these data inaccurate. THE

       respondent points out that, at the time the sanction of reprimand was adopted, the acts of

       complainant were deemed objectionable by the Appeals Board. Even assuming that the

       Complainant's question is relevant, according to the Respondent, it is not certain that the

       Appeals Board would have judged the facts differently in light of the new provisions of the

       Code of ethics. It is therefore not excessive to keep track of the sanction

       disciplinary action, in particular to take it into account in the event of recidivism or to assess the

       Conditions of eligibility.

 53. Finally, the Respondent recalls that the Complainant had demanded in 2020, on the basis of this principle,

       that “the data be erased or, at the very least, corrected by indicating that the sanction
                                                                                                    31
       allegedly unlawful was pronounced in contravention of competition law”.

       Insofar as the complainant does not demonstrate that the disputed data has become

       inaccurate, excessive or irrelevant, the defendant believes that it does not violate the principle

       GDPR accuracy.

           e. Regarding compliance with the principle of lawfulness (Art. 5.1.a of the GDPR)

 54. The Respondent considers that the Complainant's reasoning relating to the Google Spain judgment

       could not apply in this case because the defendant would not have violated any principle of the GDPR

       in the context of the processing of the disputed data.

respondent.
30Idem.
31Paragraph 86 of Respondent's Reply Submissions. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 14/49

 55. The Respondent also clarifies that the legitimate interest, as a basis of lawfulness within the meaning of

       Article 6.1.f of the GDPR is not invoked in the context of the processing of disputed data.

       For these treatments, the defendant invokes a legal obligation.

           f. Regarding compliance with Article 10 of the GDPR

 56. For its part, the Respondent argues that the purpose of Article 10 of the GDPR is to create a

       obligation on the part of the legislator: the appropriate safeguards for the processing of

       judicial sanctions must be provided for by the law of the European Union or of the State

       member, and not controllers. The defendant announces that in the absence of

       clear guarantees imposed by the legislator, it nevertheless took the initiative to define
       reasonable retention periods, to ensure that the data relating to the sanctions

       disciplinary procedures are accessible only to a limited number of people and to take

       technicalandorganizationalmeasurestoensureconfidentialityandintegrity

       of said data. This is why the defendant points out that there can be no question of a

       violation of Article 10 of the GDPR.

           g. Regarding compliance with Article 17 of the GDPR

 57. The Respondent recalls that the Complainant had initially requested, in her letter of 27

       January 2020, the deletion of his disputed data based on the illegality

       of the sanction (art. 17.1.d GDPR). To the extent that the defendant contested the illegality of the

       sanction, he did not comply with his request. He also disputes the new arguments
       provided by the complainant on the grounds that the data processed would always be adequate and

       relevant, and their reasonable retention period (less than five years after the adoption

       final sanction).

 58. Furthermore, the Respondent raises two exceptions to the right to delete data at

       personal nature applicable to his situation (see points 41 and 42): the legal obligation to

       transmit data to databases containing information on the
       health professionals (article 17.3.b of the GDPR) and the legal defense of their rights

       (Article 17.3.e of the GDPR).

 59. Finally, the defendant assures that the disputed data will be erased anyway,

       following the adoption of the new Internal Rules (hereinafter “ROI”) in March 2023,

       subject to compliance with the conditions of a new automatic erasure mechanism
       minor sanctions handed down more than five years ago .32

        I.2.5. The hearing of the parties

32 This is what the defendant asserted during the hearing of January 24, 2023. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 15/49

60. On October 20, 2022, the complainant expressed her intention to use the possibility of being

     understood, in accordance with Article 98 of the LCA.

61. On November 28, 2022, the parties are informed that the hearing will take place on January 17

     2023. On January 16, 2023, the defendant requested the postponement of the hearing, which the Chamber

     Litigation accepted with the plaintiff's approval. The parties were then admitted

     postponement of the hearing to January 24, 2023.

62. On January 24, 2023, the parties are heard by the Litigation Chamber.

63. On February 20, 2023, the minutes of the hearing are submitted to the parties.

64. On February 24, 2023, the Litigation Chamber received comments relating to the trial

     from the part of the defendant which it decides to take up in its deliberation. On the other hand,

     the Litigation Chamber receives no comments from the complainant.

       I.2.6. The imposition of an administrative fine

65. On May 17, 2023, the Litigation Division informed the defendant of its intention to
     proceed with the imposition of an administrative fine as well as the amount thereof, in order to

     give the defendant the opportunity to defend himself before the penalty is effectively

     inflicted. She also asks him to provide her with a balance sheet.

66. On June 2, 2023, the Litigation Division received the defendant's reaction concerning
     the intention to impose an administrative fine and the amount thereof, as well as the balance sheet

     defendant's accountant. The defendant argues that the Litigation Chamber bases itself on

     elements contrary to those appearing in the file and does not understand the context

     legislation relating to the College of Pharmacists. It also disputes certain criteria applied

     by the Litigation Chamber to impose an administrative fine.

67. The Respondent raises in particular the absence of mitigating circumstances on its part.

     According to him, the defendant has taken many initiatives and steps since 2020 in order to

     bring the processing carried out with the disputed data into compliance.

     be considered as a mitigating circumstance for the imposition of a fine

     administration.

68. The Respondent also indicated that the disciplinary sanction pronounced against the

     complainant has been deleted. The Litigation Chamber notes, however, that it does not provide the

     evidence. These arguments are discussed in paragraphs 199 to 208 of this decision. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 16/49

II. Motivation

    II.1. As for the identification of the disputed data and the controller

 69. The Litigation Chamber recalls that Article 4.1) of the GDPR defines data of a nature

       personal as “any information relating to an identified natural person or

       identifiable (hereinafter referred to as the “data subject”); is deemed to be a "person

       identifiable natural" means a natural person who can be identified, directly or

       indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, a number

       identification, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more

       specific elements specific to his physical, physiological, genetic, psychic identity,

       economic, cultural or social; \[…\]”.

 70. Processingofpersonaldatameans“anyoperationanytogether
       operations carried out or not using automated processes and applied to

       data or sets of personal data, such as the collection,

       the recording, organization, structuring, preservation, adaptation or

       modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission,

       dissemination or any other form of making available, reconciliation or interconnection,

       limitation, erasure or destruction”.

 71. The Litigation Division finds that the sanction imposed on the complainant

       and all information related to this sanction contains personal data
                                    34
       personal within the meaning of the GDPR. Like the parties, the Litigation Chamber emphasizes that

       the creation of a disciplinary file for a pharmacist, the registration in this file of a

       disciplinary sanction, or the consultation, communication or even storage of
       the sanction are, pursuant to Article 4, 2) of the GDPR, as much data processing to

       personal character.

 72. The Litigation Chamber recalls that Article 4.7) of the GDPR defines the person responsible for the

       treatment as "the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or

       other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and

       means of treatment; when the purposes and means of this processing are determined

       by Union law or the law of a Member State, the controller may be

       designated or the specific criteria applicable to its designation may be provided for by the

33 GDPR, Art. 4.2.
34See in particular CJEU, judgment of 2017, Nowak c. Data Protection Commissioner, §34: ““any information” in the
framework of the definition of “personal data”, set out in Article 2(a) of Directive 95/46, reflects
the objective of the Union to attribute a broad meaning to this concept, which is not restricted to sensitive information or
private, but potentially encompasses all kinds of information, both objective and subjective in the form of opinions or
assessments, provided that they “concern” the person in question. » Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 17/49

                                                                  35
       Union law or by the law of a Member State. The concept of responsible

       processing is an autonomous concept of European law, the assessment of which must be made at the

       with regard to the following criteria: the determination of the purposes of the data processing

       concerned as well as the determination of the essential means thereof. According to the Committee

       European Data Protection Authority, there is, in principle, no limitation as to the

       type of entity likely to assume the role of data controller. 38

 73. Based on the aforementioned elements, the Litigation Division understands that the Order

       pharmacists, as a professional order in the field of health, has been charged

       by the Belgian legislator to regulate the pharmaceutical profession. Reason for this mission,

       the defendant is expected to pursue a mission to regulate access to the profession

       pharmaceutical, opinion, advice and prevention, but also disciplinary mission. These

       missions, of public interest, were therefore assigned to the defendant, the Order of Pharmacists,

       by the legislator. And, even if the activities of the Order and its organs are regulated

       by legislative and regulatory measures, the defendant has a certain margin

       freedom to determine the means necessary for the pursuit of these purposes. There

       Chambre Litigation deduces from this that the Order of Pharmacists is responsible for

       processing carried out with the disputed data and other data relating to

       disciplinary sanctions.

    II.2. Regarding compliance with the principle of lawfulness (Article 5.1.a of the GDPR)

 74. The principle of lawfulness is one of the key principles of the GDPR and alone conditions the application

       other GDPR principles governing the processing of personal data.

       application of article 5.1.a of the GDPR, any processing of personal data must

       including being fair, transparent and lawful. To be lawful, any processing of data to

       personal character must in particular invoke a basis of lawfulness in Article 6 of the GDPR. He

       it is up to the data controller to determine what is the adequate basis of lawfulness

       with regard to the purpose of the processing.

 75. For these reasons, the Litigation Division will therefore first examine compliance with this

       principle before addressing the other grievances of the complaint.

 76. Article 6(1) of the GDPR lists six bases for lawfulness of processing: in addition to

       consent (art.6.1.a of the GDPR), the processing of personal data may be

       necessary for the performance of a contract (art. 6.1.b of the GDPR), for compliance with a legal obligation

35
36 GDPR, Art. 4.7.
   See for example the decision 63/2022 of the Litigation Chamber of May 2, 2022, available on

controller and processor in the GDPR, version 2.0 of July 7, 2021, points 39 et seq.
38EDPS, op. cit., p. 11. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 18/49

        (art. 6.1.c of the GDPR), the performance of a mission of public interest or relating to the exercise of

        the public authority (Art. 6.1.e of the GDPR), to the legitimate interests pursued by the controller

        of the processing or by a third party (Art. 6.1.f of the GDPR), or is necessary to safeguard the

        vital interests of the data subject (Art. 6.1.d GDPR).

 77. Each processing should be justified by a basis of lawfulness mentioned above.

        When the same processing pursues several purposes, each purpose must be based on

        a basis of lawfulness.

 78. In this case, the defendant mentions that the processing of personal data

        subject of the complaint is the keeping of a register of disciplinary sanctions. 39

        However, the Litigation Division considers this presentation of the facts by the

        respondent. Indeed, it appears from the documents in the file, including the conclusions of the defendant

        and the complainant, that the complaint actually targets several processing operations carried out with the

        disputed data (conservation, consultation, transmission of disputed data).

 79. It also appears from the documents in the file that this processing pursues the purposes

        different, which are as follows:

 80. Processing for these purposes requiring the storage, consultation or

       transmission of the disputed data, the Litigation Chamber will examine the

       bases of lawfulness for each purpose.

        II.2.1. Management of disciplinary cases

 81. On several occasions, the Respondent invokes the management of “disciplinary cases” as

       purpose of processing the disputed data.

 82. First and foremost, for the sake of clarity, the Litigation Division wishes to clarify what it intends

       in this decision by:

       - Management of disciplinary cases: all actions taken by the Councils

           Provincial Councils and Appeals Councils necessary to regulate the behavior of
                                                                                                       48
           pharmacists with a view to imposing respect for pharmaceutical ethics

           (ranging from the opening of an investigation, to the investigation of the case, the prosecution, the judgment,

           the transmission of a file to an appeal body and the assessment of the risk of recidivism
                                            49
           in the event of a subsequent procedure). The management of disciplinary cases requires keeping

           a disciplinary file reflecting the current disciplinary status of a pharmacist and

           containing the decisions pronounced against the pharmacist;

       - Disciplinary file: the individual file, specific to each pharmacist, in which

           finds the disciplinary sanctions or other decisions pronounced against a

           pharmacist. This file reflects the disciplinary status of a pharmacist.

 83. In the present case, the defendant invokes a legal obligation within the meaning of Article 6.1.c of the
                                                         50
       GDPR for the management of disciplinary cases. To do this, the defendant invokes the article

       15 of Royal Decree no. 80, requiring the National Council to keep a directory of case law, the

       articles of Royal Decree no. 80 instituting disciplinary jurisdiction on the part of the Councils
                                               51
       provincial and Appeals Councils, as well as the articles of Royal Decree no. 80 defining the
                                                                        52
       conditions of eligibility for positions in the organs of the respondent.

 84. Pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 1, c) of the GDPR, the processing can be considered as

       lawful when it is necessary "for compliance with a legal obligation to which the person responsible for the

       treatment is submitted”. As clarified by the Article 29 Working Party, for a

       controller can rely on article 6.1.c of the GDPR to process data

       personal data, the controller must be obliged to do so by or

       under a legislative standard.

48 See not.J.ALARDIN,J.CASTIAUX, Disciplinary law in the case law, Brussels, Larcier, 2014, p. 50: “The action
disciplinary has, in fact, for the purpose of research if the holder of a profession has violated the rules of ethics or

discipline or has damaged the honor or dignity of his office or profession”.
50 This list is not exhaustive.

 85. In accordance with Article 6.3 of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Article 22

       of the Constitution and with Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union
       European Union, this legislative standard must define the essential characteristics of a

       data processing, necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or falling

       the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. In the

       aforementioned provisions, it is emphasized in this respect that the processing in question must be

       framed by a sufficiently clear and precise standard whose application must be predictable

       for the people concerned. 53In accordance with Article 6(3) of the GDPR, this

       standard must define the purpose(s) of the processing.

 86. However, the Litigation Division finds that the provisions of Royal Decree no. 80 put forward by the

       defendant to demonstrate a legal obligation on his part (point 82) do not mention

       explicitly the management of disciplinary cases. They allow at most

       Provincial Councils and Appeals Councils to adopt disciplinary sanctions and assess

       the eligibility of candidates for election. Evaluation of the conditions of eligibility for elections
       of the defendant's organs does not pursue the same purpose as the management of the cases

       disciplinary proceedings. The Litigation Chamber finds that Article 15 of AR No. 80 mentioned in

       effect the keeping of a register of disciplinary decisions at the expense of the National Council but

       the purpose of which is well defined and does not target the management of disciplinary cases: this

       register must be used to “adapt, if necessary, the code of ethics with a view to supplementing or

       to specify its provisions on the basis of this case law”.

 87. In the legal provisions invoked by the Respondent, there is therefore no question of the

       keeping of a disciplinary file or the assessment of the offense.

       rely on Article 6.1.c of the GDPR to justify the management of disciplinary cases. A

       hypothetical legal obligation based on Royal Decree no. 80 could only justify part of the

       processing carried out by the defendant (RD no. 80 only mentions the adoption of
       sanction and consultation of sanctions in order to determine the eligibility of a candidate for

       elections). This legal basis, erroneously invoked by the defendant, could not

       allow data subjects to understand the extent of the processing carried out

       with personal data relating to disciplinary sanctions. This

       ignorance on the part of the defendant is therefore not compatible with the obligation to

       transparency. The defendant will therefore violate Article 5.1.a of the GDPR by invoking a basis of

       erroneous legality.

 88. However, the Litigation Chamber does not conclude that there is no legal basis

       adequate regarding the processing(s) of data in the context of business management

       disciplinary.

53 DPA, decision on the merits 47/2022 of 4 April 2022, p. 22, item 106, available at
https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/publications/decision-quant-au-fond-n-47-2022.pdf . Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 21/49

 89. Indeed, with regard to its missions, it is normal that a professional order such as the Order

       of pharmacists can keep a disciplinary file of its members up to date in order to

       continue its disciplinary mission.

 90. In accordance with Article 6.1.e of the GDPR, processing of personal data

       may be necessary for the performance of a mission of public interest or relating to the exercise of

       the official authority vested in the controller by virtue of a provision

       legislative. Unlike the legal obligation provided for in Article 6.1.c of the GDPR, the

       processing necessary for the pursuit of the mission of public interest must not be

       explicitly described in a legislative provision. Salaries, according to the Chamber

       Litigation, are based rather on the public interest mission conferred on the head of the

       treatment. 55 The legal basis must, at least, define the missions of public interest or falling

       of the exercise of official authority which justify the need for the processing of data to

       personal character. The purpose of the processing must also be determined in this

       legal basis .6

 91. The notion of “processing necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest” has a

       broad in scope since it covers not only the processing necessary for the execution of the

       mission of public interest in the strict sense, but also the processing necessary to

       the performance of tasks directly related to this mission of public interest, including the

       processing necessary for the management and operation of the bodies responsible for

       this mission of public interest.

 92. The Article 29 Working Party rightly noted that this legal basis is relevant

       for: “a professional association, such as a bar association or a professional association

       doctors, vested with the required public authority, may initiate disciplinary proceedings

       against some of its members. 57

 93. In this case, the management of disciplinary cases involves the processing necessary to

       the exercise of the quasi-jurisdictional functions of the Provincial Councils and the Councils

       appeal of the Order. These disciplinary functions are, in accordance with Article 6.3 of the GDPR,

       exclusively attributed by Royal Decree no. 80 to the Provincial and Appeals Councils of the Order.

       The assessment of the risks of recidivism in the assessment of the sanction to be adopted is

       also necessary to pursue this mission.

 94. In view of the foregoing, the Litigation Chamber concludes that the treatments of the

       disputed data consisting of the management of disciplinary cases by the Councils

       Provincial Councils and Appeals Councils are justified on the basis of Article 6, paragraph 1, e) of the

54
  GDPR, art. 6.3.

57 Article 29 Working Party, op. cit. p. 23. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 22/49

       GDPR, insofar as said processing is carried out by the competent bodies

       who is responsible for the performance of disciplinary jurisdictional functions.

        II.2.2. The establishment and management of the roll of the Order

 95. Respondent submits that the disciplinary status must appear on the Order's roll.

       To do this, the defendant must read the pharmacists' disciplinary file.

       However, Royal Decree 80 assigns the mission of establishing a list of pharmacists to the Councils

       58 and the Royal Decree of 4 July 1970 imposes on the Provincial Councils the procedure to be followed

       for registration on the roll.9 The set of provincial rolls constitutes the roll of

       the Order.

 96. The Respondent did not explain all the purposes pursued by keeping the scoreboard

       the Order. It emerges from the aforementioned provisions that registration on the provincial rolls allows

       the Provincial Councils to control access to the profession by requiring proof of

       competence on the part of pharmacists and also conditions access to the profession. Of

       more, the table of the Order, which is the sum of the provincial tables, has a function

       administrative, by listing all the pharmacists practicing or having the right to practice

       in Belgium. This list should contain the identification data of the pharmacists as well as

       than their disciplinary status.

 97. The Litigation Chamber judges that the provisions mentioned in point 96
                                                               60
       contain the essential elements of the treatment. The Litigation Chamber notes

       however, the personal data accessible on the list does not appear

       in these provisions. However, the provisions mentioned are satisfactory for

       allow the defendant to rely on Article 6.1.c of the GDPR in order to proceed with

       the establishment and management of the roll of the Order.

        II.2.3. Assessing the eligibility of candidates for election to the organs of the

            respondent

 98. As mentioned previously, AR No. 80 requires the organs of the defendant to take

       into consideration the sanctions pronounced against the candidates in their elections

       respective. Thus, for the defendant's bodies, the pharmacist who has
                                                                 61
       incurred a sanction other than that of a warning.

61AR n°80, art.8§1, art. 12, §1, 1°, art. 14, §1, 1°, par. 2. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 23/49

 99. This purpose therefore involves consulting the disciplinary status of the candidate pharmacist.

 100. Given that the purposes and means of this processing are sufficiently delimited,

       the Litigation Chamber finds that this processing is justified by a legal obligation

       meaning of article 6.1.c of the GDPR.

        II.2.4. The evaluation of applications to become an internship supervisor and the transmission
            of this assessment to universities

 101. The Respondent also mentioned consulting the disciplinary status of the

       pharmacists in order to provide advice to the universities that have received their application for a

       position of internship supervisor. Even if this opinion only takes the form of a yes or a no, 62the

       consultation and drafting of this notice are processing of personal data

       personnel requiring a basis of lawfulness of Article 6 of the GDPR. The purpose pursued -

       indicate to universities whether potential future internship supervisors have a suitable profile

       to train pharmacy students - is different from that of business management

       disciplinary.

 102. However, the Respondent does not advance any basis of legality relating to this purpose.

       more how this treatment would be compatible with the initial treatment, the management of the cases

       (point 142). The Litigation Chamber therefore finds that the defendant violated

       Article 5.1.a of the GDPR by not indicating an adequate basis of lawfulness for these

       data processing.

        II.2.5. The transmission of data to the federal database CoBRAH and to the database
            European data

 103. The defendant indicated that he had to transmit to the FPS Public Health certain data

       relating to registration on the roll and the temporary or permanent withdrawal of the right to exercise

       pharmacy profession via the federal CoBRAH database. 63

 104. The defendant must transmit information relating to the restrictions or prohibitions

       to practice the profession of pharmacist to the competent authorities who in turn inform

       the authorities of other Member States via the Internal Market Information System
           64
       (IMI).

64 Coordinated law of 10 May 2015, art. 114/1. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 24/49

 105. Given that these processing operations are sufficiently delimited by law, the Chamber

       Litigation accepts the basis of legality put forward by the defendant, i.e. an obligation

       legal under article 6.1.c of the GDPR.

        II.2.6. Maintaining a directory of case law

 106. The Respondent wrongly relied on Article 15 of Royal Decree no. 80 to justify, due to a

       legal obligation within the meaning of Article 6.1.c of the GDPR, the management of disciplinary cases

       Provincial Councils and Appeals Councils (points 81 to 95).

 107. The Litigation Chamber notes, however, that the defendant can rely on this

       provision of Royal Decree no. 80, but only for the processing of disputed data

       pursuing the purpose imposed by Article 15, and at the expense of the National Council. Indeed, this

       article requires the National Council to keep an up-to-date directory of disciplinary decisions

       pronounced by the National Councils and the Appeals Councils. The only purpose indicated by

       the legislator for such a repertoire is to develop the principles of ethics

       pharmaceutical industry and to adapt the Code of Ethics.

 108. Therefore, the keeping of such a repertoire of case law by the National Council in order to develop

       the code of ethics is based on a legal obligation within the meaning of article 6.1.c of the GDPR, namely

       article 15 of RD n°80.

        II.2.7. Recognition, exercise or defense of legal rights

       The defendant further invokes the legitimate interest as a basis of lawfulness within the meaning of Article

       6.1.f GDPR to process the complainant's disputed data. 65

            II.2.7.3. Position of parties

 109. The defendant explains that the complainant has a broader dispute with the Order,

       in particular the complaint filed with the ABC (point 12) 66and that an action for annulment

       before the Council of State was introduced by the complainant on March 2, 2020. In this

       executive, he had to refer to the decision rendered on December 22, 2016 by the Appeals Board

       and the procedure before the Council of State is still pending. For this last reason, the

       respondent emphasizes that it will continue to process the disputed data in the proceedings

       still in progress, in particular before the Council of State, but only within this framework. 67

 110. The complainant explained that the dispute between her and the defendant before the Council of State

       on the new Code of Ethics: this is a dispute relating to the normative function of the

       defendant and not to his disciplinary jurisdictional functions. Moreover, "the law organizes

       carefully the independence of the provincial council and the appeals council in relation to
                                                                     68
       order as drafter of the Code of Ethics”. The complainant adds that the

       defendant would invoke the need for indefinite storage “(until the death of the

       pharmacist concerned) ethical sanctions in order to ensure the defense of his rights
                   69
       in justice "  .

            II.2.7.4. Position of the Litigation Chamber

 111. The Litigation Chamber notes that, according to Article 6.1.f of the GDPR, the processing of

       personal data must be “necessary for the fulfillment of the legitimate interest”

       pursued by the data controller (for completeness: or by a third party).

 112. Moreover, recourse to legitimate interest is expressly subject to a criterion

       additional balancing act, which aims to protect the interest and the rights and freedoms

       fundamentals of the people concerned. In other words, the legitimate interest pursued

       by the controller must be weighed against the interests or rights and freedoms

       fundamental rights of the data subject, the objective of the balancing being to prevent

       a disproportionate impact on their rights and freedoms.

 113. The interest pursued by the data controller, even if it is legitimate and necessary, cannot

       therefore validly be invoked only if the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons

       concerned do not prevail over this interest. The Court of Justice of the European Union 70 has

       clarified that these three conditions – either the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the controller

       of processing (out of purpose)(a), the need for the processing to achieve the interest

       lawsuit pursued (necessity test) (b) and the condition that the rights and freedoms

       of the persons concerned do not prevail over the interest pursued (test of

       weighting) (c), are cumulative.

 114. In this regard, legal defense is a fundamental right enshrined in article 48 of the

       Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union. In general, the legal defense can

       actually be considered a lawful legitimate interest in the context of

                     71
       hypothetical. The Litigation Chamber finds that the interest of the defendant is real and

       present, because of the proceedings pending before the Council of State. The first requirement

       is therefore fulfilled.

 115. With regard to the second condition, the defendant must show that the treatment is

       necessary for the exercise of this defense in court. This need to deal with

       disputed data implies that the legal defense of the defendant before the Council of State

       be obstructed without the processing of the disputed data. Moreover, one of the corollaries of

       this criterion of necessity is compliance with the principle of data minimization (article 5.1.c

       GDPR).

 116. In the present case, the Litigation Division notes that the procedure initiated by the

       plaintiff before the Council of State seeks to annul certain provisions of the new Code

       of ethics. The defendant indicates that the processing of the data was necessary because

       it had to mention the decision of the Appeals Council of December 22, 2016 in its conclusions.

       Legitimate interest, as a basis for lawfulness, would only allow the National Council, as

       legal representative of the defendant, to process the disputed data in the context of

       this procedure only.

 117. With regard to the third condition, the fact remains that this data processing must

       also fit in a relevant and proportionate way with the purpose precisely

       identified with this legitimate interest, namely the legal defense with regard to the dispute before the Board

       of state. It is therefore still necessary to ensure that the requirements of the weighting test are

       encountered. The balancing test requires balancing the interests of the

       controller on the one hand and the fundamental rights and freedoms of the person

       concerned on the other hand.

 118. The Litigation Division is of the opinion that legal defense is a compelling interest

       that may justify an infringement of the right to the protection of the privacy of individuals
                   73
       concerned. Such an infringement of the plaintiff's right would be justified. Furthermore, the

       defendant is not a public authority and can therefore invoke a legitimate interest in the

       framework of the defense of his rights in court.

 119. The defendant may therefore invoke the defense of his rights in court as an interest

       legitimate within the meaning of Article 6.1.f of the GDPR to justify the processing of the data

       disputed by the National Council.

        II.2.8. Conclusions on compliance with the principle of lawfulness

 120. As noted above, the Respondent relied on a basis of legality

       inadequate to justify processing relating to the management of disciplinary cases

       (points 81 to 95). Nor did the defendant invoke a basis of lawfulness to justify the

       processing relating to opinions given to universities (points 101 and 102). Based on these

       findings, the Litigation Chamber judges that the defendant violated the principle of legality

       and transparency of Article 5.1.a of the GDPR.

    II.3. With regard to Article 5, paragraph 1, e) of the GDPR (principle of limitation of the storage
          Datas)

 121. The principle of limitation of data retention implies that the duration of

       retention of personal data must be defined and limited. She must not

       exceed what is strictly necessary with regard to the purposes for which the
                               74
       data is processed. Applying this principle also reduces the risk of

       the use of such data to the detriment of the data subject.

 122. The GDPR does not dictate the retention period of personal data but

       requires the data controller to adopt, at the very least, retention criteria
                                                                       75
       with regard to the purposes established for each treatment. In principle, the duration of

       conservation determined by the data controller must be communicated to the
                                                                                                76
       data subject at the time the personal data is obtained.

 123. The College has established the following criteria to determine the retention period of

       personal data that it is required to process in general: “The

       Controller retains Personal Data (i) for as long as

       that it is necessary or relevant for the purposes indicated above, (ii) for the period

       during which the law requires it, or (iii) as long as a legal dispute or investigations
                            77
       can take place. » .

 124. Given its preponderant role in achieving the other purposes pursued by the

       defendant, the Litigation Chamber will first consider the retention limit

       data related to a disciplinary file.

  Pages 34 to 35 of the Respondent's summary submissions Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 28/49

                A. Duration of retention of disciplinary sanctions within the framework of management
                    disciplinary cases

 125. Concretely, the Respondent decided to keep the data related to sanctions

       disciplinary until the death of pharmacists registered on the Order's roll or, at the
                                        78
       less,until the end of their career. In order to justify this retention period, the Order

       to RD n°80 which does not indicate when a sanction becomes obsolete to determine the

       Conditions of eligibility. Insofar as Royal Decree no. 80 does not explicitly provide for

       provisions concerning the retention period of data in disciplinary matters, the

       defendant therefore concluded that the provisions of the Royal Decree required de facto a
       processing for an indefinite period, thus justifying data retention

       disciplinary measures until the death or the end of the pharmacists' career.

 126. However, as examined previously, these provisions are not relevant to establish

       treatment involved in the management of disciplinary cases.

       not relevant to justify this retention period.

 127. The management of disciplinary matters, including the keeping of a disciplinary record, is

       reality based on a mission of public interest (paragraphs 89 to 94). But it would be wrong

       to interpret the silence of a legislative text as allowing data processing to be

       unlimited in time. A royal decree imposing a mission of public interest on the

       meaning of Article 6.1.e of the GDPR must be interpreted in accordance with the GDPR. So the

       controller cannot shirk its obligations, including that of

       determine the period necessary for the retention of personal data. He

       it was therefore up to the defendant to adopt a retention period adequate for the management of the

       disciplinary cases.

 128. The Litigation Division draws a distinction between two types of sanctions:

       minor sanctions (the warning and the reprimand) and major sanctions (the

       penalties greater than a reprimand). Such a distinction is also adopted by the

       respondent. 79

 129. In the present case, according to the Litigation Division, the retention of a disciplinary sanction
       in a file until retirement, regardless of its severity, is excessive and not

       GDPR compliant. Moreover, the defendant fails to explain the relevance of the

       conservation of minor sanction until the death or the end of the career of a pharmacist in order,

       for example, to take recidivism into account in a disciplinary case.

 130. With regard to the retention period applied to the complainant's sanction, the

       defendant also argues that the retention period of the data in question must be

78Page 48 of the Respondent's summary submissions
79See the 2021 Annual Report of the National Council of the Order of Pharmacists, p. 27. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 29/49

       determined from February 5, 2018, when the decision relating to the sanction with regard to the

       complainant has become effective, i.e. thirty days from the notification of the judgment of the

       Court of Cassation (point 15). A cassation appeal in disciplinary matters has

       effectively a suspensive effect on the contested decision. The treatments mentioned

       previously and involving the complainant's disciplinary status (taking into consideration

       of the sanction to assess the conditions of eligibility for elections as well as for a post of

       supervisor, to assess the risk of recurrence, etc.) would not have taken place until after the 5
       February 2018. The Complainant did not contest this point. The Litigation Chamber is therefore

       of the opinion that the start of the retention period of the disciplinary sanction imposed on

       against the plaintiff is scheduled to begin on February 5, 2018.

 131. However, this last point does not change the finding that the Respondent was applying a

       policy of retention of data related to excessive disciplinary sanctions and
       intended to apply it to the complainant's disputed data.

 132. In conclusion, the Respondent failed to adopt a reasonable retention period for the

       retention of personal data relating to disciplinary sanctions, and

       this without taking into consideration the severity of the sanctions adopted. Bedroom

       Litigation concludes that such a data retention policy
       personnel violates the principles of retention limitation (Articles 5.1.e of the GDPR).

 133. Furthermore, when this decision was adopted, the disciplinary sanction imposed on

       against the plaintiff will have been adopted more than five years after the judgment of the Court of

       cassation has become res judicata. The Litigation Chamber considers that a

       retention period exceeding five years for a minor disciplinary sanction is

       excessive.

 134. The defendant must then adopt a retention limitation policy specific to the

       needs encountered in handling disciplinary cases. The defendant must adopt

       fixed retention periods depending on the types of decisions contained in a

       disciplinary record.

                B. Duration of retention of disputed data in the context of processing

                involving disciplinary status other than the management of disciplinary cases

 135. Given that the roll of the Order must reflect the disciplinary status of a pharmacist on
       basis of his disciplinary file, the mention of a disciplinary sanction on the table of

       the Order must remain published on the list of the Order as long as the

       disciplinary sanction in the individual disciplinary file.

80 Judicial Code, art. 1121/5, 3°. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 30/49

               C. Duration of retention of a disciplinary sanction in the directory of

               jurisprudence

136. The Litigation Chamber understands from article 15 of Royal Decree no. 80 that the National Council

      mission is to establish a directory of disciplinary decisions in order to develop its

      jurisprudence and not to manage disciplinary files (points 106 and 108).

137. To comply with this legal obligation, the Litigation Division considers that a
      longer preservation of the disciplinary sanction in this directory will be necessary, but

      solely for the purpose of fulfilling this specific purpose.

   II.4. As to Article 5, paragraph 1, b) (purpose limitation principles)

138. The purpose of the processing is based on the fact that each processing of personal data

      personnel must have a specific, explicit and legitimate purpose. This purpose of

      processing must be respected, make it possible to determine the relevance of the data
      collected and must set the retention period for the data. In other words, once

      the data is collected and processed for a purpose, it is, in principle, no longer possible

      to use them for processing for a different purpose, subject to

      the application of article 6.4 of the GDPR.

139. The Litigation Chamber recalls that the purpose limitation principle implies that the

      controller must, before the start of any processing, determine the purpose of the

      processing, i.e. the purpose it intends to achieve through the use of the data

      personal. The purpose must be determined, explicit AND legitimate, so that a person

      concerned must be able to understand what data will be processed and for what purposes.

140. Further processing of personal data for purposes other than the one(s)

      for which this data was initially collected is only authorized if

      subsequent processing is compatible with the purposes for which the character data

      personal were initially collected, taking into account the link between the purposes for
      which they were collected and the purposes of the further processing envisaged, the framework

      in which the personal data was collected, of the consequences

      possibilities of the further processing envisaged for the data subject and the existence of

      appropriate safeguards. A compatible purpose is, for example, a purpose that the person

      concerned may provide or which may be considered compatible by virtue of a

      legal provision (see article 6.4. of the GDPR). Further processing is however excluded.

      when the initial processing is based in particular on national law or European law.

141. The Litigation Chamber judges that the purposes presented by the defendant are not

      sufficiently determined, i.e. specific, or explicit. Indeed, the respondent Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 31/49

       justifies the processing of the disputed data under an obligation to manage the "business

       disciplinary matters", or to keep a directory of case law. This concept is very vague.

       and would not make it possible to understand the purposes listed in point 79. In addition, the use

       of a vague notion to define the purposes of such processing also means that these

       purposes are not sufficiently explicit.

 142. The defendant also mentions subsequent processing (in particular the evaluation of

       conditions of eligibility for a position of internship supervisor) compatible with the initial purpose
                                                                                       81
       collection of disputed data (management of disciplinary cases). The defendant

       does not, however, prove compliance with the conditions for applying further processing

       compatible with the original purpose. Furthermore, the Litigation Chamber notes that the

       initial processing of disputed data is based on a mission imposed by law

       Belgian (see section II.2.1), which excludes further processing with the same data.

 143. Consequently, the Litigation Division finds a violation of the principle of limitation of

       purposes (Article 5.1.b of the GDPR) because the defendant did not sufficiently specify the purposes

       pursued with the disputed data, rendering the said purposes insufficiently

       determined and explicit.

    II.5. As to Article 5(1)(c) (data minimization principle)

 144. According to the minimization principle, the data undergoing processing must be

       “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for

       which they are processed. The relevance requirement is met if the data

       present a necessary and sufficient link with the purposes pursued. Furthermore, the

       principle of data minimization leads to personal data

       are processed only where that purpose can reasonably be achieved by
                                82
       to the treatment in question.

 145. In order to honor the principle of minimization, data controllers may have

       use of measures such as anonymization, pseudonymization of data
                                                           83
       (making the person concerned unidentifiable) or the designation of the persons

       authorized to access the data.

82 Respondent's Summary Submissions, p. 30, § 73.
83 GDPR, recital 39.
  GDPR, art. 4.5°; This is the “processing of personal data in such a way that they can no longer be
be attributed to a specific data subject without recourse to additional information, provided that
such additional information is kept separately and subject to technical and
organizational to ensure that personal data is not assigned to a natural person
identified or identifiable” Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 32/49

146. The Litigation Chamber will examine compliance with the principle of minimization with

      each purpose pursued.

              A. Management of the Complainant's Disciplinary Cases

147. As mentioned above in Section II.2.1, the keeping of a disciplinary file is necessary for

      the exercise of the quasi-judicial functions of the controllers who are the

      Provincial Councils and Appeals of the Order. When they exercise their function
      disciplinary authority assigned by AR No. 80, they must process personal data in

      disciplinary matter, in particular transmitting information allowing the assessment of the

      recidivism or to pursue disciplinary proceedings at second instance. In this case, the

      Litigation Chamber was unable to identify and trace the transfer of the

      disciplinary data between the organs of the Order and regrets that the communication and/or

      the transmission of disciplinary data to assess the recidivism or the conditions
      of eligibility within the organs of the Order have not been explained by the defendant.

148. The Litigation Chamber recalls that the principle of minimization also implies a

      restricted access to personal data. Transfers within the Order must
      therefore be necessary with regard to the powers of each body.

              B. Management of the roll of the Order

149. The Respondent also indicated that the Order’s roll “repeated” or “contained” the

      disciplinary sanctions. The defendant also ensured that such treatment respected the

      principle of minimization due to its restricted access, which in the future will be even more

      restricted because only accessible to the instructor and the rapporteur of an instance

      disciplinary. The Litigation Chamber questions this assertion: the defendant

      seems to confuse the keeping of a disciplinary file and the keeping of the roll of the Order.

150. With regard to the purpose pursued by the management of the table of the Order with the related data

      to disciplinary sanctions, it is not necessary that the full sanction be accessible via

      the consultation of the table of the Order. Only an up-to-date statement of disciplinary status is
      sufficient to pursue this purpose.

              C. Development of ethical principles based on case law

151. The defendant had also raised its obligation to maintain a directory of

      case law. The Litigation Chamber recalls the precise purpose of such a directory that

      must pursue the National Council: the development of the principles of ethics.

152. In order to comply with the principle of data minimization, the respondent must implement

      adequate measures to manage this repertoire of case law. The defendant should

      therefore proceed to the pseudonymization of the personal data included in

      a decision. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 33/49

                D. Assessment of Eligibility Conditions for Elections to Organs of the Respondent

 153. As indicated above, the organs of the defendant will have the obligation to take into account

       the disciplinary status of a candidate in their elections. The Litigation Chamber notes

       however, this processing does not require consultation of the file and the sanction

       entire discipline. A sanction contains a lot of personal data

       relating to the behavior of the accused. In order to comply with the principle of minimizing

       data, consultation of the table of the Order, where there is a mention of any

       sanction, would be sufficient.

                E. Communication of disputed data to the CoBRAH database and the

                    IMI system database

 154. With regard to processing aimed at satisfying the legal obligation of the defendant to

       transfer data to the mentioned databases, the Litigation Chamber

       notes that the reprimand is not a measure restricting or prohibiting the right

       to practice the profession of pharmacist. As such, the communication of the disputed data

       is not necessary to satisfy the legal obligation of the defendant to transfer to the

       other Member States via the IMI system of disciplinary sanctions other than

       restriction or prohibition to practice the profession of pharmacist. Bedroom

       Litigation adds that Article 114/1 of the coordinated law of 10 May 2015 does not provide for the

       communication of all the disciplinary data of a pharmacist nor the sanctions

       disciplinary measures other than the restriction or prohibition to exercise the profession of

       pharmacist.

 155. Moreover, contrary to the defendant, the Litigation Chamber finds that Article 99, 7°
                               84
       of the law of 15 May 2015 provides that the data to be transmitted by the defendant to the database
       of CoBRAH data are the data relating to the registration on the roll and the withdrawal

       temporary or permanent right to practice. Based on this provision, it appears that the

       communication of data relating to disciplinary sanctions not resulting in the

       removal from the roll or temporary or permanent withdrawal from practice is not necessary for

       fulfill the obligation established by article 99, 7° of the law of 15 May 2015.

 156. The Litigation Chamber notes, however, that the defendant invokes, for the transmission of

       data to the FPS Public Health, a protocol concluded between the defendant and the FPS Health

       public.85 This protocol would establish the communication of all sanctions

84 Coordinated law of 10 May 2015, art. 99: “The following services, organizations and persons provide the bank with
permanent federal data of health care professionals the following data:
\[…\]
7° the Order, with regard to professional addresses as well as data relating to registration on the roll and
temporary or permanent withdrawal of the right to practice but without mentioning the reasons justifying this withdrawal;
\[…\]”
85 Respondent's submissions, p. 50, §119. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 34/49

       to the FPS Public Health but was not provided by the defendant to the Chamber

       Litigation and is not freely accessible.

 157. The Litigation Division finds that this protocol does not meet the requirements of

       Article 6.1.c of the GDPR to constitute a legislative provision imposing an obligation

       legal because this protocol is not foreseeable for the persons concerned (point 84).

 158. The Litigation Chamber then concludes that the Defendant violated Article 5.1.c of the GDPR

       proceeding to the communication of the data relating to the minor sanctions which were

       not necessary for the purpose pursued

    II.6. As to Article 5(1)(d) (principle of correctness)

 159. The principle of correctness of Article 5, paragraph 1, d) of the GDPR implies that the data

       collected must “be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; all measurements

       reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that the personal data which is

       inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or

       rectified without delay”. In concrete terms, this measure of accuracy translates into

       specific guarantees which are the rectification of data, the erasure of data which

       are inaccurate and no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were

       collected 87 or the limitation of processing for a period allowing the

       controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data. 88

       An additional link to the principle of accuracy, updating data takes on a

                                          89
       much more concrete practicality. As soon as an update opportunity arises

       to the controller, the latter must enter it.

 160. The purpose of this principle is to fight against obsolete data whose use is made of it

       may be irrelevant or even harmful to the data subject.

 161. In its Nowak judgment, the Court of Justice of the European Union clarified how the

       compliance with this principle had to be assessed: "the completeness and accuracy of data to be

       personal character must be assessed with regard to the purpose for which these data were

       been collected”. This implies that the data controller adopts measures

       reasonable to ensure the accuracy of the personal data it processes.

       Compliance with this principle is assessed with more or less severity depending on the effects

       the processing of inaccurate data on the rights and interests of the data subject. This

       principle of accuracy establishes an obligation of means. 91

 162. The GDPR does not define the term “accuracy”. The Article 29 Working Party

       clarified that: “As a general rule, “accurate” means “accurate with respect to a
            92
       do " . It follows from this interpretation that the accuracy of subjective information cannot

       be challenged under the principle of accuracy of the GDPR. However, the border between the
                                                                                93
       objective and subjective character of a datum is not always clear. Therefore, in the

       within the framework of the processing of a sanction or a formal opinion issued by a disciplinary body,

       when such an opinion is based on normative texts whose legality has been contested, the

       processing of the review in question may be challenged under the principle of accuracy. 94

 163. As a reminder, the Litigation Division is not competent to determine whether a

       sanction adopted following the acts carried out by the complainant could be pronounced under

       of the new Code of Ethics of the Order of Pharmacists. Likewise, the House

       Litigation does not question the existence of the acts carried out by the complainant which

       led the French-speaking Appeals Council of the Order to find a breach of the principles

       essentials of the profession of pharmacist and to sanction it (point 11).

 164. However, the Litigation Chamber is surprised that the disciplinary bodies of the Order

       WERE NOT MORE ALARMED ABOUT A POTENTIAL UPDATE OF THE disciplinary file

       the adoption of the new Code of Ethics and/or decisions of the ABC within the framework of

       the management of disciplinary cases. The Litigation Chamber considers that the authorities

       disciplinary measures of the Order should reasonably foresee – at least after the adoption

       the new Code of Ethics – updates to disciplinary records, including

       to verify whether the retained data still reflected an accurate disciplinary status at the

       regardtothenormativeframeworkoftheprofessionofpharmacist.Inthiscase,thedefendant

       should have checked whether the sanctions imposed on the complainant on the basis of

       the old edition of the Code of Ethics would be pronounced again under this

       new Code and whether, in the light of this review, the maintenance of the disciplinary sanction

       pronounced against the Complainant still reflected an accurate disciplinary status.

 165. In addition, the Litigation Chamber once again reminds the controller

       that, as indicated above (point 160), the purpose of this principle is to fight against data

       obsolete whose use may appear irrelevant, or even

       detrimental to the person concerned. This situation appears to be the case here.

      since the disputed data, namely the sanction pronounced in 2018 against the

      complainant on the basis of the old Code, are processed to assess the recidivism and/or the

      conditions of eligibility of the complainant to the various councils of the Order.

166. The Litigation Chamber finds that the defendant has, despite the adoption of the new Code

      of ethics, continued to process the disputed data of the complainant without even

      consider a potential update of her disciplinary file since the complainant does not

      still could not stand for election to the organs of the defendant. On the other hand, the

      facts at the origin of the sanction could expose it, within the framework of new procedures
      disciplinary measures, to a more severe sanction due to a recidivism. When requesting

      deletion of the complainant in 2020, such damages should have motivated the Board

      provincial to re-examine the relevance of maintaining the disciplinary sanction of the

      complainant in his disciplinary file, for which he was responsible. In its conclusions and when

      of the hearing, the defendant could not moreover affirm that such a sanction would be

      pronounced again after the adoption of the new ROI, proving that the revaluation of the
      continuation of the disciplinary sanction in the complainant's file was not examined.

167. This evaluation on the part of the Provincial Council should not be understood as an

      second chance of an appeal against the decision to cancel the sanction. It aims to assess the

      relevance of updating the disciplinary status of a pharmacist by determining whether the
      presence of a disciplinary decision is always relevant in his disciplinary file.

      This update of the disciplinary file does not entail the cancellation of the decision

      disciplinary in the case law of counsel for the respondent.

168. In light of the foregoing, the Litigation Division finds that the defendant has not

      mobilized sufficient resources to respect the principle of accuracy. By not having

      re-examined the complainant's disciplinary file after the adoption of the

      new Code of Ethics, despite the prejudices raised by the complainant and the

      serious indications of the lack of merit in maintaining such a sanction, the defendant

      violates Article 5(1)(d) GDPR.

   II.7. Regarding the violation of Article 10 of the GDPR

169. Regarding the processing of personal data relating to convictions

      criminal offenses and offences, Article 10 of the GDPR specifies that “any complete register of

      criminal convictions can only be held under the control of public authority”. THE

      GDPR requires that such processing, when not carried out under the control of

      public authority, are governed by Union law or by the law of a Member State

      which provides appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 37/49

      170. In order to delimit the material scope of the GDPR, the Litigation Chamber verifies

             if the processing of ethical sanctions is not included in the processing of

             personal data excluded from the scope of the GDPR. Indeed, article 2,

             paragraph 2, d) of the GDPR 95 excludes from the material scope of the GDPR the processing

             of data protected by Directive 2016/680 of April 27, 2016 (hereafter the Police Directive-

                      96
             Justice) .

      171. To fall within the scope of the Police-Justice Directive, data processing

             data must meet two cumulative conditions. On the one hand, it must pursue one of the
                                                       er
             purposes mentioned in Article 1, namely the prevention and detection of offenses

             criminal proceedings, investigations and prosecutions in this area or the execution of criminal sanctions . 97

             On the other hand, the processing, whatever its purpose, must be implemented by an authority

             competent within the meaning of Article 3(7) of the Police-Justice Directive. 98

      172. Conversely, Article 10 of the law of 30 July 2018 on the protection of persons

             with regard to the processing of personal data (hereinafter “framework law”)

             specifies that the entities referred to in Article 10 of the GDPR, and therefore which are not authorities

             authorities within the meaning of Article 3.7 of the Police-Justice Directive, may be

             legal persons governed by public law, provided that the management of their own litigation

             requires it. The Litigation Chamber considers that the Order of Pharmacists corresponds to

             this definition, due to its findings in Section II.1. The defendant is therefore excluded

             of the personal scope of the Police-Justice Directive and Article 10 of the GDPR can

             potentially be applied to it.

      173. The Litigation Division must still determine whether a disciplinary sanction can be

             considered as a criminal conviction, a concept which is not defined by the GDPR.

             therefore turn to the Police-Justice Directive. According to recital 13 of the directive

             Police-Justice, the concept of criminal offense is an autonomous concept of EU law

     95
       Article 2.2.d): “\[…\]2. This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data carried out:

       European Union and in accordance with the interpretation of the Court of Justice of the European Union (here

       after "CJEU"). To assess the criminal nature of a sanction, the CJEU 100 adopted the

       same criteria as the European Court of Human Rights in its judgment Engel 101: the

       first is the legal qualification in domestic law of the sanction, the second, the nature

       of the offense itself and, the third, the degree of severity of the sanction 102.

 174. On the basis of these elements, the Litigation Division finds that a disciplinary sanction

       is not considered criminal in nature under Belgian law. This criterion is not

       however not determinative 10. The nature of the offence, as targeted by sanctions

       major, has repressive objectives against behavior deemed to be contrary

       to the essential principles of the profession, with the aim of preserving the interests

       generals of society, such as public health. The severity of a disciplinary sanction

       major, by prohibiting the exercise of a professional practice, would likewise

       high enough to meet the third condition set out in case law

       of the ECHR. The second and third conditions are therefore met for sanctions

       majors. But this is not the case for a minor sanction such as a reprimand.

       Therefore, the Litigation Chamber concludes that Article 10 of the GDPR does not apply to

       processing carried out on the data of the complainant.

    II.8. As to the request for erasure of the complainant's data and the breach of
          GDPR article 17

        II.8.1. On the violation of Article 17 in 2020

 175. First of all, with regard to the request for erasure submitted by the complainant in

       January 2020, the Litigation Chamber finds that its request was mainly

       based on the fact that, according to the complainant, the sanction adopted in 2016 was to be

       considered illegal following the decisions of the ABC and the adoption of the new Code. There

       Litigation Chamber is not competent to rule on the legality of the sanction

       in question with regard to competition law or pharmaceutical ethics

       current. It cannot therefore find a violation of Article 17.1.d committed by the

       defendant when he indicated that the sanction adopted was not illegal, and therefore the

       subsequent processing of the data of this sanction either. 104

   If the defendant was not required to erase any reference to the disputed data and stop all processing
involving this disputed data, at least he should then have examined the accuracy of the complainant's disciplinary status
(Section II.6). Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 39/49

 176. Moreover, as of 2020, the complainant also raised the lack of an adequate policy of duration

       of preservation on the part of the defendant was lifted that her sanction had been preserved for
       excessive duration. Erasure therefore had to be applied due to processing

       unlawful in accordance with Article 17.1.d of the GDPR. The Litigation Chamber cannot

       however, to follow the complainant's reasoning. A shelf life of less than

       four years for a minor disciplinary sanction does not seem a priori excessive

       Litigation Chamber. And only the absence of a retention period policy for

       disputed data is not an offense serious enough to warrant erasure

       disputed data requested. The Respondent therefore did not violate Article 17.1.d when

       his refusal to comply with the complainant's request in 2020.

        II.8.2. On the application of the right to erasure as provided for in Article 17 of the GDPR

 177. In its complaint filed in 2022, the Litigation Chamber notes that the complainant

       invokes Article 17, paragraph 1, a), d) and e) of the GDPR to request the erasure of these

       disputed data. The complainant's request seeks to erase the disputed data from the

       individualfileofthecomplainant.Basedontheconclusionsofthecomplainantandhercomplaint,

       the Litigation Chamber understands that the complainant wishes that the disciplinary sanction

       pronounced in 2016 be removed from his disciplinary file and that, consequently, the

       processing in connection with his disciplinary status (more particularly the evaluation of

       conditions of eligibility for elections to the organs of the defendant and for the status of master of

       internship) come to an end.

 178. Pursuant to Article 17(1)(d) of the GDPR, a data subject may request

       this deletion when the processing of his data is unlawful. This provision is between

       otherviolation of the principle of lawfulness of article 5.1.a of the GDPR.

       the scope of this provision and specified that unlawful processing may result from other

       situations in which the data is “inadequate, irrelevant or excessive to the

       with regard to the purposes of the processing, that they are not updated or that they are kept

       for a period exceeding that necessary, unless their retention is required for

       historical, statistical or scientific purposes. »0. This interpretation is also

       confirmed by the European Data Protection Board: “the notion of processing

       unlawful must be interpreted in the light of Article 6 of the GDPR relating to the lawfulness of the processing.

       Other principles established by the GDPR (such as the principles referred to in Article 5 or in
                                                                                   106
       other provisions of Chapter II) may favor this interpretation”.

10 EDPS, Guidelines 5/2019 on the criteria for the right to be forgotten under the GDPR in the context of search engines
p. 10 §35-36. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 40/49

179. In view of all the foregoing considerations, the Litigation Chamber finds

      that the defendant fails to demonstrate compliance with the principle of purpose limitation and

      minimization of data (see sections II.4 and II.5) or compliance with the principle

      of accuracy (see section II.6) in the context of the processing carried out with the data
      The Litigation Chamber then declared the processing of disputed data

      illicit.

180. This unlawful processing involves serious offences, including the violation of several

      essential principles of the GDPR and, therefore, the complainant is entitled to request
      the erasure of the disputed data from his disciplinary file pursuant to Article 17,

      paragraph 1, d) of the GDPR.

181. The retention of the disputed data in the complainant's disciplinary file,

      retained for more than five years at the time of the adoption of this decision, is no longer
      relevant.

182. The Litigation Chamber notes that the defendant raises two exceptions to the right

      deletion of personal data applicable to his situation: the processing is
      necessary to comply with a legal obligation (article 17.3.b of the GDPR) and to defend

      his legal rights (article 17.3.e of the GDPR).

183. Among the legal obligations invoked, the Respondent mentions the provisions of Royal Decree

      #80. As expressed by the Litigation Chamber above, article 15 of RD n°80
      indeed mentions the keeping of a register of disciplinary decisions but whose purpose is

      well-delimited: “to adapt, if necessary, the code of ethics with a view to supplementing or

      specify the provisions on the basis of this case law”. This specific treatment has not

      linkwiththemanagementofdisciplinarycasesanddoesnotrequirethemaintenanceofdata

      contentious in his disciplinary file.

184. Moreover, the mission put forward by the defendant to keep the roll of the Order cannot be

      opposed to the request for erasure: the personal data included in the

      table of the Order must reflect the disciplinary status of a pharmacist, which depends on a

      updated disciplinary record. In reality, the erasure of the disputed data from the file

      disciplinary action should lead de facto to the erasure of the mention of the sanction on the
      table of the Order. Regarding the other purposes pursued with the disputed data

      (evaluation of the conditions of eligibility for elections and for the status of internship supervisor), the

      same reasoning can be applied to them: the cancellation of a disciplinary sanction

      should logically lead to the cessation of these treatments.

185. With regard to the other legal obligations put forward by the Respondent, which consist in

      communicate personal data relating to all sanctions

      disciplinary orders, whether minor or major, to two databases Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 41/49

     under the coordinated law of 10 May 2015, as mentioned above, the

     disputed data in question are not relevant to achieve these purposes (points 155

     at 157). The defendant cannot therefore set up these two legal obligations against the request

     erasure of the complainant.

186. With regard to the exception raised to defend its interests in court (Article 17.3.e

     of the GDPR), the Litigation Chamber found that the defendant could use the data

     disputes before the Council of State.

     disputed data by the National Council, the only body empowered to represent the
     respondent. It does not require the contentious data to be kept in the file

     disciplinary proceedings against the complainant, held by the competent Provincial Council.

187. In conclusion, on the basis of the elements noted above, the Litigation Division

     orders the defendant to erase the disputed data from the disciplinary file of the
     complainant.

188. The Litigation Chamber recalls that the data controller is required,

     in accordance with Article 19 of the GDPR, by a notification obligation with regard to
     erasure of personal data. The controller notifies the

     each recipient to whom the personal data has been communicated

     erasure of personal data carried out in accordance with Article 17.1 of the

     GDPR, unless such communication proves impossible or requires efforts

     disproportionate. The controller provides the data subject with

     information on these recipients if the latter so requests.

   II.9. As for the adoption of new internal regulations and violations of
        GDPR articles 23, 35 and 36

      II.9.1. Position of parties

189. The defendant announced the adoption of the new ROI of the National Council.

     put in place mechanisms for erasure and rehabilitation. They aim to erase the sanctions

     minor and major disciplinary actions, with respective procedures. According to the defendant,

     this new ROI would make it possible to respond to the complainant's grievance.

190. The complainant points out that each organ of the Order has been granted the power to establish

     its own ROI to regulate its internal functioning: each of the provincial councils

     (art. 5 AR n°80), each of the appeal boards (art. 12 AR n°80) and the National Council (art. 14

     AR no. 80). The complainant emphasizes that the ROI of the National Council aims, like all

     the ROI of the other bodies of the order, to regulate the internal functioning of the Council

     national, and not to create rules of law enforceable against other counsel and
     pharmacists. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 42/49

 191. The Complainant is surprised that the Respondent has – to complete the current legal framework –

       amended the ROI of the National Council to comply with the provisions of the GDPR, which

       would violate Articles 23, 35 and 36 of the GDPR and Articles 6 and 13 ECHR.

 192. With regard to the status of the new ROI adopted on September 22, 2022, the complainant

       regrets that the defendant does not communicate the entirety of the new ROI but only

       excerpts, nor the complete deliberation of September 22, 2022. She adds that no one

       can say that this new ROI will actually be in effect one day.

 193. With regard to the content of the new ROI, the plaintiff is surprised that the defendant

       be set aside from the recommendations (adoption of a formal law) which he nevertheless requested from

       the share of ODA in 2020 and completed the current legal framework by modifying the ROI of

       National Council to comply with the provisions of the GDPR, which would violate Article 23 of the

       GDPR.

 194. The Respondent contests the violations alleged by the Complainant arising from the adoption of

       this king. Articles 23, 35 and 36 of the GDPR establish obligations on the part of the

       authorities of the Member States, and not on the part of the data controllers.

        II.9.2. Position of the Chamber

 195. The Litigation Chamber finds that each organ of the Order is competent to

       adopt its own ROI. Unlike the National Council 107, each Provincial Council 108

       and each Appeals Council 109establish their own ROI which they submit to the Council

       National which definitively adopts the text.

 196. In view of all the foregoing considerations, the Litigation Chamber concludes

       that the National Council is not empowered to adopt a ROI applicable to all bodies.

       The National Council could not then impose its ROI on the defendant's other bodies,
       namely the Provincial Councils and the Appeals Councils. Therefore, the Litigation Chamber

       excludes from its examination the new ROI proposed by the defendant and ultimately excludes from the analysis

       the alleged violations of Articles 23, 35 and 36 of the GDPR as well as Articles 6 and 13 of

       the ECHR alleged by the complainant.

III. Corrective measures and sanction

 197. In addition to the corrective measures aimed at bringing the processing into compliance with Articles

       5.1.a, 5.1.b, 5.1.c, 5.1.b and 5.1.e of the GDPR and to comply with the request for erasure of data

10AR no. 80, art. 14, §2.
10AR no. 80, art. 5, paragraph 1.
10AR no. 80, art. 12 and 13. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 43/49

       litigation of the plaintiff of her disciplinary file, the Litigation Chamber decides

       also to impose an administrative fine of 30,000 Euro, the purpose of which is not to

       put an end to an offense committed but also to effectively apply the rules of the

       GDPR. As is clear from recital 148, the GDPR provides that

       sanctions, including administrative fines, be imposed for any violation

       serious - therefore including the first observation of a violation -, in addition to or

       instead of the appropriate measures that are imposed. 110The Litigation Chamber demonstrates

       hereinafter that the violations of the principles of Article 5 of the GDPR committed by the defendant

       are by no means minor violations and that the fine would not constitute a

       disproportionate burden on a natural person within the meaning of recital 148 of the GDPR,

       two cases in which a fine could be waived. The fact that this is a first

       finding of a violation of the GDPR committed by the defendant does not affect the

       possibility for the Contentious Chamber to impose an administrative fine. Bedroom

       Litigation imposes an administrative fine pursuant to Article 58.2 i) of the GDPR.

       The instrument of the administrative fine is in no way intended to put an end to violations.

       To this end, the GDPR and the LCA provide for several corrective measures, including the orders cited

       in article 100, § 1, 8° and 9° of the LCA.

                                                   111
 198. Having regard to Article 83 of the GDPR, the case law of the Court of Markets as well as the criteria
                                                                                                 112
       set out in the EDPB guidelines on the calculation of administrative fines, the

       Litigation Chamber justifies the imposition of an administrative fine in a

       concrete :

            - The faulty behavior of the defendant: The observed infringement relates to the principles

                basis for the processing of data provided for in Article 5 of the GDPR. However, these principles

                have been in effect since May 25, 2018. The Respondent admitted to conducting a reflection

                on an adaptation of its data protection policy, since 2020.

                However, a reflection is not enough and should materialize in

                measures to bring the processing carried out into compliance with the

                disputed data. This reflection has not yet solved the problems

11 Recital 148 provides the following: "In order to reinforce the application of the rules of this Regulation, sanctions
including administrative fines should be imposed for any violation of this Regulation, in addition

                evident by the plaintiff and of which the defendant knew of the existence and its

                potential damage for several years. Consequently, the Chamber

                Litigation finds the defendant's behavior negligent. This finding allows him

                to consider the imposition of an administrative fine. 113

            - The seriousness of the breach: the provisions breached are at the heart of the GDPR: the

                basicprinciplesforprocessingunderArticle5GDPR.Violationsof

                aforementioned items carry the highest fines of section 83.5

                GDPR.

                In addition, the processing in question concerns the management of sanctions

                disciplinary proceedings against pharmacists.

                therefore likely to cause harm to the persons concerned. The defendant being

                mandated by law to pursue a mission of public interest at the national level, the

                processing operations in question are also national in scope and may affect

                all pharmacists practicing in Belgium given that the offenses

                stem from gaps in the overall privacy policy of the

                defendant, and not an isolated case.

            - As for the level of damage suffered, the plaintiff advances a non-pecuniary damage in

                due to damage to the reputation as well as a possible refusal of approval by the master

                internship and non-eligibility with the various organs of the defendant. These

                damage can reach all the persons concerned having been

                sanctioned by the defendant. The Litigation Chamber does not have the

                exact number of pharmacists who have been or are subject to a sanction

                disciplinary.15The Chamber therefore finds that a moderate number of persons

                concerned may potentially suffer moderate damage due to

                the observed violation.

            - The duration of the violation: the Litigation Chamber finds that the defendant has a

                inadequate data protection policy, in particular with regard to

113
  See in particular the opinion of Advocate General N. EMILIOU in case C-683/21, §77-78, for whom the finding of a
Due diligence is a minimum requirement for imposing an administrative fine.
  See in particular recital 75 of the GDPR.
11As an example, according to the 2021 Annual Report of the National Council of the Order of Pharmacists, 44 sanctions were
pronounced in 2021, figures up on previous years. The Litigation Division deduces from this that it
there is a moderate number of pharmacists for whom the defendant maintains a disciplinary file. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 45/49

         the application of the principles of legality, minimization of data, limitation of

         purposes and limitation of storage, since at least February 5, 2018,

         the adoption of the sanction against the complainant. The violation of these principles

         for which the Litigation Chamber is competent therefore lasts since May 25
         2018.

         Regarding the violation of the principle of accuracy, the Litigation Chamber

         notes that the Respondent adopted a new Code of Ethics in January 2020,

         Code that should be more liberal towards new advertising methods. There

         complainant also challenged the merits of her sanction on January 27, 2020 by

         sending a formal notice to the defendant. In 2023, the defendant had no
         verified the relevance of maintaining the complainant's sanction with regard to the

         new provisions of the Code of Ethics. The Litigation Chamber

         therefore considers that this part of the infringement began in January 2020.

     - On the absence of mitigating circumstances: the Litigation Chamber that the

         initiatives mentioned by the defendant are not in order to mitigate the fine

         imposed. Indeed, the GDPR was adopted in 2016, and came into force in 2018.
         Compliance with the principles of the GDPR should have been achieved from the entry into force

         of the GDPR. Moreover, in the light of the findings of this decision, these efforts

         were not sufficient to resolve the subject matter of the complaint.

     - The necessary deterrent effect in order to prevent new violations: The

         defendant considers that its data protection policy is not illegal.

         In order to justify possible breaches of the GDPR, the defendant argued that he

         was not his responsibility to solve this problem, but the legislator. Such a
         position demonstrates a misunderstanding of the importance of legislation in

         with regard to the protection of personal data, in particular

         basic principles of data processing. The Litigation Chamber considers

         therefore, recourse to an administrative fine is necessary.

All of the elements set out above justify an effective, proportionate sanction

and dissuasive, as referred to in Article 83 of the GDPR, taking into account the assessment criteria

that it contains. The Litigation Chamber draws attention to the fact that the other criteria

of Article 83.2 of the GDPR are not, in this case, such as to lead to another fine Decision on the substance 77/2023 – 46/49

      administrative than that defined by the Litigation Chamber within the framework of this

      decision.

199. In response to the Sanction Form, Respondent submits in summary that the

      Litigation Chamber is based on elements contrary to those appearing in the documents

      of the file and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the legislative framework, the role and the competences

      of the order. The Respondent advances arguments on the merits to illustrate its point.

      folder. The Litigation Division considers that the reasoning for this decision

      responds to the arguments put forward by the defendant in its reaction.

200. With regard to the criteria taken into consideration for imposing a fine

      administrative, the respondent argues that:

         i. The Litigation Division indicated that the duration of the offense should be calculated at

             from December 22, 2016 but that it was competent only from May 25

             2018. However, according to the defendant, the date of December 22, 2016 should not be taken

             taken into account, given that the sanction only became effective from the 5

             February 2018. Moreover, even if the Litigation Division is only competent to
             from May 25, 2018, it does not take into account the measures taken by

             Order to address data retention issues.

        ii. The Litigation Chamber indicated that the defendant should have taken

             initiatives as soon as the GDPR comes into force, and that the solution to the problems of
             data protection could not be the sole responsibility of the legislator. According to him, the

             defendant assumed its responsibilities, going so far as to adopt countermeasures

             legem, in order to bring the processing carried out into compliance with the principles of

             GDPR.

       iii. The defendant disputes the characterization of his behavior as “negligent”.

             Contrary to what the Litigation Chamber wrote in its form, the

             the defendant's reflection began as early as 2020 (and not in 2023), as demonstrated

             documents in the file. The defendant would be the only order, among the professions

             regulated, to have taken concrete measures to remedy this problem.

       iv. The defendant argues that the moral damage suffered by the plaintiff is not

             sufficiently proven, and is based only on the statements of the complainant.

        v. The defendant indicates that he is not responsible for the negative opinions given by the

             universities due to the existence of a disciplinary sanction, or the non-

             eligibility of candidates to the organs of the Order. According to the defendant, it is the

             legislator who has provided for ineligibility without time limit.

       vi. The Litigation Chamber is not competent to decide whether a sanction

             discipline is warranted or not. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 47/49

        vii. The Litigation Chamber takes no mitigating circumstances in

               consideration.

                                                                                     er
       viii. The sanction imposed on the complainant was canceled on March 1, 2023,

               following the adoption of the new ROI of the National Council.

 201. The elements of the sanction form taken into consideration by the Litigation Division

       are discussed below.

 202. The Litigation Division took into consideration the Respondent's remarks regarding the

       effective date of the disciplinary sanction, and therefore of the start date of the processing
       carried out with the disputed data: the sanction became effective on February 5, 2018. This

       change of date, however, has no influence on the relevant duration of the infringement of the

       GDPR, which started on May 25, 2018.

 203. As to the arguments put forward in point 200, i. and ii., the measurements shown were not

       still adopted when the debates were closed. No tangible proof of adoption

       of such measures was brought before the Litigation Chamber.

       even reflections began in 2020, the GDPR requires compliance of all processing,
       etc from May 25, 2018. A reflection that did not resolve the subject of the complaint before the closure

       of the debates cannot exonerate a data controller of his breaches of the GDPR.

 204. As for the moral damage suffered, recital 75 of the GDPR indicates that the supervisory authorities

       must take into account not only the damage suffered, but also the risks

       damages. The data processed by the defendant relating to disciplinary sanctions,

       an absence of retention limits for such data is highly likely to
       stigmatize the persons concerned whose disciplinary, minor or

       major, kept in a disciplinary file and processed without time limit.

 205. The respondent is the controller of the processing mentioned in this decision. He

       It is therefore up to the defendant to apply the principles of the GDPR to such processing.

       The argument in point 200, v., is irrelevant.

 206. If the Litigation Chamber is not competent to rule on the legality or

       advisability of adopting a disciplinary sanction, it is however appropriate for

       issues relating to the processing of data contained in these sanctions.

 207. As for the assessment of mitigating circumstances, the steps taken by the
       defendant did not prove to be effective in the eyes of the Litigation Chamber. However, the

       EDPS guidelines indicate that the measures undertaken by a respondent must

       be examined with regard to their effectiveness and their time frame for adoption.

       find that the measures put forward by the defendant had not yet been adopted

11EDPB, Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of administrative fines under the GDPR, version 2.0, p. 27, § 76. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 48/49

       at the close of the debate. Moreover, the defendant's reflection spanned from 2020 to

       2023. The Litigation Chamber does not claim only a compliance of processing

       made by the defendant is an easy task and does not dispute the difficulties

       by the health crisis. But the GDPR having entered into force as of May 25, 2018, this

       The process should therefore have started much earlier.

 208. As to the cancellation of the disciplinary sanction on March 1, 2023, the Respondent does not

       no concrete evidence. Moreover, if this deletion took place, it was carried out after the

       closure of the debates.

 209. On the basis of all the elements set out above, the Litigation Chamber decides

       to adjust the proposed penalty from 50,000 euros to 30,000 euros. The shortcomings

       identified justify an effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanction referred to in Article 83

       AVG, taking into account the evaluation criteria set out therein. The Litigation Chamber

       considers that a lower fine would not meet the criteria required by Article 83,

       paragraph 1 of the AVG, according to which the administrative fine must not only be
       proportionate, but also effective and dissuasive.

IV. Publication of the decision

 210. Given the importance of transparency regarding the decision-making process of the Chamber

       Litigation, this decision is published on the website of the Protection Authority

       data. However, it is not necessary for this purpose that the identification data of

       the complainant are communicated directly.

 211. In this case, the Litigation Chamber decides to publish this decision with

       identification of the defendant's data.

 212. The Litigation Chamber specifies that this publication with identification pursues

       several goals.

 213. It pursues, as far as the defendant is concerned, an objective of general interest. The identification of

       the defendant is moreover necessary for the proper understanding of the decision and therefore,

       the materialization of the objective of transparency pursued by the policy of publication of

       decisions of the Litigation Chamber. Decision on the merits 77/2023 – 49/49

        FOR THESE REASONS,

        the Litigation Chamber of the Data Protection Authority decides, after deliberation:

        - Pursuant to Article 100, §1, 13° and 101 of the LCA, to impose an administrative fine

            €30,000 to the defendant for violations of articles 5.1.a, 5.1.b, 5.1.c, 5.1.d,

            5.1.e GDPR.

                                           er
        - Pursuant to Article 100, §1, 6° of the LCA, to comply with the request of the

            complainant, i.e. to erase the data relating to his disciplinary sanction from his

            disciplinary record.

        - Pursuant to Article 100, §1, 9° of the LCA, to order compliance of the

            treatment, more particularly with articles 5.1.a, 5.1.b, 5.1.c, 5.1.d and 5.1.e of the

            GDPR.

   In accordance with Article 108, § 1 of the LCA, an appeal against this decision may be lodged,

   within thirty days of its notification, to the Court of Markets (court

   d'appel de Bruxelles), with the Data Protection Authority as defendant.

   Such an appeal may be introduced by means of an interlocutory request which must contain the

   information listed in article 1034ter of the Judicial Code. The interlocutory motion must be

   filed with the registry of the Court of Markets in accordance with article 1034quinquies of the C. jud. , or 118

   via the e-Deposit information system of the Ministry of Justice (article 32ter of the C. jud.).
