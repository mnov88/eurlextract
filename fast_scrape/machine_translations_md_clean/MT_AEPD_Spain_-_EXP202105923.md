## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject filed a complaint with the Spanish DPA after a personal data breach. The controller, an electric and gas company, sent the data subject's contract to the wrong address.

The data subject had previously held a contract with the controller at their address, which was cancelled when the data subject moved. The data subject had indicated their new address when they registered again with the controller, but the controller had activated its online invoice service without updating the data subject's contact information, causing the new contract to be sent to the old address.

When the contract was mistakenly delivered to the old address, the data subject had a restraining order on the current resident, who now had access to, among other things, the data subject's current address.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller had violated [Article 5(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1d "Article 5 GDPR") ("accuracy") for not keeping the data subject's contact information up to date. It considered the controller's negligence and routine handling of personal data as aggravating factors. For this infraction the DPA assessed a fine of €100,000. The controller ultimately paid €60,000, taking advantage of two reductions available for admitting responsibility and paying the fine before the resolution of the sanctioning procedure.

## Comment

The Spanish DPA found that the controller violated [Article 5(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1d "Article 5 GDPR") ("accuracy"), but a more natural conclusion would be to find a violation of [Article 32(1)(d) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1d "Article 32 GDPR") ("adoption of adequate technical and procedural measures"). This somewhat strained interpretation may be explained by the fact that the LOPDGDD categorizes [Article 5 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") violations as "very serious" and [Article 32(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR#1 "Article 32 GDPR") violations as merely "serious." The two categories differ both in statute of limitations and maximum fine.

On January 31, 2022, this Agency received a response letter
indicating that the claimant has contracted gas and electricity supplies in

the address located at \*\*\*ADDRESS.1 from November 16, 2021.

Previously, the claimant had been the holder of an electricity supply contract

located at \*\*\*ADDRESS.2, until your contract was terminated due to a change
ownership.

It has been verified in the systems of the Regulated Marketer that at the moment
of the registration of the contract on November 16, 2021, although it was indicated by the claimant

as correspondence address the \*\*\*ADDRESS.1 the service of
On-Line Invoice but the main address associated with the claimant was not updated,
reason the copy of your contract was sent to the previous primary address

associated with the customer's NIF, which was the address of \*\*\*ADDRESS.2.

By virtue of the powers that article 58.2 of the RGPD recognizes to each authority of

control, and according to the provisions of articles 47 and 48 of the LOPDGDD, the Director
of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection is competent to initiate and to

resolve this procedure.

                                             II

Article 5 of the RGPD establishes what are the principles in the treatment of data.

riorly in a manner incompatible with said purposes; according to article 89,

paragraph 1, the further processing of personal data for archiving purposes in-
public interest, scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes are not considered

will be incompatible with the original purposes ("purpose limitation");

accidental loss, destruction or damage, through the application of technical measures or

in section 1 and able to demonstrate it (“proactive responsibility”).”

                                            III

In the present case, the complaining party denounces the defendant because he has

sent the supply contract of your new address, to the address of your old
address, where the person on whom you have a restraining order lives.

The respondent party has argued that the claimant had been the holder of a contract of
light of the supply located at \*\*\*ADDRESS.2, until the cancellation of its
contract for change of ownership, registering again on November 16,

2021, contracting gas and electricity supplies at the address located on the
\*\*\*ADDRESS 1.

Previously, the claimant had been the holder of an electricity supply contract
located at \*\*\*ADDRESS.2, until your contract was terminated due to a change

ownership.

Although the new address was indicated at the time of discharge, the service of

On-Line Invoice without updating the address, which is why the copy of your contract is
shipped to \*\*\*ADDRESS.2.

Therefore, in accordance with the available evidence, and without prejudice
of what results from the instruction of this sanctioning procedure,
considers that we are facing an illicit treatment of personal data, by referring to a

incorrect address the supply contract of the claimant where their
personal data, among others, your address, incurring in an infringement of art. 5.1.d)

for not having updated the data indicated in the basis of law II.
