## English Summary

### Facts

The Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP) received many complaints regarding the fact that the controller sent information by e-mail to 295 persons revealing the e-mail addresses of the other recipients. The data subjects were candidates who provided their personal data for recruitment on the operator's website or through online applications.

### Dispute

Does sending information by e-mail to a group of persons and revealing the e-mail addresses of the other recipients lead to a violation of the GDPR?

### Holding

The ANSPDCP found that the controller did not implement sufficient security measures to ensure the confidentiality of the personal data of data subjects, which led to the disclosure of e-mail addresses belonging to a number of 295 persons to other recipients, breaching the provisions of Article 32 GDPR.

In addition to the applied fine of €1000, the Romanian DPA applied the corrective measure of implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures in the case of remote transmission of personal data, including regular training of the persons that process personal data under the controller's authority (employees or collaborators).
