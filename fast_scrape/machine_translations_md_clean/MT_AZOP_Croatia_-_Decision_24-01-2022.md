his compensation for the month of September was not paid through a current account, but through the company of Croatia

The request is not founded.
First of all, it should be noted that from May 25, 2018, in the Republic of
In Croatia, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament is directly and bindingly applied
of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of individuals in connection with the processing of personal data and on
free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General
data protection regulation) SL EU L119.
The General Data Protection Regulation in Article 4, Paragraph 1, Point 1 stipulates that they are personal
data all data relating to an individual whose identity has been determined or can be determined, a
an individual whose identity can be established is a person who can be identified directly or
indirectly, especially with the help of identifiers such as name, identification number, information about

physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that individual.
Pursuant to Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation, personal data must be: (a)

transparency"); (b) collected for specific, express and lawful purposes and may not be further
process in a way that is inconsistent with those purposes ("purpose limitation"); (c) appropriate,
relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ("reduction

Furthermore, in accordance with Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation, processing is only lawful
if and to the extent that at least one of the following is met: (a) the subject has given consent
to process your personal data for one or more specific purposes; (b) processing is necessary for

processing manager; (f) the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party
parties, except when those interests are stronger than the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the respondents who
require the protection of personal data.
3
Also, it should be emphasized that the right to protection of personal data is not absolute
the law itself must be considered in relation to its function in society and it should be harmonized
with other fundamental rights in accordance with the principle of proportionality.
As a separate law, we cite the Postal Services Act ("Narodne novine", number:
144/12, 153/13, 78/15 and 110/19) regulating postal services, prescribe the conditions for
performance of these services and for the provision and financing of universal service, govern the rights,
obligations and responsibilities of providers and users of postal services, conditions of access to the postal network,
issuance of postage stamps of the Republic of Croatia and surcharge stamps is determined by jobs
Croatian regulatory agencies for network activities in the part related to regulatory
tasks in the field of postal services, performing inspection supervision in the field of postal services
services, and regulate other issues related to the performance of postal services.
Also, Article 44 of the aforementioned Act stipulates that the provider of postal services
obliged to adopt general conditions for the performance of postal services in domestic and/or international
traffic. Based on the quoted article, Hrvatska pošta d.d. is on July 1, 2021.
passed the General Terms and Conditions for the provision of universal services, which regulate the manner and conditions
performance of the universal service provided by HP-Hrvatska pošta d.d., delivery deadlines,
method and conditions of payment for postal services, method of marking payment for postal services on
to the postal shipment, the responsibility of HP d.d. and compensation for damage and the submission and settlement procedure
complaints of users of postal services.
In this connection, it is necessary to point out article 47 of the aforementioned General Terms and Conditions, in which
stipulated that the sender, receiver or other authorized person proves his identity, between
among other things, with an identity card, and the type and number of the identification document that established the identity
it is entered in the corresponding place of the postal document.
Furthermore, by looking at the Answer, CLASS: .., CODE: .. from ... which is the Center for
social care y as a processing manager delivered to the applicant, it is clear that the manager
processing, informed the applicant that he had sent the amounts through the mail.
As a result of the above, on the basis of the submitted evidence in this administrative matter it was established
that the Center for Social Welfare, as the processing manager, did not provide personal data for use
of the applicant for this to an unauthorized recipient/third party and in this sense the request
rejects the applicant as unfounded.
Namely, in the specific case there was a legitimate purpose and legal basis from Article 5 i
6. General regulations on data protection for forwarding certain personal data to a third party
(company Hrvatska pošta d.d.), and all so that the applicant could realize the right that belongs to him
in accordance with the adopted Decision, CLASS: .., NUMBER: .. from the year ... or the right to
guaranteed minimum compensation.

In this regard, it should be emphasized that in the conducted procedure it was not determined that
personal data of the applicant were forwarded by the processing manager to the company
Hrvatska pošta d.d. to a greater extent than is necessary for the specific purpose of guaranteed delivery
minimum fees and that the applicant has not proven in any way that the information about him is as
to the user of the Center for Social Care, disclosed to a third party without authorization.
Likewise, in the specific case it was established that the company Hrvatska pošta d.d.
during the delivery/payment of the guaranteed minimum compensation, it complied with the prescribed procedures and
in accordance with Article 47 of the General Terms and Conditions for the provision of universal services, identity verification
of the applicant as the payee.
Additionally, and further to the applicant's statement that he is guaranteed a minimum compensation
should have been paid to the current account as determined by the Decision, CLASS: .., NUMBER: ...
from ... year, we point out that the method of delivery/payment of the user's minimum fee is not in
jurisdiction of this Agency, but it is the decision of the processing manager himself in accordance with the special
regulation.
In conclusion, and taking into account all the circumstances of the specific case, there is no evidence that
indicate that the applicant's personal data were processed contrary to the General provisions
regulations on data protection.
Due to the aforementioned circumstances, it was decided as in the Proclamation of the Decision.
