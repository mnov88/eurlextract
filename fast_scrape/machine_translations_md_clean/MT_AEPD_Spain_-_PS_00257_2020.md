C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

a "power" different from the sanctioning power, the exercise of which is conditional on the
concurrence of the special circumstances described in the precept. At

By means of a statement of claim, the respondent has stated that he has already designated

graduation of the sanctions whose existence has been accredited, the Director of
