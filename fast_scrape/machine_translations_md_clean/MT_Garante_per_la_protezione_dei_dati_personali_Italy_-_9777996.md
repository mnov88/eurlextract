## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is the Municipality of Taranto. The processor is Amiu s.p.a., a public entity facilitating waste collection services for the Municipality of Taranto. A report from the DPA revealed that the processor installed video surveillance systems to detect and sanction illegal activities. Some of these videos showing identifiable persons were posted on its Facebook page. On 14 January 2020, the processor contacted the supplier of the video surveillance system (ITS) without notifying the controller.

### Holding

The DPA held that the processor violated [Article 28(2)](/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR "Article 28 GDPR"), as it did not notify the controller prior to contacting ITS about the video surveillance system.

The DPA noted that public entities can lawfully process personal data for the fulfilment of a legal obligation or for the performance of a task in the public interest pursuant to [Article 6(1)(c) and (e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"). The DPA followed that even if the processing is lawful, it must also be in accordance with the principles laid down in [Article 5](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR"). Since no indication of a legal basis for the placement of the videos on its Facebook page was found ([Article 6](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR") and Article 2-ter of Code Privacy), the DPA held that the processor violated the principles of "lawfulness, correctness and transparency" ([Article 5(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR")).

The DPA further held that the controller violated the principle of "purpose limitation" ([Article 5(1)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR")). The DPA found no indication of any compatibility with the purposes for which the personal data was previously collected (detection of illegal activities) for further processing (publication on Facebook).

Lastly, the DPA held that the processor violated [Article 28](/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR "Article 28 GDPR"), as it found that the processor had not appointed a data protection officer pursuant to [Article 37](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR "Article 37 GDPR").

The DPA fined Amiu s.p.a. €200.000 for the aforementioned violations.
