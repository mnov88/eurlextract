## English Summary

### Facts

Independent of any instructions from the XVIII District Office of the Government of Budapest, the municipality of Pestszentlőrinc‑Pestszentimre carried out a survey on the COVID-19 vaccination status of its local citizens. The controller aimed to produce anonymised statistics on the basis of which municipal decisions in relation to the pandemic could be made.

To send the questionnaire, the controller lawfully obtained the names and addresses of all adult residents in the area. The questionnaire, on the other hand, was deemed non-compliant. It did not make clear that data subjects’ name, telephone number and email address were optional. It did not specify that the name, telephone number and email address, when provided, would be processed alongisde the health data. Lastly, consent to processing was only available upon completion of the questionnaire, when the data had already been submitted.

After a public interest notification, the case was referred to the Hungarian DPA under Hungarian national law.

### Holding

The controller carried out the processing based on its own decision making it an independent controller under [Article 4(7) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#7 "Article 4 GDPR").

The controller failed to provide adequate information on the data processing to the data subjects in the questionnaire under [Articles 12(1)](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") and [14 GDPR.](/index.php?title=Article_14_GDPR "Article 14 GDPR")

Processing the personal data that was optionally added to the questionnaire resulted in excessive processing under [Article 5(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1b "Article 5 GDPR") and [5(1)(c) GDPR.](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") It also breached [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR") and [13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") as the data subject was not informed of this additional processing. The COVID-19 status of the residents was considered health data under [Article 9(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR#1 "Article 9 GDPR"). Mixing the processing of the optionally provided data with the health data muddied consent breaching [Article 7(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR#2 "Article 7 GDPR"). This meant that the controller no longer had a legal basis under [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR").

The DPA fined the controller 3 million Hungarian Forint, equivalent to around €7,800, under [Article 58(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2 "Article 58 GDPR").

for the purpose of benefit. No circumstances to the contrary arose during the procedure.

1.3. The main characteristics of data management related to the contact data received in the Questionnaire

1. On the Questionnaire, the Customer requested to provide the following contact details, but no
indicated that entering them is optional: name, phone number, email address. They are not in substance
were separable from the requested health data, it was not clear from the Questionnaire that this

- according to his information, the consent is managed based on the consent of the data subject
until its withdrawal for the purpose of "keeping in touch for the purpose of exchanging information" on this
with the data subjects providing data on the Questionnaire. 13

3. Based on the above, those who send Questionnaires by post or online, approx. Of the 5,000 people involved,
the name, telephone number, and email address of the data subjects providing contact information is currently still managed by it

Customer.

1.4. Data management related to the health data received in the questionnaire is the main one
characteristics

1. The Questionnaire included the following questions:
   (i) have you registered for vaccination,

   (ii) whether you have received the vaccine,

   (iii) whether you have been infected with coronavirus.

2. Pursuant to point 15 of Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation, health data is one
personal data concerning the physical or mental health of a natural person,
including health services provided to natural persons

also data that carries information about the health status of the natural person. Above
The Customer did not dispute the nature of answers to questions as health data during the procedure,
Article 9 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation was also referred to in this regard
also to point a). The broad interpretation of health data is confirmed, among others, by the European
Also the practice of the Court of Justice of the Union, according to which any reference to physical or mental health

did not arise during the procedure.

4. The purpose of handling health data was to produce anonymous statistics based on which
the Client wanted to make local government decisions with the covid-19 pandemic

III.2. Obligation to provide appropriate information

1. According to Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Customer is considered independent
the obligation of the data controller to take appropriate measures to ensure that
concerning the processing of personal data for those concerned, referred to in Articles 13 and 14

all information and 15-22. and each information according to Article 34 is concise,
in a transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible form, in a clear and understandable way
provide it formulated.

2. The system of appropriate information in the general data protection regulation serves to
so that the data subject can be aware of which personal data, which data controller and

for which purpose, how you will handle it. This is essential to be in a position to
to be able to meaningfully exercise its stakeholder rights.

1 see e.g. Decision No. C-101/01 (Lindqvist case): https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-101/01 14

3. Data management based on point e) of Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
due to the more vulnerable stakeholders, there is an increased expectation of information
performing public authority tasks, performing data management regardless of the consent of the data subject
against a data controller compared to a data controller that is the data subject's right of disposal
manages the personal data of the data subject. In the absence of adequate information, by definition

the data subject is not in a position to properly exercise his data subject rights.

4. Data management based on point a) of Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
based on Article 4, point 11 of the General Data Protection Regulation, not only the data management
beginning, but before obtaining consent, the data controller is obliged to
to provide information on the basis of which informed consent can be given.

5. In relation to the legal basis of data subject consent according to the General Data Protection Regulation
it is important to emphasize that it does not mean that the data controller is subject to other legal obligations
applies as a general authority regardless of conditions that at any time and
can handle any personal data without limits for any reason. For data management
stakeholder consent can only be valid if it is for specific purpose(s) - per purpose
can be specified separately - they ask, and before that they provide adequate information, which in such a situation
brings the data subject to be able to make an appropriate decision about giving consent, and

complies with all other validity conditions prescribed in the General Data Protection Regulation
requirement. Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation specifically
imposes a performance obligation on the data controller, i.e. the data subject needs such help
provide, so that all stakeholders can exercise their rights in an informed manner.

6. As explained above, the obligation to provide information is not a mere "paperwork"
is an obligation in the General Data Protection Regulation. Everything contained in the preamble,

all the articles of the General Data Protection Regulation require the data manager to achieve results
in determining its obligations, not just a specified minimum effort
confirmation by the data controller. The purpose of the information is to put you in such a situation
data subject to be in the appropriate decision-making position by exercising the data subject's rights
in connection.

7. The Customer has no merit in the Questionnaire, and is easily accessible by those concerned

did not provide information about data management to the affected parties, nor did it provide any other information
purposes, neither the legal bases nor the durations were revealed, and the source of the name and address data
didn't mark it either. It was also not revealed that filling in contact information is optional. It is paper based
in the case of data management, the provision of substantive information in its entirety online is usually not
it is transparent and easily accessible to the stakeholders who receive the Questionnaire by post and return it
for. Thus, this alone prevented the valid consent of those concerned
be able to give.

8. It is available to the Customer with a link indicated in writing on the Questionnaire and also when filling it out online
general data management available at www.bp18.hu/kozerdeku/adatvedelmi-informáciok
information at the time of sending out the Questionnaires and when they are returned by those concerned - which is
According to customer statements, there was a short period around March 2021 - none
it did not contain information about any of the examined data management. At the request of the Authority
information sent at the web address www.bp18.hu/kozerdeku/adatvedelmi-informáciok only

After May 7, 2021, the above I.2. Based on the web archive according to point 3, it
prior to this, there was no information regarding any data management. Bar
subsequent information does not play a role in the determination of illegality, the Authority
notes that, subsequently exchanged by the Customer on the Website, 2.4. and 2.5. with points
supplementary information also did not include the source of the data, as well as basic information
about specific goals. The file name, content, and version number of this on the Website are not 15

corresponds to the version available at the time of the examined data management. However, due to the above, 2.4. and
2.5. in case of earlier availability of new information supplemented with points, its content, as well as
It would not have been made suitable due to the lack of easy accessibility together with the questionnaire
the information, at least its basic information, should have been provided on the Questionnaire. The
the purpose and nature of data management was not so complex that it would have significantly hindered this.

III.3. Evaluation of the data management required to send the Questionnaire

1. Based on Article 6 (1) point e) of the General Data Protection Regulation a
necessary for the performance of public authority and other public duties defined by law
has the right to contact district residents.

2. However, it is also necessary in the case of the application of the above legal basis - and any other legal basis
to comply with all provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, in this case
with particular regard to the obligation under Article 14 of the General Data Protection Regulation. This
based on the Customer at the latest when sending the Questionnaire, together with at least
to provide information to those concerned about where it comes from
their name and address data, and this data is no longer managed. The Customer is responsible for this

– the above III.2. taking into account what was explained in point - he did not fulfill it, and this also played a big role
played a role in the fact that several stakeholders made public interest announcements due to the Questionnaire.

3. None of the exceptions according to Article 14 (5) of the General Data Protection Regulation apply
in the present case, it does not constitute a disproportionate expectation and would not make it impossible
the purpose of data management is to provide at least adequate concise information on or alongside the Questionnaire
about the most basic conditions of data management.

4. This data management is closely related to the Questionnaire, however, the legal basis and the data are different
due to its external source, different provisions are required compared to the other examined data management
comply, for this reason the Authority classified it separately. Article 6 of a self-governing municipality
The legal basis for this, based on point e) of paragraph (1), is smaller compared to other violations
an omission does not make it invalid, however, regardless of this, the Customer would have been obliged to e
to act in accordance with the general data protection regulation.

5. Based on the above, the Customer violated Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
and the obligation to provide information according to Article 14.

III.4. Evaluation of the handling of contact personal data

1. The principles in Article 5 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation do not only apply to
they serve to make theoretical findings with the implementation of data management
in connection. These principles cover specific obligations that can be held accountable
in specific cases on the data controllers.

2. According to Article 5 (1) point b) of the General Data Protection Regulation, personal data
should only be collected for specific, clear and legitimate purposes and should not be processed

in a manner inconsistent with these purposes; in accordance with Article 89 (1).
is not considered incompatible with the original purpose for the purpose of archiving in the public interest,
further data management for scientific and historical research purposes or for statistical purposes.
In this case, it is not a law, but a unique statistic based on the Customer's decision,
thus the precise and clear definition of the data management purpose and from other purposes
it would have been the Customer's responsibility to ensure its distinctiveness. 16

3. The Customer fulfills the above obligation - the revealed facts and the above III.2. also explained in point
attention - neither the Authority nor the stakeholders did not fulfill it. Contact details
the goal of its treatment should not be an elusive goal such as general contact.
It is necessary to indicate in some way what the contact is specifically like

means sending information of the kind, and in the case of "exchange of information", what kind of information
are expected from the stakeholders. Mixing this data management with health data, they are one
collection on the page raises the prohibition according to Article 7 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
also his grievance, according to which the request for consent is clearly separated from other matters
must be presented in a distinguishable manner, especially when their mixing is severe
would raise data protection issues.

4. According to Article 5 (1) point c) of the General Data Protection Regulation, data management
they must be appropriate and relevant for its purposes and must be necessary
be limited. The optional nature of the contact as a whole, as well as the contact information
in the event of your choice, the right to freely choose individual communication channels (that is enough
to enter a type of contact data) should have been clearly and clearly stated
from the information provided to those concerned, however, the Customer has no merit in this regard
did not provide information to those concerned. The Customer did not substantiate with anything that

for which reason it is not enough if the individual maintains contact only on one communication channel
with stakeholders, even if several contact channels are specified, why would you need more than one
for several types of access to contact a data subject and for which purposes this is necessary
without time limit, even after the end of the epidemic.

5. Based on Article 4, point 11 of the General Data Protection Regulation, the consent of the data subject is one
suitable for data processing without a specific purpose and unreasonably determined in time

is not valid in the absence of information, and the above circumstances are also affected individually
would lead to invalidity of consent. In the absence of valid consent, it is
data management does not comply with Article 6 (1) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation
according to the legal basis, and no other legal basis exists.

6. Based on the above, contact personal data collected by the Customer on the Questionnaire
violated Article 5(1)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation

according to the purpose-related principle, data saving according to Article 5 (1) point c).
principle, to provide prior information according to Article 12, paragraph (1) and Article 13
obligation, as well as in the absence of valid consent due to the above, the general
Article 6 (1) and Article 7 (2) of the data protection regulation, and this point
violations of the law still exist.

III.5. Evaluation of the management of health data

1. The above III.2. and III.4. written in points, as explained below, are properly governing
also for handling the health data collected on the Questionnaire, with the fact that in this case there was one
legitimate purpose, the preparation of epidemiological statistics, and local government measures based on this
and these data are no longer processed, they have been deleted. Because of this
above III.4. from the points explained, there was no violation of the principle of purpose-boundness

with regard to health data.

2. In the case of handling health data, Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
Article 9 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation is required in addition to one of the legal bases of
according to paragraph - exceptions to the general treatment ban according to Article 9 (1)
one of them must exist. In this case, the consent is defined in Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation

According to Article 9(2)(a), the additional condition that the person concerned must be met
has given his express consent to the said personal data for one or more specific purposes
for treatment. Given that adequate information was not provided, as well as a
necessity and suitability to achieve the goal does not exist for the reasons explained below, therefore
this condition could not be met either.

3. Data saving according to Article 5 (1) point c) of the General Data Protection Regulation
one of the conditions for its practical implementation is that data management is necessary and proportionate
to achieve a given data management goal, and is also suitable for it.

4. Regarding the issue of suitability, the Authority emphasizes that the Client did not support it with anything
below, exactly how he knew from a non-representative sample of less than 10%

to draw accurate conclusions about the district residents as a whole. In addition, the statistics are one
it was made at a moment in time in the middle of the vaccination campaign, its results are significantly different from week to week
could have changed, and would not have given an accurate picture of the epidemic situation within a short period of time even if the
would have been accurate when it was made. The Study referenced by the Customer is only a summary
was available, but the Study does not support that it was collected on the Questionnaire
to get accurate results by creating anonymous statistics from data, but that is small
in the case of a large, non-representative sample, additional external – non-anonymous – information

it would have been necessary to use it in relation to those who filled out the Questionnaire. Such
the Customer did not indicate the acquisition of additional personal data, and this is data protection
it would not have reduced the level of infringement, but rather increased it. Suitability in itself
however, it would not significantly affect the legality of data management.

5. It is a question independent of the suitability of the generated statistics that the treated health
data were classified as personal data because they potentially – even on a paper basis –

they could be linked to the persons concerned. Apart from the Customer's statement, there is no organizational
or other guarantee that could have technically excluded this connection. Is that
questions were not asked separately from the contact identification data,
unnecessarily linked them to a specific stakeholder. To a specific natural person
with a non-binding random document identification number, it can be ensured that there is only one person concerned
send back a reply which has no connection between document identification numbers and recipients
would not be necessary at any step of data management (it is sufficient to ensure that

that a document identification number is processed only once, which is indicated in the list), and
the statistics could also have been prepared from anonymous data of a special category of personal
without processing data. For this reason, this data management in no way complied with the
necessity and proportionality criterion, which is the above III.2. as explained in point
is an additional condition for the legality of data processing independent of the consent of the data subject.

6. Based on the above, the Customer manages the health data collected with the Questionnaire

violated Article 5(1)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation
the principle of data saving, the advance notice according to Article 12 (1) and Article 13
obligation to provide information, as well as valid due to the above
due to the lack of consent, Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, Article 7
(2) and (1) of Article 9.

ARC. Legal consequences

1. The Authority complies with Article 58 (2) point i) and Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
may impose a data protection fine instead of or in addition to the other measures.
There was no doubt that in case of violation of the general data protection regulation, the general
on the basis of Article 58 (2) point d) of the Data Protection Regulation, to oblige the data controller 18

Due to the time-consuming nature of obtaining consents and the nature of data management as a public task, a
The authority set a deadline of 60 days instead of the usual 30 days. In addition to the

among the aspects listed in Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation

2. On the question of whether the imposition of a data protection fine is justified, the Authority

to paragraph a), Infotv. 75/A. 83 of the General Data Protection Regulation.
(2) and Article 58 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, which
based on this, the conviction in itself would not be a proportionate and dissuasive sanction, therefore

a fine must be imposed. In this case, the protection of personal data - which is the Authority
task - it is not available based on the totality of the fine imposition circumstances detailed below
without imposing a data protection fine. The imposition of fines is both special and general
it also serves prevention, for which purpose the decision should also be published on the website of the Authority
costs

3. The Authority did not consider mitigating factors regarding the necessity of the fine

as a circumstance, the economic situation referred to by the Customer, since it is – indirectly, the annual
through income - it only affects the amount of the fine if it is necessary, no
whether it is necessary to impose the fine, the necessity of the violation and its circumstances
determined in accordance with Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation. E
respect, the Authority took into account when determining the amount of the fine that the Customer
Its net sales revenue in 2021 was HUF 19,598,010,463. The Authority is the Customer's bad material
situation and the public interest related to the performance of his public duties, the amount of the fine

taken into account as a mitigating circumstance when determining

4. The Authority also did not consider as a mitigating circumstance the fact that the Customer a
With the authority during the procedure - not for damage mitigation, only for response in the procedure
purpose - cooperated, as this is all based on Article 31 of the General Data Protection Regulation
obligation of data controller and data processor, its absence could be taken into account
as an aggravating circumstance. (General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point f)

5. When determining the amount of the data protection fine, the Authority as a mitigating circumstance
took into account the following:

   (i) Compiling statistics to aid epidemic management is not illegal in itself
   During the operation of the municipality, only its access was not planned for data protection
   with awareness and inappropriately trying to reach it, as well as on contact details
   external data were deleted within a short time, and with regard to contact personal data
   based on all the circumstances of the case, the violation can be remedied according to the relevant part.

   (General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point a)
   (ii) The infringement is negligent, it was not aimed at harming the affected parties or

   for illegal profit-making (General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point b)

   (iii) Most of the personal data was deleted within a short period of time, thus remedying the violation
   the Customer has already partially done so – without affecting the occurrence of the previous infringement,
   and before that, it was used for statistical purposes separately from other data management
   health data (General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point c)

   (iv) The Authority has not previously established a data protection violation against the Client.
   (General Data Protection Regulation Article 83 (2) point e) 19

6. When determining the amount of the data protection fine, the Authority as an aggravating circumstance
took into account the following:
