## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant, a former patient at several hopsitals in Madrid, requested the deletion of certain medical practicioner's notes from her medical history. One of the hospitals to which she made this request responded that they could not comply with the complainant's requst in full because certain information would be necessary for any future physician "to have a true and updated knowledge of your health status, and to provide you with adequate health care".

### Dispute

Does Article 17 GDPR entitle a former patient to have all their medical history erased by a controller such as a hospital?

### Holding

The AEPD decided that Article 17 GDPR did not give the complainant the right to have all her medical data held by the hospital(s) erased, due to the remaining data being necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health.

File No.: TD/00034/2020
RESOLUTION Nº: R/00161/2020
Having regard to the complaint lodged on 22 September 2019 with this Agency by Ms. A.A.A.,  (from now on the complaining party), against CONSEJERIA DESANIDAD DE LA COMUNIDAD DE MADRID - SERVICIO MADRILEÑO DE SALUD, with NIF S7800001E (from now on the complaining party), for not having duly attended to its right of suppression. Once the procedural actions provided for in Title VIII of the Organic Law 3/2018 of 5 December on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD) have been carried out, the following have been found

FIRST FACTS: 
The claimant, dated August 5, 2019, requests the right to withdraw from some notes with which she disagrees made by the physicians who have provided her with medical assistance.                     Subsequently, from October 18, 2019 to February 13, 2020, she has submitted sixteen other documents to different hospitals, in some cases requesting rectification in health centers and hospitals, and in other cases, making complaints because she has not been asked for consent to have MIR students present.   There are also complaints about disagreement with the diagnosis or treatment of the specialists in the different hospitals.                  
The complainant provides numerous responses from hospitals such as SanCarlos in Madrid, the head of patient care in the Madrid Healthcare and Primary Care Management, the Delegate Committee for Data Protection of the Madrid Healthcare Service, and the Doce de Octubre University Hospital, of which the latter provides up to four responses from different departments. There are several responses from various bodies.            
In the complaints presented to this Agency, the complainant speaks of medical treatment, diagnoses and the Law on Patient Autonomy.SECOND: In accordance with the functions set out in Regulation (EU)2016/679, of 27 April 2016, General Data Protection (RGPD), particularly those that respond to the principles of transparency and proactive responsibility on the part of the person responsible for the treatment, the complainant has been required to inform this Agency of the actions that have been taken to deal with the complaint. In summary, the following allegations were made:
-The representative/data protection representative of the respondent states in his submissions of 13 March 2020 that once the request for suppression was received, the necessary internal procedures were carried out to contact the doctors, who are responsible for assessing the interest in care of those requested to be suppressed.   Once this task had been carried out in a unified manner, according to the claimant, the response was sent to the claimant on 17 October 2019. The dispatch to which they refer is documented.                           According to the respondent: "...decided to partially admit said request for suppression, proceeding to eliminate 3 of the 4 annotations made by 3 health professionals from the San Fermin Health Center. The Responsible of the treatment has taken this decision, taking into account the established by the article 17 of the RGPD, as well as the established by the article 15 of the Law 41/2002, of November 14, basic regulator of the autonomy of the patient and of the rights and obligations in the matter of information and clinical documentation, as well as, and the indicated in the Royal Decree 1093/2010, of September 3, by which the minimum set of data of the clinical reports in the National Health System is approved.

FIFTH: Article 17 of the RGPD states that: "1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain without undue delay from the data controller the deletion of personal data relating to him, who shall be obliged to delete the personal data without undue delay in any of the following circumstances a) personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; b) the data subject withdraws the consent on the basis of which the processing was carried out in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a) and this is not based on any other legal basis; c) the data subject opposes the processing according to Article 21(1) and no other legitimate grounds prevail for the processing, or the data subject opposes the processing according to Article 21(2); (e) personal data must be deleted in order to comply with a legal obligation under Union law or the law of the Member States applicable to the controller Where he has made personal data public and is required, pursuant to paragraph 1, to delete such data, the controller shall, taking into account the technology available and the cost of implementation, take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform the controllers who are processing the personal data of the request of the data subject to delete any link to such personal data or any copy or replica thereof. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply where processing is necessary: (b) in order to comply with a legal obligation requiring the processing of data imposed by Union law or by law of the Member States on the controller or in order to carry out a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of public authority vested in the controller; (c) for reasons of public interest in the field of public health in accordance with Article 9(2)(h) and (i) and (3); (d) for archiving purposes in the public interest, for the purposes of scientific or historical research or for statistical purposes, in accordance with Article 89(1), insofar as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to make impossible or seriously impede the achievement of the objectives of such processing; or (e) for the purpose of lodging, exercising or defending complaints. ”
SIXTH: In the case analyzed here, the claimant exercised his right of withdrawal and in accordance with the rules mentioned above, his request obtained the legally required response. We have studied the extensive documentation submitted by the claimant and only those issues raised by the complainant that are included within the object of claims on data protection will be analyzed and assessed. The claimant, through the Data Protection Agency, requests the deletion of certain medical practitioner's notes from her medical history and, as we have verified from the documentation provided by herself, she has been attended to. There is a reply from the Madrid Primary Care Management dated 17 October 2019, in which they inform you: "...we inform you that we have proceeded to process the deletion of the following data (...) As for the note dated 14/06/2016, made by a professional of the San Fermin Health Centre, it is not possible for us to attend to your right of deletion considering it not in accordance with the law, given that taking into account what is indicated in the aforementioned article 15 of the Law on Patient Autonomy, under the criterion it has been determined that such information is necessary for any physician to have a true and updated knowledge of your health status, and to provide you with adequate health care... "There is a request identical to the above and also answered on 11 December 2019. Therefore, we can consider that the majority of the requested suppression has been attended to and the part that has not been suppressed has been rejected, with good reason. Despite having received this response in October 2019, the complainant insisted on sending all types of documentation, treatment, diagnosis, etc.   It is clear that there is a discrepancy between the parties that is related to medical issues. And, which they will have to resolve in other forums, it does not affect the fact that the complainant requested the deletion of four paragraphs and the claimant once he had the information answered saying that he was deleting three of them and the fourth one denied it with reasons.   Therefore, we consider that the right has been fulfilled. 

In view of the aforementioned precepts and others of general application, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:
FIRST: TO REMOVE the claim formulated by Ms. A.A.A. against the HEALTH COUNCIL OF THE COMMUNITY OF MADRID - MADRID HEALTH SERVICE. 
SECOND: TO NOTIFY this resolution to Ms. A.A.A. and to the CONSEJERIA DESANIDAD DE LA COMUNIDAD DE MADRID - SERVICIO MADRILEÑO DE SALUD. 
In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this resolution will be made public once it has been notified to the interested parties.  48.6 of the LOPDGDD, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 123 of the LPACAP, the interested parties may, optionally, lodge an appeal for reversal with the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency within a period of one month starting from the day following notification of this resolution or the address of the contentious-administrative proceedings before the Contentious-Administrative Chamber of the National Court, in accordance with the provisions of Article 25 and paragraph 5 of the fourth additional provision of Law 29/1998 of 13 July, regulating the Contentious-Administrative Jurisdiction, within a period of two months from the day following notification of this act, as provided for in Article 46. 1 of the aforementioned Law.
