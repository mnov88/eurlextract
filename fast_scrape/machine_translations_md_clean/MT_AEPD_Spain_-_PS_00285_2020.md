## English Summary

### Facts

A claimant filed a complaint with the DPA to report several infringements of the GDPR coming from the Asturian Handball Federation. They alleged that the federation did not have a DPO, that they did not obtain valid consent from the children above 14 or their parents, nor they verified the legitimacy of such consent, that they were publishing photos of minors without such consent, that they did not inform about the data processed according to Article 13 GDPR and that they made reference in their privacy policy to the old Spanish Data Protection Act.

The Asturian Handball Federation alleged that they had two websites, one with domain .es and another with .com, and that they were coexisting due to an administrative error. The old one was not up-to-date, what is what caused the reference to the old Data Protection Act and the fact that they had non-updated forms for gathering data.

Additionally, the federation appointed a DPO during the course of these proceedings and amended their privacy policy to include everything that Article 13 requires.

### Dispute

Did the Asturian Handball Federation incur in any violation of GDPR given these facts?

### Holding

The AEPD held that the federation had violated Article 37 GDPR for not having appointed a DPO. They also held that the federation had violated Article 13 for not having provided in their privacy policy the mandatory information provided by the GDPR.

For both these violations, the AEPD issued a warning.

However, the AEPD held that there was no violation regarding consent due to the fact that it is a public federation that, according to the law, processes the data that the sports clubs collect, and that therefore the obligations regarding consent lay on such clubs.
