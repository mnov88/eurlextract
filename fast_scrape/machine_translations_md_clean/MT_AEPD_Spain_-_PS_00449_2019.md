## English Summary

### Facts

On 23/05/2019 it was published in the newspaper "Segre" that the Medical Association of Lleida is investigating a possible breach of ethics for the use of medical data to send advertising of a political party in an election campaign.

On 26/06/2019 the claimant filed a complaint denouncing that he had received advertising from the political party "PARTIT DELS SOCIALISTES DE CATALUNYA (PSC-PSOE)" addressed to a ceased relative and who was a patient of a doctor related to the denounced political party.

The political party states that the doctor, who had run in the municipal elections and was a counselor at the Town Hall, brought boxes with sealed envelopes. The administrative staff of the Political Party proceeded to send them.

### Dispute

Is it a violation of Article 5 GDPR to send election advertising to citizens using data arising from the doctor-patient relationship?

### Holding

The AEPD considered that the conduct of the defendant's employees - the sending of electoral publicity using personal data from a patient-doctor relationship - infringes Article 5.1 b) of the RGPD, an infringement punishable under Article 83 (4) (a) GDPR.

Assessing the circumstances that modify the responsibility contemplated in Article 83 (2) GDPR, in this case, the aggravating circumstances for being a non-intentional but significant negligent action (Article 83 (2) (b) GDPR), and for being data known as basic personal identifiers such as name and address (83 (2) (g) GDPR).

The AEPD set the amount of the administrative fine at €5000 (five thousand euros).
