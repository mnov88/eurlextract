## English Summary

### Facts

The complainant, who plays a role in public life in Belgium, applied to Google Belgium for the deletion of search results linked to his name on the search engine (so-called "de-listed"). Part of the pages that he wanted to be de-listed suggested his political preferences, which he refutes. A second part relates to a complaint of harassment against the complainant, which was dismissed several years before. Google has decided not to de-list any of the pages in question.

### Dispute

\- Competence of the Belgian DPA over Google BE

\- Who is the controller, the main establishment (Google Ire, or Google LLC ?) , and what is the role of Google BE ? Can The DPA impose a fine against Google BE ?

\- Delisting of the two categories of results (see here under)

### Holding

I. On the Competence

In that case, Google argued that the complaint cannot be founded because it is brought against Google Belgium,whereas the controller is not Google's Belgian subsidiary, but Google LLC, based in California.

The Litigation Chamber did not follow this argument. In its view, the activities of Google Belgium and Google LLC are inextricably linked and, consequently, the Belgian subsidiary may be held liable.

This is crucial to ensure full and effective protection of the GDPR, as it is difficult for a DPA in Europe to exercise effective control and impose sanctions on a company located in the United States.

On the other hand, the Litigation Chamber followed Google's argument that its principal place of business in Europe (Google Ireland) is not responsible for the delisting.

Regarding the pages concerning the political preferences of the complainant, the Litigation Chamber of the BE DPA considered that, given the complainant's role in public life, the maintenance of such listing was necessary in the public interest and thus ruled in Google's favour.

II. On the delisting

Regarding the pages concerning the complaint against the complainant, the BE DPA believes that the request for delisting is well-founded and that Google demonstrated a serious breach by refusing it. Since the facts have not been established, are old, and are likely to have serious repercussions for the complainant, the rights and interests of the person concerned must prevail. According to the Litigation Chamber, Google was particularly negligent, given that the company had evidence that the facts were irrelevant and outdated. The DPA imposed a fine of 600 000 euros on Google.

Decision on the merits 37/2020 - 2/49
1. Facts and retroacts of the proceedings
1. The complainant, a Belgian resident, lodged a complaint signed on 12 August 2019, against Google Belgium
SA, a company incorporated under Belgian law, concerning the deregistration of a series of contents numbered from 1 to
12 and whose twelve URLs are listed in the complaint. This complaint was declared admissible on 14 August.
2019 by the Front Line Service.
2. 2. In essence, the complainant complains that "Google" has refused to grant his requests to
dereferencing sent via online forms requesting deletion of information
personal. Whereas, according to him, a search based on his first and last name results in
the referencing of content that is detrimental to its honour and reputation in the written press
Belgian.
3. More specifically, two categories of content in Google's indexes are criticized. This is on the one hand,
content that portrays the complainant "as a person labeled party Y" (a political party
Belgium), whereas this would involve processing special categories of personal data in the Belgian
meaning of Article 9 of the GDR not covered by the exceptions provided for in the GDR and, moreover, inaccurate.
4. And, secondly, content referring to information suggesting that the
complainant was the subject of a harassment complaint, which would have been found not to be substantiated.

factors such as the apparent relevance of the latter, Google has decided not to block it".

6. As for the second category of content, content nos. 9 to 12, Google is also said to have decided
not to block them5.
7. On 30 August 2019, the Litigation Chamber decided under article 95, paragraph 1, 1° and
section 98 of the CAA that the complaint could be dealt with on the merits. The parties were invited to

invitation had indeed reached Google LLC but that nothing was manually signed in California.
due to the outbreak caused by the Covid-19 Coronavirus. However, the Litigation Chamber wrote
by paper mail to Google LLC, and Google LLC responds in the same manner as the one by which
she's in demand. The e-mail address of the Litigation Chamber was, however, known to Google, which
could have used it to answer him. Because of the above-mentioned epidemic, the hearing was held in
distance, by videoconference.
9. Minutes of the hearing were provided to the parties on May 11, 2020. On May 13, the complainant
informed the Litigation Chamber that he has no observations. On 22 May 2020, Google Belgium SA
communicated its remarks on the minutes of the hearing of 6 May in the form of a track

10. On 4 June 2020, the Litigation Chamber sent an e-mail to Google Belgium SA, informing it that it had received the following information

put forward its defences to the proposed amount of the fine. The Litigation Chamber
received such means by e-mail on June 24.
11. On 9 June 2020, the Litigation Chamber introduced an informal notification of mutual assistance
voluntary under Article 61 of the RGPD in the system of cooperation between supervisory authorities,
asking for a reaction within two weeks. The Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian authorities..,
Slovak, German (Hamburg, as well as Baden-Württemberg), French, Italian and Irish
have submitted comments within this time limit.
2. Structure of the decision
12. By the present decision, the Litigation Chamber addresses the issue of dereferral of the case from the
by an Internet search engine, of content following searches relating to an
natural person. This question is the subject of case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The European Court of Justice (hereinafter CJEU) is well known, in particular in the Google Spain6 judgments,
Google/CNIL7 and GC et al./CNIL8. The Belgian Court of Cassation also ruled on the
dereferencing and the right to oblivion.9
13. For the Litigation Chamber, this is an opportunity to adopt a decision of principle and to decide
a few fundamental aspects related to dereferral, based on the case law of the
CJEU on the matter, or on other points relating to the determination of its competence to act
(in particular the ECJ ruling Wirtschaftsakademie10 ).
14. Firstly, the Litigation Chamber analyses the competence of the Authority for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (the
Data (ODA) in the case submitted under Article 55(1) and Recital 122 of the GDR.
To this end, the Litigation Chamber demonstrates that the case in question does not need to be submitted under Article 55(1) and Recital 122 of the GDR.
The "single window" mechanism of the DP Regs (Section 3 infra).

15. Second, having concluded that such jurisdiction exists, the Chamber turns to the concept of "jurisdiction".
as controller within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the DPMR, with the purpose of deciding whether
Google Belgium SA - the defendant in this case - can be held responsible for the
processing and/or having its activities inextricably linked with those of the controller
(Google LLC), and whether the ODA can exercise its jurisdiction over Google Belgium (Section 4 infra).
16. Thirdly, it determines the territorial application of the de-referral, with a view to the judgment of the Court of First Instance in the
Google/CNIL. (Section 5 infra).
17. Fourthly, the Litigation Chamber is considering applications for de-listing from the List of Counsel.
submitted by the complainant, which relate to the political labelling and harassment complaint
(Section 6, infra).
18. Fifthly, the Litigation Chamber considers that certain facts that have been brought before it by the
knowledge in the present case constitute a breach of the GDGR (Section 7 infra), and
details the related corrective actions.
3. Jurisdiction of ODA and the inapplicability of the "single window" mechanism
19. The competence of ODA is defined and framed in Chapter VI of the DPR.
20. In accordance with Article 55(1) of the DPR, a supervisory authority is competent to exercise its powers of control.
tasks and powers in the territory of the Member State to which it belongs. Recital 122 provides
that this should cover - inter alia - the processing of data in the context of activities carried out by
an establishment of the controller in that territory, as well as a processing operation affecting
persons concerned in that territory.
21. Territorial jurisdiction is a major principle of the RGPD, which should be read in conjunction with Article 3, 1,
on the territorial application of the GDGR. The territorial competence of the authority is a rule of the

controller not established on the territory of the European Union, as provided for, and
in accordance with the conditions of Article 3(2) of the GDMP. This is confirmed by the European Committee for
Data Protection (EDPB)12.
23. On the other hand, an exception to this founding principle of the DPMR is provided for in Article 56(1), read in conjunction with Article 56(2), read in conjunction with Article 56(3), read in conjunction with Article 56(4), read in conjunction with Article 56(5), read in conjunction with Article 56(6), read in conjunction with Article 56(7), read in conjunction with Article 56(8).

The exception is limited to situations of "cross-border processing", as defined in Article 4(23) of the DPMR,
i.e. a processing operation that is carried out in several establishments in the European Union
of a controller, or a processing operation that significantly affects data subjects
in several Member States (or is likely to affect them). In the present case, the complaint
is brought against Google Belgium SA, a subsidiary of Google LLC (USA). That Belgian establishment,
a corporate law subsidiary, of Google is the defendant. However, Google Belgium SA defends
the position that only Google LLC (USA) is the data controller.
24. The Litigation Chamber points out that even if Google LLC and not Google Belgium is the data controller, the
SA would be the data controller (hypothesis not followed by the Litigation Chamber13 ), ODA
would be competent to deal with the complaint of a Belgian national. The processing of data at
personal nature in the context of an establishment of an external data controller

roles and responsibilities of the Google group of companies, including the existence of an
possible principal place of business (within the meaning of Article 4 (16) of the GDPR)14.
26. Google Belgium SA acknowledged that Google Ireland Ltd was Google's principal place of business within the meaning of Article 4(16) of the GDR.14 26.
Article 4(16) of the RPMR, i.e. the location of the central administration of Google LLC in the Union
European. Although the role of Google Ireland is referred to in these proceedings, the Chamber
Litigation considers that the data processing in the case at hand is not carried out in the
the activities of Google Ireland Ltd.
27. First, at the hearing, Google Belgium SA argued that the reference to Google
Ireland Ltd. was out of contention. According to Google Belgium SA, this reference was not included in the
conclusions of the complainant and the debate is between Google Belgium SA and Google LLC: it is therefore not
There's no way Google Ireland Ltd. is going to get involved. In the present proceedings, the parties have not

on the role of Google Ireland Ltd. However, the Litigation Chamber reiterates in this respect that it has
expressly invited the parties to comment on the existence of a possible principal place of business of the company.
Google on the territory of the European Economic Area15 , and that it did appear at the hearing
that Google Ireland Ltd. was that establishment.
28. Second, in the context of the pleadings, Google Belgium SA insisted that the activity of Google Ireland Ltd was that establishment.
Google Ireland Ltd as data controller concerns a different hypothesis from the one that
concerns the indexing activities of the search engine. It concerns the processing of data
users", i.e., for example, when a person uses the search engine, their
search history can be processed by Google for the adaptation of search results. It
This is a processing operation for which Google Ireland Ltd is the data controller. For the
Google search engine and the treatments corresponding to the three steps necessary for the
operation of the search engine (exploration, indexing, selection of search results)
searches) at issue in the proceedings, Google Ireland Ltd is not the data controller.
This division of roles is explained by the fact that Google Ireland Ltd acts as an interface with
users residing in the EU but not involved in the development and management of the
searches, exclusive competence of Google LLC.

14 The invitation letter contained the following passage: "Without prejudice to any arguments they may wish to develop
before the Litigation Chamber, all parties are invited, in the context of the present case, to express their views on the
activities, roles and responsibilities of Google LLC, Google Belgium SA, and the existence of a possible principal place of business
(within the meaning of Article 4(16) of the GDR) of Google in the territory of the European Economic Area".
15 Supra, note 14.
Decision on the merits 37/2020 - 8/49
29. Thus, the evidence raised by Google Belgium SA at the hearing, according to which Google Ireland
Ltd would be responsible for the processing of users' data when, for example, their
search histories are processed to adapt the results communicated to them by the
search engine are potentially contradictory with the position defended by Google.
Belgium SA that Google LLC is the sole data controller in the context of the
operation of the search engine and its three phases, i.e. the exploration phase, the search phase and the search phase.
indexing and result selection.
30. 30. Therefore, the data processing (i.e. dereferencing) in the present case is only
not carried out as part of the activities of Google Ireland Ltd. In conclusion in the present case,
the Irish supervisory authority may not be the lead supervisory authority within the meaning of Articles 56 and 60
of the DP Regs, implying that the "single window" mechanism does not apply and that the
competence of the Litigation Chamber can be assessed in the light of the principle of territoriality.
enshrined in section 55(1) of the GDR.
31. This conclusion is corroborated by the position taken by Google LLC in a letter to the authority of the
Irish control dated 23 June 2020, in which Google LLC explains that it will no longer oppose
that a local supervisory authority has local jurisdiction over the treatment of
personal data that comes within the sphere of responsibility of Google LLC.16 This statement
of position does not mean that the system of cooperation cannot be applied17.
4. As to the controller
32. The purpose of this section is to establish whether Google Belgium SA - the defendant in this case - can
be considered as the data controller for the processing of
complainant, i.e. the entity that determines the purposes and means, and/or whose activities are
inseparably linked with those of the data controller, in this case Google LLC.
33. At this stage, the Litigation Chamber makes a preliminary observation on the territorial application
of the RGPD. Section 3 of the EDR covers two distinct scenarios with respect to its applicability
territorial :
a. the first scenario involves the application of the DPMR to the processing of data at
personal nature carried out as part of the activities of a

16 This letter is added to the file by the Litigation Chamber.
17 Infra, No. 89.
Decision on the merits 37/2020 - 9/49
data controller within the Union, whether or not the processing operation takes place
in the Union (Article 3.1);18
b. the second scenario concerns the application of the PGRD to processing of personal data in the Union (Article 3.1);18 b. the second scenario concerns the application of the PGRD to processing of personal data in the Union (Article 3.2);19 b. the third scenario concerns the application of the PGRD to processing of personal data in the Union (Article 3.3)
(b) the staff of the Commission shall be entitled to receive information on the
controller not established in the Union (Article 3(2)).
34. The Chambre Contentieux notes that these two paragraphs must be aligned. Failing that, on the basis of
on a purely textual reading, a certain legal vacuum might exist in the circumstances or
a processing operation is carried out by a data controller which has an establishment in
the Union, and that the processing is not carried out in the framework of the activities of that institution but
by a controller established in a third country.
35. In the present case, it is not disputable that the data subject (the complainant) is on
the territory of the European Union (in this case, Belgium). Google LLC having various
establishments in the Union, Article 3.2 shall not apply. Therefore, the territorial application is
triggered by section 3.1 of the EIHWR. Indeed, if none of these provisions are considered to be
applicable, the effective and comprehensive protection of the data subjects as required by the Court of Justice
of the European Union19 would not be guaranteed.
36. Furthermore, the Litigation Chamber points out that, since the GDR and the case law of the
Court of Justice provide for effective and comprehensive protection of persons, the application of Article
3.1 is to be regarded as the main rule, for the sole reason that effective control becomes
complex if the processing of personal data is carried out by an establishment in
outside the European Union. It is, for example, not obvious for a supervisory authority to
to exercise powers of investigation or to take corrective action in respect of such
establishment referred to in Article 58 of the GDR in respect of an establishment outside the Union.
4.1 Position of the controller and Google Spain's judgment
37. In essence, Google Belgium SA considers the complaint against it to be unfounded since the only

The decision would imply that Google LLC would be the sole data controller. This position does not convince

41. In addition, Google Belgium SA argued at the hearing that the processing is covered by Article 3(1) ,
of the DPMR, which provides that 'This Regulation shall apply to the processing of personal data relating to the
personnel carried out in the framework of the activities of a controller's establishment, or
of a processor on the territory of the Union, whether or not the processing takes place within the Union", such that the processing is carried out on the territory of the Union.

43. The Litigation Chamber certainly acknowledges that this jurisprudence concerning the application of the principle
of the "indissociable link" was drawn up in the context of the application of Directive 95/46/EC whose
territoriality provisions are distinct from those of the DPGR. Nevertheless, in Google v. CNIL
the Court confirms its willingness to extend its case-law in this area to the GDR. The Chamber

Brussels and its activities are aimed at the inhabitants of Belgium, and that the activities of Google Belgium SA and
of Google LLC are inseparable within the meaning of the Google Spain judgment referred to above.
45. Google Belgium SA does not dispute that. It is also not disputed that Google Belgium SA exercises
actually and effectively activities in Belgium.
46. During the hearing, Google Belgium SA was questioned about the different roles of the establishments of
Google it. The Commission confirmed that it has no role with respect to the data processed in the context of the three
phases of the operation of the Google search engine, i.e. its exploration phase, its
indexing and its phase of selecting results according to the request made by the user.
Google LLC would be solely responsible for the processing in this context. In substance at the hearing,
Google Belgium SA explained that it was a subsidiary of Google established in Belgium which was likely to
lead to the application of European and Belgian law. Google Belgium SA considers that Google LLC is
therefore submitted to the GDMP pursuant to Article 3(1) of the GDMP, and therefore should not designate an
representing in accordance with Articles 3, 2 and 27 of the GDR.
47. 47. Google Belgium SA explained that it only offers consultancy services related to the
marketing the services of other Google entities on the Belgian market. Requests from
referrals are directly and exclusively processed by Google LLC from the
online forms introduced by the data subjects without any involvement of Google
Belgium SA. The latter explains that when it is approached by data subjects
requesting dereferral, it systematically refers them to the online forms that
are sent (and addressed) to Google LLC. On the basis of the country and language chosen by the individual

for Google LLC that was accessed. The analyses carried out by this Google employee are on
the basis of information from public sources and his good knowledge of the specificities of the company
to the country concerned of which he or she is a national.
48. The Litigation Chamber concludes that, on the basis of the foregoing, that in applying the
In the present case, the Google Spain judgment, the DPMR is indeed applicable to Google LLC pursuant to Article 3(1)(a) of the EC Treaty,
of the RGPD and that the subsidiary Google Belgium SA does indeed constitute an establishment capable of causing

context of the Google/CNIL26 judgment in which the Court stressed that it is irrelevant whether the processing has been
place or not in the Union.
49. Although it is true that Google Belgium SA does not determine the purposes or means of the processing
in the strict sense - these are determined by Google LLC -, Google Belgium SA is a subsidiary of Google
LLC and it follows from the position of Google Belgium SA that the activities of this subsidiary trigger
the application of section 3.1 of the DP Regs. In other words, the processing in question is carried out in the
framework of the activities of Google's establishment in Belgium. Another interpretation would imply
the application of Article 3.2 of the RGDP, as well as Google's obligation to appoint a representative
in the European Union under Article 27 of the GDR. This is not provided for by Google and is not
not necessary either in view of the role of Google Belgium SA.
50. The Litigation Chamber emphasises that this interpretation is corroborated by the Google Spain judgment,
although the situation is not identical. In that judgment, the Court held - under the
Directive 95/46 - "that processing of personal data is carried out in the framework of the
activities of an establishment of the controller in the territory of a Member State, on the territory of a Member State, at
meaning of that provision, where the operator of a search engine creates in a Member State
a branch or subsidiary for the promotion and sale of advertising space
proposed by that engine and whose activity is aimed at the inhabitants of that Member State. »27
51. Moreover, its activities are inextricably linked to those of Google LLC, its subsidiary in Belgium,
in light of the role it plays and describes, may be treated in the same manner as a
data processing carried out within the framework of the operation of the Google search engine and
the management of delisting requests in Belgium.
52. In short, the Litigation Chamber considers that Google Belgium SA should be treated in the same way as Google Belgium SA.

54. Account should now be taken of the judgment of the Court of Justice in the Wirtschaftsakademie case, delivered on 5 July 2001.
June 201828 concerning Directive 95/46, which gives a supervisory authority the power to
to exercise its powers with respect to an establishment of the controller even if that
institution is not a joint controller. Further developments
will demonstrate that it is appropriate to extend the application of this case law to the case at hand29.
55. In the Wirtschaftsakademie case, the Court held that the German supervisory authority was a "supervisory authority".
for the purpose of ensuring compliance on German territory with the rules on the protection of the environment and the
of personal data, to implement, with regard to Facebook Germany, all the
the powers it enjoys under the national provisions transposing Article 28(2) of the Treaty, and

clearly held that "Facebook Inc. and, in the case of the Union, Facebook Ireland should be looked at
as the main determinant of the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, and

Germany was not responsible (or jointly responsible) for the disputed data processing.
56. The Court of Justice recognised that competence to the German supervisory authority following the verification of
satisfaction of the two conditions laid down in Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 95/46 :
"for the purpose of determining whether a supervisory authority is well founded, in circumstances such as
those in the main proceedings, to be carried on in respect of an establishment situated in the territory of the Member State

namely, on the one hand, whether it is an 'establishment of the controller', within the meaning of this Regulation.
and, on the other hand, if such processing is carried out 'in the course of the activities' of that
establishment, within the meaning of the same provision "31.
57. As to the first condition, the Court found it to be met by considering that it was "constant that

activities in that Member State "32.
58. Mutatis mutandis, this is also the case of Google Belgium SA33 , which actually carries out and
activities in Belgium.
59. As to the second condition, in order to ensure effective and comprehensive protection of persons with
concerned and applying the Google Spain case-law referred to above, the Court of Justice has
considered that the activities of Facebook's establishment in Germany were
inseparably linked to those of the joint data controllers Facebook Inc. and
Facebook Ireland34.
60. Mutatis mutandis, this is also still the case for Google Belgium SA, as this one has also
confirmed, since it does not refute the complainant's argument on this point35.
61. On these bases, the Court concluded in the Wirtschaftsakademie case that German law was
applicable pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 95/46, and that the authority of
the German supervisory authority was competent, in accordance with Article 28(1) of that Directive, to carry out the checks required by Article 28(1).
to apply German law to the processing, and that it therefore had all the powers
available to it under its national law transposing Article 28(3) of Directive

provisions are also mentioned jointly39.
64. The Litigation Chamber considers that, for the three reasons set out below, it is appropriate, in order to
to ensure the effective application of the RGPD, to follow the lessons of the Wirtschaftsakademie judgment
in the present case, and that it is therefore competent to exercise its powers against Google
Belgium SA on the basis of a complaint lodged against the latter with the Authority.
65. Firstly: the controller is established outside the Economic Area (EEA).
European. Mutatis mutandis, and a fortiori with a view to ensuring effective and comprehensive protection of
persons concerned in a situation such as the one in question where the legal person that is
data controller is not located in the European Economic Area (EEA) (the
Google LLC), it is necessary to transpose the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in the case of
Wirtschaftsakademie under the RGPD. The new rules enshrined in the RGPD do not
do not call into question the principles established by the Court in that case law: the GDMP standardizes
the tasks and powers of the supervisory authorities (see Articles 57 and 58), whose competence remains
subject to the principle of territoriality (see Article 55(1) of the GDGR).
66. 66. On the contrary, the DPMR intends to strengthen the effectiveness of data protection rules and to make them more effective.
protect the persons concerned as best as possible. However, while the Court has held that even where the person responsible
of the processing operation was established in the territory of a Member State, the supervisory authority of another State
Member where an institution which is not jointly responsible for the processing operation is located was
competent authority for such an establishment, this reasoning applies a fortiori when the person responsible for the
treatment is established outside the European Union.
67. Second: the controller should not appoint a representative, since it is established outside the EU.
in the territory of the European Economic Area. In view of the roles played by Google Belgium SA40
and Google LLC, the latter being a data controller subject to the DMPP pursuant to the
Google LLC was therefore not required to appoint a representative in accordance with Article 27 of the
RGPD. Recital No 80 of the GDPMR provides that :

69. If the European legislator did not consider it useful, when adopting Article 3(1) of the GDPMR, to oblige a
data controller in a situation such as that of Google LLC at issue in the judgment
Google Spain to appoint a representative,41 is that it considered that the presence of an establishment
of the controller in the territory of the Union within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the PGRD should
have a sufficient territorial link with the territory of the European Union in order to ensure a proper
application of the DMPR: it is implicit but certain that an establishment within the meaning of this provision does not

of the RGPD.
70. On the contrary, the Wirtschaftsakademie case law can be seen in this logic: in
For the effective application of the DPMR in respect of the person concerned, it is appropriate to apply
this case-law also to the establishment of a controller located in the territory of
the Union such as Google Belgium SA, when the manager, subject to the PMPR pursuant to Article
3, 1. of the GDR, did not have to designate a representative within the meaning of Article 27 of the GDR. Not allowing
the supervisory authorities to disregard the legal, social and functional division of a

71. Thirdly: Google as a multinational entity does not allow the identification of the

makes the communications of Google LLC and Google Belgium SA, vis-à-vis the persons concerned,
lack clarity as regards the identification of the controller. It is therefore
all the more necessary to transpose the Wirtschaftsakademie case-law to the present case, with a view to
to ensure the usefulness of the DP Regs.
72. Google Belgium SA notes, in its summary conclusions, inter alia, that the complainant 'has addressed
its initial delisting request to Google LLC (Exhibits B.1 and B.2), through the form
standard made available by the latter (Exhibit A.3)". He did not contact Google Belgium.
SA. The data deletion request form in French is indeed referenced,
to a certain extent, to the company Google LLC: reference is made to Google LLC concerning
the use of the information provided with a view to identifying the data subject, also
concerning the use of the information provided via the form, and the "copyright" also makes
reference to Google LLC.
73. 73. However, the introduction of the form simply refers to "Google" as does the latest
check mark states "I understand that Google will not be able to process my request.

at the hearing that the objective was to be the least "pompous" towards users and that the
references to Google LLC were made explicit in important legal passages of the form.
74. 74. Google's French-language responses also refer to "Google" and "Google LLC.
"The Google Team".
75. As regards the possibilities to challenge Google's decision on the requests for
dereferencing, the response form is limited to specifying the following: "If you are not

contact the owner or author of the page and send him/her directly your request to

Decision on the merits 37/2020 - 19/49
76. Neither the form nor Google's (LLC) responses explicitly identify an
treatment. On the basis of these elements, the Litigation Chamber considers that the process of
dereferencing thus maintains a certain ambiguity, for the persons concerned, as regards
the identity of the controller.
77. 77. In that connection, at the hearing, Google Belgium SA expressed its surprise at the fact that the
data subjects may still have doubts as to the identification of the controller in case of
de-referencing, in the light of the Google Spain judgment already referred to, which identifies Google Int.
as solely responsible. It therefore fails to understand that this established case-law still leaves
some doubts as to the identity of the person in charge in respect of the persons concerned and their
advice.
78. The Litigation Chamber considers on this point that this would in no way relieve the person responsible for the
processing of its obligation to inform the data subject in accordance with Articles 12(1) and 12(2).
of the DPMR, in a transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible manner, in clear and easily understandable terms and
simple, and by facilitating the exercise of his rights by the data subject (on this point, see infra point
Nos. 168). Thus, the data controller is obliged to provide precise information, such as
provided for in Articles 13 and 14 of the GDGR.
79. 79. In conclusion, this ambiguity regarding the roles and responsibilities of Google LLC and Google Belgium in the
SA which may legitimately create doubts on the part of the persons concerned as to
the interlocutor responsible for the processing (or not) to which they are addressed, constitutes a third
reason for transposing the Wirtschaftsakademie case-law in the present case, of

by a person concerned against Google Belgium SA alone.
80. Conclusion. On the basis of these elements, the Litigation Chamber decides that the plaintiff could
direct his complaint, concerning the dereferencing of contents of the search engine indexes
Google, against Google Belgium SA alone. For the Litigation Chamber, it is of little importance
that the processing of its data is in fact carried out outside the European Union by
employees of Google LLC.

84. With respect to the complainant's request for a worldwide de-listing on the ground that he is a senior executive
of a large company, the Litigation Chamber first considers that it does not demonstrate to the aid
evidence that it is also affected in its interests in (the territory of) other States
members or third countries (which does not exclude that its interests in Belgium may be affected).
from these territories).
85. 85. Furthermore, in Google v. CNIL, the Court held that Article 17 of the GDR (on which it bases the right of access to information in the context of the
to dereferencing) cannot have the scope to impose on Google a worldwide dereferencing for
all versions of its search engine. In addition to this, it should be noted that in national law

in particular Article 4), nor the Law of 30 July 2018 on the protection of natural persons with disabilities.
with regard to the processing of personal data, which define the scope of competence
of the Litigation Chamber, do not give the Chamber the power to order a
global dereferencing. The Litigation Chamber cannot therefore grant the request of the
complainant of a worldwide deregistration.
86. 86. Next, the Litigation Chamber examines the arguments in favour of a European scope for the
dereferencing. The Court has - in the Google/CNIL judgment cited above - established the following:
« 67. It is important to note, however, that the public interest in access to a piece of information
may, even within the Union, vary from one Member State to another, so that the result of

members to provide, in particular for salaries solely for the purposes of journalism or
of artistic or literary expression, exemptions and derogations necessary for
reconciling these rights with, in particular, freedom of information.
68. 68. It follows in particular from Articles 56 and 60 of Regulation 2016/679 that, for the
cross-border processing within the meaning of, and subject to, Article 4(23) of the Regulation, and subject to that
Article 56(2), the different national supervisory authorities concerned shall
cooperate, in accordance with the procedure laid down in those provisions, in order to reach a consensus, and
to a single decision binding on all these authorities and whose controller
must ensure compliance with respect to processing activities carried out in the context of
all its establishments in the Union. In addition, Article 61(1) of the Regulation
2016/679 obliges the supervisory authorities, in particular, to provide each other with relevant information.
and to provide each other with mutual assistance in implementing and applying this Regulation

protection of the data subject's personal data with the interest of

example to the Belgian top level domain name (.be) from Google and to a geoblocking of the
users resident in Belgium, the public in other Member States would not suffer any harm to its
opportunities to access information44.
88. To this end, two opportunities for international cooperation are opened by the GDMPR: either the
mandatory cooperation under Articles 56, 1. and 60 (competence of a lead authority)
and one-stop shop) of the GDMP, i.e. voluntary cooperation on the basis of Article 61 of the GDMP, which
allows you to limit yourself to communicating useful information.

European supervisory authorities pursuant to Article 61 of the RGPD, to ensure that the

90. The Litigation Chamber considers that a dereferral can only be effective if it applies
to searches carried out from outside Belgium. In the European area without borders
internal, it would not be useful to order a limited dereferencing of searches conducted from within the
of Belgian territory.
91. With regard to the geographical scope of the dereferral, the Litigation Chamber considers -
in accordance with the Google/CNIL judgment - to be deregistered with effect throughout the Union

(from Belgium's neighbouring countries, for example) and that as a result, people are seeking to find out about
about the complainant via other versions of the Google search engine than the Belgian version (.be).
In this context, a dereferencing limited to Belgium would not be effective enough.

95. In the same judgment, concerning information relating to judicial proceedings in respect of a

"It is thus incumbent on the operator of a search engine to assess, in the context of a

96. Group 29 also explains that :
"The general objective of these criteria is to assess whether the information contained in a result

data protection - and, more broadly, legislation on respect for life
privacy - aims first and foremost to guarantee the fundamental right of individuals to respect for their lives
(and to the protection of their data) "51 .
97. In his complaint, under the complainant's "Party Y labelling" referrals, the complainant
provides eight SEOs and URLs numbered from 1 to 8. These are listed in Exhibit 1 of
its conclusions. The other contents, numbered from 9 to 12, are under the heading of references linked to
a "harassment complaint". These are also set out in Exhibit 1 of its findings.
In essence, in support of his claim, the complainant argues that the referenced content is
inaccurate and/or obsolete and/or contain sensitive data unlawfully disclosed to the
public. It does not challenge the lawfulness of the communication to the public of the content itself to which

98. Before analysing the disputed referrals one after the other,52 the Litigation Chamber assesses whether the
complainant plays a role in public life53 and whether the referrals contain about him or her special categories of data referred to in section 9 of the MGDR54.
6.1. The complainant's role in public life
99. Among the criteria to be taken into account in the analysis to be carried out,55 the role played by the person
concerned in public life appears decisive. In the EDPS guidelines, the EDPS, repeating the
Court of Justice, point out the following:
"The Court has also held that the rights of the persons concerned will prevail, in the event of a breach of the principle of equal treatment, over the rights of the data subject.

determination. These include: the nature of the information or its sensitivity, and especially
the interest of Internet users in accessing information, which may vary depending on the role
played by the person concerned in public life ... "56 .

100. According to Group 29 guidelines (pp. 15-16) :
"What is a "role" in public life?
It is not possible to establish with certainty the type of role in public life that an
natural person must play a role in justifying public access to information on that natural person.
person by means of an Internet search.
However, as an example, politicians, senior officials,
business and professional (regulated) persons
can generally be considered to play a role in public life. There are
reasons for allowing the public to seek information about the role and
activities of these people in public life.
In general, it is appropriate to consider whether the fact that the public has access to the
specific information about a person by means of a search on the basis of his or her name
would prevent it from engaging in inappropriate public or professional conduct.
It is equally difficult to define the sub-group of "public persons". In good standing
public persons can be said to be persons who, because of the
the functions they hold or the commitments they have made, are more or less exposed
to the media.
Resolution 1165 (1998) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the right to the
The Privacy Act provides a possible definition of "public persons". It states
that "public persons are those who hold public office and/or use
of public resources and, more generally, all those that play a role
in public life, whether political, economic, artistic, social, sports or other".
Some information concerning public persons is of a purely private nature and does not

information about their health or family members. But as a general rule, if the
persons making an application are public persons and that the information provided by the applicant is
in question do not constitute information of a purely private nature, there will be moreover
strong reasons for refusing the dereferencing of search results concerning them. The
case law of the European Court of Human Rights (hereinafter the "ECHR") is
particularly relevant for assessing the balance of interests" (italics added by the
Litigation Chamber). »

101 In this context, both the complainant and Google raise issues that demonstrate that the
complainant has played and continues to play a role in public life in Belgium.
102 It should first of all be pointed out that neither the Group 29 guidelines nor the
The EDPS does not require the data subject to be a political figure in order for him to be able to act as a
role in public life.

the public has no or no longer a legitimate interest in having access to this information. He also notes that he was

years, i.e. a company that is closely related to Company Z.
105 In its conclusions, Google also lists a series of functions performed by the complainant
in the past and which illustrate, also in the opinion of the Litigation Chamber, that it has also, by
the past, played a role in public life.
106.Thus, in addition to the complainant's current responsibilities already mentioned, among the duties of the position are the following

Minister of Party Y; Government Commissioner in Entity A; Member of Entity B; Agent

responsibilities in organization E; and a senior position in public entity F.
107.In other words, the complainant is performing and has performed public duties and/or in which
it has used and is using public resources, has been and is being exposed in the media, has acted and is acting in
a public context as a public person and, more specifically, as a senior public servant, or
agent of a public service.

108 In conclusion, on the basis of the elements just set out,57 the Appeals Chamber considers that the
complainant has played and is playing a role in public life.

section 9 of the GDPR. These data benefit from a legal regime of enhanced protection.
For example, Google's processing of such data is prohibited, as it cannot be based on
none of the applicable exceptions (i.e. Article 9 §2 of the RGPD and Article 8 §1 of the Law of the
30 July 2018 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data relating to
personal data)".
110 The complainant further insists that portraying him as a person "labelled party Y"....
is inaccurate information justifying its dereferencing, and that in particular the deductions of
Google regarding the complainant's links to the Y party are hasty and based on evidence
erroneous (this is discussed below58).
111 In its summary findings, Google notes that in the present context, namely that of the
and its role in public life in Belgium, it "is clear to the public that the labelling of the
policy does not in any way refer to \[the applicant's\] real or supposed political views, but
only the political party to which he is professionally close and which supported his candidacy
to obtaining public mandates "59. In its conclusions, Google intends to demonstrate in fact
the professional ties between the applicant and the Y Party. In particular, in order to justify that the
treatment of political labelling is important to ensure a relevant public interest debate by
the manner in which the appointment of (senior) officials and the terms of reference of the (senior)
public mandates in Belgium, Google quotes Professor David Renders as saying that the recruitment of
senior officials is politicized. In the same vein, the second paragraph of the press article
less than ten years ago from www.lecho.be profiled the complainant and reported his appointment to
a senior position in Public Entity F (Exhibit B.14 in the Google file).

7. Violations of the DMPP
157 Upon submission of his deregistration request form to Google on May 31, 2010
2019, under "Reason for deletion", the complainant, through his lawyer, reported that
that the harassment complaint had been declared unfounded in 2010 and that the information referenced
was therefore no longer up to date88. This fact, regardless of its demonstration on the basis of parts (such as the

that the opinion referred to above89), at this stage of the process, has therefore been brought to Google's attention
as soon as the dereferral form has been submitted, and this, moreover, by a lawyer.
158 Also at that time, Google must have become aware of the fact that the referenced content
was about ten years old and concerned facts that were more than ten years old.
The Chamber therefore considers that, upon receipt of the application form for a
dereferencing introduced by the complainant, Google had actual knowledge of the
of the harassment complaint, the fact that this information was not updated, and finally,
in the case of a harassment complaint, that it was likely to cause harm to the complainant.
In other words, Google had effective knowledge from that moment on of serious grounds for

of the RGPD.
162 The same facts also constitute a breach of section 6(1)(f) of the GDPR when
in the circumstances of this case and for the reasons already given,92 the interests of the complainant who
require protection of personal data prevail over Google's legitimate interest
to reference content available via the Internet.
163 The Litigation Chamber considers that these failures are of a serious nature on the part of
from Google. Although the provisions that were violated are open to interpretation and the
right to data protection is not an absolute right, dereferencing is an obligation
clear from a search engine following the Google Spain shutdown. As referred to by the Court of Justice,
the potential seriousness of the interference is serious and the rights of the person concerned prevail, by
principle, on the interest of this public in finding this information when searching for the name
of that person.93
164 In this case, Google was fully aware of all the facts as a result of the
the complainant's request, did not act diligently in refusing to derefer to the content
in question, when the complainant had provided him with evidence of their outdated nature. The House

conclusion, Google's response as to the reason for the refusal to deregister lacked transparency
and was not sufficiently comprehensible, in violation of Articles 12, 1. and 4. of the GDR.
8. Corrective and deterrent measures.
First, the Litigation Chamber orders Google Belgium, pursuant to Article 100(1) of the GDR, to take the following corrective and deterrent measures.
1, 8° and 9° of the LCA, to bring the treatment into conformity and, to this end, to have the following implemented

167 In addition to the injunction to dereferencing references Nos. 9 to 12, the Litigation Chamber
Considers that the two failures referred to above require in addition, for purposes of
deterrence, the imposition of administrative fines.
168 The Litigation Chamber emphasises that the purpose of imposing an administrative fine is not to
only to put an end to an offence committed but, above all, to ensure effective enforcement
of the rules of the GSPD. As can be seen from recital 148, the PGRD wants to see sanctions, y
including administrative fines, be imposed in cases of serious infringements, in addition to
or instead of the appropriate measures that are imposed. The Litigation Chamber acts as follows
application of section 58.2(i) of the DP Regs. The instrument of an administrative fine does not therefore have the purpose of
main objective to end violations. This goal can be achieved through several measures
including the injunctions referred to in Article 100, § 1, 8° and 9° of the LCA, which are provided for in the
by the RGPD. With respect to a sanction in the form of an administrative fine, the nature
and the gravity of the violation are taken into account by the Litigation Chamber in order to examine
the imposition and extent of this sanction.

administratively vis-à-vis Google for a breach in the context of deregistration.
The Swedish supervisory authority, for example, imposed on Google on 11 March 2020 a fine of 75
million Swedish kronor (approximately EUR 7 million) for several breaches by it
to its delisting obligations.95
A form for the imposition of an administrative fine was sent to Google Belgium SA, a company that is not a member of the European Union.
on 4 June 2020 to make these arguments regarding the imposition of administrative fines.96
In response to this form Google Belgium SA puts forward several arguments. First and foremost Google
Belgium argues that no sanctions should be imposed on it, since this would be "totally
inappropriate, dangerously counterproductive and even illegal "97. In the alternative, Google Belgium
SA states that "the envisaged sanctions would violate the principle of proportionality of the standards....
repressive. In addition, the publication by name of a sanction against Google Belgium SA
would be counterproductive "98. In the further alternative, Google Belgium SA considers that the
the determination of the amount is not properly justified because "the Litigation Chamber has
... and did not take into account the mitigating circumstances "99.
The amount of the fine is also considered problematic by Google Belgium SA because
it is not able to control the scale, formula and method of calculation used for its
determination.
172. In response to these arguments, the Litigation Chamber specifies that it is relying on Article 83 of the
to conclude that an administrative penalty is warranted and to calculate the
amount. The Litigation Chamber gives reasons for its decision on the basis of the findings set out below.
As indicated in the fine form, in respect of the determination of the amount of the fine, the
of the turnover of Google Belgium SA, which is a criterion for the calculation of the fine,
the Litigation Chamber is based on the opinion of the European Data Protection Committee which
is the following:
"In order to impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive fines, the enforcement authorities
will rely on the definition of business provided by the ECJ for the purposes of
the application of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, namely that the concept of undertaking must
be understood as an economic unit that can be formed by the parent company and all of its subsidiaries.

175 Concerning the failure to comply with articles 17, 1, a) and 6, 1, f) of the RGPD, the Litigation Chamber,
having regard to Article 83(2) of the GDR, decides to impose an administrative fine in the amount of
EUR 500,000, taking into account :

pursuant to Article 62.§ 2 of the ACL, only applications may be the subject of mediation

concerned, the complainant had lodged a complaint and not a request103. Furthermore, the

but a deterrent104 , the effect of which cannot be replicated by mediation ;
(iii) to date, the defendant has not taken any steps, even temporary, to mitigate the
damage suffered by the plaintiff, even though she has known since the fine form was sent
on June 4, 2020 that the Litigation Chamber was questioning a violation of the GDR and that
the Litigation Chamber considered the imposition of a sanction (Article 83. 2, c). On this point,
the Litigation Chamber clarifies that it is under no obligation to suggest or impose on the party
defendant to take measures which would enable it to reduce the amount of the fine

requires a case-by-case analysis, the right to oblivion constitutes an obligation

recidivism where the legal entities concerned are different (Article 83(2)(e));

such as those found by the House. This also justifies that greater diligence
is expected from it (Article 83(2)(k) of the GDR).
176. The Litigation Chamber further recalls that, under Article 83(5)(b) of the GDR, it provides as follows
the power to impose fines of up to EUR 20 000 000 or up to 4% of the turnover of
the company. The amount of the fine provided for in this decision is well below
These ceilings and represent a reasonable amount in relation to sales ($161.857 billion in

Article 83(2) of the RGPD decides to impose an administrative fine of EUR 100 000,
taking into account the following elements :

decisions of the Litigation Chamber, also taking into account the scope of the present decision

and the other people mentioned. The Chamber considers that such a deletion is necessary in order to
of the objective pursued by the complainant, namely dereferencing by Google. 
Decision on the merits 37/2020 - 47/49
182 In the reaction to the fine form, Google Belgium SA states, inter alia, that a
publication would be counterproductive and would stigmatize Google. This argument is not convincing.
First of all, Google Belgium SA considers that such a publication would be counterproductive.
since it would encourage people seeking dereferencing to turn to Google unnecessarily
Belgium SA rather than Google LLC. This argument cannot be accepted. Indeed, the request for
dereferencing is not done by postal mail, but by an online form put at
disposition by Google LLC. It is not possible to turn to the wrong entity during a
request for dereferencing since it is Google LLC that makes the web page available and that runs
the process for dealing with his complaint. Apart from extremely marginal cases, the Litigation Chamber
can't see how a person could direct his or her request for dereferral to Google
Belgium SA.
Second, with regard to the stigmatisation argument, the Litigation Chamber points out that the
publication with identification of the defendant pursues two objectives. First of all, it aims to
an objective of general interest, because it explains the responsibilities (of the subsidiaries in the Union) of
Google under RGPD. Indeed, in view of the importance of the search engine "Google" for very
