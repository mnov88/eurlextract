## English Summary

### Facts

A tenant of a flat in an apartment complex argued that the motion-detecting camera installed in the complex by another tenant was unlawfully processing their personal data, since it partially recorded public spaces of the building. Moreover, the complainant also questioned whether the single sticker the defendants placed on the wall satisfied the information provision obligations under [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR").

The defendants argued that the camera was used to protect their belongings, such as their door and gas/electricity meters, and therefore fell under the 'legitimate interest' legal ground under [Article 6(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"). Finally, they noted that after reviewing the recordings captured by the camera, they made sure to delete them on a daily basis.

### Holding

The Hungarian DPA noted that the legitimate interest legal basis under [Article 6(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") could indeed be invoked for the protection of private property, including for the monitoring of public spaces under limited circumstances, as noted in point 27 of the EDPB in Guidelines 3/2019 on processing of personal data through video devices. However, the DPA held that this legal ground was not applicable in this case, since the camera's angle also captured areas that were not relevant for the purpose of protecting private property, and the defendant's activity therefore did not fulfil the requirements for necessity and proportionality.

Moreover, the DPA recalled that in the [CJEU - C‑212/13 - František Ryneš](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C%E2%80%91212/13_-_Franti%C5%A1ek_Ryne%C5%A1 "CJEU - C‑212/13 - František Ryneš"), the CJEU ruled that the exception for 'purely personal or household activity' under [Article 2(2)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_2_GDPR#2c "Article 2 GDPR") must be interpreted narrowly, and therefore does not apply to the recording of public spaces.

Subsequently, the DPA ordered the defendant to either restrict the viewing angle of the camera, use blurring or masking technologies achieving the same effect, change the location of the camera, or cease its use altogether. The DPA also noted that one sticker warning that the camera is in use does not fulfil the provisions regarding information to be provided under [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR"). However, the DPA did not deem it necessary to impose any fine, given that it was a first offence that caused only limited harm.

In view of the above, the Applicant addressed the following requests to the Authority:
- prohibit the Applicants from operating the camera system;
- call for the dismantling of the illegally operated camera system;
- order the Applicants to delete the data;
- impose a fine on the Applicants.

In order to clarify the facts, the Authority in its orders dated 28 April 2021 63.

Subsequently, the Authority repeatedly invited the Applicants to make a statement in accordance with Ákr. Section 63
and sent a rectification to the Applicant as the Authority found that the application was not

In its supplementary submission, the Applicant stated as follows. He stated that the \[…\]

ownership is not relevant, only the quality of the data subject matters in the data protection

above, and the Applicant’s apartment is located directly below the Applicants residing on the roof level. THE
Applicant stated that he approached his apartment with the disputed camera

may record without authorization. The Applicant submitted that there was no guarantee that the
Applicants will actually delete the unauthorized data after the recordings have been made.

In their joint statement, the Applicants presented the following. The Applicants consider

stated that an application saves the notifications to the memory card, hence to a separate folder
the data will not be saved. A screenshot was attached to support their statement. THE
According to the applicants' statement, the legal basis for data processing is the General Data Protection Regulation
Article 6 (1) (f) for the purpose of promoting their property and personal protection, as
on 5 August 2020, the Applicant threatened him with a knife (no action was taken).
He attached a copy of the decisions in support of their statement. It is also attached to the Property

Following the Applicants' reply, the Applicant lodged a request for access to the file, which was
by sending the documents by post.

The Conseil d 'État submitted that, because of the wording, correspondence with the Joint Representative did not prove that the
consent to camera recordings and cannot be considered lawful either, as it is common
representative is not entitled to authorize on its own without the decision of the residents. The Applicant
He added that the property protection proceedings relied on by the Applicants were not in the present case
relevant because, on the one hand, it has already been properly assessed by the acting body by rejecting the
submission. On the other hand, the facts presented by the Applicants cannot be justified by any resident
operation of a camera intended to be operated illegally in the common condominium area.

Subsequently, in order to clarify the facts, the Authority again invited the
Applicants are listed in the Ákr. 63.

In their joint submission, the Applicants stated as follows. Candidates attached
the balancing test with the addition that since the ongoing proceedings it has been

experienced the following:
    non-greeting was replaced by an arrogant wide grin;
    - when the Applicants pass in front of the Applicant's apartment, from within the Applicant
       knocks loudly on the door;
    - if they accidentally meet on the street and cross the road in front of the Applicant's car
       the engine is started by the Applicant.

The Authority highlights the following part of the content of the interest balance test attached by the Applicants:
"The area in front of the door can otherwise be closed with a separate grille, which allows access to the roof
stairwell, but this is not the only way to approach the roof. The first

at our entrance) are also treated as private because of the above ”.

Given that the Applicants have not been subjected to atrocities since the camera was installed, it is
that dismantling the camera would perpetuate past inconveniences and increase
a sense of threat. Applicants described the location of the two properties and the camera

the area observed by. In this regard, the Applicants highlighted that if
someone who wants to look out of the affected window does not necessarily get into the camera 's field of view, and
observation does not extend beyond the designated area, not pedestrians passing by on Turkish Road

Applicants submitted that they had never seen one belonging to their apartment in the last five years

it is associated with the same sight. The Applicants attached the deed of incorporation of the condominium with which

In this connection, it was stated that the deed did not designate the exact location of the joint ownership, thus

III.1. The identity of the controller

Pursuant to Article 4 (7) of the GDPR, a controller is a natural or legal person \[…\] who a

\[…\].

According to Article 26 (1) of the GDPR, if the purposes and means of data processing are two or more

jointly defined by the controller, they shall be considered as joint controllers.

The Applicants in their declaration to the Authority - as the operator of the camera system
Have clearly identified themselves as data controllers and, according to the Applicants' statement,
camera was installed themselves, therefore, as determining the purpose and means of data management
Article 4 (7) of the GDPR and Article 26 (1) of the GDPR
considered by the Authority to be a joint controller.

All this does not change the fact that in consultation with the common representative of the Condominium in advance
became the fact that in the current situation real estate camera surveillance may be warranted, as Condominium
TV. Pursuant to Section 25 (1), only at least two-thirds of all ownership shares
the camera shall be deemed to have been approved with the affirmative vote of the majority of the co-owners
operation.

III.2. Legality of camera data management

Under the GDPR, the image of the data subject is considered personal data. Affected by the identified or
identifiable natural person. According to all this, if based on a recording
natural person can be identified, then the image is taken as personal data, the image is taken
considered as data management.

The Authority notes that in the course of the proceedings it is not relevant that the Applicant
owns or otherwise owns the apartment. All you need to consider is that
whether it can be related to data processing, i.e. whether it is included in the camera’s field of view.
In the present case, the Authority finds that the Applicant is considered to be concerned, as in two cases

camera captured (even if for a short time) the Applicant, as well as by operating the camera on it
the possibility still exists.

The use of cameras, depending on their position and angle of view, may be suitable for
to observe another private area, or a public area, associated with another property
make recordings that may violate the personal identity of persons observed by the camera
rights, privacy.

The angle of view of cameras should not normally be directed at a public area because it is for surveillance purposes only
it is possible in a narrow circle, as this activity may infringe on the privacy of the observed person
by handling your personal information even against your will.

Under Article 2 (2) (c) of the GDPR, they do not fall within the scope of the Regulation and therefore do not

the GDPR rules apply to the processing of personal data if it is carried out by natural persons
carried out exclusively in the course of their personal or domestic activities (so-called "household data management").
Examples of personal or domestic activities are given in recital 18 of the GDPR,
thus, it qualifies as such in the context of correspondence, directory storage, personal and home activities
social networking and other online activities. Important
                                                                                                     1
however, to emphasize that, as the Court of Justice of the European Union in the so-called Rynes judgment
the exception for private data processing should be interpreted narrowly.
For the purposes of this Decision, camera surveillance, in so far as the data processing
also extends to persons outside the private property of the shooter
exception.

This practice has been maintained by the European Data Protection Board for the use of video
in its Guideline 3/2019 on in-depth data management. The guidelines, in addition to
flattens that it is generally a camera designed to monitor its own area

a situation may arise where the scope of the camera surveillance cannot be reduced to one’s own

the individual is entitled to extend the camera surveillance to his own territory.

let your immediate surroundings.

However, in the event that the individual does not employ the camera in the field of view of another
private area - who obscures solutions, or who specifically monitors another private area
already operates a camera system, it becomes a data controller, and its activity does not qualify

private data management, so it should apply to GDPR data controllers
all the requirements set out in

Thus, by applying masking, the area monitored by the camera can be narrowed to the area that
is in the possession of the controller. However, if the angle of view of the cameras is

outside the privacy of the person performing the data management with the system - for example, in a public area, a condominium
jointly owned territory or territory owned by another third party,
it cannot be considered as a “personal or home” activity covered by the above exception.

In the present case, the memorandum of association actually states that the walls of the staircase, the

walls, ventilation chimneys, and intermediate and closing slabs are common areas. A Ha-
as the forecourt is not separately owned and the intermediate and
closing slabs can be considered as a common area and therefore cannot be considered as private area. The Authority
