## English Summary

### Facts

Two parents turned to NAIH in connection with their credit institute’s processing of personal data regarding their “Childbirth incentive loan”.

The couple applied for suspension of repayment, for which they were eligible under the condition that the fetus is at least 12 weeks old. In order to certify this fact, the administrator of the credit institute copied their pregnancy booklet in its entirety.

The parents were of the opinion that this is unnecessary for the purpose of certifying the age of the fetus, as the pregnancy booklet contains a number of sensitive information.

Following this situation, NAIH conducted an ex officio investigation. In order to have all the necessary and relevant information, NAIH collected statements from the controller.

NAIH found that the controller processed the personal data in question excessively and unlawfully, and therefore had breached multiple GDPR provisions. As a consequence, NAIH imposed a data protection fine of HUF 35,000,000 on the controller.

### Dispute

Is the controller’s general data processing practice in compliance with the GDPR in connection with collecting personal data from pregnancy booklets and patient records for the purpose of reviewing the eligibility of a couple for repayment suspension for a “childbirth incentive loan” construction?

### Holding

The conditions of a special loan called as “childbirth incentive loan” are set out in a respective Hungarian Government Decree. According to the relevant rules, parents, or parents expecting a child are eligible for suspension of repayment, where specific criteria are met, including that the fetus is at least 12 weeks old.

In order to verify this, certain documents must be presented. The controller in this case requested, amongst others, the copy of the complete pregnancy booklet, with all the information in it, as well as the patient records.

The pregnancy booklet contains a wide range of personal data regulated specifically in a ministerial decree, e.g., detailed information about the health status of the mother, including data related to possible previous pregnancies, details about the circumstances of previous childbirth, or miscarriages.

Regarding the legal basis of the above data processing, NAIH highlighted, that the fact of being pregnant is in itself health data, and as such, can only be processed if one of the legal bases in Article 6 (1) and an additional criterion under Article 9 (2) of the GDPR apply.

Article 9 (2) of the GDPR does not contain an exception that would explicitly allow the processing of health data for the purpose of performing a contract. According to Article 9 (2) (a) of the GDPR, health data may be processed if data subjects give their explicit consent. Pursuant to Section 9 (2) of the relevant Government Decree, the spouses must expressly state in the loan agreement that they consent to the processing of data regarding the 12th week of pregnancy and the expected date of childbirth. By this, the Government Decree settles the legal basis for the processing of health data. However, NAIH raised issues as to the validity of the consent. NAIH is of the opinion that it is questionable whether the consent is freely given, since without the prior consent of the contractor, no loan agreement would be concluded.

NAIH concluded, that the controller violated the principle of data minimization by copying the entire pregnancy booklet, containing excessive health data and other highly sensitive data, as it is not strictly necessary in light of the purpose of the processing. In addition to the excessive collection of special categories of personal data, NAIH highlighted that the affected individuals were in an extremely vulnerable situation.

NAIH also held, that the data controller had, in fact, no appropriate legal basis for the processing.

NAIH held that the continuous nature of the violation of the data subjects’ rights, and the large number of affected individuals were aggravating factors in the case. On the other hand, NAIH acknowledged the fact that the controller reconsidered and changed its data processing operations, and ended its unlawful practice of keeping copies of pregnancy booklets and patient records.

  

## Comment

NAIH has already considered the copying of personal and other documents and processing identification documents by controllers in multiple cases. According to NAIH's practice, copying of documents is generally not necessary for concluding a contract or for pre-contractual screening. Processing of identification documents and relevant identification numbers is also generally unnecessary for the given purpose of processing, unless it is prescribed by law.

The Szaztv. § 23 determines which bodies are entitled to manage the TAJ number and for what purpose.

ARC. Decision:

IV.1. The need to process personal data recorded in the pregnancy care book

(28) Pursuant to Section 9 (2) (b) of the Government Decree - in force at the beginning of the official proceedings -

      the beneficiaries must declare at the time of concluding the loan agreement that:
      the 12th week of pregnancy and the expected date of delivery with a pregnancy care book
      verify and consent to the processing of this data. The 12th week of pregnancy and the

      proof of the expected date of confinement is required if the fetus is 12 weeks old
      the assisted couple wishes to claim a discount, ie to suspend the repayment, or

      childbirth allowance.

(29) Section 14 (4) and Section 19 (5) of the Government Decree provide that the repayment

      application for childcare allowance or childbirth allowance a
      must be submitted to a credit institution providing a baby waiting loan, to which the Government Decree must be attached
      Documents pursuant to Section 9 (2) (b) and (c). The Government Decree does not define that submission

      how the term is to be understood, as a presentation at the bank branch when submitting the application or as a document
      a copy to the application. Subject to Section 9 (2) (b) of the Government Decree

      which is only expected for the 12th week of pregnancy and childbirth

      In accordance with paragraph 2 (b), the above data shall relate to obstetrics with the content specified in Annex 2.

      may also be attested by a certificate issued by a gynecologist, in the opinion of the Authority
      submission shall be construed in a narrower sense as a presentation.

(30) What data should be recorded and what data can be recorded in pregnancy care
      26/2014 on Pregnancy Care. (IV. 8.) EMMI Decree (hereinafter: EMMI
      Regulation). In the pregnancy care book, the pregnant woman is natural

      In addition to the personal identification data, the social security number is indicated

      the name and address of the next of kin (page 1). They shall also indicate:

      various details of a gynecologist or midwife, e.g. name, address, phone number, email address

      (Page 2).

(31) At the expected time of confinement or in addition to the fact that the obstetrician-gynecologist

      in which week the pregnant woman appeared - from which it can be calculated that the 12th week of pregnancy
      when loaded - a number of additional details will be recorded in the pregnancy care book,
      some of which are health data. The pregnancy care book contains the pregnant woman

      blood group, risk classification of pregnancy, data on previous births and pregnancies (3.
      side). These data include that if a pregnant woman has already given birth,

      when was she born, in how many weeks of pregnancy, how many grams was the newborn born, what was it like 11

      whether its position - cranial position, pelvic end, transverse position - was there any
      complication during labor, vaginal delivery - episiotomy or barrier protection, or

      by gripping surgery or vacuum extraction - or by cesarean section, or that the child
      what state of health you are in when you are admitted to another pregnancy.

(32) Data on ‘failed pregnancies’ indicate in which year, the number of pregnancies
      how many weeks and how the pregnancy was terminated: with an artificial or spontaneous abortion, or whether it was
      angina or ectopic pregnancy in a pregnant woman.

(33) In addition to the above, a history of diseases, diseases,
      surgeries - developmental disorders in the parents' family, inherited diseases,

      drug sensitivity or test finding (page 4). It is also recorded by the dentist
      study findings (page 4), records of those involved in pregnancy care (pages 8-13),

      in which they record when, in what week of pregnancy the size of the pregnant woman was
      body weight, blood pressure, heart rate, abdominal circumference and the position of the fundus, as well as
      symptoms observed during the studies and the therapy or measure recommended for them.

(34) Also included in the Pregnancy Care Book (pages 6-7) according to the EMMI Regulation
      free, mandatory examinations - e.g. various blood tests, urine tests, ultrasound

      tests or genetic testing (page 14) if the pregnant woman is 37 years of age at conception
      assessment and any specialist comments, and when it was
      the first day of the last menstrual period, usually how long a menstrual cycle is and what the birth is

      expected date.

(35) The Authority notes that there is no explicit section in the Pregnancy Care Book in which

      it could be indicated when the 12th week of pregnancy was loaded, it can only be calculated
      may be from when, in what week of pregnancy the proof of pregnancy occurred.

      This should or can be listed in two places in the pregnancy care book, first inside it
      on page 7, which is completed by the nurse, and on page 7, “The ultrasound of intrauterine pregnancy
      examination ’, completed by the obstetrician and gynecologist performing the examination.

(36) As acknowledged by the customer, the Client supported it in accordance with its general practice during the period considered
      on a women’s pregnancy care book who, along with their spouses, applied for a baby-waiting loan

      suspension of childbirth or childbirth allowance
      made a copy for the 12th week of pregnancy, sometimes to varying degrees.

(37) The Authority examined the pregnancy books provided by the Client
      made copies showing that \[…\] the practice of each account was not uniform
      the extent to which a copy of the pregnancy care book was made. Some \[…\]

      accounts copied the entire pregnancy care book, others only natural
      pages with personal information and the expected date of delivery. Also a copy

      attached is the Client, which was made exclusively from the page of the pregnancy care book on which the
      specialist indicates the expected date of delivery. However, in addition to these, there are also copies
      were made which did not contain the pages on which the expected date of confinement was given

      or from which the 12th week of pregnancy could have been calculated.

(38) The data content of the copies of the pregnancy books of each beneficiary varies according to the

      depending on the personal circumstances of the spouses, the number of their children or whether
      at what stage of pregnancy did the Client turn to suspend the repayment, or 12

      application for childbirth allowance, as the more advanced the pregnancy, the more
      several test results are recorded in the pregnancy care book.

(39) In addition to the data specified in the EMMI Regulation, nurses and general practitioners are unique
      comments have also been included in pregnancy books, e.g. how many days was the

      the menstrual cycle of a pregnant woman at the age of 15 or the age of her first child
      breastfed.

(40) The processing of data listed in the above paragraphs, in particular health data, is not
      necessary to complete the 12th week of pregnancy and the expected date of delivery a
      supported by the Client are certified to the Client, i.e. by the Client in the Pregnancy Books

      data handled in copies - excluding the expected date of delivery and the pregnancy is loaded
      are not appropriate for the purpose of data processing and are not

      relevant, they go far beyond the required range of data and the Authority therefore concludes that
      that the Customer has violated the principle of data protection pursuant to Article 5 (1) (c) of the GDPR.

IV.2. Handling of personal information contained in copies of maternity care books

      legal basis

(41) Certain conditions for the use of the baby waiting loan and related aid are a

      Government Decree, in addition to in accordance with Section 4 (4) of the Government Decree
      a loan agreement may be concluded only with claimants who are covered by the credit institution's general internal rules

      according to which it qualifies as creditworthy for the borrowing requested.

(42) According to Section 9 (2) (b) of the Government Decree in force during the period under review, the repayment

      pause and childbirth allowance for the 12th week of pregnancy
      and the expected date of confinement must be evidenced by the pregnancy record book if the
      to apply for discounts to the Customer to submit the child

      takes place before birth.

(43) The processing of this data by the Client is necessary in order to be able to ascertain the

      the eligibility of applications for benefits and the benefits
      can ensure the use of this data between the beneficiaries and the
      necessary to fulfill the contracts concluded between the beneficiaries. That doesn't change that

      nor that as a condition for the use of the grant the processing of these data by Government Decree
      makes it binding on the Client within the framework of the contractual relationship. Therefore, the

      data on the completion of the 12th week of pregnancy and the expected date of delivery, which
      the legal basis for the processing of a pregnant woman's personal data under Article 6 of the GDPR is Article 6 (1) of the GDPR
      paragraph (b).

(44) It should also be emphasized that the fact of pregnancy is in itself the health of the pregnant person
      including how many weeks of pregnancy you are going and when you are expected to

      to give birth. According to Article 9 of the GDPR, personal data are personal data
      and their handling is, in principle, prohibited. Health data legally

      they can only be dealt with if one of the legal bases set out in Article 6 (1) of the GDPR
      In addition, there is a circumstance within the meaning of Article 9 (2) of the GDPR.

(45) Article 9 (2) of the GDPR does not contain an exception which is expressly a contract

      would allow the processing of health data in order to meet Article 9 (2) of the GDPR
      (a), health data may be processed if one or more of the specific data subject 13

      express consent. According to Section 9 (2) of the Government Decree, the spouses a
      they must expressly state in the loan agreement that the 12th week of pregnancy

      contribute to the processing of data on the loading and expected date of confinement,
      that is, the Government Decree apparently settles the legal basis for the processing of health data. THE
      In the Authority's view, the contribution is voluntary as one of the contributions

      whether the condition of validity is fully enforced during the data management is questionable, since a
      without the prior consent of the contracter at the time of conclusion of the contract

      no loan agreement would be concluded.

(46) The Client may not review or act on the laws of the Member States which govern it

      on the contrary, the Authority finds that in the case of spouses who have
      they wish to take advantage of the benefit provided for in the Government Decree with regard to their fetuses,
      legally manages the 12th week of pregnancy and the expected date of delivery

      data.

(47) The Client shall lawfully manage the data contained in the pregnancy care book in addition to the

      spouses ’natural identity and contact information, and the pregnant woman
      data on the occupation and education of the Client, which is managed by the Client and the
      necessary for the performance of a contract between spouses, including before the conclusion of the contract

      credit assessment - and, on the other hand, to fulfill its various legal obligations, e.g. money laundering and
      contributing to the prevention and deterrence of terrorist financing. These

      the Client has an appropriate purpose and legal basis for its management.

(48) The Authority has a copy of the TAJ number of the pregnant woman in the copy of the pregnancy care book

      considers it necessary to emphasize that the TAJ number is in line with the Szaztv. according to
      an identification code that is handled and transmitted only by statutory rules
      that is, that is, the data controller who is not authorized by law to use the TAJ number

      only with the consent of the GDPR concerned in accordance with Article 4 (11). The Szaztv. Section 23
      also determines which bodies are authorized to manage the TAJ number, for what purpose,

      however, no financial institutions are listed among them, nor is there any other sectoral law
      authorizes them, and the parties concerned have not demonstrably contributed to the TAJ
      for their handling by the Client, ie they are managed by the Client without a legal basis.

(49) Section III.1 of the Decision. The treatment of the health data described in
      (45), supplemented by the fact that the processing of these data is not limited to Article 9 of the GDPR.

      None of the circumstances set out in Article 2 (2) apply, but also to the Client
      admittedly, it does not have a legal basis under Article 6 of the GDPR. In the Pregnancy Care Book
      pregnant women have not demonstrably contributed to the processing of the health data

      they are not necessary for the fulfillment of the loan agreement - not including the pregnancy
      12th week and the expected date of delivery - their management by the Client

      not necessary to fulfill its legal obligation. In addition, the Customer is in the public interest
      does not perform a task, does not exercise public power, the data management of the data subjects or other natural
      protection of personal vital interests is not necessary, as well as the Customer these

      cannot present a legitimate interest in the management of those concerned
      rights and freedoms.

(50) The findings made in the previous paragraph with regard to Article 6 (1) of the GDPR are as follows:
      personal data not mentioned as hitherto, which do not qualify as health data - who is the pregnant woman
      GP, nurse, dentist. 14

(51) In the Authority’s view, the Client should have recognized that the Government Decree
      It shall apply subject to the provisions of the GDPR and in conjunction with that legislation

      a prudent, proportionate data management practice in line with the principles of data management
      to design.

(52) On the basis of the above, the Authority concludes that by the 12th week of pregnancy, the expected
      with the exception of the data referred to in point (47) of the Decision
      all additional data in pregnancy books, including health data

      the Client did not have an adequate legal basis for dealing with the breach, in breach of Article 6 (1) of the GDPR.
      as well as Article 9 (1) of the GDPR as regards health data.

IV.3. Necessity and legal basis for the processing of the data recorded in the final reports

(53) According to Section 9 (2) (c) of the Government Decree - in force during the period under review - the subsidized

      persons must also declare their commitment, dead, when concluding the loan agreement
      in the case of birth or miscarriage, a certificate certifying that this has taken place within a maximum of 60 days a
      presented to the credit institution and contribute to the management of that data.

(54) Section 14 (4) and Section 19 (5) of the Government Decree provide that the repayment
      application for childcare allowance or childbirth allowance a

      must be submitted to a credit institution providing a baby waiting loan, to which the Government Decree must be attached
      Documents pursuant to Section 9 (2) (b) and (c). The Government Decree does not define that submission

      how the term is to be understood, as a presentation at the bank branch when submitting the application or as a document
      a copy to the application. Section 9 (2) (c) of the Government Decree expressly
      it provides for the presentation, not the copying, of the documents listed there.

(55) The Client made a copy of the final report on the miscarriage of two subsidized women to the
      period in order to verify the above. The final report is a natural identity for women

      In addition to the data, it includes the tests performed, the therapy used, and the tests performed
      description of the intervention. The health status of women, the examinations, their results, the performed

      information on interventions, as well as the fact of miscarriage, Article 4 (15) of the GDPR
      health data which are not necessary for the fact of a miscarriage
      inappropriate and irrelevant to achieve the purpose of the data processing, therefore the

      Authority finds that by handling these, the Client has violated Article 5 (1) of the GDPR
      (c).

(56) The Authority finds that, as explained in point (49) of this Decision, the Client does not
      in addition to the fact of the abortion and the date thereof, in the final report
      in breach of Article 6 (1) of the GDPR,

      and Article 9 (1).

IV.4. Information on data management during the application and granting of a baby waiting loan

transparency

(57) The Client provides information in several different documents regarding the application for the baby waiting loan, respectively

      in the case of the conclusion of a loan agreement, of the data processing carried out in the course of that agreement, which
      documents on the Client 's website, under the \[…\] tab, collected in a clickable form and
      grouped under \[…\] addresses are easily accessible. 15

(58) The Authority shall assess the adequacy of the information provided by the Client on the processing of personal data a
      examined on the basis of the following documents: \[…\] prospectus; \[…\] Prospectus (a

      hereinafter referred to as the Data Management Information); \[…\] (Hereinafter: Application Form); \[…\] (hereinafter:
      Business Rules).

(59) According to the Code of Conduct \[…\], the purpose, legal basis and processing of personal data
      detailed rules, the data management rights of the Clients on the website and at the bank branches
      detailed in the data management information provided. The Terms and Conditions expressly a

      no further information on data management in connection with a baby waiting loan
      contain.

(60) The prospectus \[…\] is of a general nature and covers data processing of a general nature carried out by \[…\],
      thus also for the data management performed by the Client in connection with the baby waiting loan - in which

      intends to provide data subjects with information on the aspects of the processing of their personal data.

(61) Section \[…\] of the prospectus sets out the possible processing of data by group members.
      objectives in a general way, such as “interest in a service, requesting a service

      procedure "or" conclusion of a contract, performance of a contract ". Data management is possible
      its legal bases are listed in point \[…\]. The scope of managed data under the title is managed data

      categories are described, for example \[…\].

(62) In Section \[…\], the Data Protection Prospectus describes in a similar way to Prospectus \[…\] the

      the possible purposes of data management, which are detailed in \[…\].

(63) In \[…\], the Customer defines the processed data for data management purposes, their

      "Types", the legal basis for the processing and the retention period uniformly for all \[…\]
      in connection with the service. This means that the prospectus is not broken down into individual financials
      products separately, e.g. mortgage loan, personal loan, baby waiting loan, family

      home creation discount, etc. As a result, any personal data or personal information
      data category is listed among the managed data for which you have some type of credit or

      necessary for the performance of the contract by the Client during the provision of a cash loan.

(64) In the Authority's view, the definition of the purpose of data processing alone is' with the Bank
      data processing required for the performance of a contract ”is too broad, not specific, precise and

      final, it is difficult to determine what the aspects of the contract are and
      related data management is included because e.g. \[…\] the provision and provision of the service

      for the customer as a separate data management purpose, although the general meaning of the words, and
      Chapter according to the concept of contract, performance of the contract is nothing more than under contract
      provision of a service to be performed.

(65) In the Authority's view, in order for the data management to be transparent to the Client
      set more specific data management goals, such as the 12th week of pregnancy and

      the purpose of the processing of personal data concerning the expected date of delivery is that the Client sets
      be able to verify the legitimacy of the claim or subsequently verify that the grant is supported

      persons wish to take advantage of the benefits provided for in the Government Decree with regard to their fetus. THE
      Authority does not dispute whether the suspension of repayment or childbirth allowance
      is provided within the contractual relationship during the performance of the contract, but the

      in the absence of a sufficiently specific definition of data management purposes for data subjects
      it is clear why they need to make some of their data available to the Client. 16

(66) In the Authority’s view, the data and categories of data processed in the Data Management Information Sheet \[…\]
      its listing in this way does not meet the requirement of transparency either, since it is there

      approximately all personal information that the Customer has any credit is listed
      or in connection with a loan agreement. As a result, it is difficult for those involved to be convinced
      that the fulfillment of their credit or loan agreement with the Client, certain aspects thereof

      exactly what information they will need to provide. In the present case, for example, a
      Beneficiaries do not have to provide a

      details of their property insurance or details of their property sold to the Client within five years, as
      these data are irrelevant to the credit they use, while, for example, fetal data is one
      they are not relevant in a personal loan agreement. In this regard, the Authority also

      notes that it is not entirely clear exactly what data the Client understands
      fetal data, as the fetus is not yet legal, the 12th week of pregnancy and the

      data on the expected date of delivery are the health data of the mother.

(67) In addition, the Data Protection Information Statement states that the purpose of data processing is to:
      fulfillment of the reporting obligation to the Hungarian State Treasury (hereinafter: MÁK).

      It does not appear from the Data Protection Information that such a reporting obligation is
      When it exists for a customer, it affects what kind of contract stakeholders.

(68) Section 26 of the Government Decree also prescribes the obligation to provide information to the MÁK for control purposes, and
      specifies which of the persons supported or the child born

      must transfer your personal data to the Customer. Defined in the Privacy Policy
      the scope of data does not correspond to the scope of data specified in the Government Decree, e.g. the Data Management
      is not indicated in the prospectus of the identity card of the supported persons, travel

      document or card format driving license number as data to be transmitted \[Gov.
      Section 26 (1) (bd) of the Decree\].

(69) The Application Form must indicate the identity of the applicants for the baby loan, the credit assessment
      necessary personal data, data of the requested loan, statements according to the Government Decree,

      which are necessary to establish the eligibility conditions, and \[…\].

      statements concerning data processing pursuant to Section 9 (2) of the Decree. According to point \[…\]
      and \[consent to the processing of their personal data\]. In the Authority 's view,

      privacy statements should have been separated by the Customer from other contractual
      provisions in the interests of transparency. Furthermore, the wording of point \[…\] is incorrect
      may give the impression to those concerned that their personal data provided on the Application Form

      their legal basis for their management.

(71) In the light of the above, the \[…\] prospectus, the Privacy Notice and the Application Form

      The information provided by the customer on the handling of personal data is not transparent, not sufficiently
      specific and not suitable for the persons concerned to know and see through the personal

      process of handling their data and be aware of exactly which Customer is
      for what purpose and on what legal basis they process their personal data. The Authority finds that

          and in particular to enforce data protection principles. \[Article 83 (2) GDPR
