## English Summary

### Facts

On 23 March 2023, an employee of the controller consulted an extract of the data subject's personal data stored in the Belgian National Register, which refers to the information processing system that records, memorizes and communicates information relating to the identification of Belgian citizens.

After that, the data subjectfiled an access request with the controller, requesting clarification into who accessed their data and for what purpose. Due to not receiving any response regarding the access request, the data subject filed a complaint with the Belgian DPA on 14 June 2023.

On 7 August 2023, the controller replied to the access request, acknowledging that it consulted the National Register records of the data subject and that the processing was performed by a professional with specific authorization. However, due to professional secrecy, the controller could not disclose the professional's identity or assess whether the consultation complied with legal and ethical obligations.

### Holding

The Belgian DPA stressed that the controller, in its capacity, must comply with a request made by a data subject pursuant to Articles 15 to 22 GDPR, in compliance with the conditions set out in [Article 12 GDPR,](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") and to provide the data subject with information on the measures taken, as soon as possible and in any event within one month of receipt of the request.

Furthermore, the DPA noted that pursuant to [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 24 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_24_GDPR "Article 24 GDPR"), the controller should be able to demonstrate its compliance with the data protection principles.

In light of the facts of the case, considering that the complainant clearly exercised their right to access under [Article 15 GDPR,](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") that on 14 June 2023, the data subject complained to have not received any answer and that the controller only replied on 7 August 2023, the controller exceeded the deadline established in [Article 12(3) and (4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR").

Therefore, the Belgian DPA found the controller to have breached [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") in conjunction with [Article 12(3) and (4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR"), and it mandated the controller to comply with the data subject's access request within 30 days from the notification of the decision. Additionally, the controller was ordered to inform the DPA about the actions taken in response to the decision within the same timeframe.

## Comment

This decision emphasizes the right of access under GDPR, particularly highlighting the obligations of data controllers to provide data subjects with access to their personal data and the importance of complying with data subject rights within a timely manner.

       rights, more specifically the right of access, within 30 days from the date of

       notification of this decision.

 15. The Litigation Chamber takes into consideration the grievance raised by the complainant regarding

       the lack of response from the defendant to its request for access, including the

       precise date was not specified, but whose response was provided by the defendant on August 7

       2023 (see point 7) as well as the recommendations of the SPL dated July 3, 2023 (see point

       5) clearly confirm its exercise, in accordance with Article 15 of the GDPR.

 16. Article 4(7) of the GDPR defines the “data controller” as “the person

       physical or legal entity, public authority, service or other body which, alone or
                                                                                              3
       jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing.

 17. The Litigation Chamber recalls that the data controller must follow up on the request.

       request made pursuant to articles 15 to 22 of the GDPR by the data subject,

       in this case an access request provided for by Article 15 of the GDPR, in compliance with the

       conditions set out in article 12 of the GDPR.4

 18. Under Article 12.1 of the GDPR, it is the responsibility of the data controller to take “

       appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 as well as

       to make any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and Article 34 with regard to

       concerns the processing of the data subject in a concise, transparent manner,

       understandable and easily accessible, in clear and simple terms \[...\]. ".

 19. The Litigation Chamber also emphasizes that it is the responsibility of the data controller

       to provide the data subject with information on the measures taken following a

       request made in application of articles 15 to 22 of the GDPR, as soon as possible and

       in any event within one month of receipt of the request. 5

       Article 12.3 of the GDPR provides that this period may, if necessary, be extended by two months,
                                                                     6
       given the complexity and number of requests. In such a case, the person responsible

       processing informs the data subject of this extension and the reasons for the postponement
                                                                            7
       within one month of receipt of the request.

 20. In the event that the data controller does not respond to the request made

       by the person concerned, he informs him without delay and at the latest within one

 According to Article 4, 2) of the GDPR, “processing” of personal data means “any operation or set of operations
carried out or not using automated processes and applied to personal data or sets of data, such as
that the collection, recording, organization, structuring, conservation, adaptation or modification, extraction, consultation,
use, communication by transmission, broadcasting or any other form of making available, rapprochement or interconnection,

6GDPR, art. 12.2 and 12.3.
7GDPR, art. 12.3.
 GDPR, art. 12.3. Decision 11/2024 — 5/8

       to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and lodge an appeal

       jurisdictional.

 21. In addition, the Chamber also recalls that in its capacity as data controller, the party

       defendant is required to respect the principles of data protection and must be in

       able to demonstrate that these are respected. It must also implement

       all measures necessary for this purpose (principle of liability – articles 5.2 and 24 of the

       GDPR).

                                                                           9
 22. Finally, the Litigation Chamber recalls that the right of access is one of the requirements

       major aspects of the right to data protection, it constitutes the “entrance door” which allows

       the exercise of other rights that the GDPR confers on the data subject, such as the right to

       rectification, the right to restriction of processing or the right to erasure.

 23. Under the terms of article 15.3 of the GDPR, the person concerned also has the right to obtain a

       copy of the personal data which is the subject of the processing. Article 15.4 of

       GDPR provides that this right to copy cannot infringe the rights and freedoms of others.

 24. On the basis of the documents supporting the complaint, the Litigation Chamber finds that the complainant

       has effectively exercised his right of access, in accordance with article 15.1 of the GDPR (see points

       5, 6, 7, 15). SPL recommendations dated July 3, 2023, combined with the response

       of the defendant dated August 7, 2023, clearly confirm the exercise of this right. There

       Litigation Chamber adds that the defendant indicated, in its letter of August 7

       2023, that the “..” of the Order to which this professional concerned depends will carry out

       verifications and will communicate the results resulting from these verifications. Bedroom

       Contentious note that the complainant submitted his complaint to the APD on September 29, 2023,

       thus exceeding the response times allocated to the data controller under the

       articles 12.3 and 12.4 of the GDPR. Finally, the Litigation Chamber emphasizes that if the party

       defendant had fully complied with the requirements set out in Article 12 of the GDPR, it

       would have taken into account the request for access by communicating the aforementioned assessment (see

       point 8).This approach would have potentially avoided the complainant having to initiate a procedure

       in front of the ODA.

 25. Following the above-mentioned analysis, the Litigation Chamber considers that the party

       defendant could have committed a violation of the following provisions: article 15 of the

8GDPR, art. 12.4.
9Under the terms of this article 15, the data subject has the right to obtain from the data controller confirmation that the data to be
personal nature concerning them are or are not processed and, when they are, access to said personal data as well as
that the following information (article 15.1. of the GDPR): the purposes of the processing (a), the categories of personal data (b), the
recipients or categories of recipients of the data (c), the retention period (d), information relating to other rights that
confers the GDPR (e), the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority (f), any information relating to the source
data when this has not been collected from the person concerned (g) and the existence of automated decision-making
(h). Article 15.2 of the GDPR provides that if the data is transferred to a third country or an international organization, the person
concerned has the right to be informed of the appropriate guarantees regarding this transfer, in accordance with Article 46 of the GDPR. Article 15.3.
of the GDPR provides that the data controller must provide a copy of the personal data subject to processing. He
may charge a reasonable fee for additional copies. If the data subject makes their request electronically, the
Information must be provided in a standard electronic form, unless the individual requests otherwise. Decision 11/2024 — 6/8

       GDPR, combined with articles 12.3 and 12.4 of the GDPR; what justifies making a decision

       prima facie by the Litigation Chamber which is as follows: under article

       58.2.c) of the GDPR and article 95, §1, 5° of the LCA, to order the defendant to

       comply with the complainant’s request to exercise their right of access.

 26. This decision is a prima facie decision taken by the Litigation Chamber

       in accordance with article 95 of the LCA on the basis of the complaint lodged by the complainant,

       as part of the “procedure prior to the substantive decision” and does not constitute a

       decision on the merits of the Litigation Chamber within the meaning of article 100 of the LCA.

 27. The purpose of this decision is to inform the defendant, presumed responsible

       of the processing, due to the fact that it may have committed a violation of the provisions of the GDPR,

       in order to enable it to still comply with the aforementioned provisions.

 28. If, however, the defendant party does not agree with the content of this

       prima facie decision and considers that it can put forward factual arguments and/or

       legal issues which could lead to another decision, it may address to the Chamber

       Litigation a request for processing on the merits of the case via the email address

       litigationchamber@apd-gba.be, within 30 days after notification of the

       this prima facie decision. If applicable, the execution of this decision is

       suspended for the aforementioned period.

 29. In the event of continued processing of the case on the merits, under Articles 98, 2° and 3°

       juncto article 99 of the LCA, the Litigation Chamber will invite the parties to introduce their

       conclusions and attach to the file all the documents they consider useful. If applicable, the

       This decision is permanently suspended.

 30. With a view to transparency, the Litigation Chamber finally emphasizes that a

       treatment of the case on the merits may lead to the imposition of the measures mentioned in

       section 100 of the LCA .11

 31. Finally, the Litigation Chamber further draws attention to the following:

1Section 3, Subsection 2 of the LCA (articles 94 to 97 inclusive).
1Art. 100. § 1. The litigation chamber has the power to

 1° close the complaint without further action;

       If one of the two parties wishes to use the possibility of consulting and copying the file

       (article 95, § 2, 3° of the LCA), it must contact the secretariat of the Litigation Chamber,

       Contentious, this decision is published on the website of the Protection Authority

       Datas. However, it is not necessary for this purpose that the identification data

       parts are directly communicated.
