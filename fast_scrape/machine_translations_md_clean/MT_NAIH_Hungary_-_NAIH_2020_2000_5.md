As a result of the above, the Debtor amended the data management prospectus, but did not substantially change its previous practice, which is also supported by the complaint received on 2 January 2020. The data management prospectus does not clearly contain the legal basis for data management, the rules for sending newsletters and data retention are unclear and the Authority's previous decisions detailed above are not taken into account, there are no clear guidelines for the exercise of data subjects' rights, the designated data protection register does not exist since 25 May 2018 and there is no information on redress Therefore, in order to clarify this, it was necessary to contact the Debtor.

The Debtor has attached the data management information also available on the Website (...............................) 3. Name, email address, IP address, phone number and password information are provided voluntarily by users in order for the service to work.4.

There are no actual newsletters and it has not been for years.2. The Debtor shall not transfer personal data to third parties in connection with advertising or otherwise.3.

III.
Decision
1.	False information in the privacy statement The privacy statement still contains provisions on the sending of newsletters. 

In contrast, there is no evidence to refute the Debtor's statement that the Authority has complied with its previous calls for newsletters and has not sent newsletters. However, this was not reflected in the data management prospectus, thus misleading data subjects about the data subject, as if he were currently conducting data processing for newsletter purposes. personal information. However, this was not reflected in the data management information sheet, thus providing misleading information to data subjects about the retention of data and its possible transfer to a third party. The data controller informs data subjects that the data management has been registered in the data protection register. As of 25 May 2018, the Authority no longer maintains a data protection register under the General Data Protection Regulation, so this information is untrue and misleading. Under Article 30 of the General Data Protection Regulation, from 25 May 2018 .This is without prejudice to the obligation to provide information in a concise, transparent, comprehensible and easily accessible form, in a clear and comprehensible form, in accordance with Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation and Article 5 (1) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation. the principle of lawful and transparent data management, as the Obligated False is contradictory information to the data subjects, so that the data subjects can reasonably understand the essence of the data processing on this basis.

2.	Unclear indication of the legal basis for the data processing in the data management information

The text of the information notice requires both the necessity to provide the SMS service (Article 6 (1) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation) and the data subject's consent The refusal or revocation of consent to the processing of personal data shall not have any adverse consequences for the data subject. data processing is in fact a condition for the provision of the service - there can be no valid legal basis. Particular account should be taken of Article 7 (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation. Without the management of a mobile phone number, it is technically impossible to provide the service and the management of the email address and password for identification purposes is necessary to establish entitlement to the service, thus excluding the data subject's consent. ) may be raised. Any other type of personal data or the processing of the above type of personal data for other purposes may only be based on the data subject's consent if the provision of the service is clearly not subject to consent and can be provided separately or withdrawn at any time without adverse consequences. An important condition for the validity of the consent is that it is given by the data subject on the basis of appropriate information, which in this case is given in Annex III.1 above. Due to the above, the legal basis of the data processing, which violates Articles 6 (1) and 7 (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation, has not been clarified on the basis of the data management information related to the Website.
3.	Lack of information on data subjects' rights in the data management information 

The exact manner of exercising the data subject's rights, in particular the right of cancellation, cannot be determined from the data subject's data management information, in particular the description of the possibility of deletion within the account is missing. At the request of the Authority, the Debtor presented several options that could not be found in the information provided to the data subjects or not in the form of the Debtor's declarations. the obligation to provide clear and comprehensible information and the obligation of the controller under Article 12 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation to assist the controller in complying with Articles 15 to 22. exercise of their rights under this Article.
4.	Lack of information on the data subject's rights of appeal in the data management information sheet 
The data subject's data management information sheet does not include the right of data subjects to apply to the Authority or a court in order to enforce their rights, or the contact details of the Authority. This leads to a lack of information under Article 13 (2) (d) and Article 12 (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation, which infringes these provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation as well as Article 12 (1) 5. Summary of the main issues to be improved in the data management information document (i) The parts concerning unrealistic data processing activities should be deleted from the data management information document (newsletter, data retention in accordance with point 10 of the information document, data transfer). The processing of each type of personal data for each purpose must be based on one of the legal bases listed exhaustively in Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, which must be clearly indicated in the data protection prospectus. concise but informative information must be provided, as the right to delete and access can be exercised both in the account settings in person and by e-mail addressed to the Debtor, but this cannot be stated from the examined data management information. (v) Provide adequate information on the data subject's rights of appeal under Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (possibility and means of recourse to the Authority or a court) .IV. Legal consequences Due to the above, the Authority decided in accordance with the operative part pursuant to Article 58 (2) (d) of the General Data Protection Regulation. However, the Authority examined of its own motion whether it was justified to impose a data protection fine on the Applicant. On the question of whether the imposition of a data protection fine is justified, the Authority decided acting in accordance with the discretion based on law, taking into account Infotv.
