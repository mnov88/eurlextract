## English Summary

### Facts

TRIVE CREDIT SPAIN, S.L. (the controller) is a financial company that provides loans, including microloans online. On 19 September 2023, a data subject filed a complaint with the DPA on the grounds that the controller had not responded to their access request.

During the DPA’s investigations, the controller did not prove that it had responded to the access request. Therefore, the DPA ordered the controller in March 2024 to respond to the access request by providing the data requested or denying the request with an explanation. The DPA set a deadline of ten business days to comply with the decision.

The data subject contacted the DPA in July 2024, stating that the controller had not complied with the decision. The DPA then sent two requests to the controller to comply within five and ten business days respectively. The DPA began sanctioning proceedings in December 2024, as the controller had not responded to the access request or presented an appeal of the DPA’s decision to a court.

The controller argued that the data subject had abused their rights under the GDPR. According to the controller, it had already processed the data subject’s erasure request in January 2023. In addition, the controller argued that the access request was part of a “confrontation strategy” intended to harm the company; this included two lawsuits, 80 phone calls and at least two complaints to the DPA. Finally, the controller argued that it had already responded to three access requests that year.

### Holding

The DPA found a violation of [Article 58(2)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2c "Article 58 GDPR"), as the controller had not complied with its previous decision to respond to the data subject’s access request. The DPA warned the controller that it had the proactive responsibility of proving its compliance with the GDPR in accordance with [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR"); this extends to the entire “life cycle” of data processing.

The DPA considered this a serious violation, as the controller failed to prove it had complied with its obligations under the GDPR. In addition, the controller had not complied with the DPA’s decision. This prevented the DPA from exercising one of its primary functions of enforcing the GDPR. The DPA also took into account the duration of the violation, since the violation had taken place almost a year since the sanctioning proceedings started. Finally, the DPA took into account that the violation affected one data subject.

The fine was initially set at €225,000 but pursuant to Law 39/2015, a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the DPA informed the controller that it may make a voluntary payment of the proposed fine and waive their right to appeal. This action reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to make a voluntary payment and reduced the fine by 20%, paying the reduced sanction amount of €180,000. In addition, the DPA ordered the controller to respond to the access request.

## Comment

The DPA did not comment on whether the data subject's data requests or other interactions with the controller were excessive within the meaning of [Article 12(5) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#5 "Article 12 GDPR").

File No.: EXP202415922

PROPOSED RESOLUTION FOR SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

From the procedure initiated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following:

BACKGROUND

FIRST: On March 12, 2024, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency issued a resolution in the procedure for the exercise of rights in file number EXP202315972 against TRIVE CREDIT SPAIN, S.L. (hereinafter, TRIVE).

In this procedure, it is established that the complainant exercised the right to access their personal data, but this request was not duly addressed.

A resolution was issued requiring the following:

"FIRST: ACCEPT the claim filed by A.A.A., considering that the provisions of Article 15 of the GDPR have been violated, and urge TRIVE CREDIT SPAIN, S.L., with Tax Identification Number (NIF) B87258091, to, within ten business days of this resolution becoming final and enforceable, send the complainant a certificate stating that the right of access exercised is upheld or that it is denied, stating the reasons why the request should not be addressed, in accordance with the provisions of this resolution. The actions taken

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 2/23

As a result of this Resolution, they must be communicated to this
Agency within the same period. Failure to comply with this resolution could result in
a violation of Article 83.6 of the GDPR, classified as very serious for

the purposes of the statute of limitations in Article 72.1.m) of the LOPDGDD, which will be sanctioned,
in accordance with Article 58.2 of the GDPR.

SECOND: The notification of the resolution of the rights exercise procedure, in which TRIVE was granted a period of ten business days to address the exercise of the right of access, was carried out in accordance with the regulations established in Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), and was received by the controller on March 12, 2024.

THIRD: After the deadline indicated for the actions required in said resolution had elapsed, and after the complainant submitted a letter dated July 19, 2024, with entry registration number REGAGE24e00055044978, stating that the resolution had not been complied with, TRIVE was sent twice a request to forward the request within five business days. The complaining party must certify compliance with said resolution and, within ten business days, notify this

Agency of the measures taken.

FOURTH: The aforementioned request for information was notified on both occasions
in accordance with the rules established in the LPACAP and was received by TRIVE on
August 23 and October 1, 2024, as recorded in the acknowledgments of receipt

in the file.

FIFTH: After the deadline for the initial resolution and subsequent
requests has elapsed, TRIVE has not sent a response to this Agency certifying that it has
fulfilled the right of access exercised or that it has denied it with reasons
for why the request should not be addressed.

SIXTH: No ordinary appeal may be filed against the aforementioned resolution through administrative channels
due to the expiration of the established deadlines. Furthermore, the interested party has not expressed its intention to file an administrative appeal, nor is this Agency aware that one has been filed and that a precautionary suspension of the resolution has been requested.

SEVENTH: According to the report collected from the AXESOR tool, TRIVE CREDIT SPAIN, S.L. is a large company established in 2015 and with a turnover of €102,729,479 in 2022.

EIGHTH: On December 2, 2024, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against TRIVE for the alleged violation of Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), as defined in Article 83.6 of the GDPR.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 3/23

NINTH: The aforementioned initiation agreement was notified to TRIVE, in accordance with the regulations
established in the LPACAP, on December 3, 2024, as recorded in the acknowledgment of receipt included in the file.

TENTH: On December 18, 2024, with entry registration number

REGAGE24e00094613605, TRIVE submitted a written statement of objections to the initiation agreement, in which it states the following:

TRIVE claims that, with regard to data protection, it has a data protection officer and has contracted the firm \*\*\*EMPRESA.1, “which assists it in performing general auditing and support activities, such as receiving notifications from any consumer agency or government, state, or regional entity” and “has implemented the following protocols and procedures to ensure compliance with data protection regulations: (i) the Data Breach Procedure, (ii) the Data Subjects' Rights Management Procedure, (iii) the Privacy Procedure, and (iv) the Standard Contractual Clauses to Ensure Compliance with GDPR.”

TRIVE notes that "As evidenced by Trive's latest 2023 annual accounts, audited by \*\*\*COMPANY.2, my client's business has decreased compared
to fiscal year 2022. In 2023, net revenue decreased
to €96,785,401.35, and profit for the year decreased from €10,025,095 in 2022 to €1,122,703.85 in 2023."

TRIVE states that “The Complainant is a former Trive client who has initiated a legal battle against my client. The complaint filed with the AEPD (Spanish Data Protection Agency) that led to this case is part of their confrontational strategy, which has materialized in two lawsuits, 80 phone calls, and at least two complaints to the AEPD. All of this, as the Complainant acknowledges, was “duly advised” and intended to harm Trive.

(…) On January 28, 2023, A.A.A. exercised the right to delete “its data on mykredit, including the indefinite closure of the account.” Trive processed this exercise of right on February 8, 2023, proceeding to block its data in compliance with Article 32 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on Data Protection. Personal Data Protection Act and Guarantee of Digital Rights
(“LOPDPGDD”).

From that date onward, all unblocked data processed by Trive refers,
essentially and primarily, to data provided by the Claimant through

phone calls made by him or her.”

TRIVE refers to an “abuse of the right of a.A.A..”

“After the formalization of the last of the Loans, the Claimant began requesting

that my client declare the Loans null and void, which ultimately
and for the purposes of this matter, led to the filing of two lawsuits in 2023, which have given rise to the ordinary proceedings
\*\*\*PROCEDURE.1 and \*\*\*PROCEDURE.2, currently underway (the
“Legal Proceedings”).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 4/23

Simultaneously, the Claimant began making phone calls and exercising
access rights against Trive.”

TRIVE states that "Regarding the access rights exercised by the Complainant, in 2023 alone, up to three requests were made, which were duly responded to by Trive (at the same time as the calls in which Trive operators reminded the A.A.A. that he had requested his right to erasure in January 2023).

Regarding the right of access of August 10, 2023 (the basis of the A.A.A.'s claim that gave rise to this case), the truth is that this request was also responded to. Indeed, as evidenced by the emails provided, what really happened is the following:

A few days earlier, on July 24, 2023, the Complainant requested a copy of the Loans. And this documentation was provided to him on up to two occasions, the last time on August 10, 2023, at 4:09 PM (all This, of course, takes into account that, on January 28, 2023, he had previously exercised his right to erasure, which could not be ignored.

And what A.A.A. did at that point was send a new email on the same
August 10, 2023, but only 4 minutes later (at 4:13 PM) and in a
different email chain, in which it once again requested exactly the same thing
(i.e., what had already been requested and granted).

Emails were exchanged in the following days, always regarding the first chain, in which the Claimant was explained that all available Loans had been provided.

Apparently, A.A.A. only referred in its claim to one of those
August 10, 2023, emails, without mentioning all the other events that occurred.

TRIVE refers to the “confusion generated by two practically identical procedures.” In this regard, TRIVE states that “As evidenced in the file, while the Judicial Proceedings were being

conducted, A.A.A. filed its complaint with the AEPD on September 19, 2023,” which “gave rise to this sanctioning procedure
No. 202315972 (the “Procedure 1.0”).

Independently of Procedure 1.0, and to the best of this party's knowledge, the

Complainant filed at least one more complaint with the AEPD on July 19, 2024. On that occasion, the A.A.A. He reported that, in relation to another of the 80 calls made, his right to access the data processed by Trive had not been honored, which led the AEPD to initiate the exercise of rights procedure No. 202413243 (the "Procedure 2.0").

Procedure 1.0 and Procedure 2.0 involve very similar exercises of rights, refer to the same data subject, and overlapped in time. Furthermore, this Agency sent virtually identical requests for information to Trive.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 5/23

(…) The similarity between the procedures, their temporal coincidence, and the anomalous belligerence displayed by A.A.A. And the fact that this was the first time

Trive was involved in a process of this nature in its nearly 10 years of corporate existence caused Trive to confuse both cases and mistakenly believe that only one was being processed.

Now, and this is illustrative, note that the chaos generated by the A.A.A. not only confused Trive but has also affected the Agency itself. Indeed, the

Initiation Agreement states the following:

Its Third Fact states that "after the expiration of the period indicated for the
performance of the actions required in said resolution, and after the complaining party submitted, dated July 19, 2024, with entry registration number

REGAGE24e00055044978, a letter stating that the resolution had not been complied with, Trive was sent a notice twice."

However, July 19, 2024, was the date on which A.A.A. filed the claim that triggered the initiation of Procedure 2.0, and not this file.

Its Fourth Fact states that "the aforementioned request for information was notified on both occasions in accordance with the rules established in the LPACAP and was received by TRIVE on August 23 and October 1, 2024, as recorded in the acknowledgments in the file."

However, no notification of Procedure 1.0 was made in October 2024. On that date, the only notification that took place was the one regarding the transfer of the claim and request for information under Procedure 2.0, which was responded to by Trive.

In short, it is an objective fact that the A.A.A.'s actions caused general confusion, which led Trive in particular to commit an unintentional error."

Regarding the Agreement initiating this sanctioning procedure, TRIVE states that it "analyzes Trive's lack of response to the resolutions issued in Procedure 1.0 (therefore excluding the request to which Trive did respond and which is the subject of Procedure 2.0)."

TRIVE considers that “(i) the possible imposition of a sanction would not be in accordance with the law, and, alternatively, (ii) the proposed sanction amount does not respect the principle of proportionality.”

TRIVE states that no sanction should be imposed, based on the alleged “absence of intent or negligence in Trive’s actions” and the alleged “concurrence of bad faith and abuse of rights in the conduct of A.A.A.”

Referring to Article 28.1 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector, Article 83.2.b) of the GDPR, the Supreme Court Judgment of February 27, 2012 (rec. 747/2009), and the resolutions of this Agency in case number PS/00313/2023, PS/00269/2017 and

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 6/23

PS/00315/2012, TRIVE concludes that "Trive's conduct does not meet the minimum standard of culpability required for the imposition of a sanction because:

(a) The anomalous and abusive conduct described gave rise to two proceedings before the AEPD
that were practically identical and overlapped in time. This chaos generated
by the AEPD caused Trive to make an inadvertent error when it failed to respond to the AEPD. Trive was not aware until the Initiation Agreement that, in fact, Procedure 1.0 and Procedure 2.0 were procedures that referred to different claims (although, strictly speaking, they are essentially the same). This led Trive to the false belief

that by responding to the Agency's last request, it was responding
to all of A.A.A.'s claims.

(b) Procedure 1.0 and Procedure 2.0 are the only data protection claims directed against Trive.

(c) Procedure 1.0 and Procedure 2.0 are based on 80 telephone calls made by A.A.A., between July 2023 and the date of submission of this document,
for the sole purpose of learning the status of its own claims, which are also the subject of the Legal Proceedings. That is, the purpose of the calls is to obtain information already held by A.A.A.

(d) A.A.A.'s actions confirm that the Complainant's purpose is neither serious nor legitimate. In fact, when the requested information was provided, the Complainant himself acknowledged that he had no real interest in what was asked over the phone.

Furthermore, a review of Trive's efforts in the area of data protection provides good evidence that there was no negligence (much less willful misconduct). (…)

As the AEPD itself indicated in its Resolution of January 25, 2024 (file PS/00313/2023), "Opinion 3/2010 of the Article 29 Working Party, issued during the repealed Directive 95/46/EEC, but whose reflections are currently applicable, states that the essence of proactive responsibility is the controller's obligation to implement measures that, under normal circumstances, ensure that data protection rules are complied with in the context of processing operations."

As demonstrated in Procedure 2.0, in responding to the request made by the AEPD, Trive issued internal guidelines to its call center operators to modify their responses to similar situations, training them on data protection matters. This training is in addition to the existing protocols, guidelines, and guides, and predates the Initiation Agreement.

The foregoing demonstrates the absence of intent or negligence in Trive's conduct. Without the necessary element of negligence, the commission of an administrative offense should not be established.

Regarding the complainant's conduct, TRIVE recalls that "good faith is a general principle of our law that must guide the actions of the

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 7/23

Administration and, also, govern the exercise of all types of rights by individuals (...)." Consequently, an unfair exercise of the right to access personal data does not merit protection. Malicious attempts to exploit the Agency for the benefit of private interests must be rejected. As stated in the National Court's ruling of April 1, 2011 (rec: 222/2010), TRIVE mentions the resolutions of this Agency, including those in cases A/00489/2016, PS/00425/2012, and E/03306/2011, and recalls "the Guidelines 01/2022 on the rights of data subjects — Right of access, version 2.1, adopted on March 28, 2023, according to which we are faced with an "excessive" request when a claim is filed seeking to obtain a benefit (in this case, in Judicial Proceedings) or when that claim is used to cause harm to the respondent (as expressly sought by the A.A.A.).

(…) In light of all the above, it is clear that Procedure 1.0 stems from the Complainant's unjustifiable abuse. (…)

That said, we are aware that the Initiation Agreement was issued specifically due to Trive's lack of response. However, as explained, this position was not deliberate, but rather a further consequence of the Complainant's abusive conduct. Therefore, we are challenging the sanction because, beyond the lack of intent, the imposition of a fine would be the culmination of a dishonest strategy, which should never be accepted in our society.

Not surprisingly, malicious, excessive, or abusive actions should never be
supported, nor should their intended purposes be allowed to be achieved,
as they violate the general principles of our legal system.

Therefore, in line with the aforementioned resolutions, in accordance with the principle of good faith,

in compliance with the provisions of Guidelines 01/2022 and regardless of whether
there is no intent or negligence, the appropriate course of action is to close the proceedings without imposing
any sanction.

Alternatively, TRIVE states that, "in the event that this Agency
considers that, despite all the above, the imposition of a

sanction is appropriate, the reasons why the quantification of the
Initiation Agreement is disproportionate are detailed below."

TRIVE states that "The principle of proportionality is an essential guarantee of the sanctioning procedures regulated in Article 29 of Law 40/2015," a precept

"aligned with recitals 4 and 129 of the GDPR," and cites the Supreme Court ruling of May 29, 2019 (rec. 1857/2018). From this, TRIVE concludes that it is necessary to "relate the factual background to the grading criteria established in (i) Article 29 of Law 40/2015, (ii) Article 83.2 of the GDPR, and (iii)
Article 76.2 of the LOPDPGDD."

TRIVE considers that "The concurrent circumstances do not justify the fine established
in the Initiation Agreement, as they do not take into account," it says, the nature, severity, and
duration of the violation, the confusion generated by the claimant, the very

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 8/23

limited scope (a single victim), the absence of intentionality and damages, the absence
of prior violations, TRIVE's compliance culture, and the lack of economic sense.

Specifically, TRIVE once again points out that "In 2023, Trive's net turnover in 2023 was €96,785,401 (lower than in 2022). Furthermore, as this Agency is well aware, this figure only reflects the income obtained by the entity, but not the remainder left to the company after subtracting all its liabilities and applicable taxes (the "Business Result").

This Agency has considered Business Result on several occasions to determine the amount of administrative fines, and frequently issues resolutions that compile and compare revenue and Business Result to determine the penalty (see, for example, the Resolution of March 28, 2023 (file PS/458/2022)).

Well, in this case, in 2023, the Trive's business profit was €1,122,703. Therefore, if a fine of €450,000 were imposed, that amount would represent almost half (40%) of Trive's total profits last year, which would constitute a completely disproportionate and unaffordable burden for the entity, even jeopardizing the economic viability of the business.

In conclusion, considering all the circumstances, it is unquestionable that the proposed fine of €450,000 is excessive and disproportionate.

TRIVE states that "if the imposition of a fine is upheld, it should be limited to a warning. This is the alternative that this same AEPD has used to resolve identical cases, in which the same violation was analyzed (under Article 83.6 of the GDPR, for not responding to the Agency)." TRIVE cites as examples the
resolutions of this Agency in proceedings PS/00123/2022, PS/00619/2022,

PS/00131/2022, and PS/00175/2021. TRIVE adds that "the same warning sanction has been imposed by this Agency on other private companies in other cases of very serious violations, such as that of Article 83.5 GDPR,"
citing as examples the resolutions of this Agency in proceedings
PA/00061/2023, PA/00053/2023, PA/00049/2023, PS/00299/2021, PS/00104/2019, and
PS/00224/2019.

Based on the above, TRIVE states that "the sanction in this case should be limited to a warning at most. This is even more so considering that Procedure 2.0 is still underway, and is the appropriate forum to, if the AEPD deems it appropriate, respond to the Complainant's right of access, providing in a timely manner any information or documentation that this supervisory authority deems appropriate.

Failing this, when the AEPD has deviated from this criterion and imposed a financial fine, a review of available precedents shows that the figures are very different from those included in the Initiation Agreement. The following cases serve as examples: EXP202409927, EXP202400496, EXP202318252, PS/00530/2023, and EXP202208873.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 9/23

TRIVE states that "Additional evidence that we are dealing with a proposed excessive sanction is that, when financial fines have been imposed for very serious violations on corporate groups much larger than Trive, the amounts have always been significantly internal." As an example, it cites the Agency's resolutions in proceedings PS/00339/2023, PS/00281/2022, PS/00635/2022, PS/00259/2020, and PS/00351/2019.

In TRIVE's opinion, "All of these resolutions or precedents are useful for resolving this case. If it is considered (contrary to the respectful opinion of my client) that a financial penalty should be imposed on Trive, the Agency should adopt a coherent, predictable, and uniform approach to ensure the proportionality of the measures imposed and respect the principle of legal certainty. And the above cases confirm that the AEPD has imposed significantly lower sanctions (i) in identical cases (violation of Article 83.6 of the GDPR), (ii) in similar cases (violation of Article 83.5 of the GDPR), and even (iii) in cases where the respondent party was a corporate group whose business volume is vastly greater than Trive's.

In conclusion, if the AEPD considers that Trive's conduct should be subject to a fine, the amount should be significantly reduced, but in no case exceed the limit. the

€1,000.”

For all the above, TRIVE requests:

Primarily: The closing of the aforementioned disciplinary proceedings without the

imposition of a financial penalty, in view of (i) the absence in Trive's actions of the necessary element of culpability for the commission of an administrative infraction to be established, and (ii) the abusive conduct of the Complainant.

Alternatively: If, despite all the above, the conduct is considered punishable, Trive be warned for the commission of an infraction, without imposing any financial penalty.

Alternatively to the two previous requests: If, despite all the above, the conduct is considered punishable by a financial penalty, its amount be substantially reduced to the maximum possible, under the terms

indicated in this document, in accordance with the principles of proportionality and legal certainty.

FURTHERMORE: Attached to this document is (i) the letter signed by \*\*\*COMPANY.1
certifying Trive's diligence in data protection matters, (ii) the CCAA

audited by Trive in 2023, and (iii) a set of exchanged communications that illustrate what happened. Due to the technical limitations of this Agency's website, we have not been able to provide the recordings of the telephone conversations
or all the documentation referred to in this document. However,
this party expresses its full willingness to provide, at the request of the AEPD,

whatever the Agency deems necessary or appropriate and in the format it deems appropriate.

TWELFTH: A list of documents included in the procedure is attached as an annex.

From the actions taken in this procedure and from the documentation included in the file, the following have been established:

PROVEN FACTS

FIRST: The resolution of the procedure for the exercise of rights and the requirements for compliance with the measures imposed therein, as indicated

in the first, second, third, and fourth background information, were notified, in accordance
with the provisions of the LPACAP. This resolution became final and enforceable due to the passage of the deadlines provided for filing the appeals indicated therein.

SECOND: TRIVE did not send any response to this Agency certifying compliance with the resolution.

LEGAL BASIS

I
Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR) and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

II
Procedure

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions

of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary manner, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

In accordance with Article 64 of the LOPDGDD, and taking into account the

characteristics of the alleged infringement, a sanctioning procedure is initiated.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 11/23

The procedure will last a maximum of twelve months from the date
of the initiation agreement. After this period, the procedure will expire and, consequently, the proceedings will be archived, in accordance with the provisions of

Article 64 of the LOPDGDD.

III
Objections to the initiation agreement

In response to the objections presented by TRIVE, the following should be noted.

In the resolution of the rights exercise procedure for file number
EXP202315972, TRIVE was required to send the complaining party a certification
acknowledging the exercised right of access or denying it with reasons.
Furthermore, the actions taken as a result of this resolution must

be reported to this Agency. This sanctioning procedure is based on
non-compliance with this order.

Any reason for disagreement with the purpose of this procedure, that is, the response to the exercise of a right granted by the GDPR to data subjects regarding their personal data, could and should have been raised at the appropriate procedural time, that is, during the processing of said procedure, when the data subject was given the opportunity to present all allegations he or she considered relevant. Likewise, the challenge to the final resolution of said procedure, which included the now unfulfilled order, could and should have been made by exercising the right to file the appropriate appeals within the period established by the regulations and reported in the resolution itself. At the present time, the resolution is final and enforceable and must be complied with on its own terms, and allegations seeking its review cannot be admitted. The purpose of this sanctioning procedure is non-compliance with a final resolution of the supervisory authority. Regarding the culpability requirement for the imposition of an administrative sanction based on the violations contained in sections 4 to 6 of Article 83 of the GDPR, the principle of liability provided for in Article 28.1 of Law 40/2015, of October 1, on the Legal Regime of the Public Sector, certainly provides that: "Only natural and legal persons, as well as, when a law recognizes their capacity to act, affected groups, unions and entities without legal personality, and independent or autonomous assets, who are found liable for such acts due to intent or negligence, may be sanctioned for acts constituting an administrative violation."

However, according to the ruling in Supreme Court Judgment 7887/2011 of November 24, 2011,
Rec. 258/2009, "(...) since its ruling 76/1990, of April 26, the Constitutional Court has declared that strict liability or liability without fault does not apply to administrative sanctions. This doctrine is reaffirmed in ruling 164/2005, of June 20, 2005, which excludes the possibility of imposing sanctions for the mere result, without proving even a minimum of culpability, even on the grounds of mere negligence. However, the method of attributing liability to legal entities does not correspond to the intentional or reckless forms of culpability that are attributable to human conduct."

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 12/23

Thus, in the case of violations committed by legal entities, although the element of culpability must be present (see the judgment of this Chamber of the

Supreme Court of November 20, 2011 (appeal in cassation in the interest of law
48/2007), it is necessarily applied differently than it is with respect to
natural persons. According to STC 246/1991, "(...) this different construction of the
imputability of the authorship of the violation to the legal entity arises from the very
nature of the legal fiction to which these subjects respond. They lack the
voluntary element in the strict sense, but not the capacity to violate the rules to which

they are subject. Capacity to violate and, therefore, direct blameworthiness which
derives from the legal right protected by the rule being violated and the need for
such protection to be truly effective, and from the risk that, consequently, must be assumed by the legal entity that is subject to compliance with said rule."

To the foregoing, it should be added, following the judgment of January 23, 1998,
partially transcribed in STS 6262/2009, of October 9, 2009, Rec 5285/2005,
and STS 6336/2009, of October 23, 2009, Rec 1067/2006, that "although the
culpability of the conduct must also be subject to proof, it must be considered,
in order to assume the corresponding burden, that ordinarily the volitional and cognitive elements necessary to assess it are part of the typical proven conduct, and that their exclusion requires proof of the absence of such elements, or in its regulatory aspect, that the due diligence required by the party alleging its absence has been exercised; in short, the invocation of the absence of fault is not sufficient to exonerate itself in the face of typically unlawful conduct."

Furthermore, it should be reiterated that the file contains acknowledgments of receipt by TRIVE of both the resolution of the procedure for the exercise of rights and of two requests for compliance with it, without this Agency having received a response to these notifications before the initiation of this sanctioning procedure, therefore, the lack of fault is dismissed.

Regarding TRIVE's "culture of compliance" with data protection regulations, note is taken of the provisions of Article 5.2 of the GDPR, which establishes the principle of proactive accountability when it states that "The data controller shall be responsible for compliance with the provisions of paragraph 1 and capable of demonstrating such compliance." This principle refers to the obligation that

the data controller is responsible not only for designing, implementing, and observing the appropriate legal, technical, and organizational measures to ensure that data processing complies with the regulations, but also for remaining actively vigilant throughout the entire processing lifecycle to ensure that compliance is correct, and for being able to demonstrate this. Therefore, what is a legal duty of the data controller cannot be considered as an extenuating circumstance.

Regarding the alleged "confusion generated by two practically identical procedures," it is pertinent to clarify, first of all, that the third fact mentions the document submitted on July 19, 2024, in which the complaining party stated that the resolution of file EXP202315972 had not been complied with. This bears no relation to the complaint filed on the same date by the complaining party, which gave rise to the other file referred to by TRIVE.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 13/23

Secondly, it is reiterated that, as stated in the fourth fact, the file contains the acknowledgments of receipt of the two notifications of the request for compliance with the resolution of case EXP202315972 collected by TRIVE, which were issued prior to the opening of this procedure, granting two new deadlines for the non-compliance with the resolution to be regularized.

Regarding the application required by TRIVE of the principle of proportionality and the grading criteria, it should be noted that these have been taken into account in the Agreement to initiate this sanctioning procedure.

In Legal Basis V of the Agreement to initiate this sanctioning procedure, under the heading of Proposed Sanction, it is indicated that, to ensure a consistent application of the GDPR, the Guidelines are taken into consideration. 04/2022
made by the European Data Protection Board on the calculation of fines under the GDPR.

In this regard, it should be noted that, in the Initiation Agreement, the fine was set based on TRIVE's turnover for the fiscal year 2022, as the latest data available in the AXESOR tool report is based on the latest accounts filed with the Companies Registry. However, based on the 2023 annual accounts submitted by the company, the amount of the fine imposed on TRIVE should be reviewed.

Regarding TRIVE's statement that "if the imposition of a fine is maintained, it should be limited to a warning. This is the alternative that this same AEPD has used to resolve identical cases, in which the same violation was analyzed (under Article 83.6 of the GDPR, for not responding to the Agency)." It should be noted that the resolutions cited by TRIVE refer to sanctioning procedures in which the person under investigation was a public authority. Therefore, in accordance with Article 77 of the LOPDGDD, once the violation was proven, the resolution was declared and, where appropriate, the measures to be adopted to cease the conduct or correct the effects of the violation.

Regarding TRIVE's assertion that "the same warning sanction has been imposed by this Agency on other private companies in other cases of very serious violations, such as Article 83.5 of the GDPR," it is clarified that Article 83 of the GDPR regulates the general conditions for the imposition of administrative fines. Regarding the resolutions that TRIVE provides as examples of warning sanctions, they address warnings for violations of different articles of the GDPR (in none of these cases Article 58.2 of the GDPR) classified in Articles 83.4 or 83.5 of the GDPR. Therefore, these are different cases than the present sanctioning procedure, which analyzes whether a violation of Article 58.2 of the GDPR, classified in Article 83.6 of the GDPR, has been committed.

Regarding TRIVE's assertion that "Additional evidence that we are facing an excessive sanction proposal is that, when financial fines have been imposed for very serious violations on much larger corporate groups than TRIVE, the amounts have always been significantly lower," it is noted that the resolutions cited by TRIVE as examples refer to cases in which the sanctioned party had a high turnover and the violation was classified as a violation under Article 83 of the GDPR. In this regard, it is worth remembering that the final quantification of the fine must be based on a specific assessment carried out in each specific case. The grounds for quantifying the fine in this case are detailed in the proposed sanction. Taking into account all of the above, it is not appropriate to close this sanctioning procedure, nor to issue a warning to TRIVE.
However, in view of the 2023 annual accounts provided by TRIVE and the financial information filed by this company with the Commercial Registry and collected by this Agency through the Axesor tool, it is appropriate to review the amount of the administrative fine set in the Agreement initiating this sanctioning procedure.

IV
Breached Obligation

Based on the facts set forth above, TRIVE is deemed to have breached the resolution

of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

Therefore, the facts described in the "Proven Facts" section are deemed to constitute an infringement, attributable to TRIVE, for violation of Article 58.2.c) of the GDPR, which provides as follows:

"2. Each supervisory authority shall have all of the following corrective powers:
(…)
c) order the controller or processor to respond to requests for the exercise of the data subject's rights under this Regulation;"

V
Classification and classification of the violation

This violation is classified in Article 83.6 of the GDPR, which stipulates the following:

"Failure to comply with the decisions of the supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(2) shall be punishable in accordance with paragraph 2 of this article by administrative fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or, in the case of an undertaking, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the total annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher."

For the purposes of the statute of limitations for violations, the alleged violation expires after three years, in accordance with Article 72.1 of the LOPDGDD, which classifies the following conduct as very serious:

“m) Failure to comply with resolutions issued by the competent data protection authority in the exercise of the powers conferred on it by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 15/23

VI
Proposed Sanction

In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the GDPR must be observed, which state:

“1. Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to this Article for infringements of this Regulation

indicated in paragraphs 4, 9, and 6 are, in each individual case, effective, proportionate, and dissuasive.

2. Administrative fines shall be imposed, depending on the circumstances of each individual case, in addition to or as a substitute for the measures provided for in

Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each case, Each individual case shall take due account of:

a) the nature, gravity, and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them;

b) the intentionality or negligence of the breach;

c) any measures taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects;

d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account any technical or organizational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;

e) any previous breaches committed by the controller or processor;

f) the degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the breach and mitigate any adverse effects of the breach;

g) the categories of personal data affected by the breach;

h) how the supervisory authority became aware of the breach; in particular whether the controller or processor notified the infringement and, if so, to what extent;

i) where the measures referred to in Article 58(2) have been previously ordered against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with those measures;

j) adherence to codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 or to certification mechanisms approved pursuant to Article 42, and

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 16/23

k) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, through the infringement.

For its part, Article 76 "Sanctions and Corrective Measures" of the LOPDGDD
provides:

"1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5, and 6 of Article 83 of Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 shall be applied taking into account the grading criteria

established in section 2 of the aforementioned article.

2. In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,
the following may also be taken into account:

a) The continuous nature of the infringement.

b) The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data.

c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the infringement.

d) The possibility that the affected party's conduct could have led to the commission of the infringement.

e) The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of the infringement, which cannot be be attributed to the acquiring entity.

f) The impact on the rights of minors.

g) Having a data protection officer, when not mandatory.

h) The voluntary submission by the controller or processor to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in cases where there are disputes between them and any interested party.

Furthermore, to ensure consistent application of the GDPR, Guidelines 04/2022 issued by the European Data Protection Board on the calculation of fines under the GDPR must be taken into consideration.

In this case, considering the seriousness of the potential violation, especially considering the consequences its commission has on those affected,

a fine would be imposed, in addition to the adoption of measures, if appropriate.

The fine imposed must be, in each individual case, effective, proportionate,
and dissuasive, in accordance with the provisions of Article 83.1 of the GDPR. To ensure

these principles, TRIVE's turnover is considered as a matter of priority.

Furthermore, the GDPR establishes maximum amounts in Article 83, paragraphs 4 to 6, which
group together several different types of conduct. In this regard, it is taken into account

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 17/23

that the infringement determined in this procedure is classified under Article
83.6 of the GDPR, and therefore falls within the group of more serious infringements that
carry a higher sanction.

Finally, it should be noted, according to the circumstances of the grading of Article
83.2 of the GDPR, which in its section a) considers that due account must be taken of "the nature, gravity, and duration of the breach, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage they have suffered." The following has been assessed:

- First, the gravity of the breach due to its nature, given the interests protected and its place within the framework of personal data protection.
By failing to prove compliance with measures aimed at correcting the effects of a breach or bringing processing into compliance with the law,
an unlawful situation is persisting, in addition to disobeying the corrective powers with which the GDPR provides supervisory authorities so that they can fulfill their primary task: monitoring the application of the GDPR and enforcing it.

- Second, the gravity of the breach due to its duration. The data controller
has been aware of the resolution requiring compliance with an order from this
Agency since March 12, 2024, a resolution that became final and enforceable
one month later. Thus, more than a year has passed since the deadline
granted for compliance with the resolution expired, and during

this time, two compliance requests were also issued by this Agency.

- Notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of data subjects
affected by the violation is also taken into consideration, as it involves a single individual.

Given the circumstances outlined above, for the violation of Article 58.2 of the
GDPR, as defined in Article 83.6 of the GDPR, TRIVE should be imposed an
administrative fine of €225,000.00.

VII
Corrective Measures

If the violation is confirmed, the resolution issued may establish the corrective measures that the offending entity must adopt to end the non-compliance with personal data protection legislation, in this case in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 58.2 d) of the GDPR, according to which each supervisory authority may "order the controller or processor to ensure that the processing operations comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period...".

In such a case, in the resolution adopted, this Agency may order the controller to notify the Agency within ten working days of the adoption of the measures imposed in the resolution of the rights exercise procedure in file number EXP202315972.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 18/23

Please note that failure to comply with the possible order to adopt measures imposed by
this body in the resolution of this sanctioning procedure may be
considered an administrative infraction in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR,

classified as an infraction in its Article 83.6, and such conduct may lead to the
opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.

Please also remember that neither the acknowledgment of the infraction committed nor, where applicable, the voluntary payment of the proposed amounts, exempts you from the obligation to
adopt the relevant measures to cease the conduct or correct the effects of
the infraction committed, nor from the obligation to prove compliance with this
obligation to this AEPD.

In view of the above, the following is issued:

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

SECOND: On June 12, 2025, TRIVE paid the fine
in the amount of €180,000.00, making use of the reduction provided for in the
proposed resolution transcribed above.

THIRD: In the draft resolution transcribed above, the facts constituting an infringement were established, and the Presidency proposed that the controller be required to adopt appropriate measures to bring its actions into compliance with the regulations, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 58.2 d) of the GDPR, according to which each supervisory authority may "order the controller or processor to ensure that processing operations comply with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period...".

LEGAL BASIS

I

Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to resolve this procedure.

Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary manner, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II
Termination of the Procedure

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 21/23

Article 85 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter LPACAP), under the heading "Termination of Sanctioning Procedures" provides the following:

"1. Once a sanctioning procedure has been initiated, if the offender acknowledges responsibility, the procedure may be terminated with the imposition of the appropriate sanction.

2. When the sanction is solely monetary in nature, or when a monetary sanction and a non-monetary sanction may be imposed, but the inadmissibility of the latter has been justified, voluntary payment by the alleged offender, at any time prior to the resolution, will terminate the procedure, except with regard to restoring the altered situation or determining compensation for damages caused by the commission of the violation.

3. In both cases, when the sanction is solely monetary in nature, the competent body to resolve the procedure will apply reductions of at least 20% on the amount of the proposed sanction, and these reductions may be combined.
These reductions must be specified in the notification of initiation of the procedure, and their effectiveness will be conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the sanction.

The percentage reduction provided for in this section may be increased
by regulation."

III

Voluntary Payment

In accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned Article 85 of the LPACAP, the notified draft resolution allowed the company to voluntarily pay the proposed penalty, which would result in a 20% reduction in its amount. With the application of this reduction, the penalty would be set at €180,000.00, and its payment will terminate the proceedings, without prejudice to the imposition of the corresponding measures.

Following the aforementioned draft resolution, and before the resolution was issued by this authority, TRIVE, on June 12, 2025, proceeded to make the voluntary payment, availing itself of the 20% reduction. In accordance with section 3 of Article 85 of the LPACAP, the effectiveness of the aforementioned reduction will be conditional on the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal against the penalty.

Must It should be noted that, in accordance with the provisions of the LPACAP, as well as the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on this matter, the exercise of voluntary payment by the alleged responsible party does not exempt the administration from the obligation to resolve and notify all proceedings, regardless of their form of initiation. Similarly, Article 88 of the aforementioned regulation establishes that the resolution that concludes the procedure will decide all issues raised by the interested parties and any other issues arising from it.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeaepd.gob.es 22/23

Therefore, in accordance with applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for graduating sanctions, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: TO DECLARE the commission of the violations and CONFIRM the sanctions determined in the operative section of the Proposed resolution transcribed in this resolution.

The sum of the aforementioned amounts amounts to a total of €225,000.00.

After TRIVE CREDIT SPAIN, S.L. made a voluntary payment, although without acknowledgment of liability, pursuant to Article 85 of the LPCAP, a 20% reduction is made from the aforementioned total, resulting in the final amount of €180,000.00.

The effectiveness of this reduction is subject, in all cases, to the withdrawal or waiver of any administrative action or appeal.

SECOND: DECLARE the termination of procedure EXP202415922, in accordance with the provisions of Article 85 of the LPACAP.

THIRD: ORDER TRIVE CREDIT SPAIN, S.L. to, within 10 days of this resolution becoming final and enforceable, Notify the Agency of the adoption of the measures described in the legal grounds of the proposed resolution transcribed in this resolution.

FOURTH: NOTIFY this resolution to TRIVE CREDIT SPAIN, S.L.

FIFTH: In accordance with the provisions of Article 85 of the LPACAP, which conditions the reduction for voluntary payment on the withdrawal or waiver of any action or appeal in administrative proceedings, this resolution will be final in administrative proceedings and fully enforceable upon notification.

In accordance with the provisions of Article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this Resolution will be made public once it becomes final in administrative proceedings.

Against this resolution, which ends the administrative proceedings as provided for in Article 114.1.c) of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations, interested parties may file an appeal. An administrative appeal may be lodged before the Administrative Litigation Division of the National Court, in accordance with the provisions of Article 25 and Section 5 of the Fourth Additional Provision of Law 29/1998, of July 13, regulating the Administrative Litigation Jurisdiction, within two months from the day following notification of this action, as provided for in Article 46.1 of the aforementioned Law.

However, pursuant to Article 90.3 a) of the LPACAP (Spanish Civil Code), the final administrative decision may be provisionally suspended if the interested party expresses their intention to lodge an administrative appeal. If this is the case, the interested party must formally notify this fact in writing.
