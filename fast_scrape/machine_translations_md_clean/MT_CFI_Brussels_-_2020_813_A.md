## English Summary

### Facts

GRAYDON wrongly associated Mrs. KAHN’s name with the EGAR company. Consequently, on 31 July 2019, Mrs. KAHN was requested by a bailiff to pay the amount of 537.02 euros on behalf of EGAR as part of the mandatory annual contribution. Mrs. KAHN claimed the existence of a misidentification and challenged the lawfulness of the processing of her personal data. She requested the deletion of all her personal data appearing in GRAYDON’s file.

### Dispute

Does a misidentification of a data subject in connection with a specific company in a register and a request for deletion arising from this data subject necessarily imply that any processing of his/her personal data in this register is unlawful under article 6 GDPR?

### Holding

The Tribunal declared the action admissible and observed that GRAYDON spontaneously deleted Mrs. KAHN's personal data in connection with EGAR. However, the Tribunal stated that the processing of her personal data by GRAYDON in relation to other legal persons is not automatically unlawful. Despite the withdrawal of consent by Mrs. KAHN, GRAYDON may base the processing of personal data on a legitimate interest (Article 6(1) GDPR).
