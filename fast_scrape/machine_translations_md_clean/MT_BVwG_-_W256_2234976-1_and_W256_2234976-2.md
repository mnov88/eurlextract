## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject was marksmen from 2012 until about 2017 and participated in competitions. Controller 1 (first appellant in the present case) operates a website that offered shooting accessories and lessons. Controller 2 (second appellant in the present case) also operates a website where they added blogposts concerning these competitions and offered shooting lessons including advertisement for a company.

Several reports by the two controllers, published on their respective websites, included an image and the name (and nickname) of the data subject. However, the data subject had never explicitly consented to this publication nor was there a contractual agreement at any time. The publications were mainly for advertising purposes.

Controller 1 issued two of the reports in question; on 30 July 2015 and on 9 November 2015. Controller 2 published the other two reports, namely on 10 August 2016 and on 18 September 2016.

The controllers took down the reports in September 2018 and November 2018, respectively. On 17 February 2019, the data subject filed two complaints before the DSB (Austria) for infringement of their fundamental right to data protection by the two controllers.

The DSB joined the two cases in its decision of 13 July 2020 accepting the complaint and deciding in favour of the data subject: According to this decision, controller 1 unlawfully processed the data subject’s personal data from 9 November 2015 until 30 September 2018. Controller 2 unlawfully processed the same data from 10 August 2016 until November 2018. Both controllers appealed against this decision before the Austrian Federal Administrative Court (_Bundesverwaltungsgericht - BVwG_), claiming that their activities were covered by the media exception of [§ 9(1) Austrian Data Protection Act](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/NormDokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10001597&Artikel=2&Paragraf=9&Anlage=&Uebergangsrecht=) (_Datenschutzgesetz - DSG_).

### Holding

First, the BVwG considered the application of [§ 9(1) DSG](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/NormDokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10001597&Artikel=2&Paragraf=9&Anlage=&Uebergangsrecht=), which provides for a broad nonapplication of GDPR provisions (among others), notably [Article 6 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR "Article 6 GDPR"), which deals with the lawfulness of processing (“Medienprivileg”). The court, making reference to [CJEU C-73/07](/index.php?title=CJEU_-_C-73/07_-_Satamedia "CJEU - C-73/07 - Satamedia"), held that personal data is processed for journalistic purposes if the processing has the sole purpose of disseminating information, opinions or ideas to the public. Since in this case there was at least an element of advertisement in each of the publications, the BVwG held that [§ 9(1) DSG](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/NormDokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10001597&Artikel=2&Paragraf=9&Anlage=&Uebergangsrecht=) was not applicable.

Then, the BVwG assessed the lawfulness of processing in light of Article 6(1) GDPR.

First of all, the court noted that none of the controllers could provide with a substantive argument or proof that the processing of data took place on the basis of consent by the data subject under [Article 6(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1a "Article 6 GDPR").

Hence, pursuant to [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"), the court further examined whether processing was necessary for the purposes of the controllers’ legitimate interest. It confirmed that making available to the public their reports on shooting competitions represents a legitimate interest for processing of personal data, however, the court pointed out that none of the four reports constituted an exercise of their right to freedom of expression and information. The reports were not issued as a contribution to a debate of general interest, but, in fact, merely for the purpose of promoting the company of controller 1 and another company as far as controller 2 is concerned. Thus, the controllers could also not rely on [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR") as a legal basis for processing the data subject's personal data.

As a result, the court held that the publication of personal data in the reports was unlawful and that both controllers infringed the data subject’s right to confidentiality.

2. Assessment of evidence:

The facts established above arise, among other things, from the administrative act submitted and

among other things, from the evidence listed in brackets.

The second complainant himself stated during the oral hearing that

that he wrote the contributions in question and is solely responsible for them

was (negotiation document, page 14: “VR: Who was the owner of the homepage at the time of

You were responsible for the website during the period in question. The
Course content met the company XXXX. Were made without your consent or intervention

However, no content was posted on the site. Is that right? BF2: Yes.”). There are none
Reasons to doubt this argument.

That the designation XXXX is not an official designation of the co-participant and this or

is also not known to the general public, results from the consensus
Submissions of the parties during the oral hearing (negotiation document,

That the first complainant submitted the contribution of July 30, 2015 and the report on the

published the results of XXXX from November 9, 2015 for its own advertising purposes,

This is clear from the text itself. On the one hand, it advertises the T-shirt

Others report (exclusively) on the results of the team

The first complainant also stated during the oral hearing that

is. When asked specifically about this, he also stated during the oral hearing that

he described his report on his experiences at the state championships as “editorial

However, the naming of the person involved was for advertising purposes

(Negotiation document, page 5: “VR: Why do you have the above contributions on your
Homepage published? BF1: The reason was simple, on the one hand, to advertise myself

do, on the other hand also for the MP. The blog was very positive. It was about him

The same applies to the second complainant's report of August 10, 2016
about the results of the XXXX. It only reports on the results of the XXXX

The first complainant conducted further questioning during the oral hearing
Negotiation in turn states that he is the co-participant with those in question

It is undisputed that the first complainant submitted the report dated July 30, 2015 (application

The complainants see their legitimate interest in data processing in the fact that they
