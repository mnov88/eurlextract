## English Summary

### Facts

23andMe is a US based consumer genetics and research company. It offers customers (data subjects) a genetic testing service by analysing a DNA sample provided by them to identify, among others, their ancestry composition, DNA relatives and health predispositions. To view and download the results of their DNA analysis (raw genetic data) customers must create an account.

  

Between 25 May 2018 and 31 December 2024, a threat actor was able to perpetrate a credential stuffing attack and obtain access to personal data relating to 155,592 UK-based customers of 23andMe. Some of the data constituted special category personal data relating to health and genetic data, as well as data relating to the racial or ethnic origin.

  

In August and October 2023, the personal data exfiltrated by the threat actor was offered for sale on a number of online forums.

23andMe became aware of the data breach in October 2023 and notified the DPA (Information Commissioner's Office-ICO).

  
In June 2024, the DPA informed 23andMe of the launch of investigation into the data breach.

### Holding

First, the DPA found that 23andMe infringed Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR, by failing to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of its processing systems and services including by failing to implement:

i. appropriate authentication and verification measures as part of its customer login process, including, but not limited to, multi-factor authentication, secure password requirements, unpredictable usernames, or other measures recognised as effective defences against credential stuffing attacks;

ii. additional appropriate security measures specifically focused on the access to and download of raw genetic data, despite the fact that genetic data is special category data by virtue of Article 9(1) UK GDPR and therefore merits specific protection.

iii. measures which enabled 23andMe to monitor for, detect and appropriately respond to threats to its customers’ personal data.

  

  
Second, the DPA found that 23andMe violated Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32(1)(d) UK GDPR by failing to implement an appropriate process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures intended to ensure the security of its processing systems and services.

The seriousness of the infringements was further aggravated by: (a) the sensitivity of the personal data processed, (b)the large number of affected UK data subjects, (c)the damage and distress suffered and likely to be suffered by affected data subjects, (d) 23andMe’s failure to identify the data breach at an earlier stage, despite multiple indications of anomalous and unauthorised activity by the threat actor, and (e) deficiencies in the content of 23andMe’s notifications of the data breach to the DPA.

In lights of the above, the DPA imposed a fine of GBP 2,310,000 (€2,702,295).

I. INTRODUCTION
1. Pursuant to section 155(1)(a) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA
2018”), by this written notice (“Penalty Notice”), the Information
Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) requires 23andMe, Inc
(“23andMe”) to pay the Commissioner a penalty of £2,310,000.
2. This Penalty Notice is given in respect of infringements of Article 5(1)(f)
and 32(1) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”).
3. This Penalty Notice follows an investigation which was carried out jointly
by the Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”) and the Office of the
Privacy Commissioner of Canada (“OPC”) into a personal data breach
which 23andMe first reported to both regulators in October 2023. This
Penalty Notice sets out the Commissioner’s conclusions and the reasons
why the Commissioner has decided to impose a penalty, including the
circumstances of the infringements and the nature of the personal data
involved.
4. In accordance with paragraph 2 of Schedule 16 to the DPA 2018, the
Commissioner issued a notice of intent (“NOI”) to 23andMe on 4 March
CONFIDENTIAL

2025, setting out the reasons why the Commissioner proposed to issue
23andMe with a penalty notice. In that NOI, the Commissioner indicated
that the amount of the penalty he proposed to impose was £4,593,750.
5. On 18 April 2025, 23andMe made written representations (the “Written
Representations”) in response to the Commissioner’s NOI. Oral
representations were provided at a hearing on 30 April 2025 (the “Oral
Hearing”). In reaching the decision to issue this Penalty Notice, the
Commissioner has taken full account of 23andMe’s representations and,
where appropriate, the Penalty Notice makes specific reference to them.
6. On 6 February 2025, 23andMe Holding Co., of which 23andMe is a wholly
owned subsidiary, filed its Form 10-Q1 with the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission. The Form 10-Q showed that as of 31
December 2024, 23andMe Holding Co. had accumulated a deficit of $2.4
billion and possessed unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $79.4
million, a decline from $216,488,000 on 31 March 2024. At the time of
filing the Form 10-Q, 23andMe Holding Co. stated that there was
substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going
concern.2
7. On 23 March 2025, 23andMe Holding Co. and certain of its subsidiaries,
including 23andMe, filed voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter
11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.3 A hearing to
approve the sale of 23andMe Holding Co., its subsidiaries and/or its assets
is scheduled to take place on 17 June 2025.
8. The Commissioner finds that between 25 May 20184 and 31 December

20245 (“the Relevant Period”) 23andMe infringed Article 5(1)(f) and
Article 32(1) of the UK GDPR (the “Infringements”), by failing to
implement:
a) appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the
ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of its
processing systems and services (Article 5(1)(f) and Article
32(1)(b) UK GDPR); and
b) an appropriate process for regularly testing, assessing and
evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organisational
measures intended to ensure the security of its processing systems
and services (Article 5(1)(f) and Article32(1)(d) UK GDPR).
9. 23andMe submitted that in light of the deterioration in its financial
position, a monetary penalty is not warranted as it would further deplete
the funds that may be used to compensate 23andMe customers who
have filed several class action lawsuits and arbitration claims in the US,
Canada and the UK.6 The Commissioner has carefully considered these
representations and concluded that a monetary penalty remains
appropriate in order to provide an effective, proportionate and
dissuasive response to the Infringements. However, when setting the
amount of the penalty, the Commissioner has taken into account the
latest financial information provided by 23andMe, including 23andMe
Holding Co.’s projected annual turnover for its 2025 financial year, in
order to ensure that the penalty is proportionate in light of the
company’s current and significantly deteriorated financial position.
10. This Penalty Notice is issued in respect of the Infringements on the basis
that, in all the circumstances, and having regard to the matters listed in
Article 83(1) and 83(2) UK GDPR, the Commissioner considers that the
5 23andMe confirmed that its security improvements had been materially implemented by
this date.

imposition of a financial penalty in the sum of £2,310,000 is an effective,
proportionate and dissuasive response to the Infringements.
II. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
11. This Penalty Notice follows a joint investigation by the Information
Commissioner’s Office and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of
Canada. The findings in this Penalty Notice are those of the
Commissioner only.
12. Following his investigation, the Commissioner has concluded that during
the Relevant Period, 23andMe, a US-based consumer genetics and
research company, infringed Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32(1)(b) and (d)
UK GDPR by failing to implement:
a) appropriate authentication and verification measures as part of its
customer login process, including, but not limited to, mandatory
multi-factor authentication (“MFA”), appropriate password security
policies and procedures, the ability for customers to use
unpredictable usernames and other additional controls, such as
device, connection or address fingerprinting (Article 5(1)(f) and
Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR);
b) appropriate security measures specifically focused on the access to,
and download of, special category data7 (Article 5(1)(f) and Article
32(1)(b) UK GDPR);
c) measures which enabled 23andMe to monitor for, detect and
appropriately respond to threats to its customers’ personal data
(Article 5(1)(f) and Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR);
d) an appropriate process for regularly testing and assessing the
effectiveness of its technical and organisational security measures,
specifically in relation to the threat posed to its customers’ personal

7
data by a credential stuffing attack8 instigated by a third-party
threat actor9 (Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1)(d) UK
GDPR).
13. As a result of the Infringements, a threat actor was able to perpetrate a
credential stuffing attack over the course of at least five months (the
“Data Breach”), during which they obtained access to personal data
relating to 155,592 UK-based customers of 23andMe (“Affected UK
Data Subjects”). The personal data exfiltrated by the threat actor was
offered for sale on a number of online forums in August and October
2023, with the relevant posts indicating that the threat actor had
targeted 23andMe customers according to their racial and ethnic
background.
14. Whilst the nature of the personal data accessed by the threat actor will
have varied between the Affected UK Data Subjects, at least some of it
constituted special category data. This special category data included
personal data relating to health and genetic data, as well as data relating
to the racial or ethnic origin of some customers, which could be inferred
from the personal data processed by 23andMe.
15. The Commissioner has obtained evidence from Affected UK Data
Subjects which demonstrates the harm which arose, or could have
arisen, from the Infringements, including feelings of extreme anxiety
about the consequences for their personal, financial and family safety
and concerns that the personal data accessed by the threat actor could
be used to target specific groups.
8 Credential stuffing takes advantage of people reusing username and password
combinations. Attackers fraudulently obtain valid combinations for one site and then use
them across others to try and gain access to accounts (Use of credential stuffing tools -
NCSC.GOV.UK)
9 For the purposes of this Penalty Notice, the Commissioner has referred to a “threat
actor”, however, the Commissioner has not been received conclusive evidence that the
Data Breach (as defined in paragraph 13 above) and the related posts on the dark web
were attributable to a single individual or group.
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
8
16. The Commissioner has concluded that the Infringements constituted a
serious failure to comply with the requirements of Article 5(1)(f) and
Article 32(1) UK GDPR. The seriousness of the Infringements was
aggravated by the sensitivity of the personal data processed by
23andMe, the large number of Affected UK Data Subjects, the extended
period of time during which the 23andMe failed to comply with its data
protection obligations and the damage and distress suffered and likely
to be suffered by Affected UK Data Subjects as a result of the
unauthorised access to their personal data.
17. The seriousness of the Infringements was further aggravated by:
a) 23andMe’s failure to identify the Data Breach at an earlier stage,
despite multiple indications of anomalous and unauthorised activity
by the threat actor; and
b) deficiencies in the content of 23andMe’s notifications of the Data
Breach to the Commissioner.
18. In light of the above, and having fully taken into account the
representations received from 23andMe in relation to the NOI and
penalty calculation, the Commissioner has concluded that a penalty of
£2,310,000 adequately reflects the seriousness of the Infringements
and is effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
III. RELEVANT LEGAL FRAMEWORK
19. Section 155 DPA 2018 provides that, if the Commissioner is satisfied
that a person has failed, or is failing, as described in section 149(2) DPA
2018, the Commissioner may, by written notice, require the person to
pay to the Commissioner an amount in sterling specified in the notice.
20. The types of failure described in section 149(2) DPA 2018, include, at
section 149(2)(a), “where a controller or processor has failed , or is
failing, to comply with . . . a provision of Chapter II of the UK GDPR ...
. principles of processing)” and at section 149(2)(c), “where a controller
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
9
or processor has failed, or is failing, to comply with . . . a provision of
Articles 25-39 of the UK GDPR . . . (obligations of controllers and
processors).”
21. Chapter II of the UK GDPR sets out the principles relating to the
processing of personal data that controllers must comply with. Article
5(1) UK GDPR lists these principles and at point (f) includes the
requirement that “personal data shall be… processed in a manner that
ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss,
destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational
measures (integrity and confidentiality).” This is referred to in the UK
GDPR as the “integrity and confidentiality” principle.
22. Article 32(1) UK GDPR (security of processing) materially provides:
“(1) Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation
and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as
the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of
natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement
appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of
security appropriate to the risk . . .
(2) In assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be taken
in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular
from . . . unauthorised disclosure of . . . personal data transmitted,
stored or otherwise processed.”
23. The legal framework for imposing a penalty notice is set out below in
Section VII: Decision to Impose a Penalty.
IV. BACKGROUND TO 23ANDME

35. 23andMe provides this function to enable its customers to access,
understand and benefit from the information their genetics can tell
them. 23andMe informed the Commissioner that many customers wish
to upload their data to third-party services, which offer to interpret their
raw DNA data to find new genetic relatives or generate new genetic
reports.29
36. As of 29 April 2023, the date identified by 23andMe as the beginning of
the Data Breach described further at paragraphs 93 to 103 below,30 a
customer was able to access and download their Raw Genetic Data
through 23andMe’s “Browse Raw Data” feature.31 The Commissioner
notes that this feature was disabled on 2 November 202332, as part of
23andMe’s response to the Data Breach. During the suspension,
customers were required to authenticate their identities with 23andMe
customer care to download their Raw Genetic Data. The feature was
then reinstated on 27 February 2024 with the additional requirement

V. BACKGROUND TO THE INFRINGEMENTS
A. Relevant events prior to October 2023
40. This section summarises the relevant events which took place prior to
23andMe becoming aware of the Data Breach in October 2023 and which
have been disclosed to the ICO and the OPC during the course of their
joint investigation. It does not seek to provide an exhaustive account of
all relevant events which took place prior to 29 April 2023.
(a) 2019 and 2020 credential stuffing attacks
41. In October 2023, a forensic team, instructed by 23andMe, commenced
an investigation (the “Internal Investigation”) into reports that
personal data relating to 23andMe customers (“Customer Personal
Data”) had been exfiltrated from the Platform and offered for sale on
the dark web.40
38 The exome represents the protein-coding regions of genes, which make up only about 1-
2% of the entire genome but contain the majority of genetic variants associated with
disease risk. By selectively sequencing these regions, exome sequencing provides valuable
insights into an individual's genetic makeup, identifying variations that may be linked to
specific genetic disorders or conditions. This technique is particularly useful for diagnosing
rare genetic diseases and conducting research into the genetic basis of various medical
conditions, 23andMe+ Total Health - Build longevity with DNA, blood & more (accessed 2
June 2025).
39 Polygenic scores (PGS) aim to quantify the cumulative effects of a number of genes,
which may individually have a very small effect on susceptibility. They can be used to
predict a person’s likelihood of displaying any trait with a genetic component, Polygenic risk
scores: how useful are they? - Genomics Education Programme (accessed 12 May 2025).

42. As part of the Internal Investigation, 23andMe analysed whether any
credential stuffing attacks had taken place prior to 29 April 2023. The
forensic team identified “eight separate accounts that may have been
accessed in isolated incidents of credential stuffing in 2019 and 2020.”41
This was the first occasion on which 23andMe identified these earlier
credential stuffing attacks.
(b) July 2023 Login Spike and July Attempted Profile Transfers
43. 6 July 2023 - The Platform was rendered temporarily inoperable as a
result of over one million successful logins (as displayed in Figure 3
below), primarily to a single customer account in what was subsequently
determined to be an unsuccessful attempt to transfer the ownership of
customer profile data from the accessed customer account to other
23andMe accounts using 23andMe’s profile transfer function42 (the “July
Login Spike”).43
41 Letter from Greenberg Traurig LLP to the ICO and OPC, 16 July 2024 (responding to a
letter from the ICO and OPC dated 20 June 2024): Response to Question 36
42 A profile transfer is when a DNA profile associated to an account is transferred to a
different account. This may take place, for example, when a child who has their profile
associated to a shared family account (23andMe Family Account Options (accessed 5
February 2025)) becomes an adult and wishes to establish their own account. To initiate a
profile transfer, a customer must be logged into the account with which the DNA profile is
associated and enter the email address of the “destination account” (What is a Profile
Transfer? – 23andMe Customer Care (accessed 5 February 2025))

all profile transfer requests, placed a temporary lock on accounts
suspected of attempting to perform an unauthorised profile transfer and

detect abnormal rates of profile transfer requests (
) and undertook an internal investigation to determine whether
Customer Personal Data had potentially been accessed by a third party.
Based on its investigation, 23andMe determined that limited Customer
Personal Data within 19 US-based 23andMe customers’ accounts had
been accessed by an unauthorised third party.48
(c) Customer contact portal messages – August 2023
46. 10 and 11 August 2023 - Messages were submitted via the 23andMe
customer contact portal which were directed to 23andMe’s former chief
executive officer (“CEO”), , from an individual named
“Anna” who claimed to have obtained the data of over 10 million
23andMe customers (the “August 2023 Messages”). It was claimed
that the data amounted to over 300 terabytes, and included personal
information, family background, ancestry composition, haplogroup
information, health data, health traits, surveys and raw DNA data. The
individual threatened to “destroy” 23andMe if the company was not
“honest” with them.49 “Anna” further threatened to share the DNA data
of both and her former husband, .

(d) The Hydra Post
48. 11 August 2023 - Customer Personal Data was offered for sale on the
Hydra Market platform51 by a customer operating under the pseudonym
Dazhbog (the “Hydra Post”). In the Hydra Post, Dazhbog claimed to
have access to 10 million DNA records, and offered them for sale for
US$50 million. Dazhbog claimed that the file contained over 300
terabytes of data, and included “personal information, family
background, ancestry composition, haplogroup, health, traits, surveys
\[and\] raw DNA data.” Dazhbog also offered to separate the data
specifically based on location and ethnicity if the purchaser was willing
to pay an additional fee.52
49. A copy of this post is displayed at Figure 2 below:
51 Hydra Market was an online criminal marketplace that enabled users in mainly Russian-
speaking countries to buy and sell illicit goods and services, including illegal drugs, stolen
financial information, fraudulent identification documents and money laundering and
mixing services, anonymously and beyond the reach of law enforcement. Hydra Market was
disabled in April 2022 after the US Department of Justice seized its servers and
cryptocurrency wallets containing US$25 million in a coordinated international law
enforcement operation - Office of Public Affairs | Justice Department Investigation Leads to
Shutdown of Largest Online Darknet Marketplace | United States Department of Justice
(accessed 5 February 2025). Despite this, the
Report dated 19 October 2023 (Exhibit N of the Letter from Greenberg Traurig LLP to the
OPC and ICO, 13 August 2024) attributed the Dazhbog posts to the Hydra Market platform.
The Commissioner has not investigated the accuracy of the attribution of the Dazhbog
posts to the Hydra Market platform

instructions on how the data would be sent to a purchaser in China.
51. A subsequent post, apparently by the same user, on 14 August 2023 on
the Hydra Market platform claimed that the entire dataset had been sold
to an Iranian national who had requested that the original post be

58. The Ticket shows that a number of immediate actions were
identified and allocated to individual members of 23andMe’s Cyber
Incident Response Team. These actions included conducting an analysis
of the email headers within the August 2023 Messages, checking access
patterns to identify any irregularities and searching the dark web for any
information related to the incident and to data alleged to have been
obtained from the Platform in general.
59. 15 August 2023 - A screenshot of the Reddit post referred to in the
comments added to the Ticket on 14 December 2023 was

60. Members of 23andMe’s Cyber Incident Response Team added comments
to the Ticket stating that analysis of the image of the Reddit
post did not reveal a discrepancy from the ones on the “legit DNAR58
pages,” indicating that the Cyber Incident Response Team believed that
the Reddit post included genuine data extracted from the DNA Relatives
feature.

the fact that Raw Genetic Data had been accessed and downloaded by
the threat actor. 23andMe explained in its Written Representations that
it had notified the OPC and 70 other data protection regulators within
72 hours of finalising the Internal Investigation and the failure to notify
the ICO at the same time was an unintentional omission.82
89. 12 December 2023 - The Ticket was updated to state that,
“no evidence of the exfiltration of 10M customers’ raw DNA data was
found. While shows that some data was accessed, it was not
to the levels outlined in this claim. If this is related to , then it is
likely an exaggeration of the actual data obtained.”83
90. January 2024 - “Additional information came to light” that, “some
ungenotyped accounts are set up specifically to receive the DNA
Relatives profile and health reports of another customer through the
Connections feature.”84 Despite requests from the Commissioner,
23andMe failed to confirm how this additional information “came to
light.”85 23andMe stated that during the Internal Investigation in
October and November 2023, prior to receipt of this additional
information, it had assumed that only the accounts of those customers
who had submitted DNA for testing would contain genetic data.
91. As a result of this additional information coming to light, 23andMe
investigated the credential stuffed accounts to determine which
accounts contained other customers’ information which had been shared
through the Connections feature.86 This led to 23andMe identifying an

shared through the Connections feature had been accessed by the threat
actor.87

E. 23andMe’s Internal Investigation – reported findings
93. In December 2023, the Internal Investigation determined that the threat
actor had been able to obtain access to certain 23andMe accounts by
way of a credential stuffing attack.
94. Credential stuffing is a form of brute force attack which involves the
automated injection of stolen credentials (usernames or email addresses
and passwords) into website login forms in order to fraudulently gain
access to the customer’s account.89 Many internet customers re-use the
same credentials across multiple different online accounts, meaning that
when those credentials are exposed, an attacker can use those
credentials across multiple other sites in order to compromise other
accounts belonging to the same individual. Credential stuffing is one of
the most common techniques used to gain unauthorised access to
customer accounts and, once the attacker knows that they have access
to an account, potential next steps include making purchases, accessing

sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and private
messages), sending phishing messages or spam, and selling known
valid credentials for other attackers to use. Multi-factor authentication
is regarded as the primary means of defending against credential
stuffing attacks.90
95. The Internal Investigation found that the threat actor used credential
stuffing to gain access to the accounts of 611 Affected UK Data
Subjects.91
96. The threat actor’s first activity occurred on or about 29 April 2023, when,
up until 6 May 2023, they logged into six accounts with separate email
addresses that were likely to have been used by the threat actor to
create their own 23andMe accounts.92
97. In the period from 1 – 16 May 2023, the threat actor carried out 183,380
failed and 9,974 successful login attempts, whilst also scraping93 DNA
Relatives profile information, ancestry composition information and
health data contained in the credential stuffed accounts that were
successfully accessed.94
98. Between 11 and 16 June 2023, the threat actor continued to scrape DNA
Relatives profile information via the credential stuffed accounts that had
opted into this feature.95
99. This occurred again on 27 and 28 August 2023, whilst on 29 August

2023, the threat actor scraped Family Tree profile information using the
credential stuffed accounts.96
100. Further incidents of data scraping from DNA Relatives and Family Tree
profiles, as well as the scraping of data from Ancestry Composition
Reports, was identified as having taken place between 28 August and 3
September 2023, and on 20 September 2023.97
101. Overall, 23andMe found that during the period between 1 May and 18
September 2023, the threat actor conducted approximately 14,601
successful logins and approximately 273,465 unsuccessful logins.98
102. In total, the Internal Investigation found that the DNA Relatives profiles
of 120,031 Affected UK Data Subjects were unlawfully accessed in the
course of the Data Breach, with 35,561 Affected UK Data Subjects’
Family Tree profiles accessed by the threat actor. The threat actor also
gained access to the Ancestry Reports of 120,504 Affected UK Data
Subjects, the Health Reports of 320 Affected UK Data Subjects, the self-
reported health conditions of three Affected UK Data Subjects and the
Raw Genetic Data of two Affected UK Data Subjects.99
103. Based on the Internal Investigation, 23andMe informed the
Commissioner on 16 July 2024 that it had found no evidence that the
threat actor had downloaded Raw Genetic Data relating to any Affected
UK Data Subjects.100

of a joint investigation into the Data Breach.
105. On 20 June 2024, the ICO and the OPC jointly sent a first round of
questions to 23andMe seeking information about its data processing
policies and procedures, the Data Breach and how it had responded.101
23andMe stated that this letter from the ICO and the OPC alerted it to
its failure to submit a supplementary personal data breach report form
to the Commissioner in December 2023.102
106. On 24 June 2024, 23andMe submitted an updated supplementary
personal data breach report form to the ICO (the “Third Data Breach
Report Form”), which stated that the breach had begun on 1 May 2023
via a credential stuffing attack.
107. The Third Data Breach Report Form stated, inter alia, that:
a) The type of personal data affected depended on the customer
groups impacted by the Data Breach. However, the threat actor had
accessed the Raw Genetic Data of two Affected UK Data Subjects
and the self-reported health conditions of three Affected UK Data
Subjects.
b) 156,204 Affected UK Data Subjects could have been affected by the
Data Breach. This total figure included 611 Affected UK Data
Subjects whose accounts the threat actor had been able to access
via credential stuffing, 120,031 Affected UK Data Subjects
whose DNA Relatives profiles had been accessed, 35,561 Affected
UK Data Subjects whose Family Tree profiles had been

interviews by video calls with three 23andMe employees: the company’s
Software Architect, its Head of Security and its Data Privacy Officer.
23andMe provided follow-up written responses to a number of the
questions asked during the interviews.106
VI. THE COMMISSIONER’S FINDINGS OF INFRINGEMENT
A. Controllership and jurisdiction
110. The Commissioner finds that during the Relevant Period 23andMe was
the controller, as defined in Article 4(7) UK GDPR and sections 3(6), 5(1)
and 6 DPA 2018,107 of the personal data relating to the Affected UK Data
Subjects. The Commissioner’s finding is based on evidence which
indicates that 23andMe determined both the means by which the
personal data of the Affected UK Data Subjects was processed and the
purposes for which such processing took place. For example, 23andMe
determined the type of personal data that a customer was required to
provide when setting up an account, how such personal data was stored
and the categories of personal data that could be shared with other
customers through the DNA Relatives, Family Tree and Connections
features. 23andMe designed these features and processed personal data
to fulfil its stated aim of offering a service which enables individuals to

also controlled the use of customers’ personal data for research
purposes (where customers provided their consent to such processing).
111. This is reflected in 23andMe’s EEA, UK and Switzerland Privacy Notice,
which states that the company is the “controller of \[customers’\] Personal
Information because we determine the means and purposes of
processing your information when using our Services.”109
112. The processing operations performed by 23andMe in the course of
providing its services to its customers and carrying out its research
activities fall within the material scope of the UK GDPR and Part 2 of the
DPA 2018 pursuant to Article 2(1) UK GDPR and section 4(2)(a) DPA
2018 respectively, as they constitute the “automated or structured
processing of personal data.”110
113. The UK GDPR applies to 23andMe’s processing of the personal data
relating to the Affected UK Data Subjects pursuant to Article 3(2)(a) UK
GDPR as although 23andMe is not established within the UK, it processes
the personal data of the Affected UK Data Subjects for the purposes of
offering goods or services to those individuals.
B. Nature of the personal data affected
114. On 16 July 2024,111 23andMe confirmed that the threat actor had
accessed the DNA Relatives profiles of 120,031 Affected UK Data
Subjects. This provided the threat actor with access to the Affected UK
Data Subjects’ display names, relationship label and their predicted

relationship and percentage of DNA shared with their DNA Relatives
matches. In respect of the Affected UK Data Subjects who chose to share
such information with their matches, the threat actor would also have
had access to their Ancestry Reports, matching DNA segments, self-
reported city or postcode-level location, ancestor birth location and
family names, profile picture, birth year, family tree and contents of the
customer’s “Introduce Yourself” section of their profile.112
115. The threat actor accessed the Ancestry Reports relating to 120,504
Affected UK Data Subjects. 23andMe explained that Ancestry Reports
are the same as DNA Relatives profiles, but the Ancestry Reports number
is larger because it includes customers who had their accounts credential
stuffed and customers whose Ancestry Reports were accessed because
they shared it via their Connections feature with a Credential Stuffed
Profile.113
116. The threat actor also accessed the Family Tree feature for 35,561
Affected UK Data Subjects. This provided the threat actor with access to
these individuals’ display names, relationship labels and percentage of
DNA shared with their matches. Where the customers had chosen to
share this information through the Family Tree feature, the threat actor
would also have had access to the customers’ self-reported city or
postcode-level location and birth year.114
117. The threat actor also accessed personal data relating to the health of
323 Affected UK Data Subjects. This figure included:
a) three Affected UK Data Subjects whose self-reported health
conditions were accessed by the threat actor; and

b) 320 Affected UK Data Subjects whose 23andMe generated Health
Reports were accessed in the course of the Data Breach.115
118. The threat actor also accessed, but did not download, Raw Genetic Data
relating to two Affected UK Data Subjects.
119. The information that was available to the threat actor as a result of their
access to the Affected UK Data Subjects’ DNA Relatives profiles,
Ancestry Reports and Family Tree profiles constitutes personal data
within the meaning of Article 4(1) UK GDPR and section 3(2) DPA 2018
as it relates to the individual customer and could, either directly or
indirectly, when combined with other information, identify them.
120. Article 4(13) UK GDPR defines “genetic data” as “personal data relating
to the inherited or acquired characteristics of a natural person which give
unique information about the physiology or the health of that natural
person and which result, in particular, from an analysis of a biological
sample from the natural person in question.”
121. Affected UK Data Subjects’ Raw Genetic Data therefore constitutes
“genetic data” within the meaning of Article 4(13) UK GDPR, as it is
generated using a DNA sample provided by the customer and displays
the unique configuration of nucleotides within the customer’s DNA which
determines the genetic characteristics they inherit from their biological
ancestors.
122. Furthermore, both genetic data and data relating to the health of
Affected UK Data Subjects constitute special category data within the
meaning of Article 9(1) UK GDPR.
123. All three of the 23andMe services available in the UK116 include, as

standard, Ancestry Composition, Ancestry Reports and Trait Reports.117
23andMe uses this information to connect customers to one another
where the customer has opted into its DNA Relatives feature. Customers
are then able to find their genetic relatives, message such relatives
directly and compare their respective ancestries and traits.
124. In the “Before You Buy” section of its “Customer Care” information,
23andMe includes a specific FAQ entitled “Can 23andMe identify Jewish
ancestry?”,118 which demonstrates the ability to infer Jewish ancestry
about 23andMe customers from the information contained within their
profile. The response to the FAQ confirms that “DNA clearly shows
connections among those who consider themselves to be Ashkenazi
Jewish: two Ashkenazi Jewish people are very likely to be “genetic
cousins” sharing long stretches of identical DNA. This reflects the fact
that the Ashkenazi Jewish population expanded relatively recently from
a small initial population.” This means that if a customer is connected to
an Ashkenazi Jew via the DNA Relatives feature, it is possible to infer
that they (i.e. the customer) are also an Ashkenazi Jew.
125. 23andMe confirmed that as the impacted individuals were genetically
related, the information the threat actor accessed included groups of
customers who shared a common genetic ancestry. 23andMe confirmed
that the threat actor had posted links to .csv files with the labels
“Ashkenazi DNA Data of Celebrities”; “Chinese Ancestry”; “British
Ancestry”; and “Germany Ancestry”.119
C. The Infringements

constitute an infringement of the UK GDPR and/or DPA 2018 (together
the “data protection legislation”).
127. The Commissioner has conducted an assessment of the facts set out in
paragraphs 41 to 109 above and finds that during the Relevant Period
23andMe infringed Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1)(b) and (d)
UK GDPR.
128. As part of this assessment, the Commissioner has carefully considered
and made reference to the ICO’s Guidance on Data Security120 which
includes detailed guidance on Passwords in Online Services121 and
Security Outcomes122. This Guidance was produced with assistance from
the National Cyber Security Centre (“NCSC”)123, part of the Government
Communications Headquarters and the UK’s technical authority for
tackling cyber threats. As part of his assessment, the Commissioner has
also, in addition, carefully considered relevant guidance produced by
NCSC. The Commissioner has also referred, where relevant, to other
authoritative and well-known guidance relating to technical and
organisational security measures, such as that published by the Open
Worldwide Application Security Project (“OWASP”), a non-profit
foundation which works to improve the security of software through
community-led open-source software projects and other initiatives.124
129. Whilst the Commissioner acknowledges that 23andMe did implement
some technical and organisational security measures during the
Relevant Period, he finds that, taken collectively, these were not
“appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of
security appropriate to the risk” posed to the Affected UK Data Subjects’

personal data by 23andMe’s processing.
130. The Infringements involved serious deficiencies in the technical and
organisational security measures implemented by 23andMe when
processing Customer Personal Data.
131. Specifically, the Commissioner finds that during the Relevant Period
23andMe infringed Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1)(b) and (d)
UK GDPR by failing to implement:
a) appropriate technical and organisational measures to “ensure the
ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of its
processing systems and services” (Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and
Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR), including by failing to implement:
i. appropriate authentication and verification measures as part
of its customer login process, including, but not limited to,
multi-factor authentication, secure password requirements,
unpredictable usernames, or other measures recognised as
effective defences against credential stuffing attacks;
ii. additional appropriate security measures specifically focused
on the access to and download of Raw Genetic Data, despite
the fact that genetic data is special category data by virtue of
Article 9(1) UK GDPR and therefore merits specific
protection.125
iii. measures which enabled 23andMe to monitor for, detect and
appropriately respond to threats to its customers’ personal
data;
b) an appropriate process for regularly testing, assessing and
evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organisational
125 Recital 51 to the UK GDPR states that “Personal data which are, by their nature,
particularly sensitive in relation to the fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific
protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the
fundamental rights and freedoms.”

measures intended to ensure the security of its processing systems
and services (Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1)(d) UK
GDPR). Specifically, prior to the Data Breach, none of 23andMe’s
penetration tests or security exercises simulated a credential
stuffing attack despite such attacks being widely recognised as a
prominent cybersecurity risk to organisations offering online
account-based products and services. The Commissioner notes that
one of the company’s security software providers, ,
describe such attacks as “widespread” and “a popular attack
vector.”126
(a) Failure to implement appropriate mitigations against
credential stuffing attacks
132. Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR require controllers
and processors to implement appropriate technical and organisational
measures that ensure appropriate security of personal data. In
accordance with Article 32(1) UK GDPR, the level of security should be
appropriate to the risks posed to the rights and freedoms of natural
persons by its processing activities. This includes, inter alia,
implementing measures which ensure the ongoing confidentiality,
integrity, availability and resilience of the controller or processor’s
processing systems and services (Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR).
133. The Commissioner finds that 23andMe failed to implement appropriate
technical and organisational measures to ensure the ongoing
confidentiality and integrity of Affected UK Data Subjects’ personal data
by failing to:
a) enable the use of unpredictable usernames in lieu of email
addresses;
126
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
45
b) impose appropriate requirements regarding the security and
complexity of passwords; and
c) mandate the use of MFA.
i. Usernames
134. For the reasons set out below, the Commissioner finds that during the
Relevant Period 23andMe infringed Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article
32(1)(b) UK GDPR by failing to enable the use of unpredictable
usernames in lieu of email addresses for login purposes,127 which would
have been an appropriate technical measure to ensure an appropriate
level of security.
135. Advice published by OWASP128 on the prevention of credential stuffing
attacks advises that customers create their own usernames when
registering on a website rather than simply using their email address,
as this “makes it harder for an attacker to obtain valid username and
password pairs for credential stuffing, as many of the available
credential lists only include email addresses.”129
136. Therefore, whilst a requirement for customers of online services to
create their own usernames distinct from their email address is neither
an explicit requirement within the UK GDPR, nor a failsafe means of
protecting customer accounts against credential stuffing attacks, the
Commissioner’s view is that providing an option for customers to create
unpredictable usernames in lieu of email addresses would have been an
appropriate technical measure, in accordance with Article 5(1)(f) UK
GDPR and Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR, for 23andMe to have implemented

widely-used publications such as the OWASP Top-10. Identification and authentication
failures, previously known as broken authentication, includes credential stuffing and other
brute force attacks and has featured in the OWASP Top-10 since 2003

to ensure an appropriate level of security for the personal data held
within its customers’ accounts.
137. The Commissioner’s view is that enabling the use of unpredictable
usernames would, in addition to secure password requirements and
compulsory MFA, have represented an appropriate technical measure to
increase the level of protection afforded to customer accounts against
unauthorised access, particularly credential stuffing attacks.
ii. Secure passwords
138. The Commissioner notes that during the Relevant Period 23andMe failed
to enforce appropriate minimum password length130 and complexity
requirements, and failed to prevent customers from using either weak
or compromised passwords. The Commissioner finds that this
represented a failure to implement appropriate technical measures, in
accordance with Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR,
which would have ensured an appropriate level of security for its
customers’ accounts and enhanced protections against brute force
attacks such as credential stuffing.
139. The UK GDPR does not specifically prescribe how organisations should
configure their password systems. However, providers of online services
must ensure that the configuration and operation of their password
systems comply with their obligations under Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and
Article 32 UK GDPR and are appropriate to ensure a level of security
which is appropriate to the risk, taking into account the context of the
personal data being processed and the associated risks to the rights and
freedoms of their customers.
140. ICO Guidance on Password Requirements for Online Services131 states
130 This finding applies from the start of the Relevant Period until 23andMe increased the
minimum length for customer account passwords to 12 characters following the Data
Breach.
131 Passwords in online services | ICO (accessed 5 February 2025)

47
that there are three general requirements for any password system that
providers of online services need to consider: password length, special
characters and password strength. Operators of online services are
advised to set a minimum but not a maximum password length; allow,
but not mandate, the use of special characters; and prevent customers
from using common, weak passwords by screening passwords against a
password “deny list” featuring the most commonly used passwords,
leaked passwords from website breaches and common words or phrases
related to the relevant service.
141. In assessing 23andMe’s password policy by reference to this ICO
guidance, the Commissioner notes that, at the time of the Data Breach,
23andMe’s password policy for customer accounts:
a) only included a minimum character requirement of eight
characters, albeit that, following the Data Breach, this was
increased to a minimum of 12 characters;132
b) did not include password complexity requirements; and
c) contained insufficient measures to prevent the use of common
words or known compromised credentials.133
142. In addition, 23andMe initially informed the Commissioner that there
were measures in place to prevent a customer submitting a previously
used password when resetting their password.134 However, 23andMe
later confirmed that this measure wasn’t introduced until August 2023,
after the Data Breach began, and that prior to that date, customers could
reset their passwords to any previously used password.135

143. Although 23andMe stated that it had repeatedly warned customers
about the risks of reusing their passwords136, the Commissioner notes
that customers were not directed to these resources when creating or
changing their passwords. Instead, these warnings were contained in
the “Password Tips” section of the 23andMe Privacy and Security Help
Centre137 and on a 23andMe Blog.138 The Commissioner finds that
23andMe would not have been able to ensure that its customers had
accessed and read this information when creating or changing
passwords.
144. Furthermore, 23andMe failed to maintain a comprehensive password
“deny list” of commonly used words or phrases which could not be used
by customers when creating their passwords, nor implement measures
to assist customers to choose strong passwords, both of which are
recommended in the ICO Guidance on Passwords in Online Services. This
ICO guidance also recommends that controllers consult the NCSC’s
guidance when devising their password policies. The Commissioner
notes that the maintenance of a password “deny list” and measures to
assist customers in improving the strength of their passwords are
amongst the password-related measures which are recommended in
guidance from the NCSC on password strategies that can help
organisations remain secure.139
145. The ICO Guidance on Passwords in Online Services states that operators
of online services should screen passwords against a password ”deny
list’” of the most commonly used passwords and leaked passwords from
website breaches, citing SecLists and HIBP as examples of such lists
which are available online.140

146. During the Relevant Period (and prior to the introduction of measures to
prevent customers reusing previous passwords in August 2023), the
only password complexity check implemented by 23andMe was the
default password validation function.141 The default
password validation function142 includes basic complexity checks, such
as confirming that a password is not comprised solely of integer values
nor contains elements of a customer’s email address or name. 23andMe
also utilised an in-built feature within the web framework which
enables a comparison of customer passwords against only 20,000
passwords collected in 2021 from the https://haveibeenpwned.com
(“HIBP”) dataset of approximately 500 million compromised
credentials.143
147. In addition, during the Relevant Period, 23andMe maintained a
subscription which would have allowed it to access the
which offers a database of over 14 billion
compromised credentials compared with the database of 20,000 offered

provided in support of this statement.
148. The Commissioner finds that had 23andMe implemented the
, it would have significantly increased the strength of
23andMe’s password controls by automating the screening of passwords
against the entire dataset of known compromised credentials within the
HIPB database.147
149. In the alternative, if 23andMe had not considered the
to be a viable option, the Commissioner finds that
23andMe should have implemented an alternative means of effectively
checking for previously compromised customer passwords and from a
database of significantly more than 20,000 compromised passwords as
was offered by . For example, HIBP offers a free service which
compares customer passwords against over 500 million compromised
credentials. 23andMe could also have downloaded the full HIBP database
of compromised passwords and integrated the checks within its own
Platform.148
150. The Commissioner considers that 23andMe’s reliance upon the provision
of customer credentials as the sole customer authentication measure (in
the absence of mandatory MFA) further supports his conclusion that it
would have been appropriate for 23andMe to have implemented an
alternative system of credential checks which utilised a far more
extensive database of known compromised credentials as part of its
technical security measures designed to protect its customers against
the risk of brute force attacks such as credential stuffing. The
Commissioner considers that the implementation of such a system would

51
not only have been more effective than the web framework in
preventing 23andMe customers from reusing compromised credentials
and thus protecting them against the risk of brute force attacks such as
credential stuffing, but would also not have affected the usability of the
Platform, which 23andMe cited when seeking to explain its decision not
to implement mandatory MFA.149
151. The Commissioner notes that since October 2023, 23andMe has
reviewed and updated its password requirements. This includes
increasing the minimum password length to 12 characters; preventing
customers from repeating any of their previous five passwords;
reminding customers to use a unique password; and preventing
customers using repeated characters, sequences of characters or
contextual strings in their passwords.150 In addition, 23andMe now
checks customer passwords against the entire HIBP database (nearly 1
billion passwords, updated monthly) when customers register, sign-in
and reset their passwords.151
iii. Multi-factor authentication
152. For the reasons set out below, the Commissioner finds that 23andMe’s
failure to mandate MFA on customer accounts during the Relevant Period
constituted a failure to implement appropriate technical measures to
ensure the ongoing confidentiality and integrity of Affected UK Data
Subjects’ personal data and thereby infringed Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR
and Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR.
153. NCSC guidance, to which the Commissioner’s Guidance on Passwords in
Online Services directs controllers,152 confirms that MFA is one of the
most effective ways of providing additional protection to a password

protected account.153 MFA is a strong authentication method which
requires two or more factors to gain access to a network, system or
application. Each factor must come from a different category of the three
recognised authentication methods (i.e. knowledge, possession and
inheritance or traits).154 This is in contrast to single-factor authentication
(“SFA”), which is regarded as a low-security method of authentication
which only requires one factor, such as a username and password155 to
gain access to a system. Whilst SFA systems may require two pieces of
information, such as a username and password, this is still regarded as
a single factor because they both fall within the same category of
authentication methods set out above.156
154. In 2018, the NCSC published guidance for organisations about
implementing MFA to protect against password guessing and theft on
online services.157 The Commissioner directs controllers to the NCSC’s
guidance when they are considering implementing an extra factor for
authentication.158 This NCSC guidance states that “Passwords have a
limited ability to protect your data and systems. Even when
implemented correctly, passwords are limited in helping prevent
unauthorised access. If an attacker discovers or guesses the password,
they are able to impersonate a user… One of the most effective ways of
providing additional protection to a password protected account is to use
MFA… MFA is best used where there may be additional risk (such as
logging into an account on a new device, internet facing systems or for
priority accounts).”159
153 Password policy: updating your approach - NCSC.GOV.UK (accessed 5 February 2025)
154 These factors are otherwise referred to as something you know, something you have
and something you are.
155 Both usernames and passwords are examples of “something you know”.

155. From 2019 onwards, 23andMe offered MFA to its customers as an
optional feature, with customers also able to access their accounts using
single sign-on services offered by Google and Apple.160 23andMe
informed the Commissioner that in light of the fact that its “customer
base tends to be older and less likely to possess even basic digital skills,
23andMe decided to make MFA optional to ensure that customers could
easily access their accounts.”161 The Commissioner has not been
presented with any evidence to indicate that 23andMe conducted
customer surveys, performed trials or researched customer opinions
when considering whether to mandate the use of MFA.
156. In any case, the Commissioner regards 23andMe’s reference to the
proportion of its userbase aged over 65 and who were therefore
assumed to lack basic digital skills as an inadequate explanation for its
decision not to introduce MFA as a mandatory part of its login process.
157. 23andMe’s decision not to mandate the use of MFA indicates that it
prioritised customer convenience and ease of use of the Platform over
the security of customer accounts, which the Commissioner finds is not
compliant with the company’s obligations under Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR
and Article 32(1) UK GDPR, particularly when taking into account the
sensitivity of the personal data accessible via customer accounts.
158. The guidance from the NCSC and the ICO referred to in paragraphs 153
and 154 above, clearly indicates that MFA is the most effective means
of protecting against the risk of credential stuffing attacks. At the time
of the Data Breach, only 0.2% of 23andMe’s global customer base had
MFA enabled on their 23andMe accounts and a further 21.5% used SSO
services offered by Google and Apple. Notably none of those accounts

54
were successfully accessed by the threat actor.162
159. The Commissioner considers that this constitutes clear evidence of the
effectiveness of MFA (and SSO systems) in protecting against credential-
based attacks and indicates that the Data Breach could have been
avoided if MFA had been mandated on all customer accounts. This is
further supported by research carried out by Microsoft in 2019, which
suggested that online accounts are 99.9% less likely to be compromised
where MFA is used.163
160. 23andMe clearly possessed the technological capacity to require all
customers to use MFA when accessing their accounts, as it was offered
as an optional security feature, and the Commissioner does not consider
that mandating its use would have resulted in any significant additional
cost to 23andMe.
161. The Commissioner notes that since 9 November 2023, 23andMe has
required all customers to use email-based two-factor authentication164
when logging into the Platform, whilst customers continue to be able to
use single sign-on services offered by Apple and Google to access their
accounts.
iv. Lack of compensatory controls
162. For the reasons set out below, the Commissioner finds that, taking into
account the absence of mandatory MFA prior to 9 November 2023,
23andMe’s failure to implement alternative technical and organisational
measures to ensure appropriate security of the personal data, in the
form of device, browser or connection fingerprinting and access to device
history, constitutes an infringement of Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and

Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR.
163. In relation to device, browser, connection or other fingerprinting, the
ICO Security Outcomes state that controllers should “detect security
events that affect the systems that process personal data” and “monitor
authorised customer access to that data, including anomalous customer
activity.” The guidance further states that controllers should “record
customer access to personal data” and “where unexpected events or
indications of a personal data breach are detected, \[controllers should\]
have processes in place to act upon these events as necessary in an
appropriate timeframe.”165
164. Furthermore, NCSC Guidance on Logging and Protective Monitoring166
to which controllers are directed by the ICO Security Outcomes167, states
that organisations should conduct “monitoring of device state and
compliance”, whilst also recommending that organisations “log device
events, including customer activity, network communications
authentication and access, to both devices and services.” Doing so will,
according to the NCSC, provide organisations with “the ability to detect
and respond to security events. Where possible \[organisations\] should
automate detection and remediation.”168
165. The Commissioner’s view is that implementation of device, browser or
connection fingerprinting would have been appropriate technical
measures to mitigate the risk of unauthorised access to customer
accounts, particularly as compensatory measures in light of the absence
of mandatory MFA.

device, browser, connection or other fingerprinting.169 23andMe
informed the Commissioner that it elected not to implement device,
browser or connection fingerprinting due to the other security controls
it had implemented as well as privacy concerns regarding the collection
of additional information from customers.170 The Commissioner
considers this to be an inadequate explanation for the failure to
implement these measures. The Commissioner notes that 23andMe’s
Privacy Policy states that it collects “Web-Behaviour Information:
Information on how you use our Services or about the way your devices
use our Services is collected through log files, cookies, web beacons,
and similar technologies (e.g. device information, device identifiers, IP
address, browser type, location, domains, page views).”171 Therefore, it
is clear that 23andMe already collected the personal data required in
order to produce and verify a customer’s device or connection, but did
not use this information for the purposes of verifying that an attempt to
log into a customer’s account was genuine.
167. In addition to the lack of fingerprinting, 23andMe did not allow
customers to view a device history indicating what devices had accessed,
and were currently being used to access, the Platform with their
credentials.172
168. Whilst this is not a specific requirement under the UK GDPR, the
Commissioner regards such a system of device visibility as one of the
range of possible technical security measures that it would have been
appropriate for 23andMe to implement in this context. The ICO guidance
on steps that individuals should take if they experience a personal data

breach173 directs them to the NCSC’s guidance for individuals and
families on how to protect themselves from the impact of data breaches,
which recommends that customers check whether there have been any
logins or attempted logins into their accounts from strange locations or
at unusual times.174
169. If such a system had been in place, it may have enabled 23andMe
customers whose accounts were successfully credential stuffed to
identify the threat actor’s activity as an anomalous and unexplained
entry in the list of devices used to access the customers’ accounts. This,
in turn, could have led to the customers themselves reporting such
irregularities to 23andMe in advance of the actual discovery of the Data
Breach in October 2023.
170. The Commissioner is of the view that had these compensatory controls
been implemented they would have constituted appropriate technical
measures which, when combined with the other necessary technical and
organisational measures would have ensured an appropriate level of
security to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the Affected UK
Data Subjects’ personal data.
171. The Commissioner notes that as of 31 December 2024, 23andMe has
implemented a number of additional monitoring and alerting measures
which are intended to detect unauthorised activity in customer accounts.
This includes deploying and carrying
out risk-based activity monitoring. In addition, 23andMe has

implemented a trusted browser functionality, which allows customers to
register a “trusted device” used to access their 23andMe account for a
period of 400 days and offers an “Account Event History” report which
customers can download and which displays every login, attempted login
and download with the associated IP address and approximate location
(based on the IP address).176
(b) Failure to implement additional protections for Raw
Genetic Data
172. The Commissioner finds that by failing to operate any additional
verification steps prior to customers accessing or downloading Raw
Genetic Data during the Relevant Period, 23andMe failed to comply with
its obligations under Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1) UK GDPR
to implement technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of
security of Affected UK Data Subjects’ personal data which was
appropriate to the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights
and freedoms of natural persons when taking into account the sensitive
nature of such personal data and the context and purposes of the
processing.
173. The Commissioner finds that this failure exposed the Raw Genetic Data
of customers whose accounts had been credential stuffed to
unauthorised access and processing by the threat actor. In addition, the
Commissioner regards this failure as particularly significant in light of
the lack of default technical security measures applied during the login
process at the time of the Data Breach, particularly the absence of
mandatory MFA.
174. As explained in Section VI(B) above, the Raw Genetic Data processed
by 23andMe constitutes genetic data within the meaning of Article 4(13)
UK GDPR, which is listed as a form special category data under Article
176 What’s In Your Account Settings? – 23andMe Customer Care (accessed 8 May 2025)
CONFIDENTIAL

59
9(1) UK GDPR177 and thus “merit\[s\] higher protection.”178 This enhanced
level of protection is required for genetic data due to its unique and
unchanging nature, as well as its commonality among related persons.
In the Commissioner’s view, in light of the higher level of protection that
special category data requires and the inherent sensitivity of genetic
data, it would have been appropriate for 23andMe to have implemented
additional verification measures before customers were able to access
or download their Raw Genetic Data.
175. When assessing the Infringements, it is necessary to consider not only
the information which was actually obtained in the course of the Data
Breach, but also the personal data which was put at risk by 23andMe’s
failure to comply with the requirements of Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and
Article 32(1) UK GDPR.
176. As explained at paragraph 38 above, during the Relevant Period there
was a short delay following a Raw Genetic Data download request whilst
the file was generated.179 23andMe customers were sent an email alert
when the file was available for download, with the customer required to
log back into their account in order to complete the process.180 23andMe
also confirmed that at the time of the Data Breach, once an individual
logged into their account (including after completing a MFA check, if
enabled by the customer), there were no additional authentication steps
before the customer could access their Raw Genetic Data, self-reported
177 Article 9(1) UK GDPR provides that “Processing of personal data revealing racial or
ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union
membership, and the processing of genetic, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely

177. Following the Data Breach, on 2 November 2023, 23andMe temporarily
disabled its self-service Raw Genetic Data download feature. During the
period of suspension, customers were required to authenticate their
identities with the company’s Customer Care team in order to download
their Raw Genetic Data. The self-service Raw Genetic Data download
service was re-enabled on 27 February 2024, at which time 23andMe
introduced an additional verification step requiring customers to provide
the date of birth used to register for their account before the download
could be initiated.182
178. The Commissioner notes that there are industry concerns regarding the
use of dates of birth as a method of verification because birth dates can
often be found in public records, ascertained from intelligence research,
or exposed in previous data breaches, meaning that this information
may be otherwise available to a threat actor.183
179. 23andMe informed the Commissioner that in August 2023, the company
“analysed the possibility of requiring customers to take additional steps
prior to being able to download their uninterpreted genotype data.”184
However, no additional steps were implemented until after the Data
Breach was discovered and operation of the self-service download
feature was suspended on 2 November 2023. 23andMe has not provided
its rationale for the decision in August 2023 not to require customers to

180. The appropriateness of the technical and organisational security
measures which a controller is required to implement in accordance with
Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR must be considered in light of the type of
personal data being processed and the risks posed by such processing
to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Therefore, where special
category data or other forms of sensitive personal data are processed
and, as a result, the risks posed to the rights and freedoms of data
subjects are greater, the controller must implement additional or more
stringent measures in order to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of
the personal data in question.
181. 23andMe informed the Commissioner that the Internal Investigation
found that no Affected UK Data Subjects’ Raw Genetic Data had been
downloaded by the threat actor.
182. However, the Commissioner’s investigation identified significant
concerns regarding the methodology used by 23andMe to identify both
credential stuffed accounts and, in particular, attempts by the threat
actor to access and download individuals’ Raw Genetic Data.
183. 23andMe informed the Commissioner that it identified IP addresses used
by the threat actor on the basis of one of two indicators:
a) the IP address was used to log into a customer account and, when
it did so, the HTTP referrer field was empty and a specific customer
agent string was provided; or
b) the IP address was observed scraping data from an endpoint
containing the unique signature “/p/1/”.
184. 23andMe then examined the login history for compromised accounts and

identified logins from IP addresses associated with the threat actor which
were followed by a Raw Genetic Download event from the same account
within a six-hour period. If there was such a login from a known threat
actor IP address within the six-hours prior to a Raw Genetic Data
download event, this was considered to be potentially attributable to the
threat actor.185
185. 23andMe also informed the Commissioner that when a customer
requested a full download of their Raw Genetic Data, it routinely placed
the data into an
. However, 23andMe did not collect the logs
available from which were created when this data was
subsequently downloaded. Instead, 23andMe created its own bespoke
log of such download events. Due to a “bug in the system”, the bespoke
log entry generated when Raw Genetic Data was downloaded incorrectly
recorded an internal IP Address (127.0.0.1), rather than the IP address
associated with the customer who initiated the download request.186 This
misconfiguration in 23andMe’s logging system remained undetected
until it was identified in the course of the Internal Investigation.
186. As a result of this misconfiguration, 23andMe was not able to establish
which IP addresses were being used to initiate each download of Raw
Genetic Data. This prevented 23andMe from searching for Raw Genetic
Data downloads linked to IP addresses known to have been used by the
threat actor, resulting in it employing the methodology set out above.

a letter from the ICO and OPC dated 20 June 2024): Response to questions 35 and 39.
23andMe initially indicated in its response to question 35 that it only searched for Raw
Genetic Data download events which occurred within of a login from an IP
address associated with the threat actor, but later revised this response in a letter from
Greenberg Traurig LLP to the ICO and OPC dated 22 November 2024, confirming that a

187. Furthermore, the methodology employed by 23andMe during the
Internal Investigation failed to account for multiple viable methods
which the threat actor could have used in order to initiate a Raw Genetic
Data download.
188. As a result, the Commissioner proposed an alternative methodology,
pursuant to which any Raw Genetic Data download event which occurred
after an account was compromised would be regarded as a potentially
unauthorised download by the threat actor.
189. At the Commissioner’s request, 23andMe confirmed that of the
additional 257 accounts187 which the Commissioner had identified as
having recorded a Raw Genetic Data download event after the date on
which they were credential stuffed, nine accounts related to Affected UK
Data Subjects.188
190. However, in its Written Representations, 23andMe explained that it had
further reviewed evidence of Raw Genetic Data downloads in credential
stuffed accounts and provided a report detailing the methodology that
was used.189 Applying its revised methodology, 23andMe found that the
threat actor downloaded Raw Genetic Data relating to four customers
worldwide, none of whom were in the UK.190
191. However, regardless of the number of 23andMe customers whose Raw
Genetic Data was downloaded by the threat actor, the absence of
additional step-up authentication measures in the download process, at
the time of the Date Breach, meant that Raw Genetic Data was available
to the threat actor once they had successfully credential stuffed an

192. As explained at paragraphs 185 to 186 above, at the time of the Data
Breach 23andMe’s security measures did not allow it to accurately verify
that Raw Genetic Data downloads were initiated by genuine 23andMe
customers. This not only prevented 23andMe from detecting the threat
actor’s activity in real time, but also inhibited the subsequent Internal
Investigation. Furthermore, regardless of the extent to which Raw
Genetic Data was downloaded by the threat actor, they were able to
obtain sensitive personal data relating to large numbers of 23andMe
customers via the DNA Relatives feature on the Platform. This
information would have enabled the threat actor to draw inferences
regarding the racial and ethnic origins of 23andMe customers and
therefore constitutes inferred special category data.191
(c) Failure to prepare for a credential stuffing attack
193. For the reasons set out below, the Commissioner finds that 23andMe
infringed Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1)(d) UK GDPR, by
failing to implement an appropriate process for regularly testing,
assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and
organisational measures for ensuring the security of its processing
systems and services. Specifically, prior to the Data Breach, 23andMe
failed to carry out any form of environmental scanning for potential risks
to its systems, whilst its penetration and security testing did not simulate
a credential stuffing attack, despite this being widely recognised as a
significant risk to providers of customer facing online services which has
affected multiple organisations operating in many sectors of the
191 ICO Guidance on Special Category Data states that “The UK GDPR is clear that special
category data includes not only personal data that specifies relevant details, but also
personal data revealing or concerning these details… If the information itself does not
clearly reveal or concern something about one of the special categories, it may still be
possible to infer or guess details about someone that do fall within those categories.”

194. ICO Guidance on Data Security under the UK GDPR193 states that
controllers should “have a process for regularly testing, assessing and
evaluating the effectiveness of any measures \[they\] put in place. What
these tests look like, and how regularly \[the controller\] does them will
depend on \[the controller’s\] own circumstances… whatever scope \[the
controller\] chooses for this testing should be appropriate to what \[it is\]
doing, how \[it is\] doing it, and the data that \[it is\] processing.” The ICO
guidance further states that controllers can discharge this obligation by
using a number of techniques, “such as vulnerability scanning and
penetration testing”, with these techniques functioning as “stress tests
of \[the controller’s\] network and information systems which are
designed to reveal areas of potential risk and things that \[the controller\]
can improve.”
195. Penetration testing is defined by the NCSC as, “a method for gaining
assurance in the security of an IT system by attempting to breach some
or all of that system’s security, using the same tools and techniques as
an adversary might… A well scoped penetration test can give confidence
that the products and security controls tested have been configured in
accordance with good practice.” When scoping a penetration test, NCSC
guidance states that “where the goal of the test is to ensure good
vulnerability management… risk owners should outline any areas of
special concern.”194
192 For example, video streaming service Netflix experienced a credential stuffing attack in
2019, whilst approximately 160,000 Nintendo account users were affected in a credential
stuffing attack in 2020. Also in 2020, hackers used compromised credentials to target
300,000 Spotify accounts and the login credentials of an estimated 500,000 Zoom users
were extracted from a database and placed for sale on crime forums and dark web
markets. More recently, payment services provider PayPal was targeted by a credential
stuffing attack in December 2022 which affected an estimated 34,942 of its users, whilst in
December 2023 restaurant chain Jason’s Deli alerted members of its rewards scheme that
their personal data had potentially been exposed in a credential stuffing attack.

196. Furthermore, regardless of the form of testing which is undertaken, ICO
Guidance on Data Security confirms that controllers should “document
the results and make sure that \[they\] act upon any recommendations,
or have a valid reason for not doing so and implement appropriate
safeguards. This is particularly important if your testing reveals potential
critical flaws that could result in a personal data breach.”195
197. The guidance referred to above indicates that a controller may discharge
its obligations under Article 32(1)(d) UK GDPR by regularly performing
vulnerability or environmental scanning in order to identify the internal
and external sources of risk to the security of its processing operations,
and by using penetration testing as a means of evaluating the
effectiveness of its security measures in defending against the risks
identified.
198. 23andMe informed the Commissioner that, prior to the Data Breach,
none of its penetration tests or security exercises simulated a credential
stuffing attack.196 Nor did 23andMe prepare any reports in relation to its
penetration testing which is inconsistent with the ICO guidance referred
to above.197
199. The Commissioner finds that 23andMe’s failure to incorporate testing for
a credential stuffing attack within its vulnerability assessment and
penetration testing procedures constituted a failure to implement an
appropriate process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the
effectiveness of its technical and organisational security measures, as
required by Article 32(1)(d) UK GDPR. Whilst it is ultimately for the
controller to determine how such assessments and tests are conducted,
including which threats are simulated and how often they are performed,

200. 23andMe’s failure to account for the threat of credential stuffing attacks
within its vulnerability assessments and penetration tests resulted in a
failure to test the robustness of the security measures integrated into
its login process, evaluate the effectiveness of the measures employed
to detect unauthorised activity on customer accounts, and improve the
speed and effectiveness of its incident response processes, all of which
left the Platform more vulnerable to a credential stuffing attack.

Zoom,204 should have resulted in 23andMe being aware of the risk of
such an attack targeting its Platform and customers’ accounts. In
addition, 23andMe’s Internal Investigation identified ”eight separate
accounts that may have been accessed in isolated incidents of credential
stuffing in 2019 and 2020,”205 indicating that the Data Breach did not
constitute the first occasion on which the Platform had been targeted by
this form of attack and further reinforcing the seriousness of its failure
to implement and test the effectiveness of its technical and
organisational measures against credential-based attacks.
202. The Commissioner notes that since October 2023, 23andMe has used
generated accounts to test against credential stuffing attacks.206 At the
Oral Hearing, 23andMe informed the Commissioner that it had carried
out five cyber security tabletop exercises in the company’s 2025 financial
year and had updated its product alerts to detect abuse by potential

to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of Affected UK Data Subjects’
personal data by failing to implement appropriate measures to monitor
for and detect unauthorised third-party activity on customer accounts.
Specifically, 23andMe’s rate-limiting rules, managed and operated on its
behalf by , failed to detect and alert either 23andMe or
to the high volume of both successful and unsuccessful login
attempts by the threat actor.
204. The Commissioner finds that 23andMe:
a) missed multiple opportunities to identify the Data Breach prior to
October 2023;
b) failed to appropriately investigate evidence provided directly to the
company in August 2023 of a large-scale personal data breach
affecting the Platform; and
c) deployed an organisational response to the eventual discovery and
verification of the Data Breach in October 2023 which was not
appropriate in light of the risks posed by its processing operations
to the rights and freedoms of its customers.
205. The following four sub-sections set out the reasons for the
Commissioner’s findings, and specifically address 23andMe’s failure to:
a) implement a system of device or connection monitoring or
suspicious activity alerts;
b) implement effective rate-limiting rules and alerts;
c) monitor for and detect anomalous customer activity; and
d) implement an appropriate organisational response to evidence of a
personal data breach.
i. Lack of device or connection monitoring or suspicious activity alerts
206. The Commissioner finds that 23andMe failed to implement appropriate
technical and organisational security measures as required by Article
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
70
5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1) UK GDPR by failing to implement
device or connection monitoring or suspicious activity alerts. This failure
had the effect of leaving the Platform exposed to a preventable brute
force cyberattack, whilst also depriving customers of the ability to
monitor and protect the security of their accounts.
207. Customers were not alerted when a new device, IP address or browser
was used to access the Platform using their credentials. The ICO
Guidance on Passwords in Online Services states that organisations
should consider implementing a “risk-based approach to verifying
authentication attempts. For example, if a customer logs in from a new
device or IP address \[the organisation\] might consider requesting a
second authentication factor and informing the customer by another
contact method of the login attempt.” The ICO guidance also
recommends that organisations should “consider providing customers
with the facility to review a list of unsuccessful login attempts. This will
allow people who might be specifically targeted to check for potential
attacks manually. However, this will only be useful if \[the organisation\]
pays attention to reports from individuals that their accounts are being
attacked.” 208
208. Alerts regarding login attempts from an unrecognised device or IP
address are used by a range of other organisations operating online
account-based services, for example Google209 and Microsoft,210 in order
to alert customers to unusual activity on their account, such as a login
from a new device or previously unused email address. These alerts may
instruct customers to contact the organisation in question or take steps
to protect their accounts (such as changing their login credentials)

where they do not recognise the activity in question.
209. Such a system could have been used to alert 23andMe customers whose
accounts were credential stuffed when the threat actor logged into their
accounts from a device and IP address which had not previously been
used to access the Platform using their credentials. This could also have
resulted in customers reporting such suspicious activity to 23andMe
itself and enabled the detection of the Data Breach at an earlier stage,
thus reducing the duration and severity of the Infringements.
210. As referred to at paragraph 171 above, the Commissioner notes that
23andMe now provides a trusted browser functionality, which allows
customers to register a “trusted device” used to access their 23andMe
account for a period of 400 days and offers an “Account Event History”
report which customers can download and which displays every login,
attempted login and download with the associated IP address and
approximate location (based on the IP address).211
ii. Ineffective rate-limiting rules and alerts
211. The Commissioner finds that 23andMe failed to implement appropriate
technical and organisational security measures as required by Article
5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1) UK GDPR by failing to implement
effective rate-limiting rules and alerts.
212. The ICO Security Outcomes state that organisations should “ensure that
\[they\] are rate-limiting or throttling the number and frequency of
incorrect login attempts. The precise number of attempts and the
consequences of exceeding these limits will be for \[the organisation\] to
decide based on the specific requirements of \[the\] organisation, but
limiting to a certain number per hour, day and month is a good idea.”212

services were used to log all events within the 23andMe Platform, with
such events then being correlated and stored within the

214. 23andMe informed the Commissioner that a range of
managed rules were in place at the time of the Data Breach to detect
and respond to potential attacks. In addition, 23andMe stated that it
implemented a range of rate-limiting rules which were set up in order
to limit the amount of traffic from a given IP address. These rules looked
for patterns, and, based on the frequency of these patterns, blocked the
flow of traffic to and from a particular IP address for a given period of
time.217 23andMe further stated that its alert system sufficiently
detected breached credential testing by identifying multiple
authentications from the same IP source within a certain time period.218

73
limiting rules had not been triggered by the threat actor’s activity due
to their rotation of thousands of unique IP addresses when accessing
accounts during the Data Breach, meaning that the login activity was
not detected as being irregular or unusual. 23andMe cited the fact that
in May 2023, the threat actor had conducted successful login attempts
from 7,813 IP addresses and had attempted further unsuccessful login
attempts from 4,156 IP addresses. The threat actor was also found to
have used approximately 2,000 IP addresses to scrape DNA Relatives
profile information.219 23andMe further stated that the rate-limiting
requests to access Raw Genetic Data would not have had any effect on
the detection of the Data Breach given the threat actor downloaded and
accessed the Raw Genetic Data for a small number of customers.
216. However, 23andMe previously informed the Commissioner that between
1 May and 16 May 2023, the threat actor carried out approximately
183,380 failed logins and 9,974 successful logins, whilst between 12
September and 18 September 2023, the threat actor carried out a
further 89,762 unsuccessful and 4,500 successful login attempts (see
Figure 7 below).220

217. Therefore, whilst the threat actor’s rotation of large numbers of IP
addresses may have prevented 23andMe’s rate-limiting rules from
detecting the unauthorised activity, 23andMe failed to identify a
significant distortion of the ratio of successful to unsuccessful login
attempts in favour of the latter, when this ratio should, in ordinary
circumstances and as illustrated in Figure 7 above, remain relatively
stable at approximately 80% successful and 20% unsuccessful. In
comparison, Figure 7 above illustrates that during the peak of the threat
actor’s credential stuffing activity this ratio fell to approximately 70%
successful and 30% unsuccessful logins. Whilst 23andMe’s security

system failed to detect any unusual or suspicious activity at the relevant
time, the Internal Investigation retrospectively uncovered “large spikes
of failed and unsuccessful logins for the certain periods in 2023 between
May 1 and September 18.”222
218. 23andMe’s rate-limiting rules were not capable of detecting the threat
actor’s attempts to access and download customers’ Raw Genetic Data.
23andMe’s measures failed to detect, in real time, the abnormally large
number of account login attempts, both successful and unsuccessful,
and the significant changes to the ratio between the two. If the threat
actor’s login attempts had been detected at this stage and an
investigation initiated, this could have resulted in 23andMe detecting the
Data Breach and taking measures in response at a far earlier stage.
219. In light of the deficiencies in 23andMe’s rate-limiting system and
broader monitoring measures, the Commissioner finds that either such
measures were ineffective as a means of alerting 23andMe’s security
team to potentially unauthorised and illegitimate activity on the
Platform, or its organisational measures did not ensure that indicators
of malicious activity were investigated in a prompt and appropriate
manner. The Commissioner also understands that the thresholds applied
by 23andMe for triggering detection alerts were set manually, resulting
in those thresholds lacking flexibility to respond to changes in usage
patterns and quickly becoming outdated. The Commissioner’s view is
that the manual setting of thresholds increased the risk of alerts not
being triggered or alerts being triggered in inappropriate circumstances.
220. The Commissioner finds that 23andMe’s failure to detect the threat
actor’s activity represents further evidence of its failure to implement
appropriate technical and organisational measures which ensured a level
of confidentiality and integrity of Affected UK Data Subjects’ personal

operations and the risks posed to its customers’ rights and freedoms.
However, the Commissioner notes 23andMe’s update at the Oral
Hearing that, as of 31 December 2024 it had:
a) reconfigured its internal logs so that its Security Team can better
track and identify malicious activities
;
b) introduced over SIEM (security information and event
management) detection alerts and new product rules; and
c) created various new rate-limiting rules through
.223 At the Oral Hearing 23andMe also
confirmed that it has continued to adjust these rate-limiting rules
based on traffic activities or indication of attack.
iii. Failure to monitor and detect anomalous customer activity
221. The Commissioner finds that 23andMe failed to implement appropriate
technical and organisational security measures as required by Article
5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1) UK GDPR by failing to implement an
appropriate and effective system to monitor for, detect and investigate
evidence of anomalous and potentially unauthorised activity on the
Platform.

expected to detect security events that affect the systems that process
personal data and to monitor authorised customer access to that
data.225 This includes recording customer access to personal data, with

timeframe.226 The Commissioner’s Accountability Framework also states
that controllers should take steps to prevent unauthorised access to
systems and applications, including by logging and monitoring user and
system activity to detect anything unusual.227
223. 23andMe informed the Commissioner that in the course of the Internal
Investigation it reviewed login patterns to identify any irregularities.
23andMe indicated that it was aware of normal patterns of customer
behaviour on the Platform, stating that when customers access the login
page from the main 23andMe.com site, the HTTP referrer is the main
login page. However, during the Internal Investigation, 23andMe
identified a login pattern where attempts were made to log in to
accounts, but the HTTP referrer was empty. Following further analysis,
23andMe identified large increases in both successful and unsuccessful
login attempts which did not display a HTTP referrer for certain periods
between 1 May and 18 September 2023.228
224. This indicates that the threat actor’s pattern of activity on the Platform
deviated from that observed when legitimate customers accessed their
accounts. However, this abnormal pattern of activity was only detected
during the Internal Investigation, with 23andMe having no system in
place to monitor and investigate such deviations from standard
customer behavioural patterns in real time during the Relevant Period.
225. 23andMe informed the Commissioner that it engaged to
protect the Platform against malicious activity, such as

used for the detection and notification of security events and incident
management across the Platform.229 However, on the basis of the

information provided to the Commissioner, it appears that 23andMe did
not proactively monitor for, detect or investigate unusual patterns of
customer behaviour, such as that displayed by the threat actor.
226. The Commissioner acknowledges that monitoring and logging of
abnormal customer behaviour is not a specific requirement set out in
the UK GDPR. However, the Commissioner’s Accountability
Framework230 confirms that implementing such a monitoring and
logging system is expected as part of the measures a controller must
put in place to prevent unauthorised access to their systems, as required
by Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR. The
Commissioner therefore regards the absence of such monitoring and
logging measures as further evidence in support of his finding that the
technical and organisational measures implemented by 23andMe were
not appropriate to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity and
resilience of its processing systems and services.
227. The fact that the threat actor’s activity was detected as anomalous in
the course of the Internal Investigation indicates that 23andMe both
understood how its customers generally accessed their accounts and
possessed the technical ability and means of detecting abnormal use
patterns within the Platform.
228. Therefore, the Commissioner’s view is that neither the costs of
implementing such a system of proactive monitoring and investigation
of potential security events, nor the availability of the required software
and technology are factors that would have prevented the adoption of
such a system, whether through a third-party service or internally, as
part of a range of appropriate technical and organisational security
measures as required by Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR.
229. This failure to implement appropriate technical and organisation
230 Records management and security | ICO

79
measures to monitor and detect anomalous customer activity is
evidenced by the multiple opportunities which 23andMe missed to detect
the Data Breach prior to October 2023. The ICO Security Outcomes state
that controllers should have processes in place to detect unexpected
events or indications of a personal data breach and processes in place
to act upon those events as necessary in an appropriate timeframe.231
When assessing 23andMe’s processes for detecting unexpected events
or indications of a personal data breach, the Commissioner notes that,
between 28 July and 30 July 2023, the threat actor unsuccessfully
attempted to automate the transfer of ownership of approximately 400
customer profiles. 23andMe confirmed in its Written Representations
that it took various steps in response to the July Attempted Profile
Transfers including mandating a password reset for 400 customers,
disabling all profile transfer requests, placing a temporary lock on
accounts suspected of having attempted a malicious transfer and
introducing a new systems alert for
. However, the Commissioner
notes that despite undertaking an internal investigation after
discovering the July Attempted Profile Transfers, 23andMe failed to
detect the threat actor’s wider activity on the Platform, or launch a wider
investigation into potential unauthorised access to customer accounts,
resulting in the Data Breach continuing for a further two months.
230. Furthermore the Commissioner notes that there were deficiencies in
23andMe’s logging and event monitoring. As stated at paragraph 185
above, 23andMe did not collect the logs generated by when a
customer requested a download of their Raw Genetic Data, whilst
23andMe’s bespoke logging system erroneously recorded an internal IP

80
address, rather than the IP address associated with the customer who
initiated the Raw Genetic Data download.233 This misconfiguration in
23andMe’s logging system was only discovered during the Internal
Investigation in October and November 2023.
231. As a result of this misconfiguration, 23andMe was unable to establish
which IP address had been used to initiate each download of Raw
Genetic Data, meaning that it was unable to search for Raw Genetic
Data downloads linked to IP addresses known to have been used by the
threat actor. This meant that 23andMe was forced to employ the
methodology explained at paragraphs 183 and 184 above in an attempt
to retrospectively identify Raw Genetic Data downloads by the threat
actor.
232. In the Commissioner’s view, 23andMe’s failure to collect and store direct
logs generated by when a customer initiated a Raw Genetic Data
download represents a significant omission. The logging of such access
requests in the is not technically complex,
particularly as the security products provided to 23andMe by
and are both designed to be compatible with .
Meanwhile, Raw Genetic Data downloads by 23andMe customers were
relatively infrequent,234 meaning that retaining the logs would not have
been likely to result in 23andMe incurring significant additional costs.
Furthermore, directly generating the logs from the
would have reduced the potential for error and would have
enabled a more expeditious and effective investigation by 23andMe.
233. The Commissioner notes that, as explained at paragraph 220 above,
since the Data Breach 23andMe has reconfigured its internal logs so that
its security team can better track and identify malicious activities

iv. Failure to implement an appropriate organisational response to
evidence of a personal data breach
234. As set out below, the Commissioner finds that 23andMe failed to
implement appropriate organisational security measures in accordance
with Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR by failing to
respond appropriately to evidence of a personal data breach by:
a) deciding to allocate the August 2023 Messages the lowest level of
priority rating within the 23andMe Cyber Incident Response
Procedure;
b) undertaking limited investigations following receipt of the August
2023 Messages; and
c) failing to consider that these incidents constituted potential
evidence of genuine malicious activity.
235. 23andMe informed the Commissioner that it only became aware of the
Data Breach on 1 October 2023 after an employee reported seeing a
post on the Reddit platform offering data allegedly stolen from the
Platform for sale, with this subsequently leading to the Internal
Investigation being initiated.236
236. However, the Commissioner finds that 23andMe missed multiple
opportunities before this date to detect and respond to the threat actor’s
attack.
237. The Commissioner notes that 23andMe’s response to the August 2023
Messages demonstrated an organisational failure by 23andMe to
respond to evidence of a personal data breach. 23andMe opened an
incident log following receipt of the August 2023 Messages, in the form
235 23andMe Written Representations, 18 April 2025: Paragraph 16.6
236 Third Data Breach Report Form

82
of the Ticket.237 The incident was only allocated a severity
rating of “should have”, which, according to 23andMe’s Cyber Incident
Response Procedure,238 is the lowest level of priority classification
available, with other examples of “should have” incidents including a
lost laptop or ID badge.
238. The low level of priority classification attributed to the August 2023
Messages was inappropriate given that the Ticket contained
reference to the Subreddit Post, including screenshots of posts
containing images of the DNA Relatives profiles of and
her former husband . The responses within the
Ticket indicate that 23andMe’s Cyber Incident Response Team attributed
a low level of priority to the August 2023 Messages on the basis that
and had publicly shared their 23andMe profile, meaning
that this information would be visible to any of either individual’s DNA
Relatives, and therefore did not constitute evidence of “outside access
to \[23andMe customer\] account\[s\].”239
239. A comment on the Ticket dated 15 August 2023, stated that
any stolen data from 23andMe systems would presumably have been
posted on an invite-only dark net site, which the Cyber Incident
Response Team did not have the capability to access. The
Ticket did not contain any response to, or follow up on this comment.
Had 23andMe’s security team arranged for other dark net platforms to
be checked at this time, there is a significant possibility that they would
have seen the Hydra Post which contained content and wording which

was very similar to the August 2023 Messages and the posts on the
23andMe Subreddit. 23andMe only established a link between the Hydra
Post and the August 2023 Messages on 8 October 2023 when the
Ticket was updated with a link to the Hydra Post.240
240. On 18 August 2023, the Ticket was closed by the Cyber
Incident Response Team on the basis that the August 2023 Messages
were deemed to have been a “hoax,” with one comment stating that
there was “no evidence of unauthorised data exposure” and another that
whilst “some data was accessed, it was not to the levels outlined in this
claim.”241 There is no evidence to suggest that the Ticket was
escalated beyond the Cyber Incident Response Team.
241. Whilst the figures quoted in the August 2023 Messages, which claimed
that the personal data relating to 10 million 23andMe customers had
been exfiltrated, were exaggerated, the updates added to the
Ticket on 12 December 2023 demonstrate that 23andMe later
established that they related to the same security incident which was
subsequently identified and verified as genuine in October 2023.
Furthermore, the Ticket failed to include reference to the July
Login Spike and the July Attempted Profile Transfer, with there being no
indication that 23andMe ever considered that the events may be linked.
242. 23andMe did not disclose the August 2023 Messages to the
Commissioner until October 2024.242 The August 2023 Messages did not
feature in the personal data breach reports submitted by 23andMe to
the Commissioner, nor in the company’s initial responses to requests for

information from the ICO and the OPC. The only indication that the
threat actor had made contact with 23andMe in August 2023 was a
reference to the threat actor having emailed 23andMe in the Hydra Post
which was visible in a screenshot within an
Report dated 19 October 2023243 which was disclosed to the
ICO and OPC as an exhibit to 23andMe’s letter dated 13 August 2024.
243. 23andMe informed the Commissioner that it did not consider
implementing any additional security or monitoring measures following
the August 2023 Messages as “there was no indication of unauthorised
access.”244 However, the proximity of the July Login Spike, the July
Attempted Profile Transfer and the August 2023 Messages should have
been sufficient to increase 23andMe’s alert level and could reasonably
have been expected to have led to a full investigation being
commissioned into the accumulating evidence of malicious activity in
August 2023. Furthermore, the fact that the August 2023 Messages
contained claims of a theft of significant amounts of customer data
should, according to the 23andMe Cyber Incident Response Procedure,
have led to the messages being classified as a high priority incident.245
244. In addition, 23andMe’s response to the August 2023 Messages focused
solely on the accounts of and on the basis
that they were named in the August 2023 Messages, which also included
extracts of their DNA Relatives Profile information. The investigation
focused exclusively on evidence of unauthorised access to these two
accounts and, when none was found, was quickly closed, with the
August 2023 Messages being dismissed as a hoax. The Commissioner

has not been presented with any evidence to indicate that 23andMe
conducted a broader search for any other indicators of unauthorised
activity, such as analysis of patterns of successful and unsuccessful login
attempts.
245. The fact that such steps were taken in October 2023 and ultimately led
to the confirmation of a credential stuffing attack, demonstrates that
23andMe had the resources and technical ability to conduct such an
investigation. The Commissioner therefore finds that the failure to do so
in August 2023 constitutes evidence of 23andMe’s failure to implement
organisational measures which ensured that actual or potential security
incidents were identified, logged and investigated in a manner which
was appropriate in light of the sensitivity of such data and the potential
consequences of a personal data breach affecting the Platform.
246. 23andMe’s inadequate response to the accumulated evidence of
unauthorised activity on the Platform, including the July Login Spike, the
July Attempted Profile Transfer and the August 2023 Messages meant
that the company’s limited and insufficient security controls and
authentication measures remained in place for a further two months,
during which time Customer Personal Data remained accessible to the
threat actor.246
(e) Assessment of compliance as of 31 December 2024
247. On 4 March 2025, the Commissioner informed247 23andMe that he
intended to issue an enforcement notice pursuant to section 149 DPA
2018 (in addition to a penalty notice pursuant to section 155 DPA 2018).
248. The proposed enforcement notice would have required 23andMe to
implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in
accordance with Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1) UK GDPR.

accounts after the Ticket was closed on 18 August 2023.

249. On 18 April 2025, the Commissioner received the Written
Representations from 23andMe, which set out the company’s response
to his intention to impose a penalty and issue an enforcement notice.
23andMe provided further detail at the Oral Hearing and by way of
written correspondence dated 6 May 2025.
250. Having considered both the written and oral representations, the
Commissioner finds that by 31 December 2024, 23andMe had
implemented appropriate measures to ensure appropriate security of
the personal data which was subject to the Relevant Processing. The
ongoing infringements of Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32 UK
GDPR were therefore remedied by that date.248
VII. DECISION TO IMPOSE A PENALTY
251. For the reasons set out below, the Commissioner has decided to impose
a penalty of £2,310,000 on 23andMe in respect of the infringements of
Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1) UK GDPR during the Relevant
Period, as described in this Penalty Notice.
A. Legal framework - Penalties
252. Section 155(1)(a) DPA 2018 provides that, if the Commissioner is
satisfied that a person has failed, or is failing, as described in section
149(2) DPA 2018, the Commissioner may, by written notice, require the
person to pay to the Commissioner an amount in sterling specified in
the notice.
253. When deciding whether to issue a penalty notice to a person, and
determining the appropriate amount of the penalty, section 155(2)(a)
DPA 2018 requires the Commissioner to have regard to the matters
listed in Article 83(1) and (2) UK GDPR, in so far as they are relevant in
the circumstances of the case.
248 As a result, there are no longer grounds to give the proposed enforcement notice.

87
254. Article 83(1) UK GDPR requires any penalty imposed by the
Commissioner to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive in each
individual case.
255. Article 83(2) UK GDPR requires the Commissioner to have due regard
to the following factors when determining whether to issue a penalty
notice and the appropriate amount of any such penalty in each individual
case:
a) the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement taking into
account the nature, scope or purpose of the processing concerned
as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of
damage suffered by them;
b) the intentional or negligent character of the infringement;
c) any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the
damage suffered by data subjects;
d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor taking into
account technical and organisational measures implemented by
them pursuant to Articles 25 and 32;
e) any relevant previous infringements by the controller or processor;
f) the degree of cooperation with the Commissioner, in order to
remedy the infringement and mitigate the possible adverse effects
of the infringement;
g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
h) the manner in which the infringement became known to the
Commissioner, in particular whether, and if so to what extent, the
controller or processor notified the infringement;
i) where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously been
ordered against the controller or processor concerned with regard
to the same subject-matter, compliance with those measures;

88
j) adherence to approved codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40, or
approved certification mechanisms pursuant to Article 42; and
k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the
circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits gained, or
losses avoid, directly or indirectly, from the infringement.249
B. The Commissioner’s decision on whether to impose a
penalty
256. Paragraphs 258 to 368 below set out the Commissioner’s assessment of
whether it is appropriate to issue a penalty in relation to the
Infringements set out above. This assessment involves consideration of
the factors in Article 83(1) and (2) UK GDPR. Those considerations are
considered in the following order, which follows the Commissioner’s Data
Protection Fining Guidance (the “Fining Guidance”)250:
a) Seriousness of the infringement (Article 83(2)(a), (b) and (g) UK
GDPR);
b) Relevant aggravating or mitigating factors (Article 83(2)(c)-(f),
(h)-(k) UK GDPR); and
c) Effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness (Article 83(1) UK
GDPR).
257. The Commissioner’s decision is to impose a penalty.
Seriousness of the Infringements
(a) The nature, gravity and duration of the Infringements (Article
83(2)(a) UK GDPR)
258. In assessing the seriousness of the Infringements, the Commissioner
249 Section 155(2)(a) DPA 2018 states that when deciding whether to issue a penalty notice
and determining the amount of the penalty, the Commissioner must have regard to the
matters listed in Article 83(1) and (2) UK GDPR to the extent that the penalty notice
concerns a matter to which the UK GDPR applies.
250 Data Protection Fining Guidance | ICO (March 2024)

89
has given due regard to their nature, gravity and duration.
i) Nature of the Infringements
259. The Commissioner has made a finding of infringement of Article 5(1)(f)
UK GDPR, which sets out the integrity and confidentiality principle for
the processing of personal data. As stated above, an infringement of
this provision is subject to the higher maximum statutory penalty,251
which is indicative of its seriousness.
260. The Commissioner finds that 23andMe’s failure to implement such
authentication and verification measures, both as part of the general
login process and the self-service Raw Genetic Data download feature,
represented a significant failure to implement technical security
measures which were appropriate in light of the risks posed by
23andMe’s processing operations to Customer Personal Data, as
required by Article 32(1) UK GDPR. The Commissioner considers that,
had 23andMe mandated MFA for all customer accounts, and/ or
implemented alternative access controls, this would have significantly
decreased the likelihood of the Platform being successfully targeted by
a credential stuffing attack. Furthermore, requiring an additional step-
up authentication measure before enabling access to the most sensitive
data within a customer account would have significantly decreased the
likelihood of the threat actor accessing and exfiltrating Raw Genetic Data
and health data.
261. In addition, simulating a credential stuffing attack as part of its security
testing programme would have alerted 23andMe to its level of exposure
to such an attack and enabled it to devise and implement measures in
response to that risk, as required by Article 32(1)(b) and (d) UK GDPR.
During the Internal Investigation, 23andMe identified eight separate
accounts that may have been accessed in isolated incidents of credential

90
stuffing in 2019 and 2020,252 which its security and monitoring
measures failed to detect at the time. If 23andMe had detected these
attacks at the time, this would have presented the company with an
opportunity to review and address the deficiencies in its security
measures, including the lack of mandatory MFA, which the threat actor
subsequently exploited in the course of the Data Breach.
262. As stated above, at the time of the Data Breach 23andMe did not have
any form of browser, device or connection fingerprinting in place on the
Platform.253 Neither did it allow customers to monitor the devices used
to access the Platform using their credentials.254 23andMe also failed to
detect significant changes in the ratio of successful to unsuccessful login
attempts, with significant increases in the latter compared to the former,
when this figure should, in ordinary circumstances, have remained
relatively stable.
263. Furthermore, the Commissioner’s investigation revealed evidence of the
inappropriateness and ineffectiveness of 23andMe’s logging, monitoring
and organisational security measures, with numerous missed
opportunities to detect the threat actor’s activities.
264. The Commissioner finds that 23andMe’s failure to (a) detect the
incidents of credential stuffing in 2019 and 2020, and (b) identify and
investigate the anomalous usage patterns displayed by the threat actor,
represent further evidence of 23andMe’s failure to implement
appropriate technical measures designed to monitor for, detect and
appropriately respond to threats to the integrity and confidentiality of
its processing systems and services, in breach of Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR

and Article 32(1)(b) UK GDPR.
265. Furthermore, 23andMe stated that it only became aware of the Data
Breach on 1 October 2023.255 However, the Commissioner finds that
both the July Login Spike and the July Attempted Profile Transfers
constituted evidence of unauthorised activity on the Platform which it is
reasonable to expect should have triggered a broader investigation into
suspected unauthorised and illegitimate activity on the Platform in July
2023. Furthermore, the August 2023 Messages directly indicated that a
significant personal data breach had occurred. Whilst an internal
incident log was created in response to the August 2023 Messages,256
23andMe:
a) did not commission a full investigation;
b) dismissed the claims as a hoax after conducting only a limited
analysis of the August 2023 Messages;
c) did not undertake a broader review of its technical and
organisational security measures; and
d) did not make any changes to its authentication and verification
measures in order to enhance the security of its login and Raw
Genetic Data download processes.
266. The Commissioner finds that 23andMe’s response to the identification
and verification of the Data Breach was inadequate given its seriousness.
In particular, the Commissioner notes 23andMe’s failure to take urgent
steps to reestablish the integrity and confidentiality of Customer
Personal Data. For example, it took 23andMe four days after verification
of the Data Breach to disable active customer sessions on the Platform257

and mandate a password reset for all customers.258 It took 23andMe
until 2 November 2023 to disable its self-service Raw Genetic Data
download feature, almost one month after the Data Breach had been
detected and verified as genuine. Mandatory MFA was only implemented
for all new and existing customer accounts on 9 November 2023, despite
23andMe almost immediately attributing the Data Breach to a credential
stuffing attack259 and MFA being widely recognised as the most effective
means of protection against such attacks.260
267. In light of the above, the Commissioner finds that the Infringements are
of a serious nature as 23andMe’s failure to implement appropriate
technical and organisational security measures exposed its customers’
highly sensitive personal data, including their special category data, to
the risk of unauthorised access and use, whilst also significantly
inhibiting its ability to detect anomalous and potentially malicious
activity on the Platform.
ii) Gravity of the Infringements
268. When assessing the gravity of the Infringements, the Commissioner has
considered the nature, scope and purposes of 23andMe’s processing, as
well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of any damage
or distress they have suffered.261
269. As regards the nature of 23andMe’s processing activities, it is of
particular significance that 23andMe customers who complete and
return a saliva collection kit entrust the company with their genetic data.
Genetic data is listed as a form of special category data in Article 9(1)

UK GDPR and, in light of its inherent sensitivity, merits specific
protection.262 Furthermore, and as explained at paragraph 318 below,
the Commissioner’s view is that the personal data contained in a
customer’s DNA Relatives profile could be inferred special category data
where it is used to make inferences about a customer’s racial or ethnic
origin based on their connections within the feature and the traits that
they share.
270. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that when devising and
implementing its technical and organisational security measures,
23andMe should have given particular consideration to:
a) the highly sensitive nature of the personal data processed on the
Platform, including genetic and other special category data;
b) the reasonable expectations of 23andMe customers who shared
their genetic and other special category data with the company
regarding the security measures in place to protect such highly
sensitive data; and
c) the extensive amounts of data sharing between customers that
takes place on the Platform which would significantly increase the
number of customers and volume of personal data which could be
affected in the event of a third-party obtaining unauthorised access
to customer accounts.
271. As regards the purposes of the processing, paragraph 59 of the Fining
Guidance263 states that the Commissioner may give greater weight to
this factor if the relevant processing is central to a controller or
processor’s main business and commercial activities.
272. The Commissioner considers that the purposes of 23andMe’s processing
is a relevant factor which increases the seriousness of the
262 Recital 51 UK GDPR

94
Infringements. 23andMe’s business model is predicated upon processing
personal data supplied by its customers, including Raw Genetic Data, in
order to generate further information about their ancestral, racial and
genetic origins, and using that information to establish connections
between customers on the basis of their shared genetic ancestry,
primarily through the DNA Relatives and Family Tree features. These
features of the Platform enable customers to view the personal data
within the DNA Relatives profiles of other customers with whom they
are connected and are a central element of 23andMe’s marketing of the
Platform.264
273. This meant that when the threat actor successfully credential stuffed a
23andMe customer account, they were not only able to access personal
data relating to the owner of that account, but also the personal data
relating to the customer’s DNA Relatives connections which they shared
on their profile.
274. This ability for 23andMe customers to share highly sensitive personal
data with 23andMe, which was then visible to their connections within
the DNA Relatives, Family Tree and Connections features, meant that
23andMe was required, pursuant to Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article
32(1) UK GDPR to implement particularly robust technical and
organisational measures in order to ensure the integrity and
confidentiality of its customer’s personal data. However, the
Commissioner finds that the technical and organisational measures in
place throughout the Relevant Period fell far below this standard and
therefore could not be considered “appropriate” for the purposes of
Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1) UK GDPR, resulting in serious
infringements of these Articles.

Relatives feature allows them to “Find your matches. Compare ancestries and traits.

275. Therefore, the Commissioner finds that, in light of the considerations set
out above, the nature and purpose of 23andMe’s processing increased
the seriousness of the Infringements.
276. When considering the scope of the processing, the Commissioner has
assessed both the territorial scope and the extent and scale of
23andMe’s processing.265
277. The Commissioner finds that 23andMe, Inc is the controller266 directly
responsible for the personal data of the company’s approximately
495,000 customers in the UK. As stated at paragraph 113 above, the
UK GDPR applies to 23andMe under Article 3(2)(a), as whilst not
established in the UK, it offers services to data subjects in the UK.
278. Paragraph 59 of the Fining Guidance states that the greater the number
of data subjects affected by the infringement, the more weight the
Commissioner will give to this factor.267 In making this assessment, the
Commissioner takes into account both the number of data subjects
potentially affected, as well as those actually affected, by an
infringement.
279. In this case, 23andMe’s failure to implement appropriate technical and
organisational security measures put at risk the personal data of the
majority of its customer base. In particular, 23andMe’s failure to
mandate the use of MFA, or implement appropriate compensatory
controls, placed the 78.3% of its customers who, at the time of the Data
Breach, had not enabled MFA and did not use a form of SSO service on
their 23andMe accounts268 at a greater risk of exposure to brute force
attacks.
265 Fining Guidance, paragraph 59
266 As defined in Article 4(7) UK GDPR as the “natural or legal person, public authority,
agency or other body which alone, or jointly with others, determines the purposes and
means of the processing of personal data.”

280. The number of data subjects whose personal data was actually affected
in the course of the Data Breach varied according to the type of personal
data that was accessed by the threat actor. 23andMe informed the
Commissioner that a total of 155,592 Affected UK Data Subjects were
affected by the Data Breach, with the threat actor having accessed:
a) Ancestry Reports relating to 120,504 Affected UK Data Subjects;
b) the DNA Relatives profiles of 120,031 Affected UK Data Subjects;
c) the Family Tree profiles of 35,561 Affected UK Data Subjects;269
d) 23andMe Health Reports relating to 320 Affected UK Data Subjects;
e) the details of health conditions self-reported by three Affected UK
Data Subjects; and
f) the Raw Genetic Data of two Affected UK Data Subjects. 270
281. Paragraph 59 of the Fining Guidance states that the Commissioner may
have regard to the number of complaints received from data subjects
about the conduct that has led to findings of infringement. However, the
absence of such complaints will not be regarded as an indication that
conduct found to infringe the UK GDPR or DPA 2018 is less serious.
282. 23andMe informed the Commissioner that its Customer Care team
received approximately 360 enquiries from UK customers relating to the
Data Breach.271 However, 23andMe has not confirmed the proportion of
these enquiries which were negative in nature, or which were treated as
complaints. In addition, 11 Affected UK Data Subjects complained to the
ICO in October 2023 following 23andMe’s initial public statements

relating to the Data Breach.
283. 23andMe informed the Commissioner that the Internal Investigation
indicated that the threat actor did not download Raw Genetic Data
relating to any Affected UK Data Subjects.272 23andMe reached the
same conclusion after re-examining Raw Genetic Data downloads in the
credential stuffed accounts during the period in which the Data Breach
occurred, claiming that its original analysis had been over-inclusive and
that only four customers globally had, in fact, had their Raw Genetic
Data downloaded by the threat actor.273 However, at the Oral Hearing,
23andMe accepted that whilst there was a small time delay as the file
was generated, there were no additional step-up authentication
measures in place which would have impeded the threat actor from
downloading Raw Genetic Data from credential stuffed accounts, had
the threat actor attempted to do so.
284. The Commissioner finds that, when assessing the seriousness of the
Infringements, it is significant that personal data relating to the majority
of 23andMe’s customer base was vulnerable to unauthorised access as
a result of 23andMe’s failure to implement appropriate technical and
organisational security measures as part of its login process. Therefore,
the Commissioner finds that the fact that a greater number of customers
were not actually affected by the Infringements was not attributable to
the effectiveness of 23andMe’s technical and organisational security
measures.
285. Furthermore, whilst 23andMe informed the Commissioner that the
threat actor accessed Raw Genetic Data relating to only two Affected UK
Data Subjects, the Commissioner considers this to be a serious
consequence of the Infringements given the particular sensitivity of

98
genetic data and the requirement in Recital 51 of the UK GDPR for it to
be given specific protection as a result.
286. In assessing the level of damage suffered the Commissioner has had
regard to both the actual damage suffered and the potential damage
and distress which could have resulted from the Infringements. In
particular, the Commissioner has considered the extent to which the
Infringements affected the rights and freedoms of Affected UK Data
Subjects, or otherwise led to them suffering, or being likely to suffer
harm, in the form of physical, material or non-material damage.274
287. Evidence which the Commissioner obtained from Affected UK Data
Subjects, which is set out in full in Annex 3 of this Penalty Notice,
demonstrated the harm that arose, or which could have arisen, as a
result of the Infringements. One Affected UK Data Subject described
feeling “extremely anxious about what \[the Data Breach\] could mean to
my personal, financial and family safety in future.”
288. An Affected UK Data Subject also stated that their 23andMe account had
“a Jewish identifier associated with it”, and that in the context of what
they described as “the conflict between Zionism and the Arab world,”
which they believed had “resulted in increases in antisemitic violence in
the UK” the ability, as they believed existed, to “target a specific group
using their DNA data” was “very concerning.”
289. Another Affected UK Data Subject stated that they “expected rigorous
privacy controls to be in place due to the nature of the information
\[23andMe\] collected,” adding that “unlike usernames, passwords and
email addresses, you can’t change your genetic makeup when a data
breach occurs.”
290. The Commissioner finds that the statements above from Affected UK
Data Subjects demonstrate that the Infringements and the Data Breach

99
which followed caused significant distress to some 23andMe customers.
291. In addition to the distress reported by Affected UK Data Subjects, the
Commissioner has considered the potential harm to 23andMe customers
which may have resulted, and which may yet result, from the
Infringements.275
292. The combination of personal data found in a DNA Relatives profile could
provide a detailed profile of an individual, including details of their race,
ethnic origin and genetic relatives. Such a combination of information,
if exploited by a maliciously motivated threat actor, could be used to
cause emotional and psychological harm, especially if used to target
individuals. The Commissioner considers that this is particularly relevant
in this case in light of the evidence in the October 2023 Online Forum
Posts that the threat actor targeted 23andMe customers of an Ashkenazi
Jewish descent.276
293. 23andMe acknowledged that customers could experience anxiety and
embarrassment if the personal data within their DNA Relatives profile
was made public. However, 23andMe considered this to be “unlikely”,
stating that “if the impacted individuals had anxiety or embarrassment
about such information being made public, or thought making such
information publicly available would harm them in some way, they would
not have shared such information with thousands of individuals on the
DNA Relatives feature.”277 23andMe also recognised that customers
whose health-related information was accessed by the threat actor may
be concerned and experience anxiety, but stated that this only applied
275 When considering the potential harms to Affected UK Data Subjects resulting from the
Infringements, the Commissioner has taken into account the categories of harm set out in
the ICO’s Data Protection Harms Taxonomy.
276 For example, the BreachForums Post Dated 17 October referred to prominent Jewish
families and an alleged Israeli attack on a hospital during the conflict between Israel and
Hamas in Gaza which began earlier that month

to a small subset of the customers affected by the Data Breach.278
23andMe submitted that over 99% of Affected UK Data Subjects had
consented to making the information contained in their DNA Relatives
Profile, Family Tree Profile and/or Ancestry Reports available to their
genetic relatives through the DNA Relatives feature and that “for the
vast majority of 23andMe customers, 90% or more of the individuals on
their DNA Relatives list are strangers who they will never know.”
23andMe also submitted that by agreeing to participate in the DNA
Relatives feature, these customers had agreed to share their personal
data with “complete strangers” and that any claims of anxiety or fear
“seem disingenuous, especially where a customer’s physical address
was not part of the information disclosed”.279
294. However, the Commissioner considers that there is a significant
difference between 23andMe customers voluntarily electing to share
their personal data with other customers in what they believed to be the
secure environment of the Platform and that personal data being
accessible to a maliciously motivated threat actor and subsequently
posted on open forums on the internet. When sharing their personal
data within the DNA Relatives feature, 23andMe customers did not
consent to, nor can they be said to have reasonably expected, their
personal data to be disclosed to a potentially unlimited and unknown
number of persons outside the Platform and in a manner which
significantly increased the risk of such data being used in a manner
which could cause them harm.
295. Therefore, the Commissioner finds that participating in the DNA
Relatives feature and sharing the personal data within their profiles with
their genetic relatives, Affected UK Data Subjects cannot be said to have
demonstrated a reduced expectation of privacy in respect of such
278 23andMe Written Representations, 18 April 2025: Paragraph 21
279 23andMe Written Representations, 18 April 2025: Paragraph 22

101
personal data. The Commissioner’s view is that Affected UK Data
Subjects had a legitimate expectation that 23andMe would have
implemented measures to ensure that such personal data was not
accessible to third parties such as the threat actor, to whom they were
not connected on the Platform.
296. In addition, in respect of some of the Affected UK Data Subjects whose
accounts were credential stuffed, the threat actor accessed their Raw
Genetic Data, personal data relating to their racial and ethnic origin,
and/or personal data relating to their health, including information on
their genetic health risks and self-reported health conditions. The
Commissioner finds that such information becoming publicly available
could lead to stigmatisation, discrimination and reputational damage,
particularly if used to target members of a particular racial or ethnic
group, or those with particular health conditions.
297. Affected UK Data Subjects who have a predisposition to, or who self-
reported a serious medical condition, could also face serious harms as a
result of such information being made public, including adverse
treatment from employers or service providers if such information was
used to assist in their decision-making regarding those individuals.
Furthermore, uses for genetic data are continuing to emerge, with the
potential for such personal data to be used by companies to develop bio-
informed and personalised products, services and advertisements, thus
exacerbating the seriousness of a loss of control over and unauthorised
access to such information. Whilst genetic information is not currently
widely used for the purposes of identification, its unique and unalterable
nature means that, in future, organisations may use it for identification
purposes in systems similar to those which currently rely on biometric
data. Therefore, unauthorised access to Raw Genetic Data could, in
future, place Affected UK Data Subjects at risk of impersonation, identity
theft and fraud.
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
298. 23andMe acknowledged that, in respect of customers whose Raw
Genetic Data and / or health data was accessed by the threat actor, “the
most severe outcome of the \[Data Breach\] could potentially be
discrimination or reputational damage due to an individual’s genotype
and / or health data becoming public.” However, 23andMe considered
that it was “highly improbable that such information will ever be used
to cause harm” as “it does not seem probable (or legal) for insurance
companies or employers to search the dark web for such information”
and that, on that basis, “there is no real risk of significant harm.”280
299. The Commissioner considers that this demonstrates 23andMe’s failure
to appreciate the extent of the distress suffered by 23andMe customers
as a result of the loss of control over their highly sensitive personal data,
whilst it also ignores the risks which are inherent in such data being
made available on the dark web and thereby becoming accessible to
maliciously motivated third parties who may seek to use it to cause
harm, either now or in the future.
300. Finally, the Infringements and the Data Breach which followed, could
have placed Affected UK Data Subjects at risk of extortion should the
threat actor, or another maliciously motivated third party, have
demanded payment in exchange for not releasing the highly sensitive
personal data contained within 23andMe accounts into the public
domain.
301. Therefore, the Commissioner finds that the seriousness of the
Infringements was exacerbated by the actual harm suffered by Affected
UK Data Subjects and the potential for further significant psychological,
reputational and financial harm to have been caused by the highly
sensitive personal data within 23andMe accounts entering the public
domain and potentially being exploited by maliciously motivated third

103
parties. 23andMe failed to recognise the potential for such harm and
emphasised the voluntary nature of the sharing of personal data within
the DNA Relatives feature, in a manner which failed to account for the
distress caused to customers as a result of the loss of control over their
sensitive personal data and the significantly greater risk of harm once
such personal data was made publicly available outside of the Platform.
Furthermore, it appears that 23andMe relied upon assurances from the
threat actor that all personal data in their possession which had been
obtained from the Platform had been destroyed and had not been sold
on as evidence of the lack of harm caused to its customers, despite, by
its own admission, being unable to confirm the veracity of those
representations.281
iii) Duration of the Infringements
302. As stated at paragraph 59 of the Fining Guidance, the longer the
duration of an infringement, the greater the weight the Commissioner
is likely to attribute to this factor due to the greater potential for harm
to have occurred.
303. As stated at paragraph 8 above, the Commissioner finds that, the
Infringements commenced on 25 May 2018 when 23andMe’s obligations
under Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and 32(1) GDPR (as it then was) came
into force. After considering 23andMe’s Written Representations and the
submissions made at the Oral Hearing, the Commissioner finds that the
additional measures 23andMe has implemented since the Data Breach,
including but not limited to:
a) revising its password requirements;
b) introducing mandatory two-factor verification as part of the login
process;

104
c) improving its credential checking processes, including checking
customer passwords against the HIBP database;
d) implementing the “Account Event History” feature;
e) implementing a date of birth check before customers can download
Raw Genetic Data, with only three attempts permitted before a user
is referred to 23andMe’s customer care team;
f) updating its product alerts to detect multiple scenarios of product
abuse, including alerts intended to respond to evidence of
and . 23andMe also adjusted
its rate-limiting rules and continues to adjust these rules
based on traffic activities or indications of attack;
g) engaging a third-party to monitor and report on any dark web posts
relating to 23andMe;
h) carrying out tabletop cyber security exercises, including five in the
company’s 2025 financial year;
i) reconfiguring its internal logs to enable the 23andMe security team
to better track and identify malicious activities
j) implementing and risk-based
activity monitoring; and
k) updating its cyber incident response procedures,
mean that as of 31 December 2024, 23andMe had implemented
appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of
security for Customer Personal Data which was appropriate in light of
the risks posed by the processing it performs, as required by Article
5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1) UK GDPR. Therefore, the
Commissioner finds that the Infringements were no longer ongoing as
of this date.
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
105
304. 23andMe’s failure to implement appropriate technical and organisational
security measures throughout the Relevant Period placed its customer’s
personal data at risk of unauthorised access and use over an extended
period of time, as demonstrated by the Data Breach.
305. Therefore, the Commissioner finds that the extended duration of the
Infringements are a further indication of their seriousness as they
exposed 23andMe customers to an increased risk of harm to their rights
and freedoms in relation to their personal data over a significant period
of time.
(b) The intentional or negligent character of the Infringements (Article
83(2)(b) UK GDPR)
306. The Commissioner finds that the Infringements are negligent, rather
than intentional, in nature because 23andMe unintentionally breached
the duty of care it owed to its customers pursuant to the UK GDPR and
DPA 2018.282 Pursuant to Article 24(1) and (2) UK GDPR, controllers are
responsible for implementing appropriate technical and organisational
measures to enable and allow them to demonstrate that processing is
performed in accordance with the UK GDPR, including, where
proportionate, the implementation of appropriate data protection
policies. It follows that 23andMe is responsible for ensuring that
Customer Personal Data is processed in a manner that ensures an
appropriate level of security of that personal data, including protection
against unauthorised or unlawful processing (Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR)
and through the use of appropriate technical and organisational security
measures (Article 32(1) UK GDPR).
307. Negligent infringements can be serious and the Fining Guidance
indicates that the Commissioner may decide to issue a penalty notice in
cases where a controller or processor is found to have acted
282 Fining Guidance, Paragraph 66
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
106
negligently.283
308. When assessing 23andMe’s negligence, the Commissioner has
considered all of the relevant evidence regarding whether it breached
the duty of care it owed to its customers, taking into account the specific
circumstances of this case.284
309. The Commissioner considers that when taking into account the
sensitivity of the personal data processed by 23andMe, including special
category data; the fact that the company’s processing operations were
intended to facilitate the sharing of information between customers; and
the risk of significant damage or distress resulting from a personal data
breach affecting the Platform, 23andMe could reasonably have been
expected to have implemented appropriate measures to prevent
unauthorised access to customer accounts and to enable the prompt
detection of and effective response to any incident which compromised,
or potentially compromised, the integrity and confidentiality of
Customer Personal Data.
310. The Commissioner also finds that the Infringements resulted from
23andMe’s failure to implement technical and organisational security
measures which included basic protections, such as mandatory MFA,
which are widely recommended by regulators and other public agencies,
including the ICO and NCSC. Prior to the Data Breach, 23andMe also
failed to carry out any form of simulation or penetration testing which
focused on credential stuffing attacks, despite this being recognised in
the OWASP top-10 web-application security risks since 2003.285
311. In addition, the Commissioner finds that 23andMe negligently failed to

respond in an appropriate and timely manner when it first received
indications in July and August 2023 that the Platform had been subject
to personal data breach. The July Login Spike, the July Attempted Profile
Transfer and the August 2023 Messages were all dealt with by
23andMe’s security team as isolated incidents and a detailed internal
investigation was not commissioned until October 2023. In particular,
the August 2023 Messages featured explicit claims that a widescale
personal data breach had occurred and that Customer Personal Data
was being sold on the dark web.286 However, the August 2023 Messages
were not linked to the July Login Spike or the July Attempted Profile
Transfer, a full investigation was not commissioned, the claims were
dismissed as a “hoax” within four days and no review of the company’s
technical and organisational security measures was undertaken, despite
the increasing evidence of a risk to Customer Personal Data.287
312. Furthermore, the failure to update 23andMe’s technical and
organisational security measures following the receipt of the August
2023 Messages must be considered in the context of the almost
simultaneous discussions relating to the launch of the Total Health
service, which indicated that 23andMe’s senior management were aware
of security risks affecting the Platform and the deficiencies in 23andMe’s
technical and organisational security measures. Specifically, 23andMe’s
Chief Product Officer highlighted security concerns related to the profile
transfer and Raw Genetic Data download features, referred to the
potential value of 23andMe customers’ genetic data to malicious actors
and recognised that MFA would be the most effective means of
improving the security of customers’ accounts.288 However, despite
these concerns being raised and recommendations being made

regarding how to strengthen the security of 23andMe customers’
accounts, 23andMe failed to take steps to ensure that its technical and
organisational security measures were appropriate in light of the risks
posed to Customer Personal Data.
313. Therefore, the Commissioner finds that whilst the Infringements are
negligent, rather than intentional, in nature, they nonetheless constitute
a serious breach of the duty of care 23andMe owes to its customers in
respect of the protection of their personal data.
(c) Categories of personal data affected (Article 83(2)(g) UK GDPR)
314. The categories of personal data affected by the Infringements are also
relevant to the assessment of its seriousness. In particular, the
Commissioner considers infringements of data protection legislation
which involve the processing of special category data to be particularly
serious because the UK GDPR makes clear that such data merits specific
protection.289
315. As stated at paragraph 122 above, during the Relevant Period 23andMe
processed special category data, within the meaning of Article 9(1) UK
GDPR. Specifically, 23andMe processed genetic data supplied by
customers who submitted their DNA to 23andMe when completing saliva
testing kits and data concerning health in the form of self-reported
health conditions, as well as 23andMe generated Health Reports in
respect of customers who subscribed to the “Health + Ancestry” or
“23andMe+ Premium” services.
316. 23andMe reported that the threat actor accessed the Raw Genetic Data
289 Paragraph 71 of the Fining Guidance states that “The Commissioner is likely to consider
infringements involving the processing of special category data within the meaning of
Article 9(1) UK GDPR). This accords with Recital 51 to the UK GDPR, which states that
”Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental
rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create
significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms. \[This\] personal data should
include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin.”

of two Affected UK Data Subjects in the course of the Data Breach.290
Furthermore, whilst 23andMe’s analysis indicates that the threat actor
did not download Raw Genetic Data relating to any Affected UK Data
Subjects, as the threat actor had demonstrated their ability to
successfully access credential stuffed accounts, the Commissioner finds
that the integrity and confidentiality of Raw Genetic Data relating to
Affected UK Data Subjects whose accounts were credential stuffed was
nonetheless compromised.
317. Moreover, it is clear that special category data includes not only personal
data that explicitly relates to the categories of information specified in
Article 9(1) UK GDPR, but also personal data which reveals or concerns
those categories of information, including where the data allows
inferences to be drawn about a data subject which fall within the
categories specified in Article 9(1) UK GDPR.291
318. The Commissioner finds that the personal data contained within
customers' accounts which is processed for the purposes of matching
customers within the DNA Relatives, Family Tree and Connections
features of the Platform may also be regarded as special category data,
as the processing of such personal data enables, and is in fact intended,
to allow inferences to be drawn regarding the shared racial or ethnic
origin of matched customers, thus bringing it within the scope of Article
9 UK GDPR.

held that Article 9(1) GDPR cannot be interpreted to mean that the processing of personal
data which only indirectly reveals sensitive information about a natural person is exempt
from the increased level of protection afforded to special category data. Therefore, in the
view of the CJEU, personal data will be considered special category data where it is
possible to infer from it, by association or deduction, information within the categories
specified in Article 9(1) GDPR. Although CJEU judgments are no longer binding following
the UK’s exit from the European Union, pursuant to section 6(2) of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018, UK courts and tribunals may have regard to them so far as they
are relevant to the matter before the court of tribunal.

319. The Commissioner regards this as significant in this context, as the
threat actor appeared to have specifically targeted 23andMe customers
of particular ethnic or racial origins, including those of an Ashkenazi
Jewish background. For example, the BreachForums Post Dated 17
October referred to prominent Jewish families and an alleged Israeli
attack on a hospital.
320. The Commissioner considers that 23andMe should have specifically
considered its processing of special category data when deciding on
what level of technical and organisational measures were appropriate in
order to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of its processing
systems and services pursuant to Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article
32(1) UK GDPR.
321. In addition, the Commissioner considers that the adequacy and
appropriateness of such measures should have been reassessed
following the receipt of the August 2023 Messages and the associated
posts identified by 23andMe’s Cyber Incident Response Team which
contained explicit references to inferences drawn regarding connected
customers’ common Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry and indicated that
Customer Personal Data was being offered for sale on the dark web.
322. Therefore, the Commissioner finds that the highly sensitive nature of
the personal data processed by 23andMe, which was placed at risk as a
result of the lack of appropriate technical and organisational security
measures, constitutes further evidence of the seriousness of the
Infringements.
Conclusion on the seriousness of the Infringements
323. Having considered the nature, gravity and duration of the
Infringements, as well as their negligent nature and the categories of
personal data affected, the Commissioner has categorised the
Infringements as having a high degree of seriousness.
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
111
324. In reaching his conclusion, the Commissioner has allocated particular
weight to:
a) the extent of 23andMe’s failure to implement appropriate technical
and organisational security measures, particularly when taking into
account applicable guidance and best practice throughout the
Relevant Period and the multiple incidents which ought reasonably
to have led to 23andMe reviewing and revising such measures;
b) the nature of 23andMe’s processing activities, including the
processing of genetic data, data relating to health and inferred
special category data;
c) the direct links between the Infringements and the purposes of
23andMe’s processing activities, specifically the use of customer
personal data to reveal further information about them and facilitate
the sharing of highly sensitive personal data between large numbers
of customers, and the importance of such processing to 23andMe’s
business model;
d) the extended duration of the Infringements, which resulted in the
integrity and confidentiality of the majority of 23andMe customers’
personal data being placed at risk of unauthorised access and use
for a significant period of time;
e) the documented evidence of actual non-material damage suffered
by Affected UK Data Subjects as a result of the Infringements and
the ongoing potential for further, serious material or non-material
harm to be suffered; and
f) the negligent nature of the Infringements, specifically the clear
breach of the duty of care owed by 23andMe to its customers in
respect of maintaining the integrity and security of their personal
data.
Relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors:
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
112
(a) Any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the
damage suffered by the data subjects (Article 83(2)(c) UK GDPR)
325. Paragraph 77 of the Fining Guidance states: “The Commissioner is more
likely to take into account measures implemented prior to the controller
or processor becoming aware of the Commissioner’s investigation as a
mitigating factor. Measures that are only implemented after the start of
the Commissioner’s investigation are less likely to be regarded as a
mitigating factor.”
326. 23andMe’s initial response to the Data Breach is set out at paragraphs
62 – 83 above.
327. 23andMe also informed the Commissioner that it searched for and
requested the removal of Customer Personal Data from dark web sites.
The Commissioner understands that 23andMe believed that these
requests were actioned in some cases, but notes that there is no
objective means of verifying how successful 23andMe were in ensuring
the removal of Customer Personal Data from the dark web.
328. Under Article 34(1) UK GDPR, a controller is required to inform data
subjects whose personal data has been affected in a personal data
breach, without undue delay, if it is likely to result in a high risk to their
rights and freedoms. The communication sent by the controller to the
affected data subjects must include the information relating to the
personal data breach and the measures taken, or which the controller
proposes to take in response which are referred to in Article 33(3)(b),
(c) and (d) UK GDPR.292
329. On 6 October 2023, 23andMe created a public blog discussing the details
and impacts of the Data Breach, as well as recommending steps
customers could take to keep their accounts and passwords secure,
292 Article 34(2) UK GDPR
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
113
including the use of strong, unique passwords and enabling MFA.293 The
blog was updated as more information about the Data Breach was
discovered during the course of the Internal Investigation, with the final
update dated 5 December 2023.294
330. 23andMe informed the Commissioner that it met with numerous
impacted individuals to respond to their questions relating to the Data
Breach and offered dark web monitoring.295 23andMe’s Data Privacy
Officer subsequently clarified that dark web monitoring was only offered
to a limited number of customers who contacted the company about the
Data Breach and where it was deemed to be appropriate on the basis of
the nature of the customer’s enquiry and the specific impact the Data
Breach had on them.296
331. In addition to the public blog on the 23andMe website, between 10
October 2023 and 30 January 2024, 23andMe sent a series of emails to
the customers it believed had been affected by the Data Breach.297
332. The content of these emails varied, but those initially sent in October
2023 to all current or former customers whose DNA Relatives profile
data had either been posted on the dark web, or was deemed to have
been accessed by the threat actor included a high-level description of
the Data Breach, a link to the type of information which may be found
within a DNA Relatives profile, details of 23andMe’s initial response to
the Data Breach and recommendations as to what steps the customers
could take in order to enhance the security of their accounts, including

333. Whilst the Commissioner acknowledges that 23andMe took steps to
inform Affected UK Data Subjects of the Data Breach, he also finds that
these emails failed to fully inform the affected data subjects of the
nature of the Data Breach to the extent required by Article 34(2) UK
GDPR. Specifically, the email notifications sent by 23andMe to its
customers prior to January 2024 did not:
a) include the period within which the Data Breach occurred. Whilst
some of the emails included the date upon which the threat actor
posted samples of Customer Personal Data on the dark web,
23andMe did not include the period during which the threat actor
accessed Customer Personal Data;
b) disclose the possibility that Raw Genetic Data and other special
category data may have been accessed by the threat actor. Whilst
23andMe did not confirm that Raw Genetic Data had been accessed
by the threat actor until the conclusion of the Internal Investigation
in December 2023,299 23andMe was aware of the possibility that
such data had been compromised, not least as a result of the claims
made in the threat actor’s posts on the dark web. The seriousness
with which 23andMe treated this possibility was demonstrated by
the fact that it disabled the Raw Genetic Data download feature on
2 November 2023, prior to the Internal Investigation confirming
that such data had been accessed and, in some cases, downloaded
by the threat actor.300 The potential for Raw Genetic Data to have
been accessed by the threat actor significantly impacted upon the
likely consequences of the Data Breach, which 23andMe was

required to describe when notifying data subjects pursuant to
Article 34(2) UK GDPR;301 or
c) provide any information as to what could happen as a result of the
personal data exfiltrated by the threat actor becoming public. Article
33(3)(c) UK GDPR and Article 34(2) UK GDPR required 23andMe to
describe the likely consequences which could result from the Data
Breach when notifying Affected UK Data Subjects. Whilst 23andMe
did alert customers to the fact that the threat actor had posted
samples of Customer Personal Data on the dark web, the
Commissioner’s view is that 23andMe was required to provide a
greater level of detail as to the potential consequences for Affected
UK Data Subjects, particularly in light of the sensitivity of the data
involved.
334. The Commissioner’s view is that 23andMe’s response to the
identification and verification of the Data Breach did not fully reflect the
urgency of the situation and had only a limited, if any, effect on
mitigating the damage suffered by Affected UK Data Subjects. However,
the Commissioner also acknowledges that 23andMe did investigate and
take steps in response to the July Attempted Profile Transfers and that
the measures taken in response to the Data Breach were ultimately
successful in bringing to an end the threat actor’s unauthorised access
to Customer Personal Data. Therefore, following consideration of
23andMe’s representations, the Commissioner finds that the action
23andMe took in an attempt to mitigate the damage to Affected UK Data
Subjects should be treated as a neutral factor, rather than an
aggravating factor.
335. As stated at paragraph 303 above, 23andMe informed the Commissioner
301 Article 34(2) UK GDPR requires communications sent to affected data subjects to
include, inter alia, the information specified in Article 33(3)(c), namely, “the likely
consequences of the personal data breach.”
CONFIDENTIAL

116
of the additional security measures that it had implemented as of 31
December 2024. However, whilst the Commissioner considers that these
measures, when assessed collectively, mean that as of 31 December
2024, 23andMe’s processing is compliant with Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR
and Article 32(1) UK GDPR, they are focused on reducing the likelihood
of a similar event occurring in the future, or at least limiting its impact.
Therefore, the Commissioner finds that such measures should not be
regarded as attempts to mitigate the damage suffered by data subjects
as a result of the Infringements. Consequently, such steps will not be
treated as a mitigating factor.
(b) The degree of responsibility of the controller or processor (Article
83(2)(d) UK GDPR)
336. At paragraph 81, the Fining Guidance refers to the level of accountability
expected of controllers and processors under the UK GDPR and indicates
that it is more likely that the degree of responsibility will be considered
an aggravating, or, at most, a neutral factor.302
337. Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1) UK GDPR require 23andMe to
implement technical and organisational security measures which ensure
a level of security which is appropriate in light of the sensitivity of the
personal data it processes and the nature, purpose and context of its
processing operations.
338. When assessing the appropriateness of such measures, the
Commissioner considers that it is necessary to have regard, in
particular, to:
a) the significant volumes of highly sensitive special category data
processed by 23andMe;
b) the risks posed by the processing of such special category data to
the fundamental rights and freedoms of 23andMe customers in the

117
event of a personal data breach;303
c) the nature and purposes of 23andMe’s processing, specifically the
processing of sensitive personal data, including special category
data, to enable its customers to learn about their genetic, racial and
ethnic origins, and connect and share such information with their
genetic relatives; and
d) the reasonable expectations of 23andMe customers regarding the
measures in place to protect the personal data they shared with the
company and their genetic relatives.
339. When assessing 23andMe’s degree of responsibility for the
Infringements, the Commissioner has considered the extent to which
23andMe did what it could be expected to do in terms of implementing
technical and organisational security measures, taking into account its
size and resources and the nature and purposes of its processing.304 The
Commissioner finds that in light of 23andMe’s position as a leading
global provider of direct-to-consumer genetic testing services, its
technical capacity to implement appropriate security measures, the
nature of its processing activities, including the processing of highly
sensitive personal data, and the importance of the relevant processing
to its business model, its responsibility for the Infringements should be
regarded as an aggravating factor.
(c) Any relevant previous infringements by the controller or processor
(Article 83(2)(e) UK GDPR)
340. The Commissioner is not aware of any relevant previous infringements
of the UK GDPR or DPA 2018 committed by 23andMe. Therefore, this
factor is not relevant to the Commissioner’s decision.
(d) The degree of cooperation with the Commissioner (Article 83(2)(f)
303 Article 32(2) UK GDPR
304 Fining Guidance, Paragraph 79
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
118
UK GDPR)
341. Pursuant to Article 31 UK GDPR, controllers and processors are required
to cooperate with the Commissioner, on request, in the performance of
his tasks. The Commissioner’s tasks include the monitoring and
enforcement of the UK GDPR305 and the conduct of investigations into
the application of the Regulation.306 Such cooperation may include, for
example, responding to requests for information and attending
meetings. The Commissioner considers that as this duty of cooperation
is required by law, meeting this standard should not be regarded as a
mitigating factor. 307
342. Paragraph 89 of the Fining Guidance states that “the Commissioner may
view persistent and repeated behaviour that delays regulatory action as
an aggravating factor. Examples of such behaviour include not engaging
with the Commissioner during the investigation or repeatedly failing to
meet deadlines set by the Commissioner without reasonable excuse.”
343. 23andMe responded to requests for information during the
Commissioner’s investigation. However, 23andMe:
a) failed, on occasion, to provide information in the format explicitly
requested by the ICO and the OPC;
b) frequently failed to respond to enquiries within the specified
timescales; and
c) requested multiple extensions to deadlines citing staff absences,
ongoing legal proceedings in the US and a reduction in workforce
numbers.
344. 23andMe’s responses to the Commissioner’s enquiries were, at times,
insufficiently detailed, necessitating multiple follow-up questions and
305 Article 57(1)(a) UK GDPR and s.115(2)(a) DPA 2018
306 Article 57(1)(h) UK GDPR and s.115(2)(a) DPA 2018
307 Fining Guidance, Paragraph 87
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
119
requests for clarification in order to obtain the information required.
23andMe’s responses to such follow-up questions and requests for
clarification often revised or amended previous responses, which, in
some cases, resulted in a substantially different position being put
forward to that which had earlier been set out. This not only created
confusion, but also created uncertainty as to the validity and accuracy
of the information provided to the Commissioner.
345. For example, 23andMe initially stated that during the Internal
Investigation it had identified suspicious Raw Genetic Data downloads
by searching for download events instigated from an IP address
associated with the threat actor which occurred within one hour of a
known threat actor login, with the one hour period used because
23andMe automatically logs customers out of the Platform after one
hour of inactivity.308 However, 23andMe later revised this response,
stating that “if the web request \[to download Raw Genetic Data\] was
made within 6 hours, 23andMe marked it as downloaded by the threat
actor.”309
346. 23andMe also delayed the disclosure of key information which was of
direct relevance to the Commissioner’s investigation. For example, in
relation to the process used to attribute Raw Genetic Data downloads to
the threat actor, 23andMe did not disclose the error that meant that the
actual IP address associated to a download event was not recorded in
its database until its response to a request for clarification on 10
September 2024,310 despite 23andMe having multiple opportunities to

provide this highly relevant information to the Commissioner prior to
this point.
347. 23andMe also failed to inform the Commissioner of the August 2023
Messages until 23 October 2024,311 when this information should have
been included in the First and Second Data Breach Report Forms.312
348. Furthermore, whilst 23andMe agreed to the ICO and OPC conducting
interviews by video call with senior 23andMe employees in November
2024, the interviews were repeatedly delayed on the grounds of a lack
of availability. 23andMe later informed the Commissioner that the delays
were due to a significant workforce reduction which was approved by
the company’s Board of Directors on 8 November 2024 and resulted in
the closure of substantially all of 23andMe’s therapeutics operating
division and an overall headcount reduction in excess of 200 employees,
representing approximately 40% of the workforce at the time.313
23andMe also failed to put forward , its Chief Product Officer,
for interview, despite the Commissioner having seen internal
documentation in which raised a number of security concerns
relating to the Platform and advocated for the implementation of
mandatory MFA in advance of the launch of the 23andMe Total Health
service in August 2023.314
349. The Commissioner has considered the broader circumstances facing
23andMe during the period of the investigation. In its Written
Representations and at the Oral Hearing 23andMe highlighted that in

312 Article 33(3)(a) UK GDPR requires a notification of a personal data breach to describe
the nature of the personal data breach, including where possible, the categories and
approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate
number of personal data records concerned. The Commissioner finds that the August 2023
Messages were indicative of the overall nature of the Data Breach and should therefore
have been disclosed within 23andMe’s initial personal data breach reports
313 23andMe Written Representations, 18 April 2025: Paragraphs 17 and 24

121
addition to responding the Commissioner’s investigation, it was
simultaneously:
a) defending numerous class action and arbitration claims in the US,
Canada and the UK;
b) engaged in multiple investigations initiated by US regulators; and
c) dealing with the resignation of the company’s entire Board of
Directors in September 2024.
350. 23andMe also highlighted how its ability to respond to the
Commissioner’s enquiries was inhibited by the departure of key
employees involved in the Internal Investigation, including the data
protection officer and chief information security officer.315
351. The Commissioner finds that the lack of cooperation on the part of
23andMe would, in normal circumstances, be regarded as an
aggravating factor. However, following consideration of the
representations made by 23andMe in response to the NOI, the
Commissioner considers that the extreme financial and commercial
challenges experienced by 23andMe during the period of the
investigation represent exceptional circumstances which must be taken
into account when assessing 23andMe’s compliance with its obligations
under Article 31 UK GDPR. Therefore, the Commissioner finds that
23andMe’s level of cooperation should be treated as a neutral factor.
(e) The manner in which the Infringements became known to the
Commissioner (Article 83(2)(h) UK GDPR)
352. Article 33(1) UK GDPR requires a controller to notify the Commissioner
of a personal data breach without undue delay and, where feasible,
within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to
result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Where the
315 23andMe Written Representations, 18 April 2025: Paragraphs 18 - 20
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
122
notification is not made within 72 hours of the controller becoming
aware of the breach, it must be accompanied by reasons for the delay.
353. 23andMe initially notified the Commissioner of a personal data breach
on 15 October 2023,316 10 days after it verified the reports of the Data
Breach in the Subreddit Post as genuine and 14 days after it was first
alerted to the Subreddit Post in which Customer Personal Data was
offered for sale. The delay was attributed to the fact that it took
23andMe until 12 October 2023 to determine what personal data and
which customers had been affected and to identify the regulators it was
required to notify.317 Therefore, whilst the submission of 23andMe’s first
notification relating to the Data Breach fell outside the statutory 72 hour
window, the Commissioner finds that 23andMe has provided an
explanation for this delay, as required by Article 33(1) UK GDPR.
354. Article 33(3)(a) and (c) UK GDPR require a notification of a personal
data breach to include a description of the nature of the personal data
affected and the likely consequences of the breach. However, the First
and Second Breach Report Forms failed to refer to the possibility that
Raw Genetic Data may have been compromised. 23andMe sought to
explain this omission by stating that it was only after the conclusion of
the Internal Investigation in December 2023 that it was able to confirm
that Raw Genetic Data had been accessed and, in some cases,
downloaded by the threat actor.318 However, the Commissioner finds
that this is indicative of a misunderstanding of the requirements of
Article 33(3)(c) UK GDPR, which specifically requires the controller to
provide a description of the likely consequences of the breach.
355. The Commissioner considers that 23andMe was required to disclose the
fact that there was at least the potential for Raw Genetic Data to have

123
been affected when it first notified the Commissioner of the Data Breach
in October 2023. The disclosure of this information in October 2023
could have allowed the Commissioner’s investigation to be expedited
and could potentially have avoided, or at least mitigated, some of the
challenges that the Commissioner encountered during the investigation,
including the departure of multiple senior individuals from relevant roles
at 23andMe in the period between the discovery of the Data Breach and
the opening of the Commissioner’s investigation.
356. The Commissioner finds that 23andMe’s failure to include reference to
the potential for Raw Genetic Data to have been accessed or downloaded
by the threat actor in the First and Second Data Breach Report Forms
delayed and rendered more difficult the Commissioner’s investigation of
the Infringements and should be treated as an aggravating factor.
(f) Measures previously ordered against the controller or processor
(Article 83(2)(i) UK GDPR)
357. The Commissioner has not previously imposed measures referred to in
Article 58(2) UK GDPR on 23andMe. Therefore, this factor is not relevant
to the Commissioner’s decision.
(g) Adherence to approved codes of conduct or certification
mechanisms (Article 83(2)(j) UK GDPR)
358. There are no relevant codes of conduct or approved certification
mechanisms in this case. Therefore, this factor is not relevant to the
Commissioner’s decision.
(h) Any other applicable aggravating or mitigating factors (Article
83(2)(k) UK GDPR)
359. The Commissioner has considered whether 23andMe benefitted from
any financial gain in not implementing appropriate technical and
organisational measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of its
processing operations. The Commissioner considered that 23andMe
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
124
would have benefitted from some savings as a result of the
Infringements. However, the Commissioner finds that such savings were
unlikely to have been significant and therefore this was not deemed to
be relevant to the Commissioner’s decision to issue a penalty.
360. 23andMe provided the ICO and OPC with copies of the August 2023
Messages which referred to a personal data breach affecting the
Platform and threatened the sale of Customer Personal Data on the dark
web.319 These messages coincided with the Hydra Post in which the
author claimed to have access to the data of 10 million 23andMe
customers and subsequently indicated that the data had been sold to an
Iranian national.
361. The Ticket indicated that an internal investigation was
conducted following the receipt of the August 2023 Messages, but that
this involved only a limited examination of the potential personal data
breach, and focused on the profiles of the 23andMe CEO and her then
husband, before being closed after only four days on the basis that there
was “no evidence of the exfiltration of 10M customers’ raw DNA data.”
23andMe’s Security and Engineering Team concluded that whilst there
was evidence that “some data was accessed, it was not to the levels
outlined in \[the Hydra Post\]” and the claims were considered to be “an
exaggeration of the actual data obtained,”320 which did not merit either
a more in-depth investigation, nor a wider review of 23andMe’s technical
and organisational security measures. Furthermore, 23andMe did not
consider the possibility that the July Login Spike and the July Attempted
Profile Transfers could have been linked to the alleged personal data
breach which was referred to in the August 2023 Messages.
362. On the basis of this information, the Commissioner finds that, as of 14
319 Letter from Greenberg Traurig LLP to the ICO and OPC, 23 October 2023 (Exhibits AA,

125
August 2023, 23andMe was aware, or was at least in possession of
significant volume of evidence of a personal data breach affecting the
Platform. However, 23andMe failed to launch a full investigation, did not
report the incidents to appropriate regulators, including the
Commissioner, and did not reconsider whether its technical and
organisational measures were appropriate to ensure the integrity and
confidentiality of its processing systems and services in light of the
cumulative indicators of unauthorised access to Customer Personal
Data. As at the date of this Penalty Notice 23andMe continues to
maintain that there was “no indication of unauthorised access” at the
time.321
363. The Commissioner finds that 23andMe’s failure to connect or fully
investigate evidence of the threat actor’s activity in August 2023
Messages, its failure to commission an investigation or review the
security measures in place on the Platform following the receipt of the
August 2023 Messages and the delayed disclosure of these incidents to
the Commissioner should be regarded as an aggravating factor.
(i) Effectiveness, proportionality and dissuasiveness (Article 83(1) UK
GDPR)
364. The Commissioner considers that the imposition of a penalty would be
effective as it would represent an appropriate sanction when considering
the seriousness of the Infringements and would emphasise to 23andMe
the importance of complying with its obligations under Article 5(1)(f) UK
GDPR and Article 32(1) UK GDPR.
365. Taking into account:
a) the seriousness and duration of the Infringements;
b) the highly sensitive nature of the personal data processed by
321 Letter from Greenberg Traurig LLP to the ICO and OPC, 17 January 2025

126
23andMe;
c) the scale of the company’s processing operations;
d) 23andMe’s position as a multinational provider of direct-to-
consumer genetic testing services;
e) the nature and purposes of its processing;
f) the distress caused to Affected UK Data Subjects; and
g) the potential harm which may have resulted, or which may in future
result from the Infringements;
the Commissioner considers that the imposition of a penalty would be
proportionate. A penalty would not exceed what is appropriate and
necessary in the circumstances of the case to promote compliance with
data protection legislation and to provide an appropriate sanction for
the Infringements.
366. 23andMe continues to process its customers’ personal data. Therefore,
the Commissioner considers that there is a need to deter 23andMe from
committing any further infringements of Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and
Article 32 UK GDPR in the future. There is also a need to deter other
controllers and processors operating within the genetic testing sector
from committing similar infringements.
367. The Commissioner considers that the proposed penalty will also have a
general dissuasive effect as it will raise awareness of the need for
controllers and processors, both within the sector and more broadly, to
ensure that they implement appropriate technical and organisational
security measures which take into account the nature, scope, context
and purposes of their processing, as well as the risks this poses to the
interests and fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects.
C. The Commissioner’s conclusions on whether to impose a
penalty
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
127
368. In light of the above, the Commissioner has decided to impose a penalty.
VIII. CALCULATION OF THE PROPOSED PENALTY
369. The Fining Guidance sets out a five-step approach which the
Commissioner proposes to apply to calculate the amount of a penalty:
a) Step 1: An assessment of the seriousness of the infringement.
b) Step 2: Accounting for the turnover (where the controller or
processor is part of an undertaking).
c) Step 3: Calculation of the starting point for the penalty having
regard to the seriousness of the infringement and, where relevant,
the turnover of the undertaking.
d) Step 4: Adjustment to take account of any aggravating or
mitigating factors.
e) Step 5: Adjusting the penalty to ensure that it is effective,
proportionate and dissuasive,322 whilst not exceeding the relevant
statutory maximum.
370. Whilst the Commissioner has applied this approach, the overall
assessment of the appropriate level of penalty which the Commissioner
has imposed involved evaluation and judgment, taking into account all
the relevant circumstances of the individual case.
Statutory maximum penalty
371. The Commissioner finds that 23andMe infringed Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR
and Article 32(1) UK GDPR.
372. An infringement of Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR is subject to the higher
maximum statutory penalty of £17.5 million, or, in the case of an
undertaking, 4% of the worldwide annual turnover in the preceding
322 As required by Article 83(1) UK GDPR
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
128
financial year, whichever is higher.323
373. An infringement of Article 32(1) UK GDPR is subject to the standard
maximum statutory penalty of £8.7 million, or, in the case of an
undertaking, 2% of the worldwide annual turnover in the preceding
financial year, whichever is higher.324
374. Pursuant to Article 83(3) UK GDPR, if a controller or processor
intentionally or negligently, in the course of the same or linked
processing operations, infringes several provisions of the UK GDPR, the
total amount of any penalty imposed cannot exceed the amount
specified for the gravest infringement.325 Therefore, the Commissioner
has based his assessment of the level of the proposed penalty on the
higher statutory maximum of £17.5 million, or, in the case of an
undertaking, 4% of the worldwide turnover in the preceding financial
year.
375. The Fining Guidance considers the concept of an undertaking for the
purpose of imposing a penalty at paragraphs 23 – 31. Where a controller
or processor forms part of an undertaking, the Commissioner will
calculate the maximum penalty on the basis of the turnover of the
undertaking as a whole. Whether or not an individual controller or
processor forms part of an undertaking depends on whether another
legal or natural person, for example, a parent company, exercises
decisive influence over it.
376. Paragraph 30 of the Fining Guidance states:
“Where a parent company owns all, or nearly all, the voting shares in a
subsidiary, there is a presumption that the parent company exercises
decisive influence over the subsidiary’s conduct. This presumption may
be rebutted. However, the burden is on the parent company to provide
323 Section 157(1)(a) DPA 2018 and Article 83(5)(a) UK GDPR
324 Section 157(1)(a) DPA 2018 and Article 83(4)(a) UK GDPR
325 Also see paragraph 33 of the Fining Guidance
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
129
sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the subsidiary acts
independently.”
377. The relevant legal entity responsible for the Infringements is 23andMe.
23andMe is a wholly-owned subsidiary of 23andMe Holding Co., which
is also the parent company of Lemonaid Health Inc. and 23andMe
Pharmacy Holdings Inc.326 Therefore, the Commissioner has relied upon
the presumption referred to above that the parent company, 23andMe
Holding Co., exercises decisive influence over its wholly owned
subsidiary, 23andMe. The Commissioner is therefore entitled to
calculate the maximum penalty on the basis of the turnover of 23andMe
Holding Co.
378. As 23andMe Holding Co.’s shares were listed for trading on the NASDAQ
stock exchange until 31 March 2025, the company’s 2023/24 annual
report was published and stated that, for the year ending 31 March
2024, it generated turnover of US$219,638,000 (approximately
£168,251,493).327 4% of this figure is £6,730,060, which is less than
the higher maximum statutory penalty of £17.5 million. Therefore, the
higher statutory maximum penalty of £17.5 million applies in this case.
A. Step 1: Assessment of the seriousness of the Infringements
379. As set out at paragraphs 109 to 115 of the Fining Guidance, the
Commissioner determines a starting point for the penalty by first
assessing the seriousness of the infringement. The Commissioner
categorises the infringement according to its degree of seriousness and
then selects a starting point based on a percentage of the relevant
applicable statutory maximum.
380. As stated at paragraph 323 of this Penalty Notice, the Commissioner has
categorised the Infringements as having a high degree of seriousness.
326 Letter from Greenberg Traurig LLP to the ICO and OPC: Initial Responses to Questions

CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
130
This means that the starting point will be between 20% and 100% of
the relevant statutory maximum.
381. The Commissioner finds that the Infringements warrant a starting point
of 60% of the statutory maximum. A starting point lower than 60% is
not warranted due to the seriousness of the Infringements, as
determined by reference to their nature, gravity and extended duration;
the sensitive nature of the personal data affected; and the nature and
purposes of the processing performed by 23andMe. The Commissioner’s
full assessment of the seriousness of the Infringements is set out at
paragraphs 258 to 324 above.
382. In deciding that a starting point higher than 60% is not warranted in the
circumstances of this case, the Commissioner has taken into account
the fact that the Infringements were not committed intentionally.
B. Step 2: Accounting for turnover
383. Having assessed the seriousness of the infringement, the Commissioner
next determines any adjustments to account for turnover, as set out in
paragraphs 116 to 129 of the Fining Guidance. This step permits the
Commissioner to adjust the starting point to reflect the size of the
undertaking.
384. Paragraph 121 of the Fining Guidance states that “the relevant turnover
of the undertaking for the purpose of calculating the maximum amount
of the fine is the total worldwide turnover in its previous financial year,”
whilst paragraph 123 further provides that “the Commissioner will
generally base turnover figures used for the purpose of calculating the
fine on the consolidated turnover recorded in the undertaking’s audited
accounts.”
385. As referred to in paragraph 378 above, 23andMe Holding Co.’s turnover
for the year ending 31 March 2024 was US$219,638,000 (approximately
£168,251,493). However, the Fining Guidance also states that “the
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
131
Commissioner may adjust the turnover figure used to ensure it reflects
the true scale of the undertaking (for example, by using more recent
management accounts or forecast figures where available.”328 In light
of this discretion, the Commissioner has considered 23andMe Holding
Co.’s Form 10-Q, which was filed with the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission on 6 February 2025 and documents the
company’s financial results for the three and nine month periods ending
31 December 2024 (the “Q3 Filing”).
386. The Q3 Filing recorded a total quarterly turnover of $60,262,000, with
a total comprehensive loss of $53,035,000, whilst it also showed that
as of 31 December 2024, 23andme held $93,288,00 in cash, cash
equivalents and restricted cash, compared to $250,791,000 as of 31
December 2023. The Q3 Filing was submitted shortly before 23andMe
Holding Co. and certain of its subsidiaries, including 23andMe Inc, filed
voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the US
Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court of the Eastern
District of Missouri.329 The Q3 Filing stated that “\[23andMe Holding Co.\]
has incurred significant operating losses as reflected in its accumulated
deficit and negative cash flows from operations. As of December 31,
2024, \[23andMe holding Co.\] had an accumulated deficit of $2.4 billion,
and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $79.4 million. \[23andMe
Holding Co.\] will need additional liquidity to fund its necessary
expenditures and financial commitments for 12 months after the date
that the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements
included in this report are issued. \[23andMe holding Co.\] has
determined that, as of the filing date of this report, there is substantial
doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”
387. The Commissioner has considered the evidence of the significant
328 Fining Guidance, paragraph 123
329 Kroll Restructuring: Administration: 23andMe Holding Co,: Case No. 25-40976
(accessed 9 May 2025)

OFFICIAL - Sensitive
132
deterioration in 23andMe Holding Co.’s financial position, as
demonstrated in the Q3 Filing and the petition for relief under Chapter
11 of the US Bankruptcy Code. In accordance with paragraph 123 of the
Fining Guidance, the Commissioner has decided that in order to reflect
23andMe’s current financial position it is appropriate to calculate the
starting point for the penalty on the basis of 23andMe Holding Co.’s
projected annual turnover, as calculated by reference to the latest
financial results recorded in the Q3 Filing. At the Oral Hearing, 23andMe
projected that 23andMe Holding Co.’s annual turnover for its 2025
financial year is likely to be close to the lower end of the £100 - £250
million range.
388. This means that the range of adjustment based on the turnover of the
undertaking is between 20% and 50%.330
389. As set out in paragraph 128 of the Fining Guidance: “the Commissioner
is likely to choose a higher amount for undertakings with higher turnover
within the applicable range. However, these ranges are only indicative.
The Commissioner will reach a decision on a case-by-case basis as to
whether it is appropriate to adjust the starting point of the fine in this
way, having regard to the need for the fine to be effective, proportionate
and dissuasive. Therefore, the Commissioner retains the discretion to
impose a fine up to the applicable statutory maximum.”
390. In this case, the projected turnover of 23andMe Holding Co. is expected
to fall close to the lower end of the applicable range (£100 million to
£250 million) specified in the Fining Guidance.331 Therefore, following
consideration of 23andMe’s representations in respect of the current size
of the 23andMe Holding Co. undertaking, the deterioration in its financial
position and its projected turnover for its 2025 financial year, the

CONFIDENTIAL

133
Commissioner has reduced the turnover adjustment factor from 35%,
as specified in the NOI, and now finds that a factor of 20% should be
applied in this case.
C. Step 3: Calculation of the starting point
391. The starting point for the penalty is calculated as follows: higher
statutory maximum amount (£17.5 million) x turnover adjustment
(20%) x adjustment for seriousness (60%) = £2,100,000.
D. Step 4: Adjustment to take into account any aggravating or
mitigating factors
392. The Commissioner next takes into account any aggravating or mitigating
factors. These factors may warrant an increase or decrease in the
penalty calculated at the end of Step 3 (the starting point of
£2,100,000).
393. On this occasion, the Commissioner has decided to account for the
aggravating factors considered at paragraphs 325 to 363 above, by
applying an increase of 10% to the starting point calculated at Step 3.
Therefore, the proposed penalty increases to £2,310,000.
394. In the NOI, the Commissioner provisionally applied an increase of 25%
to account for aggravating factors. However, after considering
23andMe’s representations, the Commissioner finds that the measures
taken by 23andMe to mitigate the harm which resulted from the Data
Breach and 23andMe’s level of cooperation should be treated as neutral,
rather than aggravating factors. Therefore, the Commissioner has
reduced the increase in the penalty to 10% increase in order to account
for the remaining aggravating factors, specifically:
a) the deficiencies in the content of the First and Second Breach
Report Forms sent by 23andMe to the Commissioner regarding the
Data Breach in October 2023;
b) 23andMe’s degree of responsibility for the Infringements when
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
134
taking into account the extent of its failure to implement
appropriate technical and organisational security measures as
required by Article 5(1)(f) UK GDPR and Article 32(1) UK GDPR;
and
c) 23andMe’s multiple failures to review and revise its technical and
organisational security measures despite increasing evidence of a
significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of Customer
Personal Data.
E. Step 5: Adjustment to ensure the penalty is effective,
proportionate and dissuasive
395. As set out in paragraph 142 of the Fining Guidance, “The aim of Steps
1 to 4 of the calculation is to identify a fine that is effective,
proportionate and dissuasive. The purpose of Step 5 is to provide the
opportunity for the Commissioner to check that is the case.”
396. The Commissioner considers that a penalty of £2,310,000 will be
effective, proportionate and dissuasive. A penalty in this amount will
have a genuine deterrent effect, taking into account both the specific
deterrent to 23andMe and the general deterrence to other organisations.
397. The penalty amount is designed to reflect the serious nature of the
Infringements, especially when considered in the context of the extent
of 23andMe’s failure to implement appropriate technical and
organisational security measures, the nature and purposes of its
processing, the sensitive nature of the personal data affected, the
distress caused to Affected UK Data Subjects and the potential harm
which may have resulted from the Infringements.
398. The Commissioner has exercised his judgment and discretion and finds
that the proposed penalty is proportionate when taking into account the
seriousness of the Infringements, the aggravating factors present in this
case, and 23andMe’s position as a prominent provider of direct-to-
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
135
consumer genetic testing services in multiple countries and territories
around the world.
399. The Commissioner considers that the proposed penalty is proportionate
to the current financial position of 23andMe and its parent undertaking,
23andMe Holding Co. Specifically, the penalty represents approximately
2.3% of 23andMe Holding Co.’s projected turnover for its 2025 financial
year and whilst the Commissioner is aware of the significant
deterioration in the financial position of 23andMe Holding Co., he finds
that a lower penalty would fail to reflect the seriousness of the
Infringements and the significant aggravating factors present in this
case.
F. Conclusion - Penalty
400. For the reasons set out above, the Commissioner has decided to impose
an administrative penalty on 23andMe, Inc in the amount of
£2,310,000.
IX. FINANCIAL HARDSHIP
401. The Fining Guidance outlines that, in exceptional circumstances, the
Commissioner may reduce a penalty where an organisation is unable to
pay due to its financial position.
402. The Commissioner has considered 23andMe’s representations, including
the submission that the company’s current financial position constitutes
exceptional circumstances which warrant not imposing any monetary
penalty. However, the Commissioner considers that the deterioration in
23andMe’s and 23andMe Holding Co’s financial position, has been
adequately accounted for as part of the calculation of the penalty in
Section VIII above and that the seriousness of the Infringements, as
well as the need to provide an effective, proportionate and dissuasive
response to the Infringements, justify the imposition of a monetary
penalty for the reasons set out in Section VII(B) above.
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
136
403. Paragraph 152 of the Fining Guidance states that the Commissioner will
only grant a reduction for financial hardship on the basis of objective
evidence that imposing the proposed fine would irretrievably jeopardise
an organisation’s economic viability. In light of this, when finding that
no further reduction to the penalty is necessary on the basis of financial
hardship, the Commissioner has taken into account the fact that
23andMe Holding Co, “is using the Chapter 11 proceedings to facilitate
a sale process to maximise the value of its business” and “intends to
continue operating its business in the ordinary course throughout the
sale process.”332
404. Therefore, the Commissioner finds that no further reduction to the
penalty should be made on the basis of financial hardship.
X. PAYMENT OF THE PENALTY
405. The penalty must be paid to the Commissioner’s office by BACS transfer
or cheque by 10 July 2025.
406. Under paragraph 9(1) of Schedule 16 to the DPA 2018, the
Commissioner cannot take action to recover a penalty unless:
a) the period specified in this Penalty Notice (i.e. by 10 July 2025) has
ended;
b) any appeals against this Penalty Notice have been decided or

Notice, in addition to those set out in paragraph 28 of the Penalty Notice:
1. “haplogroups” are “genetic classifications or ancestral groupings within
a population, typically defined by shared, inherited genetic markers or
mutations.”333
2. “Neanderthal Ancestry Reports” provide “information about how
much of your ancestry can be traced back to the Neanderthals. The
analysis includes the review of over 2,000 genetic variants of known
Neanderthal origin that are scattered across the genome”334.
3. “parental inheritance information” determines how DNA was
inherited and displays which portions of a customer’s ancestry came
from which parent. This forms part of the 23andMe Ancestry Report in
circumstances where a biological parent is also on the 23andMe
database and shares their information with the customer.335
4. “Health Predisposition Reports” inform customers if they “have
genetic variants associated with an increased risk of developing certain
health conditions but do not report on \[the customer’s\] entire genetic
profile.”336
5. “Wellness Reports” are intended to help customers “make more
informed choices that may relate to healthy living.” Wellness reports
also allow customers to “learn how \[their\] DNA may influence \[their\]

RESPONSES TO AN ICO QUESTIONNAIRE FROM AFFECTED UK DATA
SUBJECTS
Response 1
1) Are you able to confirm when and describe why you first registered as a
customer with 23andMe?
I ordered my kit on the 6 th of June 2021, I would’ve created my account
around this time.
I did so as I was interested in finding out any genetic health risks I have, as
I do not have contact with my parents or extended family.
2) Are you able to confirm which level of service you had with 23andMe
(e.g. Ancestry Service, Health + Ancestry Service or 23andMe+
Premium?
To the best of my knowledge I had the Health + Ancestry service.
3) Please explain when and how you first became aware of the breach. If
possible, please confirm what information was provided by 23andMe
directly and what you learnt from other sources (eg news reports).
I found out late 2023 that a breach had occurred on several tech link sharing
websites (e.g. Hacker News). By my rough understanding they had an
information sharing feature between relatives where a subset of your genetic
profile would be shared to a related user. Exploiting this allowed a portion of
the 23andme user data to be exfiltrated and leaked.
I remember that 23andme were very late to notify users of the breach. I
submitted an ICO complaint on the 8 th of October 2023, and received a
boilerplate notification from 23andme on the 24 th of that month which did
nothing to reassure me about the security of my PII.
4) Are you able to describe your concerns about the 23andMe breach?
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
143
As a past 23andme user, I expected rigorous privacy controls to be in place
due to the nature of the information collected. Unlike usernames, passwords
and e-mail addresses, you can't change your genetic makeup when a data
breach occurs.
Unfortunately, I was left sorely disappointed when news of 23andme's data
breach surfaced. Following on from that, further reports in the news of
23andme potentially being sold to a third party leave me deeply concerned
about the potential for my genetic records to be misused and shared without
my consent. (See
https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/09/23andme-dna-data-
privacy-sale/680057/ for one example).
I do have concerns about my genetic information being shared amongst
private companies to make risk assessments on me without my knowledge.
With the way large private corporations operate today, I imagine it wouldn't
be beyond the realm of possibility.
Whilst I did delete my 23andme account fairly recently, I have serious doubts
on whether my genetic records and DNA samples were actually destroyed.
From what I've seen, it seems that there is a tendency for US-based
companies to flagrantly disregard UK and EU privacy laws. I have no doubt
that regardless of any outcome from any investigation or penalties put in
place, my genetic information will ultimately make its way to several private
companies and foreign entities.
The tech industry, from my own experience as an IT professional, has a
tendency to 'move fast and break things', but in matters like this where
incredibly sensitive private information is concerned, that doesn't really
work.
5) To your knowledge, were any of your relatives also impacted by the
breach?
From what I remember no direct relatives used the service.

6) Please explain why you decided to raise your concerns relating to the
23andMe with the ICO?
The ICO I view as one of the only government entities interested in
maintaining the privacy of British citizens. I have the utmost respect for what
you do, and in any matter like this my first thought is to notify you so you
can review as appropriate to hopefully prevent it happening to anyone else.
7) Have you raised concerns with 23andMe directly? If so, what, if any,
response have you received?
I have not raised concerns directly, mainly because past experience with
large tech companies dictates they’ll reply with a boilerplate response and
ignore any attempts to get a real answer.
8) Have you raised concerns relating to the 23andMe breach with any other
organisation or body?
No, I only considered the ICO at the time.
9) How did you feel when you first became aware of the breach?
Shocked, and violated. I also felt a bit stupid considering how diligent I am
about my privacy. In retrospect, it was inevitable this would happen.
10) Would you say that your feelings changed over time at all? If so, if
possible, please explain how.
Not really, although I’ve mostly pushed it to the back of my mind. I’ve
accepted that my information is possibly out there in the wild and there’s
nothing I can do about it.
11) Have you taken any steps in response to the breach in respect of your
23andMe account?
Yes, I deleted my account after you sent a follow up e-mail this year.
12) Have you taken any steps in response to the breach in respect of any
other online accounts?
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
145
Over the past year I’ve deleted as many online accounts as possible,
including all big tech social media.
13) Has the breach changed your views about with whom you share your
personal information and your approach to doing so?
I’m very careful now about which companies I share PII with, as it seems to
be that even with the GDPR in place, a lot of companies choose to ignore it
and hold onto your information regardless of the consequences.
14) Is there any additional information that you feel is relevant to your
personal experience of the 23andMe data breach and that you would like the
ICO to consider?
The main issue I have is how 23andme handled this issue. As a tech worker
I know first hand that bugs and mis-designed features can and do happen,
this is understandable albeit unfortunate.
The real issue here is they delayed issuing a notice for weeks and left
everyone in the dark. Data breaches of this severity should be handled with
an immediate response and ability to directly contact the respective company
and reach a real human being to answer any questions.
Response 2
1) Are you able to confirm when and describe why you first registered as a
customer with 23andMe?
Have asked 23andMe - awaiting reply with details
At the time I registered for 23&Me, genetic technology was relatively novel
and although there was a lot of excitement about the potential of the sector,
I wanted insights into where the majority of my ancestors came from.
2) Are you able to confirm which level of service you had with 23andMe
(e.g. Ancestry Service, Health + Ancestry Service or 23andMe+
Premium?

3) Please explain when and how you first became aware of the breach. If
possible, please confirm what information was provided by 23andMe
directly and what you learnt from other sources (eg news reports).
I can't quite remember how I became aware of the data breach. I do however
remember that once I was aware, I couldn't find details of the breach in local
news, which shocked me.
4) Are you able to describe your concerns about the 23andMe breach?
Once I had contacted 23andMe asking whether my data had been
compromised, I was disappointed by their response. I asked that my data be
removed from their databases. As I understand computing, most
individualised records are stored in arrays/databases - I specifically asked
that 23andMe delete my data. I didn't want 23andMe to simply hide/prevent
my own access to my record under the guise of a user-triggered account
"deletion", rather I wanted 23andMe to delete my DNA sequence, destroy
any samples it had, remove the added benefit my data had made to any
models they have/will have in the future, etc, and no longer process my
data.
The idea that my genetic information could be used forever by a possibly
incompetent Data Controller, who is one of the biggest corporations on Earth,
scared me. No terms and conditions could fairly allow 23andMe to retain my
data forever, given the advances in CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats) gene editing, RNAi innovations and 23andMe's
data breaches. Given the exponential advances in the technology, such a
contract is unreasonable. 23andMe being hacked is one thing, but 23andMe's
refusal to respect a data subject's right to request the deletion of their data
shows contempt for British law, in my opinion. Has 23anM3 \[sic\] ever been
CONFIDENTIAL
OFFICIAL - Sensitive
147
audited? I doubt their processes can even facilitate the removal of a genetic
contributor's DNA (from their models, etc), which has to be a data
compliance issue. It appears as though this company's whole model is to
exploit users to create a library of genetic code, then make associations
between specific code and correlated real-world traits. The
pharmacogenomic potential of 23andMe was expressed in a 23andMe blog
on 26 October 2011 (https://blog.23andme.com/articles/a-prescription-for-
personalizing-medicine). The fact that 23andMe has lost over 95% of it's
peak value and may well sell it's data, should be a concern to every customer
in Britain. (And Canada, if your remit extends to this jurisdiction).
Now regarding the hack itself. We should all be concerned that incredibly
sensitive information was allegedly accessed nefariously. It is understood
that Semitic and Oriental groups were targeted. China has been accused of
carrying out genocide on its ethnic Uyghur population. Since 2014, the
Chinese government has committed a series of ongoing human rights abuses
against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim minorities in Xinjiang which has
often been characterized as persecution or as genocide
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution\_of\_Uyghurs\_in\_China).
Similarly, the conflict between Zionism and the Arab world has resulted in
increases in antisemitic violence in the UK. Being able to target a specific
group using their DNA data is very concerning. My 23andM3 \[sic\] account
has a Jewish identifier associated with it.
5) To your knowledge, were any of your relatives also impacted by the
breach?
According to 23andMe's own website, I have 1500 relatives who are their
customers, 719 who are 3-4th cousins - it stands to reason that some were
affected to some extent. But in terms of immediate family, not to my
knowledge.

6) Please explain why you decided to raise your concerns relating to the
23andMe with the ICO?
I raised my concerns with the ICO because I was concerned that 23andMe
had potentially failed in it's responsibilities as a data controller by being
hacked, and had failed to process my request to delete all my data from it's
systems.
7) Have you raised concerns with 23andMe directly? If so, what, if any,
response have you received?
I have raised my concerns with 23andMe and have sent you some of our
exchange. There's just too many messages. 23andMe suggested I delete my
account, but will not confirm whether this means all my data will be
removed.
8) Have you raised concerns relating to the 23andMe breach with any other
organisation or body?
I contacted win-no-fee solicitors.
9) How did you feel when you first became aware of the breach?
Concerned.
10) Would you say that your feelings changed over time at all? If so, if
possible, please explain how.
I would say that I am more cynical: in the battle that rages between the
“Individual” and the “Corporation”, the corporation seems to have an
advantage in law. People are real, but corporations are flexible etheric things:
how can it be fair that people are worth so little and the game is so skewed?
If I commit an offense or refuse to pay certain fines, my very liberty is at
stake. When corporations cover buildings in flammable materials, rig diesel
engines to present them to the consumer as greener and more economical
than they are, when individuals are mis-sold insurance or financial products,
what happens to corporations? Banks conspired to rig the LIBOR rate,
CONFIDENTIAL

affecting the interest rate on mortgages for tens of thousands of Britains
\[sic\], and cause cost of living crisis after cost of living crisis. Where are the
regulators? Where are the repercussions?
And what happens when individuals lose faith in corporations (who basically
fund/influence regulators through lobbyists) to "police" themselves? I'd
argue that tragedies like the killing of UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson
become more likely, as shocking as that sounds.
11) Have you taken any steps in response to the breach in respect of your
23andMe account?
The only step that I have taken is to request that 23andMe, the data
controller, delete the data it processes that relates to me.
12) Have you taken any steps in response to the breach in respect of any
other online accounts?
I periodically change passwords on my accounts.
13) Has the breach changed your views about with whom you share your
personal information and your approach to doing so?
Yes.
14) Is there any additional information that you feel is relevant to your
personal experience of the 23andMe data breach and that you would like
the ICO to consider?
i)Are 23andMe's terms and conditions "reasonable"?
ii)Does 23andMe respect and comply with the UK's DPA?
iii)given the speed at which it handled the breach in the US, settling class
actions etc, did 23andMe treat it's UK/Canada customers fairly?
iv) Should 23andMe be able to sell it's UK customer data?
v)if a decision is taken to not fine 23andMe, what would a company have to
do to earn a fine?

1. Are you able to confirm when and describe why you first registered as a

I believe I signed up for 23andme sometime around 2018. My wife is a cystic
fibrosis gene carrier and we were using the service to understand if I also
could be a carrier. I was also interested in my family ancestry.

Extremely anxious about what this could mean to my personal, financial and
family safety in the future.
Anxious about my 23andme connections, who may have been impacted and
what this may mean further down the line for me. I am not clear on any
repercussions I could be exposed to which is distressing.
Worried about the lack of communication and transparency from 23andme

The careless handling of my personal information has caused me immense
distress, and I find it totally unacceptable that such a breach could occur in
