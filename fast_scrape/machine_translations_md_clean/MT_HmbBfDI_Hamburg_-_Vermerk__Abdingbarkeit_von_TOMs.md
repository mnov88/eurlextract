## English Summary

### Facts

The DPA discussed to what extent controllers and processors must implement technical and organizational measures according to [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). It then answered the question whether the data subject can consent to a data processing which does not necessarily meet the requirements of [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

### Dispute

To what extent are the provisions in Article 32 GDPR obligatory and thus, not subject to the preferences of the data subject?

### Holding

The authority holds that Article 32 GDPR contains a number of obligations for controllers and processors, which allows for a certain margin of discretion. However, these obligations do not extend to data subjects. It is argued that data subjects have the right to consent to any conceivable data processing (e.g. those lacking certain technical and organizational measures), even if others might consider such processing harmful. The authority’s argument is based on Article 8(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights which explicitly mentions consent as a central element of data processing. Thus, according to the supervisory authority a data subject can, for example, consent to the sending of an email without proper encryption, even though Article 32 GDPR stipulates such a technical measure for certain emails.

It is important to note that only Article 6(1)(a) GDPR allows for such a derogation from Article 32. The other legal basis in Article 6 restricts a data subject’s „disposition capability“.

As mentioned above, only the data subject can consent to a derogation from the requirements of Article 32 GDPR. Nevertheless, Article 25(1) GDPR stipulates that the „controller shall, both at the time of the determination of means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organizational measures“. This means that regardless of a data subject’s eventual choice, a controller must have appropriate measures implemented, only then can a data subject consent to a data processing without the appropriate technical and organizational measures.

The controller must also ensure that, if a data subject consents to a data processing without sufficient technical and organizational measures, the requirements of Article 7 GDPR are fulfilled. Otherwise, as is the case with all processing activities based on consent, the data processing is not in compliance with the GDPR.
