## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject was the victim in a rape case that had garnered public attention. She complained to the Spanish DPA (_Agencia Española de Protección de Datos - AEPD_) that the controller, Corporación de Radio y Televisión Española, S.A. (RTVE), had published an unaltered audio recording of her speaking in court.

An investigation by the DPA confirmed multiple instances where the audio recording was not distorted before publication, and the DPA sent the controller an urgent request to either take down the recordings or alter them so as to render the data subject's voice unrecognizable. The controller complied, removing or distorting instances of the recording both published and archived.

### Holding

The DPA first confirmed that publishing a voice recording is processing of personal data. A voice is a personal attribute unique to each person and thus falls under the definition of personal data in [Article 4(1)GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#1 "Article 4 GDPR"). Furthermore, a voice can reveal identifiers like age, sex, state of health, culture, and emotional state. This combined with the fact that [Article 4(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_4_GDPR#2 "Article 4 GDPR") includes "transmission" and "dissemination" in the definition of processing means that publishing a recording of a person's voice is processing of personal data.

The DPA then considered the balance of fundamental rights at stake, noting that [Article 85 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_85_GDPR "Article 85 GDPR") mandates the reconciliation of the right to freedom of information with the right to privacy. The DPA held that the identifying characteristics of the victim were unrelated to the public's news interest in criminal proceedings. Thus, the principle of data minimisation ([Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR")) required the controller to implement measures to avoid voice recognition, like distorting the recording or reading a transcript.

For violating [Article 5(1)(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1c "Article 5 GDPR"), the DPA fined the controller €50,000. In its assessment of the fine, the DPA noted three aggravating factors per [Article 83(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2 "Article 83 GDPR"): (1) the seriousness of revealing sensitive data of a person who has already been the victim of a violent crime against sexual integrity, (2) the negligence displayed in failing to implement appropriate safeguards for news subjects, and (3) the disclosure of a special category of data. The fine was ultimately reduced by 40% because the controller acknowledged responsibility and paid before resolution of the sanctioning procedure.

Buivids mentions various criteria to weigh between the right to respect for
privacy and the right to freedom of expression, among which are “the
contribution to a debate of general interest, the notoriety of the person concerned, the
object of the report, the previous behavior of the interested party, the content, the form and
