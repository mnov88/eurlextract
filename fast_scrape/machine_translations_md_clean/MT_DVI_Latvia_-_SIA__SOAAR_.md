## English Summary

### Facts

The controller allegedly processed personal data - and specifically audio recordings containing the voice of their customers – in an unlawful way.

The Latvian DPA asked the controller to provide information concerning the processing in the context of an _ex officio_ investigation. The controller first asked for the deadline to be extended and then stopped replying to the DPA.

Thus, the Latvian DPA opened a sanctioning procedure against the controller.

After that, the controller replied to the DPA’s request and provided the information.

### Holding

The DPA noted how [Article 58(1)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#1e "Article 58 GDPR") provides supervisory authorities with the power to obtain from controllers and processors access to all personal data and information necessary for the performance of its tasks.

The notification procedure followed by the DPA to request access to such information respected all the formal requirements under Latvian law.

In light of the above, the DPA decided to issue a €800 fine against the controller. In the determination of the amount of the sanction, the fact that the controller had been already reprimanded for similar circumstances was considered an aggravating factor. On the other hand, the fact that the controller eventually complied with the DPA’s request played a role as a mitigating factor.
