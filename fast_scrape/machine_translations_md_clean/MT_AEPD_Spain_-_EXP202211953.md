## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject submitted a complaint to the AEPD indicating that the website operator Chatwith.IO infringed GDPR by implementing dark patterns, specifically overloading and skipping when users try to object to the processing of their personal data by third parties. Users are prompted with a pop-up which contains a list of service providers, 1.522 in total, in which 338 of those have the selection box toggled on. If users want to object, they need to toggle off each box individually. The data subject submitted that there should be an option to object to ALL of the legitimate interests at once. Moreover, these selection boxes are shown in a light grey colour which can be easily confused with the white background of the website and it requires an additional visual effort on the parts of users to distinguish the options. Further, the data subject submitted that the legitimate interest of third parties is not explained in a manner that can be easily comprehended and found in the privacy policy unless they have to access to each of the third parties' privacy policies.

### Holding

Upon reviewing the data subject's complaint, the AEPD confirmed the following:

1\. The purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended and the legal basis for the processing have ambiguous wording, or lack of required clarity.

2\. The legitimate interests of third parties to whom the controller is referred to in the information banner on the main page are unclear and it is necessary to access the information individually different privacy policies of each of the more than 1,000 companies that appear in the providers list.

3\. No reference is made to the controller's intention to transfer personal data to a third country or international organization outside the European Union, all this despite the fact that some of the companies that appear in the providers list are located outside the EU.

4\. In terms of dark patterns, the AEPD confirmed that the dark pattern of overloading and skipping is observed when accessing the providers list. Once there, the users find a list of about 130 companies, of which, more than half have the default marked “Accept data processing for legitimate interest” box, which requires, in the case of objection to the processing marking one by one throughout the entire list, without the option of being able to object by indicating it only once or a number of times that is reasonable and does not generate fatigue in the affected person.

5\. In regards to cookies, those that are not technical or necessary are deployed before obtaining consent from users.

6\. The cookie management panel shows that the groups of Cookies are divided into two options, accept the cookies by “Consent” that are pre-marked in the “not accepted” option and accept the cookies by “Legitimate Interest” which pre-marked in the “accepted” option. However, if all the options marked “accepted” are unchecked, the website still continues to use the same cookies detected when entering on the web without having given consent.

7\. There is no information about cookies in the second layer or link that enable the user to be redirected to the “Cookie Policy” of the website. The information about cookies appears dispersed in each of the options of the cookie management panel.

The DPA resolved to impose a fine of 2000 euro for infringement of [Article 13 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_13_GDPR "Article 13 GDPR") and required compliance with this article within one month. This infringement was considered as medium. It also Imposed a fine of 5000 euro for infringement of Article 5 (1)(a) as well as one month to bring its processing into compliance. This infringement was considered very gave

     File No.: EXP202211953 (PS/00080/2023)

               RESOLUTION OF THE SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

Of the actions carried out by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and in
based on the following:
                                  BACKGROUND

FIRST: On 09/30/22, Mr. A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complaining party) filed

claim before the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The claim is
directed against the entity CHATWITH.IO WORLDWIDE, S.L. with CIF B88184239,
owner of the website \*\*\*URL.1 (the claimed party), for the alleged violation of
data protection regulations: Regulation (EU) 2016/679, of Parliament
European Parliament and of the Council, of 04/27/16, regarding the Protection of Natural Persons

regarding the Processing of Personal Data and the Free Circulation of
these Data (RGPD) and Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of
Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD), and against the Law
34/2002, of July 11, on Information Society Services and Commerce
Electronic (LSSI).

The reasons on which the claim was based are:

       “The company IURIS MARKETING S.L. (current CHATWITH.IO WORLDWIDE
       S.L.) is the owner of the website \*\*\*URL.1.

       The claimed company processes the personal data of visitors
       who access the website, obtaining them both directly from the interested parties
       through requests for information when they try to contact the
       lawyers who advertise on the page, such as through the use of cookies
       that are installed on the visitor's computer equipment when consulting the website.

       This is reported by the data controller himself through a message that
       appears when accessing iurisnow.com, in a pop-up window that appears
       superimposes the main window and that under the title “Privacy and
       Transparency” informs the user that both the owner of the website and
       its partners process the personal data of the
       interested.

       Specifically, it is indicated in the first part of the informative text, that
       “We and our partners use cookies to Store or access
       information on a device. We and our partners use data to
       Personalized ads and content, ad and content measurement,

       information about the public and product development”, at the same time, towards
       half of the text, you can read, that “Some of our partners may
       process your data as part of our legitimate business interest without requesting your
       consent. To see the purposes that they believe have legitimate interest or
       object to this data processing, please use the link in the list of

       suppliers below.” A copy of the pop-up window is attached (Doc.
       evidentiary 4).

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/31

       The controller uses dark overload patterns
       overloading and skipping in user interface design
       through which the privacy options to be applied are configured

       to the processing of the website visitor's data, specifically
       when the interested party expresses his opposition to data processing based
       in the legitimate interest of the person responsible and of third parties, whom he calls
       “partners”.

       The dark overload pattern is clearly observed when accessing the

       section of the “Supplier List” pop-up window, once there, the
       interested party finds a list of 1,522 companies, of which, according to
       the estimate made by the claimant, 338 have the default marked
       "Legitimate interest" box, which requires, in the case of wanting to show the
       opposition to the treatment of marking one by one throughout the entire list, each one

       of the 338 boxes, without there being the option of being able to object by indicating it
       only once or a number of times that is reasonable and does not generate fatigue in the
       affected. To the previous 338 boxes, we must add another nine that are
       found in the “Manage settings” section.

       Upon accessing, you can see that a set of nine purposes appear

       of treatment under the title of “Purposes”, each of them, with its box
       corresponding marked with the default option in favor of the treatment
       based on legitimate interest, it being necessary to select one by one the
       boxes to be able to oppose each of the purposes established by the
       responsible. As in the previous situation, there is no option in the

       window that allows you to oppose all of them at the same time, or a number
       reasonable of times.

       A copy of the “List of suppliers” section is provided for evidentiary purposes.
       (Exhibit document 5), copy of the “Manage configuration” section for purposes

       evidence (Evidence Doc. 6) and the formulas used to calculate
       List companies and estimate boxes with privacy options
       affected (evidence document 17). On the other hand, the dark concealment pattern is
       used in the “Supplier List”. If you access this section, you can
       observe with some difficulty that there is an estimated set of 32 companies
       who have the consent box checked with the option blocked, without

       that the interested party can revoke it.

       These boxes appear in a grayish color that blends in with white.
       used as the background of the screen, which makes it difficult to locate and serves as
       camouflage mechanism, avoiding detection if no effort is made

       increased visual (Exhibits 5 and 17). The information that
       provided by the person responsible, relating to the legitimate interests of third parties and the purposes
       of the processing to which personal data is intended is not
       transparent.

       The legitimate interests of third parties and the purposes of the processing are not
       determine or explain in a clear or understandable manner in the information
       offered to interested parties. Within the privacy policy of the person responsible,
       The purposes for which the processing is carried out are not indicated, not even in the title

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/31

       “Provenance, purpose and legitimacy of the data offered”, can be
       find any reference to the purposes for which the data is collected.
       Nor can you find information about the legitimate interests of

       third parties in the title “Recipients of the data or transfer to third parties”, nor in other
       parts of the privacy policy, being necessary to access
       individually to the different privacy policies of each of the 1,522
       companies that appear in the so-called “List of suppliers”, for which
       if a URL link appears within the dropdown information of each
       "supplier". The only information that can apparently refer to both

       purposes, such as the legitimate interests of third parties, can be found in
       unclear form in the text that appears within the pop-up window, in
       which mentions that the data is used for “ads and content
       personalized, ad and content measurement, information about the
       public and product development”, without providing more information. (Documents

       evidence 2 and 4).

       The person responsible for the treatment does not make any mention in the information that
       facilitates the interested party, both in the pop-up window and in the policy of
       privacy, the intention or possibility of transfers of
       data to third countries, outside the European Union, nor to the existence or

       absence of an adequacy decision from the Commission, nor to the guarantees
       adequate or appropriate measures that can be adopted so that the interested party can
       exercise their rights regardless of the international transfer.
       All this despite the fact that a relevant part of the companies that appear
       in the “List of suppliers”, if they inform in their respective policies of

       privacy, that the data collected by them may be transferred outside
       of the European Union.

SECOND: On 11/15/22, in accordance with the provisions of article 65.4
of the LOPDGDD, by this Agency, said claim was transferred to the

claimed party, so that it could proceed with its analysis and report, within a period of one
month, about what was stated in the statement of claim.

According to a certificate from the Electronic Notifications and Electronic Address Service, the
request letter sent to the claimed party, on 11/18/22, through the service
of electronic notifications “NOTIFIC@”, was rejected at destination on 11/29/22.

Although the notification was validly carried out by electronic means, it was deemed
the procedure has been carried out in accordance with the provisions of article 41.5 of the LPACAP, as
informative, an attempt was made to send it by postal mail, which was returned to its destination with the date
12/14/22 with the message “unknown”.

THIRD: On 12/30/22, by the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreement is issued to admit the claim processing
presented, in accordance with article 65 of the LPDGDD Law, when appreciating possible
rational indications of a violation of the rules in the field of competences

of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.

legitimate interest of the person responsible and third parties, whom he calls “partners”.

The term “dark patterns” refers to the interfaces or implementations of
user experience intended to influence behavior and
people's decisions in their interaction with websites, apps and social networks,
way that they make decisions potentially detrimental to the protection of their
personal information.

According to recital (39) of the GDPR:

       All processing of personal data must be lawful and fair. For the people
       physical data must be completely clear that they are being collected, used,
       consulting or otherwise processing personal data that concerns them,

       as well as the extent to which said data is or will be processed.

       The principle of transparency requires that all information and communication
       regarding the processing of said data is easily accessible and easy to
       understand, and that simple and clear language is used. This principle refers

       in particular to the information of the interested parties about the identity of the
       responsible for the treatment and its purposes and the added information
       to ensure fair and transparent treatment of people
       affected physical bodies and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of the
       personal data that concerns them that are subject to processing, (…)”.

In this regard, article 5 RGDP includes the "Principles relating to processing" and
in section 1.a) establishes that:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 21/31

       Personal data will be processed in a lawful, fair and transparent manner in
       relationship with the interested party "lawfulness, loyalty and transparency."

Well, in application of the principle of loyalty established in article 5.1.a, the
Data controllers must ensure that dark patterns are not used,
at least, in relation to decisions regarding the processing of your data
personal.

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) adopted for public consultation its

‘Guidelines on dark patterns in social media interfaces,
How to recognize and avoid them. These guidelines, like the AEPD guide,
They take article 5.1.a of the GDPR as a starting point to evaluate when a

Dark patterns can be presented to the user in data processing operations.
of various kinds, such as during the registration or registration process on a social network, when starting
session or also in other scenarios such as configuring the
privacy, in cookie banners, during the process of exercising rights, in
the content of a communication reporting a personal data breach or
even when trying to unsubscribe from the platform.

According to the EDPB Guidelines, dark patterns can be classified into the
following categories:

Overloading: consists of presenting too many possibilities to the

person who has to make the decisions, which ends up generating fatigue on the
user, who ends up sharing more personal information than desired. The
The most common techniques to produce this fatigue due to overload are to show
questions repeatedly, creating privacy labyrinths and showing too many
options.

Hiding (skipping): consists of designing the interface or user experience in such a way
so that the user does not think about some aspects related to protection
of your data, or forget it.

Stirring: the users' emotions are appealed to or nudges are used

visuals in the form of effects to influence decisions.

Hindering: attempts to create obstacles so that the user cannot
easily perform certain actions. This is done through techniques such as
put privacy settings in areas that cannot be accessed, make it very

complicated to reach them or providing misleading information about the
effects of some actions.

Inconsistency (fickle): the interface has an unstable and inconsistent design that does not
allows the user to perform the actions desired.

Left in the dark: The information or configuration options of the
privacy are hidden or presented in an unclear way using language
erratic, contradictory or ambiguous information.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 22/31

In the case at hand, the dark pattern of overloading and
concealment (skipping), is observed when accessing the “List of

suppliers”, once there, the interested party finds a list of about 130
companies (suppliers), of which, more than half have the default marked
“Accept data processing for legitimate interest” box, which requires, in the case
from wanting to show opposition to the treatment to marking one by one throughout the entire
list, without the option of being able to object by indicating it only once or a number
of times that is reasonable and does not generate fatigue in the affected person.

Taking, for example, the provider “Amazon Advertising” we see that in its section
the following information appears:

 Cookie duration: 396 (days). Cookie duration is reset after
 of each session. Use other forms of storage.

 <<View details>> |<< Storage details>> | <<Privacy Policy>>

 Consent (OFF)

 Legitimate interest (ON)

If we display the information <<see details>>, the following information appears:

 Amazon Advertising requests the following:

 By Consent:

 Store or access information on a device
 Select basic ads
 Create a custom advertising profile
 Select personalized ads

 Measure ad performance
 Use market research to generate information about the public
 Develop and improve products

 For legitimate interest:

 Ensure security, prevent fraud and debug errors
 Technically serve ads or content

Checking that, in this particular example, legitimate interest is indicated as both

the “Ensure security, prevent fraud and debug errors” as “Serve
technically advertisements or content”, a situation that is repeated for the more than 200
suppliers that appear on the web.

Well, the situation is that there is a button to accept everything (<<Accept All>>) or
to confirm the chosen options (<<Confirm Options>>), but not to

reject everything or oppose everything, which can constitute a dark pattern of
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 23/31

overloading All this without prejudice to the fact that the treatments marked in
the ON position of “legitimate interest” may or may not be justified on this basis of
legitimation, an issue that is not analyzed in this procedure.

                                         III.-2
                                       Sanction

The facts set out above may constitute an infringement of the
established in article 5.1.a) of the RGPD, with the scope expressed in the

Previous Fundamentals of Law.

This violation can be punished with a fine of a maximum of €20,000,000 or,
In the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for the

of larger amounts, in accordance with article 83.5.a) of the RGPD.

In this sense, article 72.1.a) considers a “very serious” infraction for the purposes of
prescription “1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 are considered very serious and will prescribe after three years the infractions that
involve a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in

                               Graduation of the Sanction

The determination of the sanction that should be imposed in the present case requires
observe the provisions of articles 83.1 and 2 of the RGPD, precepts that,
respectively, they provide the following:

       "1. Each supervisory authority will ensure that the imposition of fines
       administrative sanctions under this article for violations of the
       of this Regulation indicated in sections 4, 9 and 6 are in each case
       effective, proportionate and dissuasive individual treatment.

       2. Administrative fines will be imposed, depending on the circumstances

       of each individual case, as an additional or substitute for the measures
       referred to in Article 58, paragraph 2, letters a) to h) and j). When deciding the
       imposition of an administrative fine and its amount in each individual case is
       will take due account of: a) the nature, severity and duration of the
       infringement, taking into account the nature, scope or purpose of the

       processing operation in question, as well as the number of interested parties
       affected and the level of damages they have suffered; b) the
       intentionality or negligence in the infringement; c) any measure taken by
       the person responsible or in charge of the treatment to alleviate the damages and losses
       suffered by the interested parties; d) the degree of responsibility of the person responsible or

       of the person in charge of the treatment, taking into account the technical measures or

       g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;
       h) the way in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in

       particular whether the person responsible or the person in charge notified the infringement and, in that case,

       any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the
       case, such as financial benefits obtained or losses avoided, direct
       or indirectly, through infringement.”

Within this section, the LOPDGDD contemplates in its article 76, titled

“Sanctions and corrective measures”:

       "1. The sanctions provided for in sections 4, 5 and 6 of article 83 of the
       Regulation (EU) 2016/679 will be applied taking into account the criteria of
       graduation established in section 2 of the aforementioned article.

       2. In accordance with the provisions of article 83.2.k) of the Regulation (EU)
       2016/679 may also be taken into account: a) The continuous nature of the
       infringement. b) The linking of the offender's activity with the performance of
       processing of personal data. c) The benefits obtained as
       consequence of the commission of the infraction. d) The possibility that the

       conduct of the affected party could have induced the commission of the infraction. and)
       The existence of a merger by absorption process subsequent to the commission of
       the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity. f) The impact
       to the rights of minors. g) Have, when it is not mandatory, a
       data protection officer. h) Submission by the person responsible

       or entrusted, on a voluntary basis, to alternative resolution mechanisms
       of conflicts, in those cases in which there are disputes between
       those and anyone interested.

       3. Adoption will be possible, complementary or alternatively, when
       appropriate, of the remaining corrective measures referred to in the article

       83.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.”

In accordance with the transcribed precepts, and without prejudice to what results from the
instruction of the procedure, for the purposes of setting the amount of the fine sanction
impose on the claimed entity, in an initial assessment, they are considered concurrent in

in this case the following factors, as aggravating factors:

    - The scope or purpose of the data processing operation, as well as the information
        affected teresses, (section a).

It is also considered that the sanction to be imposed should be graduated in accordance with the
following aggravating criteria, established by article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 25/31

    - The linking of the offender's activity with the performance of treatment
       personal data, (section b), considering that in the activity carried out
       rrolla, the personal data of its clients are involved.

Considering the factors exposed, the value reached by the fine, for the
Violation of article 5.1.a) of the RGPD, it is 5,000 euros (five thousand euros).

                                          III.-4
                                        Measures

Once the infraction is confirmed, it is necessary to determine whether or not it is appropriate to impose
responsible for adopting appropriate measures to adjust its actions to the
regulations mentioned in this act, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article
58.2 d) of the RGPD, according to which each supervisory authority may “order the

certain manner and within a specified period….” The imposition of this
measure is compatible with the sanction consisting of an administrative fine, as established
provided in art. 83.2 of the GDPR.

The text of this agreement establishes what the infractions have been.

specifics to implement them corresponds to the sanctioned party, since it is the

responsible for the treatment who fully knows your organization and must decide,
based on proactive responsibility and the risk approach, how to comply with the
RGPD and the LOPDGDD.

However, in this case, regardless of the above, it is appropriate to require the

responsible entity so that, within the period indicated in the operative part, it adapts
the “Privacy Policy” of your website to the current regulations, specifically to what
stipulated in article 5.1.a) of the RGPD.

Please note that failure to comply with the requirements of this organization may be
considered as an administrative offense in accordance with the provisions of the RGPD,

classified as an infraction in its articles 83.5 and 83.6, and such conduct may be motivated by
opening of a subsequent administrative sanctioning procedure.

                    About the Cookies Policy of the website

a).- Regarding the installation of cookies on the terminal equipment prior to consent:

Article 22.2 of the LSSI establishes that users must be provided with information
clear and complete information on the use of storage devices and

data recovery and, in particular, about the purposes of data processing.
This information must be provided in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

Therefore, when the use of a cookie involves processing that enables the
identification of the user, those responsible for the treatment must ensure the
compliance with the requirements established by the regulations on the protection of

data.

However, it is necessary to point out that they are exempt from compliance with the
obligations established in article 22.2 of the LSSI those necessary cookies

complement (plug-in) to exchange social content.

These cookies would be excluded from the scope of application of article 22.2 of the

LSSI, and, therefore, it would not be necessary to inform or obtain consent about its
use. On the contrary, it will be necessary to inform and obtain the prior consent of the
user before using any other type of cookies, both first and

                          Classification of the offense committed

Of the deficiencies detected, regarding the cookie policy, on the website in

impossibility of rejecting third-party cookies and the lack of information in the
“cookie policy”, could be assumed by the complainant, the commission of the
violation of article 22.2 of the LSSI, as it establishes that:

       “Service providers may use storage devices and

       data recovery on recipients' terminal equipment, provided
       that they have given their consent after they have been
       provided clear and complete information on its use, in particular on

       Where technically possible and effective, the consent of the recipient
       to accept the processing of the data may be facilitated through the use of the
       appropriate settings of the browser or other applications.

       The above will not prevent possible storage or access of a technical nature
       for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over a network of
       electronic communications or, to the extent strictly necessary
       necessary, for the provision of an information society service

                                         Sanction

This Infraction is classified as “minor” in article 38.4 g) of the aforementioned Law, which

considers as such: “Use data storage and recovery devices
when the information has not been provided or the consent of the
recipient of the service in the terms required by article 22.2.”, and may be

sanctioned with a fine of up to €30,000, in accordance with article 39 of the aforementioned
LSSI.

After the evidence obtained in the previous investigation phase, and without prejudice to
what results from the instruction, it is considered that it is appropriate to graduate the sanction to
