## English Summary

### Facts

On 1 December 2021, a PDF was created by the resource management department of the local police of Llucmajor (the controller). The document contained the personal data of 47 police agents, including their first names, surnames, agent numbers, and sick leave information. On 12 January 2022, the document was posted on the intranet of the Llucmajor government in the ‘local police’ folder, within a subfolder labeled ‘photocopier.’

A complaint was filed with the DPA on 22 March 2022 and the DPA subsequently conducted an investigation. The controller reported that access to the document was meant to be restricted to the police headquarters and their staff, but due to an error, it was not deleted and remained in the ‘photocopier’ folder for several days. The controller also noted that the document was accessed by individuals who were not its intended recipients. In addition, the DPA found no evidence that the controller had designated a data protection officer.

### Holding

The DPA held that the controller violated [Article 5(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR"), [32](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"), and [37 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR "Article 37 GDPR"). Pursuant to [Article 58(2)(d)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2d "Article 58 GDPR"), it ordered the controller to bring processing operations into compliance within 6 months. No other corrective measures were issued.

First, the DPA found that the controller violated the principle of confidentiality guarded by [Article 5(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#1f "Article 5 GDPR") because, by keeping the document containing personal data in the ‘photocopier’ folder for a number of days rather than being immediately deleted, the personal data was exposed to unauthorised third parties.

Second, the DPA held that the controller lacked appropriate security measures to protect against data breaches pursuant to [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR"). The DPA noted that there was no measure to ensure that documents placed in the ‘photocopier’ folder were properly deleted. In addition, the folder granted access to a number of users beyond the intended recipients.

Finally, the controller violated [Article 37 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_37_GDPR "Article 37 GDPR") because it did not have a designated data protection officer or, if it did, failed to communicate the officer to the DPA.

                RESOLUTION OF SANCTIONING PROCEDURE

From the procedure instructed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based

to the following

                                   BACKGROUND

FIRST: A.A.A. (hereinafter, the complaining party) dated March 22, 2022
filed a claim with the Spanish Data Protection Agency. The
claim is directed against LLUCMAJOR CITY COUNCIL with NIF P0703100H
(hereinafter, the claimed party or the City Council). The reasons on which the
claim are the following:

The complaining party, local police from the LLUCMAJOR CITY COUNCIL, states that,
In December 2021, a PDF document has been published on the intranet with the
name "Unsubscriptions until 11/30/21", available to all users, which contains the
names and surnames of 47 agents, agent number, position, sick leave days of each
one and the percentage of annual work absenteeism it represents. Consider that they are

data that should only be accessed by STAFF members, the Chief of Police
Local and human resources members.

It indicates that, on January 12, 2022, the Local Police Chief published a circular, with
the title "Dismissals and illnesses", congratulating the agents who had not

state of discharge and recriminating and questioning the discharge of the remaining agents. HE
They provide the two documents referred to, as well as evidence of publication.

The complaining party also states that, after consulting the Agency, it invites it
to raise the issue with the Data Protection Officer (hereinafter, DPD) of the

City Council, confirming that the claimed party has not proceeded to its
appointment despite legal obligation since May 2018.

Lastly, he stated that on the date of presentation of the claim the document
was still published.

SECOND: In accordance with article 65.4 of Organic Law 3/2018, of 5
December, Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (in
hereinafter LOPDGDD), said claim was transferred to the City Council of
Llucmajor, so that it could proceed with its analysis and inform this Agency within the period of
one month, of the actions carried out to adapt to the requirements provided in

data protection regulations.

The transfer, which was carried out in accordance with the rules established in Law 39/2015, of
October 1, of the Common Administrative Procedure of Administrations
Public (hereinafter, LPACAP), was collected on April 21, 2022 as

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 2/20

It appears in the acknowledgment of receipt that is in the file. Dated June 24,
2022 the City Council requested an extension of the deadline to respond to the letter
of transfer, which was granted.

On July 6, 2022, this Agency received a response letter sent
by the City Council. The same sends a report from the City Council of July 1, 2022,
which, among other aspects, highlights the following:

       "3. It is not true that a PDF document was published on the Police intranet, when

       reach all users, with personal data referring to the days of
       dismissal of agents.

       4. That it was verified how the controversial document, at the time, was
       saved in a temporary folder for printing, named “

       photocopier”, where documents are stored before being printed on the
       photocopier. Evidently the report had restricted access to the Headquarters
       and his Staff. Resulting in that after its edition, by mistake, it was not
       deleted, as is usually done with this type of files. Being
       deleted days later, when checking how the writing was still in the folder
       mentioned and that had been consulted by people who were not the

       recipients thereof.

       5. That the document is not still published nor was it published at any time in the
       Police intranet.

       6. Indeed, the Headquarters published a circular, in which and in a manner
       generic, the workforce was informed of the global absenteeism data.
       We understand that this information is relevant and that it should be known by
       all the workers of the department, since as a public service that
       we are, high levels of absenteeism make it difficult to provide a satisfactory response to

       the needs of citizens, while affecting the conditions of
       work of the entire group, by causing, in some cases, the denial
       of permits and licenses provided for in the legislation, due to the obligation to
       “prioritize service needs that would otherwise not be met.”

THIRD: On June 22, 2022, in accordance with article 65 of the

LOPDGDD, the claim presented by the complaining party was admitted for processing.

FOURTH: ON July 13, 2022, after having analyzed the documentation that
appeared in the file, a resolution was issued by the Director of the Spanish Agency
of Data Protection, agreeing to file the claim. The resolution was

notified to the claimant, on July 27, 2022, as evidenced in the
proceedings.

FIFTH: On August 9, 2022, the complaining party filed an appeal
optional replacement through the Electronic Registry of the AEPD, against the

resolution relapsed into the file, in which he showed his disagreement with the
contested resolution and requested that the processing of the claim continue
initial presented.

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 3/20

SIXTH: On February 23, 2023, the appeal filed was sent to the party
claimed within the framework of the provisions of article 118.1 of Law 39/2015, of 1
October, of the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations

(hereinafter, LPACAP) for the purposes of formulating the allegations and presenting
the documents and supporting documents that it considers appropriate, which has been verified
by written response dated May 3, 2023.

SEVENTH: On May 31, 2023, it was issued by the Director of the Agency
Spanish Data Protection Authority estimating the appeal for reconsideration filed by the

claimant.

The second legal basis of said resolution states:

“

                                           II
                     Response to the allegations presented

"In the appeal for reconsideration, he alleges that it is not true that the document was not published
on the intranet, since the “photocopier” folder mentioned is precisely
on the service's intranet, its use being unnecessary to send a file to print

or photocopy.

Likewise, it considers that, although the document has been withdrawn, the infringement has already been
has occurred and sanctioning proceedings should be initiated.

Finally, it highlights that the requested party has still not been appointed DPD despite
to have a legal obligation to do so, which leaves citizens in a situation of
helplessness.

In relation to these allegations, the claimed party has informed, in the response

upon initial transfer, that the document was placed in a folder accessible to
third parties prior to sending it to print, remaining in the same for
mistake. No representations are made in relation to the lack of appointment of
DPD.

In accordance with article 5.1.f) of the RGPD:

       f) treated in such a way as to ensure adequate safety of the
       personal data, including protection against unauthorized processing or
       unlawful and against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application
       of appropriate technical or organizational measures ("integrity and

       confidentiality»).

Likewise, article 32 provides:

       1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the

       nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as risks
       of varying probability and severity for the rights and freedoms of
       natural persons, the person responsible and the person in charge of the treatment will apply

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 4/20

       appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of
       security appropriate to the risk, which, where appropriate, includes, among others:

               a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;

               b) the ability to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity,
               permanent availability and resilience of security systems and services
               treatment;

               c) the ability to restore availability and access to data
               personnel quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;

               d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of the
               effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure the

               safety of treatment.

       2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration will be given to
       take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
       consequence of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of
       personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the

       unauthorized communication or access to said data.

       3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or to a
       certification mechanism approved pursuant to Article 42 may serve as a
       element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in the

       section 1 of this article.

       4. The controller and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to
       ensure that any person acting under the authority of the person responsible or
       of the person in charge and has access to personal data can only process said

       data following instructions from the person responsible, unless obliged to do so
       under Union or Member State law.

On the other hand, with respect to the appointment of the Data Protection Officer, the
Article 37 of the GDPR provides:

       1. The person responsible and the person in charge of the treatment will designate a delegate of
       data protection provided that:

               a) the treatment is carried out by a public authority or body,
               except courts acting in the exercise of their judicial function; \[…\]

In response to the hearing process, the claimed party has stated the following:

       “That is ratified in the entire content of the report signed on the day
       07/01/2022.

       Interesting to state a new point \[…\] the content of the file
       called by the appellant as “Baixes fins el 30-11-2021” as the
       generic information contained in the Headquarters circular, which does not contain

       personal data, could be obtained by reviewing the data sheets
       “Daily Service” mentioned.”

Without making any statement regarding the lack of appointment of DPD.

Therefore, in the present case, the appeal filed is upheld.”

EIGHTH: On November 15, 2023, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against the claimed party,

by:

       -The alleged violation of Article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, typified in the article

                           Violation of article 32 of the GDPR

Article 32 of the GDPR, security of processing, establishes the following:

         "1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as risks of

variable probability and severity for people's rights and freedoms
physical, the person responsible and the person in charge of the treatment will apply technical and
appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,
which, if applicable, includes, among others:

          a) pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;

          b) the ability to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;

          c) the ability to restore availability and access to data

       personnel quickly in the event of a physical or technical incident;

          d) a process of regular verification, evaluation and assessment of effectiveness
       of the technical and organizational measures to guarantee the security of the
       treatment.

         2. When evaluating the adequacy of the security level, particular consideration will be given to
       take into account the risks presented by data processing, in particular as
       consequence of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration of
       personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed, or the

       unauthorized communication or access to said data (The emphasis is
       our).
         (…)
         4. The controller and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to
       ensure that any person acting under the authority of the person responsible or

       of the person in charge and has access to personal data can only process said
       data following the instructions of the person responsible, unless required to
       this by virtue of the law of the Union or of the Member States.”

For its part, recital 74 of the GDPR provides the following:

       “The responsibility of the person responsible for the treatment must be established
       for any processing of personal data carried out by himself or his
       account. In particular, the person responsible must be obliged to apply measures
       timely and effective and must be able to demonstrate the conformity of the
       processing activities with this Regulation, including the effectiveness of

       measures. These measures must take into account the nature, scope,
       context and purposes of the processing as well as the risk to the rights and
       freedoms of natural persons.”

28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 13/20

In this sense, recital 75 of the GDPR lists a series of factors or
assumptions associated with risks to the rights and freedoms of the interested parties: (the
emphasis is ours)

       “The risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of

       variable severity and probability, may be due to data processing that
       could cause physical, material or immaterial damage and harm, in
       particularly in cases where treatment may give rise to problems
       of discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, harm
       for reputation, loss of confidentiality of data subject to secrecy
       professional, unauthorized reversal of pseudonymization or any other

       significant economic or social harm; In cases where the
       interested parties of their rights and freedoms or are prevented from exercising control
       about your personal data; in cases where personal data
       treaties reveal ethnic or racial origin, political opinions, religion or
       philosophical beliefs, militancy in unions and data processing

       genetic data, data relating to health or data on sexual life, or the
       criminal convictions and offenses or related security measures; in the
       cases in which personal aspects are evaluated, in particular the analysis or
       prediction of aspects related to performance at work, situation
       economic, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or
       behavior, situation or movements, in order to create or use profiles

       personal; in cases in which personal data of people are processed
       vulnerable, particularly children; or in cases where the treatment
       involves a large amount of personal data and affects a large number of
       interested.” (emphasis is ours)

In the case analyzed in this file, the processing of data of a nature

personnel of the 47 local police officers would not have been accompanied by some
appropriate security measures.

The Llucmajor City Council has not provided documentation that proves the
existence of appropriate security measures intended to prevent a breach of
personal data such as the one analyzed in this file may occur.

Llucmajor, in its report of July 1, 2022, prepared in response to the transfer
of the AEPD recognized that the document “baixes fins a 30-11-2021” (Baixes fins a 30-11-2021)
