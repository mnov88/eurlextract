## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject submitted an access request under [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") to a social services authority (the Croatian Institute for Social Work, the controller), seeking full information about the processing of his personal data.

The controller did not respond or provide the requested data. The data subject filed a complaint with DPA on 13 June 2024.

The data subject initiated an administrative court procedure on 21 August 2024 against the DPA for a failure to act.

The DPA eventually issued a decision upholding the complaint and ordering the controller to comply on 29 August 2024.

### Holding

The Court held that if a controller fails to provide full access to personal data in response to an [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") request, this constitutes a violation, and the DPA must issue a decision within the legal deadline or face judicial review for "administrative silence" (inactivity).

Additionally, the court held that when the DPA issues a decision during litigation that fully satisfies the claimant’s request, the administrative dispute must be dismissed under national law and the claimant is entitled to reimbursement of legal costs — in this case, €1,250.

1. Before this court on August 21, 2024, the plaintiff initiated an administrative dispute
against the defendant for failure to issue a decision on the plaintiff's request for a determination of
a violation of the right to protection of personal data, which was sent to the defendant on June 13, 2024.
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
Split, Put Supavla 1
ADMINISTRATIVE COURT IN SPLIT
Business number: Us I-2033/2024-4
II. The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff the amount of EUR 1,250.00 as compensation for
the costs of the administrative dispute, within 15 days of receipt of the final decision.
Explanation
2. In its response to the lawsuit, the defendant essentially states that it decided on the
plaintiff's request for a determination of a violation of the right to protection of personal data by
decision Class UP/I-009-01/24-13/3, Reg. No.: 567-04-02/05-24-1 of August 9, 2024, which
founded the plaintiff's request for a determination of a violation of the right to protection of personal
data, that the shipment was sent via Croatian Post dd, which received the shipment in question on
August 12, 2024, and that the plaintiff received it on August 29, 2024. Furthermore, that point 3 of
the operative part of the cited decision of August 9
I. The administrative dispute is suspended.
Given that the defendant has not decided on the plaintiff's request in question by the time the
lawsuit is filed, that is, that it has not delivered to the plaintiff any decision that may have been
made regarding the plaintiff's request in question, the plaintiff proposes to issue a judgment ordering
the defendant to decide, within 60 days of delivery of the judgment, on the plaintiff's request for a
determination of a violation of the right to protection of personal data, which was sent to the
defendant on June 13, 2024, and to deliver the decision in question to the plaintiff, and to reimburse
him for the costs of the administrative dispute.
r i j e š i o j e
5. Considering the above, i.e. that in the specific case, the aforementioned decision of the
defendant Class: UP/I-009-01/24-13/3, Reg. No.: 567- 04-02/05-24- 1 of August 9, 2024, decided on the
plaintiff's claim in question, and since the defendant was obliged not only to make a decision on the plaintiff's
claim within the statutory deadline, but was also obliged to duly deliver that decision to the plaintiff within
the statutory deadline and before the moment of seeking administrative-judicial protection, which is not the
case here (given that the claim was filed on August 21, 2024, and the defendant's decision in question was
delivered to the plaintiff on August 29, 2024), the court finds that the defendant acted in full during the
proceedings before the court in accordance with the claim filed for the so-called the silence of the
administration, i.e. decided on the request in question, which is why the prerequisites for the suspension of
the administrative dispute were met in the specific case and it was necessary, based on the provisions of
Article 106, paragraph 1, item 2, in conjunction with Article 103, paragraph 1 of the ZUS, to resolve it as
under point I of the dictum.
6. Furthermore, Article 144, paragraph 1 of the ZUS stipulates that the costs of a dispute shall
consist of justified expenses incurred during or in connection with the dispute. Paragraph 2 stipulates that
the costs of a dispute shall also include the remuneration for the work of lawyers and other persons entitled
to statutory compensation. Paragraph 3 stipulates that the value of the subject matter of the dispute shall be
deemed to be inestimable.
4. According to the provision of Article 103, paragraph 1 of the Administrative Disputes Act (Official
Gazette, No. 36/2024; hereinafter: ZUS), if the defendant fully complies with the claim during the dispute,
the court will suspend the dispute.
of the General Data Protection Regulation in relation to the request submitted on 8 June 2024, and point 4
of the operative part ordered the Croatian Institute for Social Work as the controller to inform the respondent
of the action referred to in point 3 of the aforementioned decision within 30 days of the date of receipt of the
decision. Further to the request, the Croatian Institute for Social Work informed the respondent that it had
received the decision Class UP/I-009-01/24-13/3, Reg. No.: 567-04-02/05-24-1 on 14 August 2024 and that
it had acted on it, that is, that it had provided the respondent with all information related to the processing of
his personal data. Taking into account all of the above, and considering that the defendant decided on the
plaintiff's request and issued the decision Class UP/I-009-01/24-13/3, Reg. No.: 567-04-02/05-24-1 of
August 9, 2024, and that the Croatian Institute for Social Work, as the controller of the processing, acted in
accordance with the order from the above-mentioned decision, the defendant proposes that the court
suspend the dispute in its entirety / reject the claim.
of the General Data Protection Regulation in relation to the request submitted on 8 June 2024 (point 3 of
the operative part); a period of 30 days has been set for the action referred to in point 3 of the operative
part, and the Croatian Institute for Social Work Zagreb, as the controller, must notify the defendant of the
action taken within the specified period (point 4 of the operative part).
3. From the decision of the defendant Class: UP/I-009-01/24-13/3, Reg. No.: 567-04-02/05-24- 1
of 9 August 2024, which is attached to the file of the administrative body, it is clear that the same request
for establishing the right to a violation of the right to protection of personal data of the Aÿ, here the plaintiff,
is well-founded (point 1 of the operative part); it is established that the failure to provide all information
relating to the processing of the plaintiff's personal data by the Croatian Institute for Social Work Zagreb, Ul.
Ivana Dežmana 6, has resulted in a violation of Article 15 of the General Regulation for the Protection of
Personal Data (point 2 of the operative part); the Croatian Institute for Social Work Zagreb, Ul. Ivana
Dežmana 6 is ordered to provide the plaintiff with all information relating to the processing of his personal
data / enable the exercise of the right to access his personal data in accordance with Article 15.
August 2024, the Croatian Institute for Social Work was ordered to enable the plaintiff to exercise the right
to access his personal data in accordance with Article 15.
7. The provision of Article 147, paragraph 6 of the ZUS stipulates that if the dispute is discontinued
after the defendant has acted upon the claim, the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the costs of the
dispute.
