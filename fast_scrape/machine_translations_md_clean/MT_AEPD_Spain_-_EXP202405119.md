## English Summary

### Facts

On 22 April 2024, the Spanish DPA (AEPD) initiated sanctioning procedures against Watium S.L. (the controller). As part of its investigation, the AEPD twice requested the controller to provide information related to the complaint filed against it. The requests were received by the controller on 23 November 2023 and 9 February 2024 respectively.

On 21 February 2024, the controller requested that the period for providing the documents and information be extended to 29 February 2024. Despite this request, the controller did not respond to the AEPD with the requested information.

### Holding

[Article 58(1)(e)](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#1e "Article 58 GDPR") GDPR empowers DPAs to order controllers to facilitate information in order for DPAs to conduct their investigation. The failure to comply with such requests for information can be sanctioned [Article 83(5)(e) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#5e "Article 83 GDPR").

Given these likely violations, the AEPD resolved to initiate sanction proceedings against the controller and recommended a sanction of €160,000. In calculating the fine, the AEPD noted that this was a grave infraction warranting a high sanction. It also took account of the large size of the controller, aiming for the fine to be dissuasive and proportionate.

Pursuant to [Law 39/2015](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10565), a Spanish law concerning administrative proceedings, the AEPD informed the controller that it may acknowledge its responsibility for the alleged violations and/or pay the proposed fine. Each of these actions reduces the imposed fine by 20%. The controller opted to reduce the fine by 40%, both acknowledging its responsibility for the violations and paying the reduced sanction amount of €96,000.
