## English Summary

### Facts

The Complainant was an employee at the Hellenic Ministry of Mercantile Marine and Island Policy and she claimed that the Ministry violated her right of access according to [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR") and her right of rectification according to [Article 16 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_16_GDPR "Article 16 GDPR"). She was candidate for an executive position within the Ministry and asked via e-mail that all candidates are provided with the right of objection and the right for an internal administrative appeal. The Head of the Department replied to her that there was no right to objection in this phase and that all candidates have been treated equally. It also noted that the ranking lists of the candidates contain personal data and there is no legal obligation to publish them.

### Dispute

Is there an obligation to publish ranking lists of candidates containing personal data?

### Holding

The ranking lists of the candidates contain personal data and there is no legal obligation to publish them. The HDPA invoked the obligations of the data controllers according to [Article 12(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#3 "Article 12 GDPR") and [Article 12(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#4 "Article 12 GDPR") when a data subject may exercise their right of access according to [Article 15(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#1 "Article 15 GDPR") and [Article 15(3) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR#3 "Article 15 GDPR"). Then, it explained that the right of objection and the right to internal administrative appeal under public administrative law constitute different legal bases and imply different legal consequences from the right to rectification under [Article 16 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_16_GDPR "Article 16 GDPR"). Thus, the data subject canâ€™t exercise them by exercising the right to rectification under [Article 16 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_16_GDPR "Article 16 GDPR"). Finally, the HDPA issued a reprimand to the Ministry according to [Article 58(2)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_58_GDPR#2b "Article 58 GDPR") for the infringement of [Article 12 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR "Article 12 GDPR") and [Article 15 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR "Article 15 GDPR").
