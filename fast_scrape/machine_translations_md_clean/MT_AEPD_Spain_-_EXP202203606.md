## English Summary

### Facts

Resolution No. R/00665/2022 is highlighted by a case concerning a claimant (namely A.A.A) and a respondent party (namely Securitas Direct España, S.A).

The claimant filed against the respondent party for not having been duly attended to his right of access and deletion enshrined in Articles 15 to 22 of the RGPD, Articles 13 to 18 LOPDGDD and [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR") respectively. The conflict of law arose in this case when a sufficiently legally established response was not generated by the respondent to the claimants request.

Furthermore, the claim was transferred to the respondent so that the entity could proceed with its analysis and provide a response to the claimant within a period of one month. The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to admit the claim for processing and the parties concerned were informed of the maximum term for resolution, that being six months. The competence of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is refined by [Article 55 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_55_GDPR "Article 55 GDPR") in the promotion of an obligation between controllers and processors to deal with complaints issued by data subjects.

The result of the said transfer did not allow the claimants issues to be understood as satisfied. Consequently, due to the lack of attention delegated to the claimants rights further set forth in Articles 15 to 22 of EU Regulation 2016/679, an agreement to admit for processing was initiated.

### Holding

The Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency went on to note that considering the purpose of the outlined procedure was to ensure that the rights of affected parties were fully restored, the complaint that gave rise to this procedure should be upheld on formal grounds due to the fact that the right of access had been complied with and the right of erasure had been duly denied (on the applicable grounds of [Article 17 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_17_GDPR "Article 17 GDPR")).

Considering the claim made on February 21, 2022 before this Agency by A.A.A.,
(hereinafter the claimant party), against SECURITAS DIRECT ESPAÑA, S.A., (to
from now on the claimed party), for not having been duly attended to
right of access and deletion.

Carrying out the procedural actions provided for in Title VIII of the Law
Organic 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of
digital rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the following have been verified

                                       FACTS

FIRST: The complaining party exercised the rights of access and deletion against the
claimed with NIF A26106013, without your request having received the answer

mechanism prior to the admission to processing of the claims that are formulated before

the AEPD, consisting of transferring them to the Data Protection Delegates
designated by those responsible or in charge of the treatment, for the purposes foreseen
in article 37 of the aforementioned rule, or to these when they have not been designated,
transferred the claim to the claimed entity so that it could proceed with its
analysis and respond to the complaining party and this Agency within a

month.

The representative/Delegate of Data Protection of the claimed person responds to this
Agency dated April 22, 2022, explains the contractual relationship maintained
between the parties and regarding the rights requested, it only refers to the lack of
copy/photocopy of the DNI to identify the claimant in her application.

Namely:
“…it was not until June 18, 2021 that Securitas Direct received the first written
of exercise of the right of cancellation (no access) of personal data by
Mrs. Sánchez, which was answered on June 21, 2021 by email and
where he was asked to attach a copy of the DNI to be able to execute it.

Subsequently, the same request was received again, this time by mail on 23
August 2021 which was answered again on August 24, 2021 in terms
similar, that is, requesting a copy of your DNI again since it was not attached…”

The respondent also provides an email with the same date, April 22,

2022, where it sends to the complaining party its data referring to the right of access and,
justifies that it does not attend to the right of suppression due to the controversy between the
parties awaiting resolution.

agreed to admit the submitted claim for processing and informed the parties that the
maximum term to resolve this procedure, which is understood to have started
through said admission agreement, it will be six months.

The aforementioned agreement granted the respondent entity a hearing procedure, to

that within a period of fifteen business days present the allegations that it deems
convenient. As of the resolution date of this claim, there have been
allegations where they confirm everything stated above and state that they do not
understand why the claim was admitted for processing in view of the above.

                           FOUNDATIONS OF LAW

FIRST: The Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection, in accordance with the provisions of section 2 of article 56 in
in relation to section 1 f) of article 57, both of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the

European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of

and those in charge of the treatment to cooperate with the control authority that requests it in
the performance of their duties. In the event that they have appointed a

data protection delegate, article 39 of the RGPD attributes to it the function of
cooperate with that authority.

Similarly, the domestic legal system, in article 65.4 of the LOPDGDD, has
foreseen a mechanism prior to the admission to processing of the claims that are

formulated before the Spanish Agency for Data Protection, which consists of giving
transfer of the same to the data protection delegates designated by the
responsible or in charge of the treatment, for the purposes provided in article 37 of
the aforementioned norm, or to these when they have not been designated, so that they proceed to the
analysis of said claims and to respond to them within a month.

claim that gives rise to this procedure, it was transferred to the
responsible entity to proceed with its analysis, respond to this Agency

within a month and prove that they have provided the claimant with the due response,
in the event of exercising the rights regulated in articles 15 to 22 of the
GDPR.

The result of said transfer did not allow to understand satisfied the claims of the
claiming party. Consequently, on May 21, 2022, for the purposes
provided for in article 64.2 of the LOPDGDD, the Director of the Spanish Agency for
Data Protection agreed to admit the submitted claim for processing. Saying
agreement of admission to procedure determines the opening of the present procedure of

whenever possible, due to the prevalence of alternative mechanisms that have

protection in current regulations.

It is the exclusive competence of this Agency to assess whether there are responsibilities
administrative that must be purged in a sanctioning procedure and, in
consequently, the decision on its opening, not existing obligation to initiate a

procedure before any request made by a third party. Such a decision must

FIFTH: In accordance with the provisions of article 15 of the RGPD and article 13 of the

LOPDGDD, "the interested party has the right to obtain from the data controller

Therefore, the right of suppression is also considered answered.

Spanish Data Protection RESOLVES:

SPAIN, S.A.

In accordance with the provisions of article 50 of the LOPDGDD, this
