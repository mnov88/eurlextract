## English Summary

### Facts

The data subject claims that the Community/condominium, to which he belongs, has posted on a bulletin board, located in a common area (at the entrance of the doorway next to the elevator), a judgement in which his personal data (name, address and information about the judicial process) appears.

Exposure of the document allegedly took place since May 17, 2021 without, at the date of the complaint (July 26, 2021) having being deleted or anonymized despite the clear warning on the document itself for non-dissemination to non-interested parties without prior dissociation of personal data: "it will be contrary to the Law to disseminate non-anonymized Judicial documents that have not been anonymized".

Additionally, on November 24, 2017 the data subject had already filed a complaint against the Community before the AEPD for facts of identical nature. This was processed under procedure A/00001/2018 with a warning result (R/00601/2018) for infringement and a requirement to remove the information improperly exposed.

The Community alleged that on October 13, 2021 it proceeded with the withdrawal of the document exhibited on the notice board.

### Holding

The Spanish DPA considered that even though the Community is authorized to display personal data in some cases for the management of the community, the notice board must not be placed in a public area of transit easily accessible by any person.

The AEPD highlighted that the data subject had a previous complaint against the Community under proceeding A/00001/2018, concluded with a warning to the Community and an order to remove the (other) document displayed.

AEPD concluded that, based on the evidence, it occurred a personal data security breach, categorized as a breach of confidentiality as the data subject’s personal data was improperly exposed by the Community to third parties, as they appeared in an Decree of Execution of Judicial Titles. Specifically, the information was displayed on a bulletin board in plain view of any person who accesses the building and not only the neighbors.

For this reason, the Community was fined €1,500 for unduly exposure of personal data to third parties on a public bulletin board, in violation of [Article 5(1)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR "Article 5 GDPR") and [Article 32 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_32_GDPR "Article 32 GDPR").

against the Community before the AEPD for acts of the same nature. This was

(R/00601/2018) for infringement (article 44.3.d of organic law 15/1999) and
requirement for removal of improperly exposed information.

risk your personal data. Likewise, it indicates that it is not clear what the purpose is
of such publication of your personal data.

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of article 4.1 of the RGPD, there is
the processing of personal data, since the Community

carries out, among other treatments, the collection, registration, organization, conservation,
modification, consultation, use, deletion of the following personal data of
natural persons, such as: name, surname, address, identification number,
telephone number etc.

The Community carries out this activity in its capacity as data controller,

given that he is the one who determines the ends and means of such activity, by virtue of article
4.7 of the GDPR.

Article 4 section 12 of the GDPR broadly defines “violations of
security of personal data” (hereinafter security breach) as “all

those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or alteration
accidental or unlawful personal data transmitted, preserved or otherwise processed
form, or unauthorized communication or access to said data.”

In the present case, there is a personal data security breach in the
circumstances indicated above, categorized as a breach of confidentiality when

personal data of the claimant having been displayed on a bulletin board in a
common area, specifically in the access portal of the property of the Community of
Owners, between the stairs and the elevator, therefore in sight of any
person who accesses it and not only the neighbors.

It should be noted that the identification of a security breach does not imply the
imposition of a sanction directly by this Agency, since it is necessary

applied.

Within the treatment principles provided for in article 5 of the RGPD, the
integrity and confidentiality of personal data is guaranteed in section 1.f)
of article 5 of the GDPR. For its part, the security of personal data comes
regulated in articles 32, 33 and 34 of the RGPD, which regulate the security of the
processing, notification of a breach of personal data security to
the control authority, as well as the communication to the interested party, respectively.

                                Article 5.1.f) of the GDPR

Article 5.1.f) “Principles relating to processing” of the GDPR establishes:

"1. The personal data will be:
(…)

       f) treated in such a way as to ensure adequate safety of the

       personal data, including protection against unauthorized processing or
       unlawful and against its loss, destruction or accidental damage, through the application
       of appropriate technical or organizational measures ("integrity and
       confidentiality»).”

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 7/11

In the present case, it is clear that the personal data of the claimant (name,
surnames and information about a judicial process), were improperly exposed

by the Community to third parties, since they appeared in a Decree of Execution of
Judicial Titles that was placed by said Community on a bulletin board,
locked, located at the entrance to the property (between the stairs and the
elevator), a place where any person can pass, whether or not they are the owner of the
property being, therefore, an area of public access, which constitutes an access
not authorized to said data. This document was exposed from the 17th of

May 2021 until October 13, 2021.

Article 9.h) of the Horizontal Property Law indicates as the owner's obligation the
of “Communicate to whoever exercises the functions of Secretary of the community, for
any means that allows proof of receipt, address in Spain

for the purposes of summonses and notifications of all kinds related to the community.
In the absence of this communication, the address will be considered for summonses and
notifications to the apartment or premises belonging to the community, taking full effect
legal those delivered to the occupant thereof.

       If a summons or notification to the owner is attempted, it is impossible to carry it out

in the place provided for in the previous paragraph, it will be understood to be carried out by means of the
placement of the corresponding communication on the bulletin board of the
community, or in a visible place of general use enabled for this purpose, with diligence
expressive of the date and reasons why this form of notification is carried out,
signed by whoever exercises the functions of Secretary of the community, with the approval

good of the President. The notification carried out in this way will produce full
legal effects within a period of three calendar days.”

In the present case, the presentation of the claimant's data on the board of the
community does not comply with the assumptions set forth in the Horizontal Property Law.

In accordance with the evidence available, it is considered that the
known facts constitute an infringement, attributable to the Community, for
violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD.

                Classification of the violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD

The violation of article 5.1.f) of the RGPD implies the commission of the violations
typified in article 83.5 of the RGPD that under the heading “General conditions
for the imposition of administrative fines” provides:

“Infringements of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with the
paragraph 2, with administrative fines of a maximum of EUR 20 000 000 or,
In the case of a company, an amount equivalent to a maximum of 4% of the
global total annual business volume of the previous financial year, opting for

In this regard, the LOPDGDD, in its article 71 “Infringements” establishes that
“The acts and conduct referred to in sections 4,

5 and 6 of article 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as those that result
contrary to this organic law.”

For the purposes of the limitation period, article 72 “Infringements considered very
“serious” of the LOPDGDD indicates:

"1. Based on what is established in article 83.5 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679,

a substantial violation of the articles mentioned therein and, in particular, the

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in article 83.2 of the RGPD and the
article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infraction committed by violating the
established in article 5.1.f) of the RGPD, allows setting a penalty of €1,000 (one thousand

Article 32 “Security of processing” of the GDPR establishes:

"1. Taking into account the state of the art, the application costs, and the
nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as risks of

appropriate organizational measures to guarantee a level of security appropriate to the risk,

       b) the ability to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, availability and
       permanent resilience of treatment systems and services;
       c) the ability to restore availability and access to data

3. Adherence to a code of conduct approved pursuant to Article 40 or to a
certification mechanism approved pursuant to article 42 may serve as an element

to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established in section 1 of the
present article.

4. The controller and the person in charge of the treatment will take measures to ensure that
any person acting under the authority of the person responsible or in charge and
has access to personal data can only process said data following

instructions of the person responsible, unless it is obliged to do so by virtue of the Law of
the Union or the Member States.

In the present case, at the time of the breach, it cannot be said that the
claimed had the appropriate measures to avoid the incident, since

posted the complainant's personal details on a notice board in an area
easily accessible by anyone (at the access portal, between the stairs
and the elevator) of the Community property, having also been warned by
this Agency in a previous procedure for similar facts, which puts into question
evidence that it has not adopted adequate technical and organizational measures to avoid
again security incidents like the one that happened.

In accordance with the evidence available, it is considered that the
known facts constitute an infringement, attributable to the Community, for
violation of article 32 of the RGPD.
