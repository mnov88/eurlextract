## English Summary

### Facts

It was found that the TEY-CYTA Association (Cyprus Telecommunications Authority Employees Welfare Fund) had access to personal data, more than was needed to satisfy the purposes, such as the photo of its members. The TEY-CYTA due to the fact that they couldn't separate the databases for employees and for members, was not able to respond as they should.

### Holding

The Commissioner held that CYTA violated articles 5 (1), 24 (1) and (2), 25 (1) and (2) and 32 of the GDPR and instructed CYTA to establish such security measures and practices, so that TEY-CYTA no longer has access to data disproportionate to the purpose, excluding access to the photo of its members. In this case, no fine was imposed.
