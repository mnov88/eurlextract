SECOND: The AEPD has notified the claimant of the agreement to initiate the present sanctioning procedure, but the claimant has not presented any allegations or evidence that contradict the facts denounced.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016, on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), recognizes each supervisory authority, and as established in Articles 47, 64.2 and 68.1 of the Organic Law 3/2018, of 5 December, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate this procedure.2 of the LOPDGDD determines that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in the present organic law, by the regulatory provisions dictated in its development and, insofar as they do not contradict them, with subsidiary character, by the general rules on administrative procedures."IIArticle 4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter referred to as GDPR), under the heading "Definitions", provides that: "For the purposes of this Regulation 1) "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data or upon sets of personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;"Therefore, in accordance with these definitions, the collection of personal data through forms included on a website constitutes data processing, with respect to which the data controller must comply with the provisions of Article 13 of the RGPD, a provision which has been moved from 25 May 2018 to Article 5 of Organic Law 15/1999, of 13 December, on the Protection of Personal Data.In relation to this matter, it is noted that the Spanish Data Protection Agency has at the disposal of citizens the Guide for the fulfillment of the duty to inform (https://www.aepd.es/media/guias/guia-modelo-clausula-informativa.pdf) and, in case of low risk data processing, the free tool Facilita(https://www.aepd.es/herramientas/facilita.html).III Article 13 of the RGPD, which determines the information to be provided to the interested party at the time of collection of their data, provides that: "1.

In accordance with the evidence available at this time of the agreement to initiate the sanctioning procedure, and without prejudice to the results of the investigation, the facts presented could constitute, by the defendant, an infringement of the provisions of Article 13 of the RGPD.Likewise, if the existence of an infringement is confirmed, in accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned article 58.2.d) of the RGPD, the resolution may order the respondent, as the person responsible for the processing, to adapt the information offered to users whose personal data is collected to the requirements of article 13 of the RGPD, as well as to provide evidence to prove that the requirements have been met. VA In order to determine the administrative fine to be imposed, the provisions of Articles 83.1 and 83.2 of the RGPD must be observed, which are the provisions that they indicate:
   "Each supervisory authority shall ensure that the imposition of administrative fines under this Article for the infringements of this Regulation referred to in paragraphs 4, 9 and 6 is in each individual case effective, proportionate and dissuasive. "Administrative fines shall be imposed in addition to or instead of the measures referred to in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j), depending on the circumstances of the individual case. Due account shall be taken in deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and the succession thereof in each individual case:(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, taking into account the nature, extent or purpose of the processing operation concerned, as well as the number of data subjects concerned and the level of damage suffered(d) the degree of responsibility of the controller or processor, taking into account the technical or organisational measures they have implemented pursuant to Articles 25 and 32(g) the categories of personal data affected by the infringement; (h) the manner in which the supervisory authority became aware of the infringement, in particular whether and to what extent the controller or processor notified the infringement; (i) where the measures referred to in Article 58(2) were previously ordered against the controller or processor concerned in relation to the same matter, compliance with those measures;(j) adherence to codes of conduct under Article 40 or to certification mechanisms approved under Article 42; and"In accordance with the provisions of Article 83.2.k) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the following may also be taken into account: a) The continuous nature of the infringement. b) The link between the activity of the offender and the processing of personal data.c) The benefits obtained as a result of the commission of the infringement.d) The possibility that the conduct of the affected party could have led to the commission of the infringement.e) The existence of a merger process by absorption subsequent to the commission of the infringement, which cannot be attributed to the absorbing entity.f) The effect on the rights of minors.g) The availability, when it is not compulsory, of a data protection representative.
h) The submission by the responsible party or person in charge, on a voluntary basis, of mechanisms for the alternative resolution of conflicts, in those cases in which there are disputes between the former and any interested party" In accordance with the precepts transcribed, for the purposes of fixing the amount of the fine, the following mitigating factors are deemed to be concurrent in the present case to be imposed on the entity claimed as responsible for an infringement as set out in article 83.5.b) of the RGPD: -The claimed entity does not have previous infringements (83.2 e) RGPD). -It has not obtained direct benefits (83.2 k) RGPD and 76.2.c) LOPDGD).
