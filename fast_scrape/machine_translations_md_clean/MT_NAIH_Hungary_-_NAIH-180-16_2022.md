## English Summary

### Facts

A data subject found that his data (name, address, mobile number) were included in a public online directory operated by a telecom operator (controller). The data was obtained by the operator in 2015, when the data subject first contracted with the company, but only got disclosed in 2018, when the data subject renewed his subscription via telephone. He first requested the deletion of his data via an online form, but found later that the request was ignored. He then requested the deletion via telephone as well. This once again proved unsuccessful, in spite of the promises he received on the phone. He subsequently filed a complaint with the Hungarian DPA to enforce the deletion of his data. In the meantime, the controller deleted the data from the registry.

### Holding

The Hungarian DPA (NAIH) found that the data subject's request for deletion was already fulfilled, and that therefore there was no need for the controller to act on this aspect of the complaint. However, the NAIH started an own-volition investigation into the controller's data processing practices with particular regard to data subject requests.

Subsequently, the NAIH found that the controller was in breach of the accountability principle under [Article 5(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_5_GDPR#2 "Article 5 GDPR"), since it could not prove that it had received valid consent for the processing of the data subject's personal data. Moreover, it also found that since the controller had not even asked the data subject for valid consent, it had no legal grounds for processing under [Article 6(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1 "Article 6 GDPR"). Finally, the NAIH held that the controller was in breach of [Article 12(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#2 "Article 12 GDPR") for mis-registering the data subject's request for the deletion of his data as a complaint about the service.

The NAIH decided to subsequently impose a fine on the controller. It argued that a simple reprimand would not be proportionate or dissuasive, for multiple reasons. As aggravating circumstances, the NAIH took into account the fact that the data subject had to request deletion multiple times and that the data was included in the database for more than 3 years without a valid legal ground ([Article 83(2)(a)](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2a "Article 83 GDPR")); that the controller committed multiple infringements ([Article 83(2)(d)](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2d "Article 83 GDPR")) including gross negligence in handling the case ([Article 83(2)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2b "Article 83 GDPR")); as well as that the NAIH had already warned the controller about its processing activities previously ([Article 83(2)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2b "Article 83 GDPR")).

However, the NAIH took into account as mitigating factors that the controller offered a small compensation to the data subject ([Article 83(2)(c)](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2c "Article 83 GDPR")); that it conducted the requested deletion in the meantime ([Article 83(2)(f)](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2f "Article 83 GDPR")); as well as the the NAIH missed some of its deadlines when investigating the case ([Article 83(2)(k)](/index.php?title=Article_83_GDPR#2k "Article 83 GDPR")). Subsequently, the NAIH decided to fine the controller 5,000,000 HUF (~€13,000). Given that the controller's annual turnover was more than €752,000,000, this fine is very far from the maximum threshold allowed by the GDPR.

However, the Authority is of the opinion that all this consent has been given to it

It is based on consent within the meaning of Article 7 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
in the case of data processing, the controller must be able to prove that

In view of the above, it cannot be proved that it originated from the Applicant
as a result of a voluntary declaration or an act unequivocally expressing confirmation

the Authority notes that the
Applicant is unable to demonstrate compliance with data protection principles on this
therefore infringed Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation.
the principle of accountability under paragraph 1.

Consequently, it has not been established that the Applicant actually agreed
to disclose your personal data in the Applicant's online directory
that the Applicant would have had for the disclosure
with an appropriate legal basis, the Authority finds that the Applicant has a general data protection
in breach of Article 6 (1) of the Regulation, was disclosed by the Applicant without legal basis
personal information in your online directory.

3. The Applicant classified the Applicant's requests recorded by telephone as a complaint by the Authority
in their opinion, to exercise the rights of the data subject, to delete the personal data of the Applicant
as they specifically requested the deletion of his personal data
Requested from your online directory.

The Authority will accordingly comply with the rules on the erasure of personal data

examined.

The General Data Protection Regulation governs the rights of data subjects
the right to cancel. On this basis, given that the Applicant in his statement and
Annex 3 of the General Terms and Conditions on data management information
35, the processing of personal data available in the online directory
Article 6 (1) (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation

indicated the legal basis for the consent - Article 17 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation
(b), the data subject shall have the right to request an unreasonable delay at the request of the controller

delete the personal data of the data subject without undue delay if the data subject,

and there is no other legal basis for data processing.

In the present case, even without examining the validity of certain conceptual elements of consent
it can be stated that the Applicant - on the basis of his declaration and registration system - a
managed and published on its consent basis in its online directory
Applicant's personal data after the re-contract dated 12 June 2018. As described above, a
The Authority found that it had not been demonstrated that the Applicant had in fact consented
to disclose your personal data in the Applicant's online directory

however, this fact was only revealed in the present proceedings. The Applicant
When submitting requests for the deletion of personal data, the Applicant shall
was aware that he had disclosed personal information with the consent of the Applicant
and the Applicant requests the withdrawal of this consent. The Applicant is therefore the Applicant
pursuant to Article 17 (1) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation

About how to provide information about deleting personal information
the obligations of the controller are detailed in Article 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

consent to the management of the application and initiated their cancellation by the Applicant online
due to technical or administrative errors only on July 5, 2021

after becoming aware of it.

On the occasion of the telephone inquiry of the Applicant on 2 May 2021, the preceding one

that it would have provided information on the basis of the request
measures. If the Applicant had not indicated his problem by telephone two
On several occasions, the Applicant would not have taken action to comply with the data subject's request
in order to. Consequently, the Authority finds that the Applicant has not complied with the
Applicant's request to delete personal data, in violation of the general
Article 17 (1) (b) of the Data Protection Regulation. The technical error or its clerks
an error does not relieve the Applicant of the responsibility of the data controller.
