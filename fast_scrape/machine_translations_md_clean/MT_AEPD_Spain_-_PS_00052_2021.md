## English Summary

### Facts

An ex-worker filed a complaint against Consorcio ESS-Bilbao (an infrastructure construction company) with the Spanish DPA (AEPD), in which it asked the authority to determine if the implementation of a biometric fingerprint recognition system to monitor employee working hours was compliant with GDPR.

The consortium had an agreement with Robotics, a biometric system company, which was designated as a processor. Robotics, in turn, had a contract with Microsoft Ireland Operations LTD for cloud computing data storage, operating in the capacity of sub-processor in this case.

The company stated that it had previously informed the workers that this system would be implemented gradually and that they based this processing of personal data on [Article 6(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1a "Article 6 GDPR"), having obtained their employee’s explicit consent for the processing of personal data that this system entailed. Additionally, the company stated that the processing was also lawful according to [Articles 6(1)(b)](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1b "Article 6 GDPR") and [(c) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1c "Article 6 GDPR") due to the fact that the effective monitoring of working hours was necessary for the performance of the employment contract, and a legal obligation for a company under Spanish law, respectively.

Additionally, the company alleged that this system did not constitute processing of special categories or personal data under [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR") because the recognition of the fingerprint generated and internal number and hash value which was non reversible, and that there was no recording of the fingerprint image itself.

When the complaint was filed, the company decided to substitute the biometric fingerprint registration system with another system using employee identification cards.

### Holding

The AEPD’s decision began by manifesting its ongoing concerns regarding the growing trend in use of biometric systems and their intrusiveness for the fundamental rights of data subjects, as well as the centralisation of stored biometric data, which increases the risks of data breaches and unlawful access to this data.

The AEPD held that in this case, although the image of the fingerprint itself is not stored, the fact that hash and numerical values based on the fingerprint are introduced into templates which register physical characteristics and can be used to individually identify a data subject, meant that this data should be regarded as a special category of personal data under [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"). The AEPD went on to evaluate if the use of a biometric register system was adequate, necessary and proportional with regards to the purpose it served.

In this case, the AEPD noted that although the Spanish law imposed an obligation to monitor the effective work hours and duties carried out by employees, it does not state a specific method or system in order to do so. The AEPD held that before implementing a fingerprint-based identity recognition system, the company should have assessed whether there was a less intrusive measure available to achieve the same purpose. Based on the its determination that the biometric data processed corresponded to a special category of personal data under [Article 9 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR "Article 9 GDPR"), the AEPD held that a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) under [Article 35 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR "Article 35 GDPR") should have been carried out in this case, and that the company’s failure to carry one out in this case was a clear breach of GDPR.

Finally, the AEPD acknowledged that the company had replaced the biometric registration system with a less intrusive one using identification cards. However, the AEDP stated that although corrective measures had been put into place, the complaint should not be archived as if the breach had not taken place, and issued a reprimand to the company for the violation of [Article 35 GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_35_GDPR "Article 35 GDPR") because of its failure to conduct a DPIA when implementing the aforementioned biometric registration system.

               RESOLUTION OF PUNISHMENT PROCEDURE

Of the procedure instructed by the Spanish Agency for Data Protection and based on
to the following

                                 BACKGROUND

FIRST: A.A.A. (hereinafter, the claimant) on 07/03/2020 filed
claim before the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) The claim
is directed against the CONSORTIUM FOR THE CONSTRUCTION, EQUIPMENT AND
OPERATION OF THE SPANISH HEADQUARTERS OF THE EUROPEAN SOURCE OF
SPALATION NEUTRONS with NIF G95455473 (hereinafter, the claimed one).

The defendant declares that he was a union delegate, but no longer provides his services for
the claimed. The grounds on which the claim is based are that, since November
2019, the respondent has implemented a presence control system in the company,
hourly signing by biometric fingerprint recognition. It was distributed among the employees
two a document, identified as 1, where consent is required for the
processing of biometric data and requests that it be determined whether the person claimed has acted

tuated in accordance with current legislation.

-“The AEPD determines that these data have the condition of a personal nature of
special category.” “The data stored in ROBOTICS systems does not
contain no particular aspect of personality, limiting their function to identifying
to a subject when the information is linked to it.”

-“Regarding the need for the interested party to give their consent or to be able to
oppose the processing of your biometric data, it should be noted that article 7 of the
RGPD- Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
04/27/2016 regarding the protection of natural persons with regard to

“Based on article 6 of the RGPD, the treatment will be lawful through the consent
of the interested party -employee- or if the treatment is necessary for the execution of a
contract to which the interested party is a party.

“It is necessary for the company to inform its employees of all of the above
prior to the use of such systems in order to facilitate such communication.
ROBOTICS puts at your disposal an informative note that companies should

FOURTH: On 09/16/2020, a letter was received from the claimant specifying
The complaint consists of two parts:

-The first refers to the use of biometric data, which the company says not al-

macena.

The second part refers to the fact that the company informs the workers of
that your personal data will be accessible by the installation company, but not
such data can also be accessed by other companies, such as MICRO-
SOFT.

It indicates that the company has four offices (2 in Bizkaia, 1 in Álava and another in Madrid) and
that in all four the same data treatment is given to all employees.

On the other hand, "I would like to expand the complaint: The company for some years has

started processing payroll with an external company.” "Since the information
that they give to said company I believe that it includes personal data of a protected category
(salary, identity, social security number, DNI...) I think I should tell the employees
two that said data will be shared with third parties. It never has. I know
I have personally pointed it out and they have done nothing to fix it.”

FIFTH: On 04/19/2021, the Director of the AEPD agreed to initiate against the
claimed, sanctioning procedure of warning for the alleged infringement
of article 35 of the RGPD, in accordance with article 83.4.a) of the RGPD.

SIXTH: On 05/04/2021, allegations were received from the respondent, stating:

literal:

“FIRST: That by the Director of the Spanish Agency for Data Protection,
sanction CONSORTIUM FOR THE CONSTRUCTION, EQUIPMENT AND
OPERATION OF THE SPANISH HEADQUARTERS OF THE EUROPEAN SOURCE OF
SPALATION NEUTRONS, with NIF G95455473, for an infringement of the

Request that no penalty be imposed.

EIGHTH: Of the actions carried out in this procedure and of the

documentation in the file, the following have been accredited:

                              PROVEN FACTS

1) The respondent decided to start in 2019 the progressive implementation of a system

I feel".

3) The respondent informed the staff of the system to be implemented. It is also stated that
They held meetings with the workers' representatives. Declare the claim
do that the system was going to be implemented in test mode as of 10/1/2019 and to

the entire staff as of 11/1/2019.

4) The respondent provides a copy of the treatment order contract signed on
05/24/2019 with ROBOTICS. ROBOTICS accesses data of the claimed person stored
in the “human resources” file in accordance with the instructions of the person claimed. Them-

These data are stored in the VISUALTIME application, a comprehensive software solution, in the
that all the underlying infrastructure, middleware, software, and data of the
applications are located in the provider's data center. For storage-
storage of the data, ROBOTICS has signed a hosting contract of "cloud
computing” with MICROSOFT IRELAND OPERATIONS LTD which is considered sub-
charged with the treatment regarding the operation of the server.

5) The system for registering and using the fingerprint of the employees, in accordance with the
ROBOTICS document, called "LEGAL ASPECTS OF SIGNING WITH
ROBOTICS BIOMETRIC READERS THAT MUST BE COMMUNICATED TO THE
PERSONAL” consists in that: “A number generated from characters is stored

physical characteristics of a person. “From the moment a user puts their finger
in the terminal reader (they have four), an identification number is generated.
This number is the one that is stored in the terminal's memory and the one that is distributed to
the other terminals. This same number is the one used to compare if the fingerprint
corresponds to a user or not. This number has no value outside the terms.

ROBOTICS terminals, nor is there any way to get an image from it.
that is, it is not reversible”.

Regarding the registration of the fingerprint, the respondent indicated that "it is carried out in the terminal that
generates and stores a hash”. “VisualTime” does not store a fingerprint image
it only stores the generated hash”. “The validation of the fingerprints is carried out in the

own terminal that compares the hash stored in the terminal and sends to “VisualTime”
a user ID according to its validity and type.”

-Fingerprint distribution: a screen that indicates “VisualTime” only trans-
submits the hash to authorized endpoints.

6) The claimed party has a generic security document, version 1, of

The scope of application of the RGPD extends its protection, as established by its
article 1.2, to the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in

particular, your right to the protection of personal data, defined in its article
4.1 as “all information about an identified or identifiable natural person (“the
interested"); An identifiable natural person shall be deemed to be any person whose identity
can be determined, directly or indirectly, in particular by means of an identifier,
such as a name, an identification number, location data, a

online identifier or one or more elements of physical identity,
physiological, genetic, psychic, economic, cultural or social of said person.”

Biometric data is defined by article 4.14 of the GDPR:

"biometric data": personal data obtained from technical processing
specific, relating to the physical, physiological or behavioral characteristics of a
natural person that allow or confirm the unique identification of said person,

such as facial images or fingerprint data;

of novel and very intrusive identification systems for the rights and
fundamental freedoms of natural persons, the constant concern of this

as evidenced by the Working Document on Biometrics, adopted on
08/1/2003 by the Group of 29, or the subsequent Opinion 3/2012, on the evolution of
biometric technologies, adopted on 04/27/2012, and which has led to the very

Of the initial prohibition of the processing of biometric data and its
exceptionality are shown in recitals 51 and 52 of the RGPD, indicating: "Such
personal data must not be processed, unless its processing is permitted in
specific situations covered by this Regulation, taking into account

Regulation to the fulfillment of a legal obligation or the fulfillment of a mission

those special categories of personal data, among other things when the
interested party gives his explicit consent or in the case of specific needs, in
particular when the treatment is carried out within the framework of legitimate activities by

fundamental liberties. (52) “Likewise, exceptions must be authorized to the

prohibition of processing special categories of personal data when established
the Law of the Union or of the Member States and provided that the guarantees
appropriate, in order to protect personal data and other fundamental rights,
when it is in the public interest, in particular the processing of personal data in the
field of labor law, social protection law, including

pensions and for purposes of security, supervision and health alert, prevention or
control of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health. (...)”

The RGPD prescribes the exceptions to the treatment of biometric data in your
article 9.2, by indicating:

  2. Section 1 shall not apply when one of the circumstances
following:

  a) the interested party gave their explicit consent for the processing of said data
for one or more of the specified purposes, except when the Right of
the Union or the Member States establishes that the prohibition referred to in the
section 1 cannot be lifted by the interested party;

  “b) the treatment is necessary for the fulfillment of obligations and the exercise of
specific rights of the person in charge of the treatment or of the interested party in the field of
Labor law and security and social protection, to the extent that it is so
authorized by the law of the Union or of the Member States or a collective agreement
in accordance with the law of the Member States establishing adequate guarantees

of the respect of the fundamental rights and the interests of the interested party;”

  (…)

  4. Member States may maintain or introduce additional conditions,
including limitations, with respect to the processing of genetic data, data

biometric or health-related data.”
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 13/25

The LOPDGDD refers to these special category data in its article 9:

  "one. For the purposes of article 9.2.a) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in order to avoid
discriminatory situations, the consent of the affected party alone will not suffice to

lift the ban on the processing of data whose main purpose is to identify
your ideology, union affiliation, religion, sexual orientation, beliefs or racial origin or
ethnic.

  The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prevent the processing of said data by

protection of the remaining assumptions contemplated in article 9.2 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/679, when appropriate.”

The obligation to record the daily working hours of employees does not come from
contract, but of a law, the Workers' Statute, although its treatment
through fingerprint registration should be necessary in order to fulfill said obligation, only,

“to the extent” authorized by the law, either of the Union, or of the
Member States, or a collective agreement, also within the framework of the right of the
State, containing adequate guarantees regarding fundamental rights and
of the interest of the interested party.

The correlation to this mention is found in article 9 of the LOPDGDD, which states:

In this sense, article 88 of the RGPD has established that the Member States
may, through legislative provisions or collective agreements, establish
more specific rules to ensure the protection of rights and freedoms

in relation to the processing of personal data of workers in the la-
labor, in particular, among others, for the purposes of complying with the obligations that are
established by law or by collective agreement, the management, planning and organization of the
job. These rules must include adequate and specific measures to preserve
the human dignity of the interested parties, as well as their legitimate interests and their rights.

vision in the workplace.

The limitation of the fundamental right to the protection of personal data must be the
strictly necessary. This implies that if the achievement of the intended purposes
can be done without processing personal data, this route will be preferable and
It will mean that it is not necessary to carry out any data processing. valued that

proportional.

know that you will operate with it. According to jurisprudence, due to the role that the treat-
processing of personal data performs for a series of fundamental rights, the
limitation of the fundamental right to the protection of personal data must be strict
strictly necessary.

Before implementing a fingerprint identity recognition system
fingerprint, the person in charge must assess if there is another less intrusive system with which
the same purpose is achieved. Section 72 of Guidelines 3/2019 on the
processing of personal data through video devices, of January 29,
2020, of the European Committee for Data Protection: “The use of biometric data and, in
particular, of facial recognition carry high risks for the rights of

the interested. It is essential that the use of such technologies takes place
duly respecting the principles of legality, necessity, proportionality and
minimization of data as established by the RGPD. Although the use of these
technologies may be perceived as particularly effective, those responsible for
processing must first assess the impact on the rights and freedoms

and consider less intrusive means of achieving its legitimate end of the
treatment. “

Opinion 3/2012, on the evolution of biometric technologies of 04/27/2012,
of the Article 29 Working Party (set up under Article 29 of Directive
95/46/EC, European independent advisory body on data protection
and right to privacy. Its tasks are described in article 30 of the Directive
95/46/CE and in article 15 of Directive 2002/58/CE), indicates that: “When analyzing the
proportionality of a proposed biometric system, it is necessary to consider

previously if the system is necessary to respond to the identified need, it is
that is, if it is essential to satisfy that need, and not just the most suitable or
profitable. A second factor that must be taken into account is the probability that the
system is effective in responding to the need in question in light of the
specific characteristics of the biometric technology to be used. a third

aspect to ponder is whether the resulting loss of privacy is proportional to the
expected benefits. If the benefit is relatively minor, such as a higher
comfort or a slight saving, then the loss of privacy is not appropriate. The
fourth aspect to assess the adequacy of a biometric system is to consider whether
a less invasive means of intimacy would achieve the desired end”.

These assessments require exhaustiveness, starting in this case, not only from the
prohibition of treatment of these data, since we are faced with categories
of personal data, but the risks of using intrusive technology, the
biases or the likelihood of misidentification, identity theft
and the type of unique, permanent and invariable identity that the trace contains, its
impact on the privacy of individuals, security measures, the need and

proportionality or the aforementioned treatment.

Regarding proportionality, the Constitutional Court has indicated in the
Judgment 207/1996 that it is "a common and constant requirement for the
constitutionality of any restrictive measure of fundamental rights, among
them those that suppose an interference in the rights to the physical integrity and the

privacy, and more particularly of the restrictive measures of fundamental rights
adopted in the course of criminal proceedings is determined by the strict
observance of the principle of proportionality.”
C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 15/25

In this sense, we have highlighted that, in order to verify whether a restrictive measure of
a fundamental right surpasses the judgment of proportionality, it is necessary to ascertain whether

meets the following three requirements or conditions: "if such a measure is capable of
achieve the proposed objective (judgment of suitability); if, in addition, it is necessary, in the
sense that there is no other more moderate measure to achieve such
purpose with equal efficacy (judgment of necessity); and, finally, if it is
weighted or balanced, because more benefits or advantages are derived from it for the
general interest that harms other goods or values in conflict (judgment of

proportionality in the strict sense).

In this way, if said purpose could be achieved by carrying out a
activity other than the aforementioned treatment, without said purpose being altered or
harmed, the latter activity should be chosen, given that the treatment of

personal data implies, as established by our Court
Constitutional, in Judgment 292/2000, of 11/30, a limitation of the right of
person to have the information related to it.”

In this sense, the analysis carried out by the working group created
by article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC, in the Working Document on

biometry, dated 08/01/2003, in which the following is stated:

“In accordance with article 6 of Directive 95/46/EC, personal data will be
collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, and will not be processed
subsequently in a manner incompatible with said purposes. Furthermore, the data

personal information will be adequate, pertinent and not excessive in relation to the purposes for
those that are collected and for those that are subsequently treated (principle of purposes).
Compliance with this principle implies, first of all, a clear determination of the
purposes for which the biometric data is collected and processed.

On the other hand, it is necessary to evaluate compliance with proportionality and
legitimacy, taking into account the risks for the protection of the rights and
fundamental freedoms of individuals and especially if the goals pursued
they may or may not be reached in a less intrusive way.

Proportionality has been the main criterion in almost all decisions taken

until now by the authorities in charge of data protection on the
biometric data processing....

The use of biometrics also raises the issue of the proportionality of each
category of data in light of the purposes for which said data is processed. The data

biometrics can only be used in an appropriate, relevant and not excessive way, which
which supposes a strict assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the data
treated. For example, the French CNIL has rejected the use of fingerprints in the
case of children's access to a school cafeteria19, but has accepted with the same
order the use of the results of samples of the hands. The Portuguese authority

data protection has recently made an unfavorable decision on the
use of a biometric system (fingerprints) by a university
to control the attendance and punctuality of non-teaching staff”

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 16/25

In the present case, it should have been taken into account initially, not only
as part of the data protection impact assessment, but as a rule
general in any treatment an examination on:

-suitability: "if such a measure is capable of achieving the proposed objective". In this
case, the defendant progressively establishes the system, despite the warning of the
claimant on the legitimate basis of the consent of the employees, to which
then reference will be made, collecting the consent document from everyone. The
limitation of the rights of all employees is against the fulfillment of a
labor legal obligation to record the daily shift, although the means for this that

they can be varied, they do not have to suppose the interference in the rights of the
employees as it happens here. It is necessary to apply, case by case, the principle of
suitability with respect to the ends pursued, which implies a kind of
Data minimization obligation by the data controller.

-The need for treatment is an essential requirement that any me-
proposed measure involving the processing of personal data. It will be justified on
basis of objective evidence and is the first step before assessing the proportionality of

the limitation. Necessity is also fundamental when assessing the legality of the
treatment of personal data. The processing operations, the categories of
processed data and the duration of data conservation will be necessary for the
purpose of treatment.

Proof of need for treatment for any exercise limitation

rights to the protection of personal data must be strict, and the data must be treated
themselves only in strictly necessary cases, since in principle, any
data processing operation limits the right to data protection
regardless of whether such limitation may be justified. Is

documentation of compliance that the person in charge must have in accordance with the
article 5.2. of the RGPD, and may also be contained in the evaluation document

 The need must relate to whether personal data is processed on the basis of a

objective evidence, according to the purposes to be determined, if those

Necessity implies that a combined evaluation, based on facts, is required.
on the effectiveness of the measure for the objective pursued and on whether it is less in-
trusive compared to other options to achieve the same goal. In this

case it is about data processing through the registration of fingerprints for compliance
ment of the legal obligation imposed on the employer of the registration of working hours
each worker in article 34.9 of the Workers' Statute, a rule that
does not anticipate that biometric data will be used for this. The desired ends are the registration
of the data, however the claimant does not pay for the need to implement the registry

of the fingerprint for said purpose or that it is essential, indicating the reasons that
its non-use prevents obtaining that purpose. If the draft measure does not pass the necessity test,
cesity, it is not necessary to examine its proportionality.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 17/25

Need should not be confused with system utility. It may be easy to not
having to carry a card, it's automatic and instant. Obviously a system
fingerprint recognition can be useful, but it does not have to be objectively
necessary (the latter being what really must be present). as set

WG29 - Opinion 3/2012 on the evolution of biometric technologies - should
be examined “if it is essential to satisfy that need, and not just the most suitable
or profitable.

In this sense, the AEPD, analyzing the need for a treatment, concludes that, “If
is necessary or not, in the sense that there is no other more moderate measure for the
achievement of such purpose with equal efficiency because it can be carried out manually
activity. The term need should not be confused with useful but if the treatment is

objectively necessary for the purpose” -by all, PS/00052/2020-.

The need is also a principle of data quality and a recurring condition
in almost all the requirements on the legality of the processing of personal data
derived from the right to Data Protection. If there is no objective need for
treatment, if it is not essential to satisfy that need, the treatment is not
proportional or lawful.

-Proportionality, Proportionality is a general principle of EU law.
It restricts the authorities in the exercise of their powers by requiring them to achieve a

balance between the means used and the intended objective. In the context of rights
fundamental rights, such as the right to the protection of personal data, the proportion
tionality is key to any limitation of these rights.

Proportionality requires a logical link between the measure and the objective pursued.
Furthermore, for a measure to comply with the principle of proportionality, the advantages
resulting from the measure should not be compensated for the disadvantages caused by the
measure with respect to the exercise of fundamental rights. In other words, the
limitation of the right must be justified. The safeguards that accompany a

measure can support the justification for a measure. A precondition is that
the measure is adequate to achieve the intended objective. In addition, when evaluating the treatment
processing of personal data, proportionality requires that they are only collected and
cease those personal data that are adequate and relevant for the purposes of the
prosecution.

The proportionality judgment leads to the adoption of the system, considering that
necessary, produce less interference in the law, so that it does not
there could be an equally effective system whose implementation would imply less

interference in the right of the employees, that is to say, the
proportionality in its specific context, proving that technical measures
less intrusive do not exist or would not work.

And it is at this point that everything that has been

been indicating in relation to the special nature that biometric data
conferred by the RGPD and that requires special attention not only to proportionality but
to the data minimization itself; that is, that the data is only processed
as long as it is completely essential for the fulfillment of the
purpose pursued.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es, 18/25

If the three requirements indicated are not met, it can be stated that the need
to go for the time control to take the fingerprint of the employees is not
essential, as there are other means that are suitable for this purpose. The system

nor would it comply with the requirements of proportionality and suitability. The truth is
In this case, no documented analysis of these elements was provided,

On the other hand, the European Data Protection Supervisor has issued, among others, the

In this case, the respondent indicates that the legitimizing basis of the treatment, based on

of those established in article 6.1 of the RGPD, it would be that of express consent.
He adds that there are two others, compliance with a legal obligation, 6.1.c) of the
RGPD and maintenance of compliance with the contractual relationship, 6.1 b), although the
obligation does not derive from the contract but from a norm. So, for example, in the context
