## English Summary

### Facts

A hearing aid retailer (the first controller) used personal data for sending direct marketing papers to home addresses. The first controller obtained the data from a media company specialized in direct marketing (the second controller). In turn, the second controller obtained the data from a chain of commercial data brokers.

In 2022, one of the recipients of direct marketing (the data subject) contacted the second controller and requested both access to his personal data, and their erasure. The second controller forwarded the request to both the first controller and the data broker he received the data from. However, the second controller did not itself reply to the request.

In 2023 the data subject filed a complaint with the DPA. He claimed that both controllers violated the principle of lawfulness, by processing his data for direct marketing without a legal basis. He also complained that the second controller violated Articles 12 and 15 GDPR by failing to reply to his request.

### Holding

**Regarding the first controller:**

The DPA considered that the first controller did not demonstrate that its legitimate interest in carrying out direct marketing prevails over the rights and interests of data subjects. For this reason, the processing could not be based on the controller's interest and lacked a legal basis under the GDPR.

The DPA specified that their balancing depends on the circumstances of the concrete case, and [recital 47](/index.php?title=Recitals_GDPR#r47 "Recitals GDPR") of the GDPR provides that the reasonable expectations of the persons concerned must be taken into account. These expectations relate in particular to processing operations, data, purposes and the persons responsible for further processing. They are influenced by the relationship between the controller and the data subjects.

The DPA then pointed out that it is not sufficient for the controller to rely on the declarations of the data seller and the existence of a contractual clause to consider that the data has been lawfully collected and can be reused (as the first controller did in this case). The data controller must instead ensure how they were collected, by whom, on what legal basis, and for what purpose.

Furthermore, the DPA points out that consent given at the time of collection would in no way have implied an authorization to reuse the data: such consent must be free, specific, informed and unambiguous.

**The second controller**

The second controller claimed that it was not a controller of the subject's personal data. In this regard, it pointed out that it merely acted as an intermediary and did not open or modify the file containing the data.

The DPA rejected the argument. In this regard, the DPA pointed out that by purchasing and re-selling personal data, the second controller determined the means and purposes of the processing (respectively, by deciding to provide its customers with personal data, and by deciding how to transmit them).

For this reason, the second controller needed to demonstrate the existence of a legal basis for the processing.

The DPA held that it failed to do so. In the DPA's view, the rights and interests of the data subject prevailed over the interest of its customers in receiving the data. In this regard, the DPA stressed that the second controller (like the first) failed to ensure that the circumstances of the initial collection of the data, permitted its re-use. So, the second controller processed personal data unlawfully.

Finally, the DPA held that as a data controller, the second controller was under an obligation to reply to the data subject's access request. By failing to do so, the second controller breached Article 15 GDPR.

Litigation Division

Decision on the merits 76/2025 of April 24, 2025

Case reference: DOS-2023-04302

Subject: Complaint regarding the processing of data in the context of a direct marketing campaign

The Litigation Division of the Data Protection Authority, composed of Mr. Hielke

H. IJMANS, President, and Messrs. Yves Poullet and Frank De Smet, members;

Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the

protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and

on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), hereinafter "GDPR";

Having regard to the Law of December 3, 2017, establishing the Data Protection Authority (hereinafter "LCA");

Having regard to the internal regulations as approved by the House of Representatives on December 20, 2018, and published in the Belgian Official Gazette on January 15, 2019;

Having regard to the documents in the case;

Issued the following decision regarding:

The complainant: X, hereinafter "the complainant"

The defendants: Y1 SA, represented by Gerrit Vandendriessche and Jan Clinck (hereinafter: the

first defendant)

Y2 SA, represented by Elisabeth Delinte (hereinafter: the second

defendant) Decision on the merits 76/2025 - 2/17

I. Facts and procedure

1. The complaint concerns the processing of the complainant's personal data by the

defendants for the purpose of sending direct marketing by Y1 to the complainant. Y1 (first

defendant) obtained the data in question via Y2 (second defendant), a media

agency specializing in direct marketing. Y2 itself received this data

from Z3 (formerly Z3), a commercial data broker, which had initially

obtained it from Z2 (formerly Z2).

2. On October 18, 2023, the complainant filed a complaint with the Data Protection Authority

against Y1, Z4, Y2, and Z3.

3. On October 25, 2023, the complaint was declared admissible by the Frontline Service

on the basis of Articles 58 and 60 of the LCA and the complaint was forwarded to the Litigation Division

pursuant to Article 62, § 1 of the LCA.

4. On March 11, 2024, the Litigation Division decided, pursuant to Article 95, § 1, 1° and

Article 98 of the LCA, that the case could be processed on the merits.

5. On March 11, 2024, the parties concerned were informed by registered mail of the provisions set out in Article 95, § 2, and Article 98 of the LCA. They were also informed, pursuant to Article 99 of the LCA, of the deadlines for submitting their submissions.

The deadline for receipt of the defendants' submissions in response was set at May 16, 2024, the deadline for the plaintiff's submissions in reply was set at June 6, 2024, and the deadline for the defendants' submissions in rejoinder was set at June 27, 2024.

6. On March 12, 2024, Z3 requested a change of the procedural language to French and an extension of the deadlines for submitting submissions. 7. On March 18, 2024, Y1 expressed his wish to be heard, in accordance with Article 98 of the LCA.

8. On March 25, 2024, Y2 also requested a change of the procedural language to French and an extension of the deadlines for submissions.

9. On March 27, 2024, the Litigation Chamber proposed that the parties each draft their submissions in their own language. Each party will then be responsible for translating their submissions to the other parties. The final decision of the Litigation Chamber will be drafted in French and Dutch. In addition, the Litigation Chamber decided to extend the deadlines for submissions by two weeks, as until now, it was unclear in which language submissions could be submitted by each party. Consequently, the dates for receipt of the parties' submissions were set at May 6, May 27, and June 17, 2024.

10. On March 28, 2024, Y1 requested that separate submission periods be set for Y1, on the one hand, and for Z3 and Y2, on the other. Decision on the merits 76/2025 - 3/17

11. On April 3, 2024, Y2 joined Y1's request to set separate submission periods for each defendant.

12. On April 8, 2024, the Litigation Division considered that there was no need to split the submission periods.

Indeed, the defendants had the opportunity to respond to the other party's submissions in the rejoinder, as well as at the hearing. Taking into account

the transmission of a copy of the file to the defendants, the Litigation Division

made a final adjustment to the deadlines. These became:

o Respondents' submissions in response: May 16, 2024

o Plaintiff's submissions in reply: June 6, 2024

o Defendants' submissions in rejoinder: June 27, 2024

13. On May 16, 2024, the Litigation Division received the submissions in response from the
defendants.

14. On June 6, 2024, the Litigation Division received the submissions in reply from the

plaintiff.

15. On June 27, 2024, the Litigation Division received the rejoinder submissions from the

defendants.

16. On October 28, 2024, the parties were informed that the hearing would take place on November 28,

2024. For the smooth running of the hearing, the Litigation Division requested the

parties to indicate in their acknowledgment of receipt whether they agree to a bilingual hearing in

French and Dutch.

17. As the Litigation Division received no objections to a bilingual hearing,

it informed the parties on November 19, 2024, that the hearing would be bilingual and would take place without

an interpreter. The Litigation Division informs the parties that, if they still wish to object, they must do so before November 22, 2024.

18. On November 26, 2025, the Litigation Division informs the parties that it must postpone

the hearing to December 17, 2024 due to force majeure.

19. On December 17, 2025, the parties are heard by the Litigation Division.

20. On January 3, 2025, the minutes of the hearing are submitted to the parties.

21. On January 8, 2025, the Litigation Division received some comments from Z3 regarding

the minutes, which it decided to include in its deliberations.

22. On January 9, 2025, the Litigation Division received some comments from Y2 and Y1

regarding the minutes, which it decided to include in its deliberations.

23. Based on the documents in the file, the Litigation Division notes that Z2 is a potential

interested third party within the meaning of Article 108, § 3, paragraph 2, of the LCA, in relation to the potential violations of Z3. Decision on the merits 76/2025 - 4/17

On January 31, 2024, Z2 was notified by registered mail of the

provisions mentioned in Article 95, § 2, as well as those of Article 98 of the LCA. It is

also informed of the possibility of intervening in the proceedings pursuant to Article 98
of the LCA. She informed the other parties that if Z2 intervened, they would have the opportunity

to respond.

24. On February 26, 2025, Z2 confirmed its intervention as an interested third party in the

proceedings.

25. On March 14, 2025, the Litigation Division received Z2's submissions in response.

26. On March 18, 2025, the Litigation Division received the submissions in response on behalf of the

complainant.

27. On March 31, 2025, Y2 indicated that it did not wish to submit a submission.

28. On April 8, 2025, the Litigation Division received Z3's submissions in reply.

29. On April 9, 2025, the Litigation Division received Y1's submissions in reply.

30. On April 24, 2025, the Litigation Division decided to split the case into two separate cases. This decision was motivated, on the one hand, by the need to ensure the effectiveness of the proceedings given the involvement of multiple defendants, and on the other hand, by the existence of substantial differences in the nature of the data processing alleged against the respective defendants. While the processing carried out by Y1 and Y2 is primarily for direct marketing purposes, that carried out by Z3 concerns the sale of databases. The Litigation Division informed the parties that the plaintiff's complaint against Y1, Z4, and Y2 will be pursued under case number DOS-2023-04302. The plaintiff's complaint against Z3 will be pursued under case number DOS-2025-01687. This decision concerns case DOS-2023-04302.

II. Grounds

II.1. Regarding Z4

31. First, the Litigation Division notes that, in addition to the other defendants, the complaint

was also filed against Z4. However, it appears from the documents in the case file that Z4 acted

as Y1's data protection officer, and not as a data controller

or processor. The Litigation Division decides not to pursue

its examination of the complaint regarding Z4.

II.2. Regarding Y1

32. Y1 is a retailer of hearing solutions. The disputed processing concerns a direct marketing campaign by Y1 entitled "Z1," as part of which it sent printed documents by mail to the data subjects, including the complainant. For this purpose, it used addresses obtained from Z3 through Y2.33. On March 11, 2024, Y1 was informed by registered letter of the provisions of Articles 95, § 2, and 98 of the Law of December 3, 2017. Y1 was invited to defend itself against:

a. Possible violation of Article 5, paragraph 1, point a), of the GDPR in conjunction with

Article 6 of the GDPR for unlawfully obtaining and subsequent sale of personal data;

b. Potential violation of Article 24.1 of the GDPR for failing to adequately verify

whether a dataset was lawfully created. II.2.1. Regarding Y1's second ground of appeal

34. Y1 first requests the Disputes Chamber to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that it is a

dispute incidental to a broader contractual dispute. She argues that a contractual dispute between
Z2 and Z3 is the basis of the complaint and that this issue must be resolved by a court.

Furthermore, Y1 argues that the dispute falls under the regulation of telephone directories

provided for by the Law of 13 June 2005 on electronic communications, making

the Belgian Institute for Postal Services and Telecommunications (hereinafter "BIPT") the competent authority.

35. The Litigation Division refers to its dismissal policy, which establishes that the fact that a complaint is incidental to a broader dispute to be resolved before a court or other competent authority constitutes a criterion for dismissing the complaint on grounds of expediency. When this criterion applies, the Litigation Division decides whether or not to examine the complaint based on the social and/or personal impact of the grievances. In this case, the Litigation Division first notes that the dismissal policy does not limit its discretion to consider whether or not to consider a case. For the sake of completeness, the Litigation Division notes that profiling and large-scale data processing occur when sending direct marketing messages to a targeted audience, resulting in a high social impact. Consequently, the Litigation Division considers it appropriate to consider this complaint. 36. Regarding the argument that the Law of June 13, 2005 on

electronic communications applies and makes the BIPT the competent authority

for this dispute, the Litigation Chamber considers that the potential applicability of this

1
law does not affect its jurisdiction to monitor compliance with the GDPR.

1See also the decision on the merits 19/2021 of February 12, 2021 of the Litigation Chamber. Decision on the merits 76/2025 - 6/17

37. Consequently, the Litigation Chamber rejects Y1's second argument, which requests that

the complaint be dismissed. II.2.2. Concerning the violation of Article 5.1.a) GDPR read in conjunction with
Article 6 GDPR and the violation of Article 24.1 GDPR

Preliminary remarks

38. Prior to examining Article 5.1.a) read in conjunction with Article 6 GDPR, the Litigation Chamber

wishes to clarify its letter of March 11, 2024. In this letter, it invited Y1 to

defend itself against a possible violation of Article 5.1.a) read in conjunction with Article 6 GDPR for "unlawful acquisition and subsequent sale of personal data." Y1 argues

in its submissions that the "acquisition" of personal data is

only one operation within the framework of the processing of personal data that must

be assessed as a whole. Regarding the possible violation of the aforementioned provisions

due to the subsequent unlawful sale of personal data, Y1

argues that there can be no violation because there is no indication or evidence in the

complaint or the administrative file that Y1 sold personal data.

The Disputes Chamber confirms this interpretation of Article 5.1.a) read in conjunction

with Article 6 GDPR, and therefore assesses compliance with these rules for the entire
data processing for which Y1 was a controller. In doing so, it

also notes that there is no indication that Y1 resold the data. 39. In addition to the possible violation of Article 5.1.a) read in conjunction with Article 6.1 of the GDPR, the

Disputes Chamber invited Y1, in its letter dated March 11, 2024, to defend itself against a

possible violation of Article 24.1 of the GDPR, and more specifically "for failing to adequately verify
whether a dataset was created lawfully." Article 24 of the

GDPR requires the controller, taking into account the nature, scope,

context, and purpose of the processing, to implement appropriate technical and

organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the

processing is carried out in accordance with this Regulation. This obligation is

inseparable from Article 5, paragraph 2, of the GDPR, from which it follows that the data controller

is responsible for ensuring compliance with the provisions of Article 5, paragraph 1, of the GDPR

and must be able to demonstrate this. Article 5(2) and Article 24 of the GDPR
impose general accountability and compliance requirements on controllers.

40. It follows that, pursuant to Article 5.1.a) and Article 6 of the GDPR, read in conjunction with

Article 5.2 and Article 24 of the GDPR, the controller must ensure and be able to

demonstrate that personal data are processed in a manner that is

lawful with regard to the data subject. Given that Article 5.1.a) GDPR read in conjunction
with Article 6 GDPR must also be assessed in light of Article 24 GDPR, the

Litigation Chamber decides to assess the two grievances in its letter of March 11, 2024,

together.

Regarding the violation of Article 5.1.a) GDPR read in conjunction with Articles 6 GDPR and

24 GDPR

41. Article 5(1)(a) GDPR provides that personal data

must be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner with respect to the data

data subjects. Furthermore, Article 6.1 GDPR provides that the processing of personal data

is lawful only if and to the extent that it is based on one of the legal bases

set out in Article 6.1.a) to (f) GDPR. Before processing, the controller must

verify whether the conditions of one of these possible legal bases are met. Finally, the

controller must implement appropriate technical and

organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate that the processing is

carried out in accordance with this Regulation.

42. In this case, Y1 relies on the legal basis provided for in Article 6.1.f) of the GDPR. This legal basis

provides that processing is lawful to the extent that it is "necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, unless

the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child, prevail." According to the CJEU, the legal basis provided by this provision

must be interpreted restrictively, since it allows the processing of personal data without the data subject's consent to be legalized.

43. The Court of Justice held that Article 6.1.(f) GDPR sets out three cumulative conditions that

must be met for the processing of personal data to be lawful, namely, first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest of the controller

or a third party, and second, the The necessity of processing personal data

for the pursuit of a legitimate interest and, thirdly, the condition that the interests or

fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the legitimate

4
interest of the controller or a third party.

44. According to Y1, there would be no violation of Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR read in

conjunction with Article 6 of the GDPR in this case for the unlawful acquisition and subsequent

sale of personal data. The purpose of the processing was "to contact new interested persons who may benefit from hearing assistance

on the basis of their demographic characteristics" and this was carried out on the

legal basis of legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR). The determination of this legal basis, as well as a risk analysis, were carried out and documented prior to processing. 5

45. First, Y1 argues that it is pursuing a legitimate interest. In this regard, it refers, among other things, to recital 47 of the GDPR, which states that "the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be considered to be carried out in pursuit of a legitimate interest."46. Y1 further claimed that it also met the necessity requirement. It allegedly processed only the personal data necessary for the intended purpose (contacting prospects), namely: name, address, postal code, language, and gender. Furthermore, Y1 was contractually authorized to use the data only once.

47. The Litigation Chamber considers that a thorough analysis of the third requirement in particular applies:

48. The third requirement implies that the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject must not prevail over the legitimate interest of the data controller. The Court of Justice has held that this requirement involves a balancing exercise between the competing rights and interests at stake, which, in principle, depends on the circumstances of the specific case. To carry out this balancing act, Recital 47 of the GDPR provides an important parameter, as it stipulates that the data subject's reasonable expectations, based on their relationship with the controller, must be taken into account. These "reasonable expectations" are the expectations the data subject may have regarding the processing operations that can or will be performed on their data, regarding the data concerning them that may be processed, and regarding the purpose(s) for which they will or may be processed and by whom. Recital 47 also provides that the relationship between the controller and the data subject has an impact on determining the data subject's reasonable expectations. For example, a data subject would not reasonably expect their data to be processed by a person with whom they have never had any contact. 49. Y1 asserts in its submissions that its own interests, given the measures it

has provided, outweigh the rights of the data subjects. First, it argues

that the letter in question was neither intrusive nor risky for the complainant's rights and
that, on the contrary, a benefit was offered (namely, a free hearing test). Furthermore, the

data concerned would not be sensitive and there is no large-scale processing

5Annex B.1 to Y1's summary submissions. Decision on the merits 76/2025 - 9/17

because the direct marketing campaign was sent only once and the data was not
combined with data obtained from other sources.

50. In this regard, the Litigation Chamber first notes that the letters sent were

titled "Z1", which could suggest to the data subjects that the initiative was in the public interest. However, during

the hearing, Y1 clarified that she was not carrying out a public interest mission. This

shows that the letter may be misleading. Second, the Litigation Chamber notes

that although the letter was sent only once, it was sent to a group of

data subjects, and these data subjects were contacted in writing on the basis

of their belonging to a certain age group. This combination can create a feeling among the
data subjects that may be perceived as invasive.

51. Furthermore, Y1 argues that the complainant could reasonably expect to receive

commercial letters since (according to Z3) he had consented to the resale of his data for

direct marketing purposes.

52. In this context, the Litigation Chamber recalls that Article 24 of the GDPR provides that

data controllers must implement appropriate technical and

organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the

processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the principles and

obligations set out in the GDPR. Thus, the controller must be able to demonstrate

that it has balanced its legitimate interests against the rights and freedoms of the data

subjects and that this balancing is in its favor. Where applicable, the

data controller must also be able to demonstrate that it has implemented

safeguards (e.g., technical and organizational measures) to ensure

that the rights and freedoms of the data subjects do not override its legitimate

interests. 53. Y1 claims that it has taken appropriate technical and organizational measures

in accordance with Article 24.1 of the GDPR. First, Y2 gave it contractual consent that

the address data could be used by Y1 in compliance with the GDPR. Thus,

Article 8 of Y2's general terms and conditions stipulates that the latter "takes all

reasonable measures to ensure that its source partners comply with the GDPR,
7
including by requesting a written commitment of compliance from them." According to Y1, a more in-depth examination

of the contractual agreements between Y2 and its source partners (i.e.,

Z3) was not necessary because it had no contractual relationship with these parties

and because it was entitled to have a legitimate expectation, based on the legal obligations of Z3 and Z2, that the complainant had consented to the processing of his personal data.

Annex B.2 to the summary conclusions of Y1, Decision on the merits 76/2025 - 10/17

Y1 further argues that it used the Robinson list to avoid sending letters to individuals who had thus indicated that they no longer wished to receive addressed advertising. Third, Y1 relies on the risk analysis and mitigating measures it took as part of the balancing of interests (see above), and fourth, Y1 relies on the fact that a Data Protection Officer (DPO) advised it on the risks associated with data processing. Finally, Y1 argues that the unlawful processing was the consequence of a breach of contract or a dispute between Z2 and Z3, of which Y1 could not have been aware. It argues that no organizational measures were reasonably available to enable it to become aware. 9

54. However, as a data controller, Y1 is required by the Litigation Chamber

to be able to prove that its processing of personal data can be based

on a valid legal basis. The Litigation Chamber has ruled 10 in the past that it is

not sufficient for a data controller to rely on the alleged "lawfulness" of

personal data or purchased databases. Indeed, it is incumbent on data controllers, before cooperating with intermediary organizations to

improve their marketing campaigns by requesting personal data

that they do not already possess, to ensure the origin of the data, how

it was collected, on what legal basis, by whom, for what purposes, during what

period, and for what processing. The controller cannot simply include a clause in the contract with the intermediary organization stipulating the obligation to provide data in accordance with data protection legislation (or any other obligation of the same or similar scope). The existence of such a clause is not sufficient to exclude the controller's liability in the event of one or more breaches of the GDPR. 11

55. This does not imply that the controller is obliged to verify third parties' compliance with the GDPR. However, it is obliged to take measures to ensure its own compliance with the GDPR, which means that, in certain circumstances, it must take into account the processing of personal data in its entirety, and in particular with regard to the initial collection of personal data. This is an essential element in verifying that the data subject could reasonably expect the processing of their personal data and, therefore,

Consequently, the processing in this case could be legally based on Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR.56. In this case, Y1 claims that the complainant gave his consent when his data was initially collected.

On this basis, it argues that the processing carried out by Y1 falls within the reasonable expectations of the data subject.

57. The Litigation Chamber notes, first of all, that Y1 provides no concrete evidence to support this claim. If it invokes presumed consent at an earlier stage in the data processing chain, it is incumbent on it, as the data controller, to demonstrate such consent. Mere reference to declarations or contractual agreements with intermediaries (Y2 and Z3) is not sufficient.

58. Secondly, and for the sake of completeness, the Litigation Chamber reiterates that the mere fact that a data subject has, at a given time, given his or her consent to a processing operation does not constitute automatic justification for further processing. Consent, within the meaning of Article 4(11) of the GDPR, must always be freely given, specific,

informed, and unambiguous, and is only valid within the precise context for which it was

actually given.

59. Consequently, the invocation of alleged prior consent without material

evidence cannot constitute a sufficient basis for concluding that the processing, in this case,

was within the reasonable expectations of the data subject. In light of the above, the

Litigation Chamber considers that Y1 has not demonstrated that the processing of personal data

could reasonably have been expected by the complainant.

60. It also follows that Y1 has not demonstrated that its interest outweighs the interests

and fundamental rights of the data subjects. Given that the three-part test

for processing data based on a legitimate interest involves cumulative conditions, it is not necessary to examine whether Y1 meets the other two

conditions of Article 6.1.(f) of the GDPR. The Market Court has already ruled in this regard that if

one of the three elements of the three-part test is not met, the Litigation Chamber

can rightly justify that Article 6.1.(f) of the GDPR cannot constitute a possible legal basis.

61. In these circumstances, it must be considered that Y1 has not demonstrated that its interest

overrides the interests and fundamental rights of the data subjects, so

that the processing cannot fall within the scope of Article 6.1.(f) of the GDPR. It therefore violated the

obligations imposed by Articles 5.1.a), 6.1, and 24 of the GDPR.

1 Brussels Court of Appeal, Chamber 19, Market Section, judgment of 14 June 2023, SNCB v. GBA, 2022/AR/723 Decision on the merits 76/2025 - 12/17

II.3. Concerning Y2

62. Y2 is a media agency specializing in direct marketing. In this case, it

served as an intermediary between its client, Y1, and Z3, a company offering address databases.

63. On March 11, 2024, Y2 was informed by registered letter of the provisions of Articles 95, § 2, and

98 of the Law of December 3, 2017. It was invited to defend itself against:

a. Possible violation of Article 5, paragraph 1, point (a), of the GDPR read in conjunction with

Article 6 of the GDPR for the unlawful acquisition and subsequent sale of personal data;

b. Potential violation of Article 24.1 of the GDPR for failing to adequately verify

whether a dataset was lawfully created;

c. Possible violation of Article 12.2-4 of the GDPR read in conjunction with Articles 15 and 17 of the GDPR due to the failure to respond to the complainant's requests.

64. Y2 first argues that it is not the data controller. It allegedly acted only as an intermediary, meaning it transferred to Y1 the address file that Z3 had sent it. This file was not modified or consulted by Y2 and was deleted as soon as Y1 confirmed receipt. The purpose of the processing, according to Y2, was to enable Y1 to obtain the contact details of potential customers to conduct a direct marketing campaign by mail. Consequently, Y1 determined the purpose and means, with Y2 acting only as a processor. The Disputes Chamber does not follow this reasoning.

65. The GDPR defines "controller" as the entity which, alone or jointly

with others, determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. The EDPB clarified that the concept of controller refers to

the controller's impact on data processing, based on a decision-making power or control over processing activities. This control may

derive from legal provisions, result from an implied power, or be based on the exercise

of actual influence. This analysis requires a factual assessment, testing the existing

agreements against the factual circumstances of the relationship between the parties. 16

66. In this case, it is clear from the documents in the case that Y2 did indeed have a specific purpose for

processing, namely the collection and provision of data to its customers, and that it

determined this purpose itself. Furthermore, it also determined the processing methods itself, in particular the manner in which it received the data and transmitted them to Y1. Thus, the Litigation Chamber finds that Y2 was a data controller

for having obtained personal data from Z3 and having transmitted them to Y1.

II.3.1. Concerning the violation of Article 5.1.a) GDPR read in conjunction with
Article 6 GDPR and the violation of Article 24.1 GDPR

67. The Disputes Chamber invited Y2 to defend itself against possible violations of

Article 5.1.a) read in conjunction with Article 6.1 GDPR and Article 24.1 GDPR. Article 5.1.a)

of the GDPR provides that personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently with respect to the data subjects. Article 6.1 GDPR further provides

that the processing of personal data is only lawful if and to the extent

that it is based on one of the legal bases set out in Article 6.1.a) to f) GDPR. Before

processing, the controller must verify whether the conditions of one of

these possible legal bases are met. Finally, the controller must

implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and be able

to demonstrate that the processing is carried out in accordance with this Regulation.

68. Article 24 of the GDPR requires the controller, taking into account the nature,

scope, context, and purpose of the processing, to implement appropriate technical and

organizational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate

that the processing is carried out in accordance with this Regulation. This

obligation is inseparable from Article 5.2 of the GDPR (see point 39), from which it follows that the

controller is responsible for ensuring compliance with the provisions of Article 5.1 of the

GDPR and must be able to demonstrate this. Articles 5(2) and 24 of the GDPR

impose general requirements on controllers regarding

accountability and compliance. It follows that, pursuant to Article 5(1)(a), read in conjunction with Article 6 of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Article 5(2),

and Article 24 of the GDPR, the controller must ensure and be able to demonstrate

that the personal data are processed in a manner that is lawful

with respect to the data subject. Since Article 24 of the GDPR clarifies the application of Article 5(1)(a)

read in conjunction with Article 6 of the GDPR, the Litigation Chamber notes that it must

assess the two complaints in its letter of March 11, 2024, together.

69. Y2 asserts that the processing of the complainant's personal data in this case
was lawful under Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, which provides that "the

processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or

17
Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 27 October 2022, Proximus NV v.
Gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit, C-129/21, ECLI:EU:C:2022:833, paragraph 81. Decision on the merits 76/2025 - 14/17

of a third party" (emphasis added by Y2). Y2 allegedly processed the data for the legitimate interests of Y1 (by

using the data to conduct a direct marketing campaign).70. The Court of Justice held that Article 6.1.(f) GDPR sets out three cumulative conditions that

must be met for the processing of personal data referred to therein to be lawful, namely, first, the pursuit of a legitimate interest of the controller

or a third party; second, the necessity of the processing of personal data for the pursuit of the legitimate interest; and, third, the condition that the

interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override

the legitimate interest of the controller or a third party.

71. The Litigation Chamber considers that a detailed analysis of the third condition in

particular applies. 72. Y2 claims that it balanced the interests of the data subjects with those of Y1,

in particular by verifying that the data had been lawfully obtained by Z3,

by undertaking that Y1 would not use the data for purposes other than those for which
they were leased, by allowing only occasional use of the data, and

by undertaking that the data would not be disclosed to third parties.

73. To ensure that the data provided by Z3 complies with GDPR obligations,

Y2 consulted Z3's general terms and conditions, which allegedly indicate that the data processing

is carried out in accordance with the applicable legal provisions. Furthermore, Z3 itself stated that the data was collected in compliance with the applicable legal provisions, and more specifically on the basis of the consent of the data subjects.

74. As already explained in Section II.2.2 of this Decision, a controller

cannot simply refer to the statements of an intermediary party or

include a clause in the agreement concluded with that party stating that the latter

has an obligation to provide data in accordance with data protection legislation.

Each controller is itself required to provide information, in particular, on the origin

of the data, how it was collected, on what legal basis, by whom, for

what purposes, for what duration, and for what processing operations. Without this information, the

controller cannot demonstrate, in accordance with Article 24.1 of the GDPR,

that the processing is carried out in accordance with this Regulation.

75. Y2 does not demonstrate that the complainant could reasonably expect his

data to be transmitted by a data broker to a third party for a direct marketing campaign

carried out by a commercial company with which he had no prior

contact. The Litigation Chamber recalls that the fundamental interests and rights

18 CJEU, judgment of July 4, 2023, Meta v. Bundeskartellamt, C-252/21, ECLI:EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 106 and case law cited. Decision on the merits 76/2025 - 15/17

of data subjects may, in particular, prevail in

processing where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing (see recital 47 of the GDPR), such as in the case in question.

76. In light of the above, the Litigation Chamber considers that Y2 has not demonstrated

that Y1's interest outweighs the interests and fundamental rights of data subjects. Given that the three-part test for data processing based

on a legitimate interest involves cumulative conditions, it is not necessary

to examine whether the defendant meets the other two conditions of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. The Market Court has already held in this regard that if one of the three elements

of the three-part test is not met, the Litigation Chamber can rightly justify
that Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR cannot constitute a possible legal basis.19

77. In these circumstances, it must be found that Y2 has not demonstrated that the interests

of Y1 outweigh the interests and fundamental rights of the data subjects,

so that the processing cannot fall within the scope of Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR. Thus, it has violated the
obligations imposed by Articles 5.1(a), 6.1, and 24 of the GDPR.

II.3.2. Concerning the violation of Article 12.2-4 of the GDPR read in conjunction with

Articles 15 and 17 of the GDPR

78. The complainant exercised his rights of access and erasure of data by letter addressed to

Y2 on October 10, 2022. Y2 forwarded this letter to Z3, who responded on October 12, 2022. On

November 4, 2022, the complainant requested that Y1, Z3, and Y2 erase his data on the basis

of Article 17 of the GDPR, along with information on the measures taken to achieve this. Y2

contacted Y1 and Z3 to ensure that they would respond to the complainant. Z3 responded on November 7, 2022, and Y1 responded on November 29, 2022.

79. However, it appears from the evidence in the file that Y2 did not itself respond to the complainant's requests.

This constitutes a violation of Article 12.3 of the GDPR, which stipulates that "The

controller shall provide the data subject with information on the action taken

on the request pursuant to Articles 15 to 22, without delay and in any case within

one month of receipt of the request..."

80. Under these circumstances, it must be considered that Y2 violated the obligations imposed by

Article 12.3 of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Articles 15 and 17 of the GDPR.

III. Measures

81. Pursuant to Article 100 of the LCA, the Litigation Chamber has the power to:

III.1. III.1. With regard to Y1

82. The Disputes Chamber considers that Y1 infringed Article 5.1.a) of the GDPR in conjunction with

Article 6 of the GDPR and Article 24.1 of the GDPR. It emphasizes that the data processing

was a one-time occurrence and that Y1 stated that it had deleted the data in the meantime. Taking this into consideration,

the Disputes Chamber decides, pursuant to Article 100, § 1, 5° of the WOG,

to impose a reprimand on Y1.

III.2. III.2. With regard to Y2

83. The Disputes Chamber finds that Y2 violated Article 5.1.a) of the GDPR in conjunction

with Article 6 of the GDPR, Article 24.1 of the GDPR, and Article 12.3 of the GDPR,

in conjunction with Articles 15 and 17 of the GDPR. It emphasizes that the data processing

was a one-time occurrence and that Y2 stated that it had deleted the data in the meantime.

Taking this into consideration, the Disputes Chamber decides, pursuant to Article 100, §1,
5° of the WOG, to issue a reprimand to Y2.
