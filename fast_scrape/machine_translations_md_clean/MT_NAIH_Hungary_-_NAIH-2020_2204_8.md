## English Summary

### Facts

A customer of the Deichmann company claimed that after an in-store purchase he did not receive the correct amount of money back from the cashier. The customer initially did not notice that he paid with a larger bill, and only later noticed and informed Deichmann.

Since the facts were disputed, the customer asked the company to view the video recording in which the customer appeared as he was paying. Deichmann informed the customer that the recording can only be accessed by the police following an official request. The customer filed a police report, but the camera recording was no longer available by the time of the request.

Following this situation, the NAIH conducted an ex officio investigation into the company and found that Deichmann was operating cameras extensively throughout the country, with cameras in all 129 of its stores.

The DPA found that the controller had breached multiple GDPR provisions in connection to data subject access requests. Amongst these, the company did not keep separate records of the data subject requests that it had been receiving.

### Dispute

Did the data controller fulfill its obligations under the GDPR in connection with data subject access requests?

### Holding

The DPA first held that the request to access the camera images does fall within the scope of Article 15(1) GDPR. Furthermore, the NAIH emphasised that the controller's claims were incorrect with regards to the footage only being accessible to the police. Apart from Article 15(3), the DPA held that the data controller must also give data subjects access to the part of the recording in which that person appears.

The NAIH also pointed to the importance of Article 12(4) and offering data subjects adequate explanations on the reasons for a controller's refusal to act on a data subject's request.

Regarding the deletion of the recording, the DPA held that Deichmann breached Article 18(1)(c). The controller should have kept the data following the data subject's request, until his legal claim was settled.

More generally, the DPA emphasised that the controller had failed to fulfill its obligations under Articles 24 and 25 GDPR, as it did not set up appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to ensure and demonstrate that the personal data are processed in compliance with the GDPR.

III. Decision:

The General Data Protection Regulation shall apply from 25 May 2018, ie on 26 May 2018

should be used.

However, the Regulation entered into force on 27 April 2016 and recital 171
for data processing started before the date of application of this Regulation
The data protection rules provided for a "grace period" of two years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation
to comply with this Regulation.

Although the period under review does not cover data processing prior to 25 May 2018, the Authority
notes that the data protection rules also ensure that the data subject is exercised during this period
was of paramount importance: the right of the data subject to information was granted by Infotv. also recorded and the Authority's practice
This right also included the right to inspect the camera recordings concerned and to block them
In terms of the content of the right, the data processing regulated in the GDPR was a similar legal institution

the way in which the applicant submitted the applications had to be known
would have been in front of the Company.

III.1. Handling Customer's affected requests

As the Company reported that it received a single request from interested parties during the period considered,
and thus the identity of the person exercising his / her rights at the Company became identifiable, the Authority a
Findings received by the Company regarding the handling of a stakeholder application specifically to the Client
it does.

III.1.1. The Client's request addressed to the Company on May 29, 2018 stated that it wished
to view the named camera image requested in accordance with Article 15 (1) of the Regulation

constitutes a request for access on the basis of which the Company has access to personal data
would have been obliged to ensure that the Client had access to the recordings made about him.

It appears from the Company's letter of June 19, 2018 that the Company informed it

the Client that they can take camera footage only to the police - upon official police request
may appeal to the Somogy County Police Headquarters.

The Authority first of all notes that the camera footage of a data controller is not limited to the police

but, in addition to the fact that it is otherwise required to provide any information
court or authority, in accordance with Article 15 (3) of the GDPR
it must give a person access to the part of the recording in which that person is
person is listed.

However, Customer did not request the release of the original camera image or a copy thereof
From the Company, but to have access to the recorded recordings, while the Company is the recording
He did not recognize the difference between the need to view the recording and the need to publish the recording and judged it
request as if the Customer had requested the release of the recording, when otherwise to view the recording
and the right to issue a copy of the recording.

Thus, the Company, in addition to not allowing access to the recorded camera footage, nor
neither the fact of refusal of access nor the reasons for refusal of access
information.

Based on the above, the Authority found that although the Company is defined by the GDPR as one month
answered the Client's request for the exercise of the rights of the data subject within the time limit, did not state the reasons,
why he does not allow him access to the recordings or the exercise of the data subject's rights
denied it on appropriate grounds, so that the management of the Client 's right of access did not comply with the
Article 15 (1) of the GDPR.

If a data controller refuses to comply with the data subject's request, ie as a result
does not take any action, so in the present case, if the Company decides to do so for the Customer
does not grant him access to the camera footage taken of him, the GDPR
Under Article 12 (4), he must inform him, in addition to giving details of the reasons for the refusal, that:

that you can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (i.e. in this case the Authority) and live
with the right to go to court.

Information on the right to a remedy is particularly important in the management of data subjects' rights,
whereas a person less familiar with data protection law is not necessarily aware of it

by which authority you can turn to in the event of a restriction, in the absence of this knowledge
the violation or restriction of rights that may have befallen him or her will remain unresolved. This is borne out by the fact that in the present case a
nor was the notifier aware that his application concerned a data subject
which, in the event of its refusal, may be referred to the Authority. By the time the notifier is correct
he became aware of the Remedies Forum, it was so long that it was made about it

the Company no longer had camera footage, so the Authority could not oblige the Company to
the execution of the data subject's request.

Based on the above, the Authority has determined that in refusing the Client 's request for access, the

Company has not acted pursuant to Article 12 (4) of the GDPR, hence the Customer’s request for access
did not meet the requirements of the GDPR.

III.1.2. The Customer's request dated May 29, 2018 also includes that camera recording until then
do not delete it until the case he or she objects to has been verified. The Customer is dated May 30, 2018

request states in more detail that ‘the camera recording of 26 May 2018 (taken at 5:14 p.m.)
save the management of the company ”because this is the only evidence and additional needs of the applicant
you need the recording to validate. 9

Pursuant to Article 18 (1) (c) of the Regulation, any interested party whose legal claims may be
in order to validate or protect the personal data processed about him, he is entitled to
at the request of the controller, the data shall not be “deleted”, even if the controller, otherwise

beyond a specified retention period - you no longer need personal data for data processing
for the purpose of.

Without restricting data processing, it could be a common situation to request the data subject's legal needs

enforce (e.g., file a complaint with the police or initiate court proceedings) and the commencement
procedure, if the acting body requests the camera recording necessary for the proof, the data would no longer be available
at the disposal of the data controller, as the retention period required for the purpose of data processing is already in place
letelne. This is also confirmed by the case of the Client, when - on the advice of the Company - he made a police report,
however, when the proceedings have reached the stage where the police request the named recording, the

Company - as the Client's request was not taken into account - it had been canceled by then, so the police
the applicant's allegations or the contrary were not substantiated in the proceedings.

Enforcing the right to restrict data processing may be particularly important in a business premises
in the case of an operated camera system where money is managed, as both the buyer and the seller

on the other hand, there may be a need to use the recording in the proceedings if they are unaware of a contentious situation
to decide. Without the availability of recordings, both parties may be harmed, as only the camera recording
it can be proved how much the buyer has paid and how much the seller has paid
received, so the seller may not return it to the buyer badly, so there may be a shortage in the cash register,
or the buyer pays more money for the product than it would actually cost.

It is clear from the reply to the request, both on 29 May and 30 May 2018, that the
Company to "save the recordings" or "do not delete them until checked",
he did not react in any way.

In response to a letter dated May 29, the Company only stated that the camera recording was only
police have the opportunity to hand it over, however, it did not elaborate on the obstacle to the recordings
the fact that he does not keep the recordings beyond the normal retention period,
also did not provide information to the Client, but clearly refused to comply with the request,
as he no longer had the recordings during the police proceedings.

In its reply to the letter dated 30 May, the Company also did not explain why it did not retain the
recordings beyond the normal retention period, nor did it provide information on the fact of refusal
nor, merely that “at the closing of the cash register of the given day, no cash surplus or cash was generated”.

Based on the above, the Authority has determined that the Company intends to restrict the Client's data management
infringed Article 12 (4) and Article 18 (1) of the GDPR in the handling of his application
(c).

III.2. The Debtor's data management practice between 25 May and 1 August 2018

Although the Company identified only one stakeholder application during the period considered, the Authority
did not accept the declaration, as it was the conclusion based on the handling of the only known request
it can be deduced that the Company did not recognize, prior to the initiation of the Authority’s proceedings, that the

application is subject to data protection, which is included in Annex GDPR III. the exercise of the rights of data subjects under Chapter

III.2.1. On May 29, 2018, the employee filed a consumer protection complaint in the Kaposvár store a
application because it did not detect that the application was subject to data protection. The consumer complaint is recorded
according to the minutes, the acting employee also consulted with the sales department, where they also did not know

identify the stakeholder request: the sales department also suggested that the Customer do
report. 10

On May 30, 2018, an employee of the Kaposvár store recorded the application in the customer's book.
with the Client, who has also not noticed that the application constitutes an exercise of rights by the data subject.

Nor could the customer service assistant, who was the Customer’s

by letter dated 18 June 2018 to the registered office of the Company
or if the senior official, as the addressee of the letter, himself
he read, not even the senior official himself.

As the Company itself stated that the improper handling of the data subject's claim was due to
that the Company has no data protection regulations regarding camera recordings at all during this period
provided, the Company may have more than one known request for privacy
However, as with the known application, they were not identified
as a data protection submission.

This is also confirmed by the fact that the Company kept a systematic record of incoming messages, but
did not separate the data subject submissions concerning data protection, but the Customer - otherwise data protection
as a consumer protection complaint, as well as in the customers' book
has been recorded. The Company kept three different records of incoming submissions

(Conciliation Board inquiries, e-mail complaints, customer book), but this does not mean
that other privacy notices could not have been received by the Company as the notifier
his application was also considered a complaint or an entry in the purchasers' book.

III.2.2. Article 24 of the GDPR contains the general obligations of the controller: this is the basis for the controller

shall take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure and demonstrate this
to ensure that personal data are processed in accordance with the GDPR. If it is data management
proportionate to the activity, the controller shall, as part of these measures,
also apply internal data protection rules.

Article 25 of the GDPR specifies the general obligations set out in Article 24: in this Article
the principle of regulated built-in and default data protection explicitly requires that data subjects be involved
the guarantees necessary for the protection of the rights of the data controller should be incorporated by the data controller into the data management process, ie
data protection considerations should be reflected in the design process and not in the established practice
the necessary measures should be taken.

All this means that the Company is already in the process of planning and developing camera data management - that is
before installing the cameras - you should have brought them to the organizational or technical
measures to be taken by the parties concerned in accordance with GDPR III. they can secure their rights under Chapter

These measures include, on the one hand, internal procedures for the management of data subjects' rights
designation of, inter alia, the person responsible for handling the requests of the data subject; to form
the channels through which the Company can receive the requests of the data subject, and, where applicable, the Data Protection Officer
designation; to establish the rules of the exercise of the rights of the data subject (eg the Company is made in stores
the right to access the camera in person, by post or electronically);

take appropriate data security measures; keep a register of data processing in accordance with Article 30.

The necessary measures also include appropriate information practices for those concerned
in which stakeholders are informed about the fact of data management and most importantly

including their rights to camera data management
and to whom and what contact details they may make their requests
they may receive a reply within the time limit or, in the event of disagreement, to which body
for redress.

Given that the Company has extensive coverage in the country, in all 129 of its stores
operated cameras during this period, the Authority considers that camera data management
proportionate expectation that the Company, in compliance with Article 24 (2) of the GDPR, will

also apply appropriate internal data protection rules. The Company would have been needed in this area
all its employees working with customers, in particular in the sales area and
customer service staff - teaching you what to do with camera data management under the GDPR
affected requests may occur, how to identify and distinguish these requests from others

submissions, complaints, how to handle these requests, which organization within the Company
these requests shall be forwarded to the unit.

Failure to take all of these measures has resulted in the Company not, as detailed above

recognized that the only known request for access under Article 15 (1) of the GDPR was
It shall be deemed to be a request for restriction pursuant to Article 18 (1) (c). This has led to the Company -
despite repeated requests from the applicant - did not give the applicant access to the information about him
camera recording, or restrict it. Furthermore, the Company did not inform the notifier that
appeal to the courts or the Authority, but erred in pointing out that the

camera footage can only be issued to the police upon official police request,
you can appeal to the Somogy County Police Headquarters.

Given that the Company during this period is the camera data management, so is the camera
with regard to the exercise of data subjects' rights in relation to data processing

infringed Article 25 (1) of the Regulation.

III.3. Evaluation of the Debtor's data management practices performed after 26 November 2019

Regulations governing the data management practices of the Company during the operation of the camera system

It was adopted on November 26, 2019, which includes, among other things, detailed instructions to that effect
on how to deal with stakeholder requests related to camera recordings.

III.3.1. Rules for handling access requests

The Regulations regulate three rights in the context of access to camera recordings: a
requesting written information about events recorded on camera footage, requesting a copy a
camera recording, view the camera recording.

The Regulations restrict the right of the persons concerned to issue a copy, as the Company is this document

issue a copy of the recording to the data subject only if outside that data subject
no other person is listed. If the data subject requests the release of a recording which includes other
you will only be able to view the contents of the recording if you get tired of the Company's headquarters
(To Budapest) and watch the recording there. The Company applies this practice despite the fact that a
Article 15 (3) of the GDPR clearly states that the controller is concerned

shall, at his request, provide a copy of the recording to the person concerned: he shall be free of charge for the first time
this can be done by the data controller, while for other occasions you may charge a fee for making a copy.

Based on the above, the Company is therefore obliged to issue copies, during which - Article 15 of the GDPR
Paragraph 4, it shall ensure that the request for access of the data subject is complied with

the rights of another person are not infringed. As the obligation to issue copies to the Company from this
Article 15 (4) of the GDPR does not have to be
in the case of other persons covered by this Regulation, the data recording requested by the
copy, but must be guaranteed by the Company by appropriate technical measures (eg masking),

that the rights of other persons on the recording are not infringed while the data subject requests access
fulfills. The restriction of the rights of the data subject in this way is particularly significant because the Company is
It has business premises in a significant number of cities in the country, more than fifty
all stakeholders are expected to travel several hours to the capital headquarters if the content of the recordings
you want to know.

The Regulations also limit the right of data subjects to view the recording, as the
It follows from the wording that it is only possible to view the recording in the Company 's 12

if a person other than the data subject is included in the recording, thus - based on their own practice
- cannot record the camera image.

The right to issue the copy in question is therefore provided for in Article 15 (3) of the GDPR, while the
access to personal data pursuant to Article 15 (1) of the GDPR
means. These two rights are two different sub-rights to the right of access under Article 15 of the GDPR,

each of which belongs to the person concerned separately, so that it is not appropriate to a
practice if you can practice one (view a recording) if the other (view a recording)
copy) cannot be complied with, but the data subject's request must be in accordance with the content of the request
whether you are requesting a copy of the recording or viewing the recording.

However, Article 12 (5) of the GDPR gives the controller a limited possibility to
refuses to take action on the application of the person concerned (in this case, the
or a copy thereof), but only if it is
in the opinion of the person concerned, is manifestly unfounded or excessive.

Based on the above, the Authority has determined that the development of the Company's data management regulations
has taken organizational measures which do not guarantee the right of access of data subjects to
Under the conditions set out in Article 15 (1) and (3) of the GDPR, thereby infringing the GDPR

Article 25 (1).

III.3.2. Designed to handle requests to limit data processing
regulation

The Code states that “the person whose right or legitimate interest is in the recording of the image
may, by proving his right or legitimate interest, request that the recording not be destroyed by the controller
or deleted until requested to do so by a court or authority, but for no longer than 30 days ’.

                                                                           2
The Authority first states that this provision was previously amended by Act no. contained which provision
however, after the GDPR becomes applicable on 25 May 2018, it is necessary for implementation
has been changed due to legal harmonization, and at the time of the creation of the Regulations, the
contained this provision.

The Authority further notes that the provisions of the GDPR apply to Hungarian legal entities from 25 May 2018
are directly applicable, except for those for the full application and implementation of
additional provisions provided for in the national legislation of some Member States are necessary. In addition, the regulation

it gives Member States, to a limited extent, an additional or comparable option
different rules in a certain direction, but the exercise of the rights of the data subject does not fall
that is to say, if the data subject requests the controller to restrict the processing, it shall inform the controller
you have to implement.

Neither the GDPR nor the Svv. no longer contains a rule that would require data management only
may be limited to a maximum of 30 days from the date of the request, since if it is
30 days after receipt of the request for a restriction on data processing
would delete the recordings requested to be restricted, it would not help to enforce your rights in that case

because the procedure it has initiated would not yet reach the stage where
that the acting body seek the data controller in possession of the recording.

Furthermore, the GDPR exercises the right to restrict data processing - or the right of any data subject

does not impose a condition for the exercise of the right of restriction
it would be required to prove the right or legitimate interest of the data subject.

2
 Act CXXXIII of 2005 on the rules for the protection of persons and property and for the activities of private investigators. Act (hereinafter: the Act) 13

The interpretation of the right to restrict data processing in this way is restrictive, so the Company
has taken organizational measures that it has not
ensure the right of data subjects to restrict data processing under the conditions provided for in Article 18 of the GDPR
thereby infringed Article 25 (1) of the GDPR.

ARC. Sanction and justification applied

The Authority found that during the data processing performed by the Debtor during the examined period - the III.1.

- in the course of handling the Client's exercise of the rights of the data subject, violated Article 12 of the Decree.
Article 15 (4), Article 15 (1) and Article 18 (1) (c) respectively. The Obliged
- a III.2. and III.3. infringed Article 25 (1) of the Regulation. This infringement
the Authority considered it appropriate to impose a fine as follows.

As to whether the imposition of a data protection fine is justified, the Authority should
Article 83 (2) of the Regulation and Infotv.75 / A. § under the ex officio consideration of the case all
and found that there was no warning in the case of the infringement found in the present proceedings
it is neither a disproportionate nor a dissuasive sanction, so it is necessary to impose a fine.

The Authority considers it necessary to impose a fine, as the Debtor in the period under review 2019.
until 26 November, no data protection regulations will apply to camera recordings
that is to say, it did not take the necessary organizational measures to ensure that the
the exercise of the rights of the parties concerned should be ensured in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR, which has resulted in the
The Debtor has violated the Customer's right to access or restrict data processing.

Furthermore, the data management regulations of the Debtor established on November 26, 2019 are still not in force
complies with the provisions of the GDPR, disproportionately restricts access to those concerned, and
the right to restrict data processing, so that the measures taken at that time are still inadequate,
as they do not ensure the exercise of the rights of data subjects in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR.

In view of this, the Authority Pursuant to Section 61 (1) (a), they are contained in the operative part
and in the present decision ordered the Debtor to pay a data protection fine.

The amount of the fine was determined by the Authority acting in accordance with its statutory discretion.

Depending on the nature of the infringement, the maximum amount of the fine that may be imposed under Article 83 (5) of the GDPR
EUR 20 000 000 or, in the case of the Debtor, the previous financial year in full
up to 4% of its worldwide turnover, whichever is the higher.

Depending on the nature of the breach, in breach of the principle of privacy by design and by default, the

the maximum amount of the fine under Article 83 (4) (a) of the GDPR is EUR 10 000 000 and the amount of the
not more than 2% of the total worldwide turnover in the preceding business year, whichever is the higher.

In imposing the fine, the Authority took into account the following factor as an aggravating circumstance:

    the Customer 's request to the data subject was not properly processed because the Debtor was a
        Regulation becomes operational when it becomes applicable - operated by it
        camera system - did not have any at all: the notifier wanted to do so in several forums
        to exercise his rights as a data subject, however, none of the Defendant’s employees recognized that the applicant

        his request is considered to be a data protection exercise of the data subject - committed by the Debtor
        an infringement is therefore considered to have been committed with serious negligence \[Article 83 (2) GDPR
        paragraph (b)\]

    - during the development of the regulations in force by the Debtor since 26 November 2019
        the organizational measures taken disproportionately impede the access or
        the right to restrict data processing \[Article 83 (2) (a) GDPR\]; 14

    - the Debtor is fully liable both for the breach committed against the Client and
        and for the development of a restrictive practice that has existed ever since, as it is under Article 25
        it would have been his responsibility to take action \[Article 83 (2) (d) GDPR\];

    - the Debtor is subject to extremely serious negligence in relation to the data processing in question due to the fact that
        despite the order of magnitude more affected by the larger number of its stores

        should have prepared for a request for the exercise of a right, its organizational arrangements are still such
        nor were they capable of identifying and handling applications and it can therefore reasonably be assumed that
        the right of access was not properly exercised not only in the specific case examined, but also at other times
        \[Article 83 (2) (b) GDPR\].

In setting the fine, the Authority took into account the following mitigating circumstances:

    - the Debtor offered the applicant thirty thousand forints to alleviate the damage suffered by the applicant
        \[Article 83 (2) (c) GDPR\];

    - the Debtor already facilitates lawful data management during the official control
        took action, so in Circular 66 he drew his staff’s attention to read the
        prepared a camera brochure for customers in order to be aware of the

        the rights conferred on data subjects by the GDPR \[Article 83 (2) (f) GDPR\];
    - the Debtor has complied with the cooperation with the Authority to such an extent

        obligation to admit the infringement itself \[Article 83 (2) GDPR
        point f)\].

In imposing the fine, the Authority took into account the following other factors:

    - during the period under review, the Debtor has identified a single claim, thus according to his statement
        committed a single infringement in the processing of the applications concerned, but

        Authority did not accept this statement of the Debtor \[Article 83 (2) (k) GDPR\];
    - the processing did not affect specific categories of personal data \[Article 83 (2) GDPR

        paragraph (g)\];
    - the fine imposed is able to achieve its purpose if its amount - the Obliged sales

        relative to its turnover - appreciable;
    - net sales revenue according to the Debtor's 2018 report, as last published

        Was HUF 33,645,000,000, the amount of the data protection fine imposed is based on the net sales
        0.0594% of its turnover.

The Authority did not consider Article 83 (2) (e), (h), (i) and (j) of the GDPR to be relevant for the imposition of fines.
as they cannot be interpreted in the context of the specific case.

In setting the fine, the Authority did not consider it relevant that the
“Not a central instruction” but was the result of an “erroneous individual decision” as the Authority
in his opinion, the Debtor is also liable in this case.
