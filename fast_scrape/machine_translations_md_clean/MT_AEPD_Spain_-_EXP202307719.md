## English Summary

### Facts

The Ministry of Health and Public Health of Valencia (controller) has engaged the services of Marina Salud (processor) since 2009. The processor is a health organisation providing public health services under a contract.

On 19 January 2023, the controller performed an inspection on the processor’s premises. During this inspection, it was revealed that the processor was using a 3rd party health information system software, and refused to provide the controller with the contract in place between the processor and the 3rd party. The inspection revealed that the 3rd party software was being used for laboratory and pathological management, the management of anticoagulation treatment, human resources and the management of logistics in the hospital. Two further unauthorised sub-processors had been engaged by the processor, one for IT systems, and one for a laboratory information system.

On 27 January 2023, the controller reaffirmed their instructions to the processor for the processing, access and use of the health data, as well as mandating that the processor cannot engage any sub-processors without authorisation.

On 31 January 2023, the controller informed the processor that they were not going to extend the contract for the provision of services between them past its expiration (31 January 2024).

On 16 May 2023, the controller filed a complaint with the AEPD (Spanish DPA).

During the DPA’s investigation, the processor argued that they held a general authorisation from the controller to engage sub-processors.

### Holding

The DPA rejected the processor’s claim in respect of having a general authorisation to engage sub-processors. The DPA referenced both an agreement between the controller and processor requiring the controller’s assent before a sub-processor could be engaged, as well as the processor’s obligation in [Article 28(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR#2 "Article 28 GDPR").

The DPA found that the processor had infringed [Article 28(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_28_GDPR#2 "Article 28 GDPR") for engaging a sub-processor without the controller’s authorisation.

In deciding the fine to be imposed, the DPA considered the infringement to be serious in nature. The DPA had regard to the fact that the personal data in question was special category data, that three unauthorised sub-processors had been engaged, and the processor had a high turnover. The DPA levied a fine of €500,000.

SANCTIONING PROCEDURE RESOLUTION

Based on the procedure initiated by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and based on the following

BACKGROUND

On November 7, 2024, a resolution proposal was issued, proposing the following:

FIRST: The MINISTRY OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH OF THE VALENCIAN GENERALITY (hereinafter, the complainant) filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency on May 16, 2023.
The complaint is directed against MARINA SALUD, S.A. with NIF A97563563 (hereinafter, the defendant). The grounds for the complaint are as follows:
The complaining party is the contracting body within the framework of a contract related to the provision of healthcare services in the Denia Department of Health (in force since February 1, 2009). It states that the complaining party (the concessionaire), as the data processor, processes specially protected personal data under the responsibility of the Regional Ministry.

The following sets forth a series of facts:

“- In an inspection carried out on January 19, 2023, the complainant revealed the use of specific software. In this context, the accused party was required to present the license/support and/or service provision contracts signed with the companies that own the healthcare information system applications used at Denia Hospital, but they refused to do so.

- On January 31, 2023, the accused party was notified of the intention not to renew the contract and its subsequent termination on January 31, 2024, as well as the rules for the recovery of direct management of the public service.

- On January 27, 2023, instructions were issued for the processing, access, and use of data. The aforementioned instructions indicate that the concessionaire will not use another person in charge without authorization from the Regional Ministry."

In short, the complainant, suspecting that the application of the current data processor is being dismantled, informs the AEPD that the defendant may be violating data protection regulations regarding the obligations of the data processor,

putting, in its opinion, the return of the data and the recovery of the service at risk, just a few months before the end of the contract, as well as the security and fundamental rights of the individuals to whom said data relate.

-Response from the accused party dated February 1, 2023, to the previous request, stating the following:

"Consequently, it is not within the scope of the Health Inspection to request a copy of the license/assistance and/or service provision contracts signed with the companies that own the information system applications indicated in Section II of this document, since requesting this information is not intended to inspect aspects related to the health and public health field."

-Request dated February 10, 2023, sent by the complaining party, requesting that they provide the information requested on January 19, 2023, contained in the Inspection Report \*\*\*REFERENCE 1.

-Third request issued by the complaining party dated March 29, 2023, requesting the information indicated in the first request.

FOURTH: According to the report collected from the AXESOR tool, the entity
MARINA SALUD, S.A. is a company (...), established in 2005, with a turnover of \*\*\*AMOUNT.1 euros in 2022.

FIFTH: On July 24, 2024, the Director of the Spanish Data Protection Agency agreed to initiate sanctioning proceedings against the respondent, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 63 and 64 of Law 39/2015, of October 1, on the Common Administrative Procedure of Public Administrations (hereinafter, LPACAP), for the alleged violation of Article 28 of the GDPR, classified in Article 83.4 of the GDPR.

SIXTH: After notification of the aforementioned initiation agreement in accordance with the rules established in the LPACAP (General Data Protection Act), the respondent submitted a written statement of allegations in which, in summary, it stated, in its FIRST allegation, a list of the events that occurred.

In its SECOND allegation, entitled, ON THE LACK OF VIOLATION OF DATA PROTECTION REGULATIONS BY MARINA SALUD, it indicated, among other things, the following:

“1. The scope of the alleged breach attributed to Marina Salud.
Our client is accused of committing an alleged violation of Article 28.2 of the GDPR, according to which “\[t\]he data processor shall not use another processor without the prior written authorization, whether specific or general, of the controller.

In the latter case, the data processor will inform the controller of any planned changes in the incorporation or replacement of other data processors, thus giving the controller the opportunity to object to such changes."

The AEPD understands, in the Start-Up Agreement, that our client did not communicate to the

Data Controller the information related to the identity of the entities with which it had subcontracted the processing of personal data, which would determine non-compliance with the aforementioned provision. This is based on the complaint filed by the Regional Ministry, which, however, expressly states the latter's knowledge of the contracts signed by our client that involve the use of a subprocessor to carry out activities involving the processing of personal data.

That is, the complaint focuses its rep\*\*\*COMPANY.6 on the fact that our client has not provided the complainant with a copy of the contracts entered into

with said entities. entities, but not due to the latter's lack of knowledge of which entities these were. Likewise, its content shows that our client did not breach its obligation to inform the data controller about the processing activities that were subcontracted, but only that our client had not provided the Regional Ministry responsible for the processing with a copy of the aforementioned contracts.

1. Regime applicable to the contracts entered into by MARINA SALUD.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 10/24

Taking the foregoing into account, it is necessary to describe the framework applicable to the relationship between our client and the Regional Ministry at the time the contracts were signed, as well as the regime applicable to them. Regarding the relationship between our client and the Regional Ministry, in its capacity as data controller for the data processed by MARINA SALUD, it should be noted that, at least until the adoption of the Instructions, this relationship was governed by the Personal Data Processing Agreement in compliance with Article 12 of the LOPD (Spanish Data Protection Act), in which, as indicated, the Regional Ministry (as data controller) granted our client (as data processor) a general power of attorney to subcontract those processing activities that were necessary for the proper management of the services covered by the concession.
As indicated, the Agreement expressly stipulated that the Regional Ministry authorized and, consequently, empowered Marina Salud "to subcontract, on behalf of and for the account of the data controller, the processing of data necessary for the provision of the services covered by the concession."

2. The Regional Ministry was aware of the subprocessors contracted by MARINA SALUD at the date of approval of the Instructions, and also stated their suitability for the purposes set forth in the GDPR and the LOPDGDD.
As a result, the information provided in the Initiation Agreement is inconsistent with reality, given that:

• The Regional Ministry responsible for the processing was aware of the subprocessors contracted by our client and the scope of the services provided by them at the time of filing its claim.

• The Regional Ministry considered the aforementioned data processors suitable, (i) requiring our client not to replace them with others without its authorization; and (ii) directly hiring them as data processors once the concession was reverted.

3. The failure to provide the Regional Ministry with the contracts entered into with the subprocessors does not constitute a breach of personal data protection regulations.
Much of the complaint filed by the Regional Ministry in its complaint to the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) is based exclusively on the fact that our client did not provide the Regional Ministry with copies of the contracts entered into with the subprocessors. However, Marina Salud considers it necessary to point out that neither the GDPR nor the LOPDGDD establish an obligation such as the one indicated above.

4. The Regional Ministry confirms the legality of MARINA SALUD's actions.
In the THIRD allegation, entitled BREACH OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE PENALTY, it stated, among other things, the following:
“\[…\] Indeed, in the present case, the breach allegedly attributed to our client, already refuted in the previous allegations, would be of an exclusively formal nature and would consist of not providing the data controller, at the latest until the date of the inspection that took place on January 19, 2023, that is, a few months after the execution of two of the three contracts analyzed in the Initiation Agreement, the identity of the sub-processors.
“\[…\] the AEPD has not taken into consideration a fact that it is fully aware of from a mere reading. of the file: at this time, our client is not providing the services that constituted its source of income, as its corporate purpose is the management of the Denia Health Department. However, the AEPD considers this circumstance to be entirely irrelevant, taking as a reference figure for quantifying the fine our client's turnover in 2022, when it was actually operating as a concessionaire for the public service, which has now been reversed.

SEVENTH: After notification of the proposed resolution in accordance with the rules established in the LPACAP (Spanish Public Health Act), the respondent submitted a written statement of allegations in which, in summary, it stated its ratification of the statements made in the allegations to the initiation agreement.

From the actions taken in this procedure and the documentation in the file, the following have been established:

LEGAL BASIS

I
Jurisdiction

In accordance with the powers granted to each supervisory authority by Article 58.2 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 14/24

(General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR), and as established in Articles 47, 48.1, 64.2, and 68.1 of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of Personal Data and the Guarantee of Digital Rights (hereinafter LOPDGDD), the President of the Spanish Data Protection Agency is competent to initiate and resolve this procedure.
Likewise, Article 63.2 of the LOPDGDD establishes that: "The procedures processed by the Spanish Data Protection Agency shall be governed by the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, by this Organic Law, by the regulatory provisions issued in its development, and, insofar as they do not contradict them, in a subsidiary capacity, by the general rules on administrative procedures."

II

Preliminary Questions

In the present case, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 4.1 and 4.2 of the GDPR, it is evident that personal data are being processed by the complainant party as the data processor, which it carries out in the exercise of its powers and attributions.

The "data controller" is defined in Article 4.7 of the GDPR as
"the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of processing; where Union or Member State law determines the purposes and means of processing, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be laid down by Union or Member State law."

For the provision of the services contemplated in the concession contract, relating to the provision of healthcare services in the Department of Health of Denia, the reporting party is required to process personal data in which it acts as data processor. These processes include the collection, adaptation or modification, recording, extraction, provision of access, alignment or interconnection, consultation, structuring, use, storage, communication by transmission, and destruction of personal data, which include special categories of data, health data (diagnoses, treatments, vaccinations, diagnostic tests), data relating to sexual activity, or genetic data.

Article 4.8 of the GDPR defines "processor" as "the natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller."

The defendant acts as data processor, as can be seen from the Resolution of the Regional Minister of Health of February 7, 2005, in which the defendant was awarded the public service management concession contract (\*\*\*REFERENCE 1), the purpose of which was to provide comprehensive healthcare for Area 12, Denia Health Department. The contract was formalized on March 14, 2005, with services beginning on February 1, 2009. The provision of the services contemplated in the concession contract requires the defendant, as the concessionary entity, to process personal data, especially those protected under the responsibility of the complainant. In such processing, the concessionary entity (the complainant) acts as the data processor, pursuant to Article 4(7) and (8) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter GDPR). III
Allegations to the Initiation Agreement and Proposed Resolution

In response to the allegations presented by the respondent entity, the following should be noted:

Regarding the allegation regarding the absence of a violation of data protection regulations by the respondent party, it should be noted that the respondent party used other subprocessors based on a general authorization, included in the Agreement signed between the parties in 2009, so compliance with the provisions of the second section of Article 28 would be mandatory, which refers specifically to cases in which a general authorization from the data controller exists, as is the case at hand:

"In the latter case, the processor shall inform the controller of any planned changes in the incorporation or replacement of other processors, thus giving the controller the opportunity to object to such changes."

It should be remembered that the GDPR has been mandatory since May 25, 2018, as already indicated in the Initiation Agreement, which preceded the inspection carried out by the complaining party on January 19, 2023, the instructions issued by the complaining party on January 27, 2023, and the communication of non-continuation of the contract on January 31, 2023.

In the present case, there is no evidence that the complaining party, as the data processor, informed the data controller, the complaining party, of the data processing contracts signed after that date with the other subprocessors. Considering that the contracts concluded involve the addition of other subprocessors, they would fall under the category of changes provided for in Article 28.2 and should have been notified prior to their execution so that the data controller would have had the opportunity to object to such changes.

For the sake of completeness, it should be emphasized again that the obligation to inform the data controller of the identity of the companies with which it intended to subcontract was already present in the Personal Data Processing Agreement in compliance with

Article 12 of the LOPD (Spanish Data Protection Act), signed on April 1, 2009. Clause Eight, which regulates subcontracting, stated the following:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 16/24

"The data controller authorizes the data processor to subcontract, in the name and on behalf of the data controller, the processing of the data necessary for the provision of the services subject to the concession.

For these purposes, the data processor shall inform the data controller of the identity of the companies from which it intends to subcontract the services subject to this subcontracting.

Therefore, what is included in the GDPR is not new, although the alleged violation is limited exclusively to the obligation of 28.2 of the contracts with the subprocessors already detailed in the Startup Agreement, which are the following:

-Data Protection Agreement, annex to the contract signed with the company
\*\*\*COMPANY.3., dated October 6, 2017, related to the use of the application

\*\*\*SISTEMA.1 (Document No. 14). The annex was signed on September 27, 2018.

- Contract for the Provision of Laboratory IT Services, entered into with the company \*\*\*EMPRESA.4, the purpose of which is "the acquisition by MARINA SALUD of the IT solution owned by \*\*\*EMPRESA.4, called \*\*\*SISTEMA.2, which will act as the Laboratory IT System (LIA) for the computerization of the clinical analysis laboratory of the new Denia Hospital" (Document No. 15). This contract was signed on April 16, 2008. They also provide a data processor contract, adapted to the GDPR, dated May 5, 2022 (Document No. 16).

- Contract for the provision of license and maintenance services without hosting for the computer application \*\*\*SISTEMA.3 and the APP \*\*\*SISTEMA.3, signed with the company \*\*\*EMPRESA.6 on April 12, 2022, for the use of a license for the Patient Management Software and the maintenance and technical support service. Annex II contains the provisions related to the provision of services by the subcontractor. (Document No. 17).

The concessionaire states that the aforementioned subcontracting was carried out pursuant to the general power of attorney granted by the Regional Ministry in accordance with the provisions of Clause Eight of the Personal Data Processing Agreement in compliance with Article 12 of the LOPD (Data Protection Act) provided (Document No. 4), which authorizes the subcontractor to carry out the subcontracting.

As detailed in the initial agreement, the obligation to provide information persists as long as the relationship between the data controller and the data processor is maintained. This obligation must be provided before the aforementioned contracts are signed, so that, in accordance with Article 28.2, the data controller has the opportunity to object.

As the defendant indicated in its allegations, DT5 of the LOPDGDD states that "Data processor contracts signed prior to May 25, 2018, under the provisions of Article 12 of Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13, on the Protection of Personal Data, will remain in force until the expiration date indicated therein and, if they were agreed to indefinitely, until May 25, 2022."

This Agency is not questioning the validity of the contracts at any time. The parties could have requested compliance with the GDPR, although there is no record that they did so.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 17/24

In any case, the obligation of Article 28 had to be fulfilled, but the contract also already indicated that the controller must be informed of any subcontracts made. (Personal data processing agreement in compliance with Article 12 of the LOPD (Spanish Data Protection Act), which, in its Eighth Clause, which regulates subcontracting, states that: "The data controller authorizes the data processor to subcontract, on behalf of and for the account of the data controller, the processing of the data necessary for the provision of the services subject to the concession. For these purposes, the data processor shall inform the data controller of the identity of the companies from which it intends to subcontract the services subject to this subcontracting.)

On another note, in no case has this Agency considered the fact that copies of the contracts signed with said entities, as required by the inspection, have not been provided.

Likewise, the fact that the Administration was aware of the contracts despite not having communicated them, as stated by the accused party, is not relevant in this case.

The obligation arose when the contracts were signed since, by virtue of the principle of proactive responsibility, The person responsible for such contracts must be able to prove that they fulfilled the obligation, but have not done so.

For all the above reasons, this claim is dismissed.

With regard to the claim regarding the violation of the principle of proportionality in determining the sanction, it should be noted that the reasoning for the proposed sanction followed the criteria of Article 83.2 of the GDPR and Article 76.2 of the LOPDGDD.

In the present case, and with respect to section a) of Article 83.2 of the GDPR, the duration of the violation must be taken into consideration, and it would be a permanent violation, since permanent violations create an unlawful state whose cessation depends on the will of its perpetrator. Therefore, as long as a subprocessor continues to be used, the obligation to inform persists, since the obligation is imposed so that the controller is informed, and they must be informed as long as a subprocessor is operating.

The motivation is also fully justified, following section g) of Article 83.2 of the GDPR regarding the personal data affected, health data considered a special category of personal data, according to Article 9 of the GDPR.

Likewise, the criteria set forth in Section 2 of Article 76 "Sanctions and Corrective Measures" of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act) have been applied to determine the sanction, which emphasizes that the connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data (Section b) may be taken into account. This is the case of the accused party, who, although its main activity is the management of the Denia Health Department, requires the processing of personal data in order to carry out this activity. In this case, special categories of personal data, as indicated in Article 9 of the GDPR, are involved, as these data are linked to people's health.

The above is based on data obtained from the Preliminary Investigation Actions, which indicate the following:

"Denia Hospital, on its website denia.com/hospital-marina-salud/, indicates that the Denia Health Department consists of one hospital, four integrated healthcare centers, eight health centers, 34 clinics, and two additional clinics during the summer.

It was launched in 2009.

MARINA SALUD SA is listed in AXESOR as a Spanish public limited company with the activity "Hospital Activities." Its website marinasalud.es states that it is a healthcare company that provides public healthcare services, including to Denia Hospital.

RIBERA SALUD SA is listed in AXESOR as a Spanish public limited company with the activity "Hospital Activities." Its website riberasalud.com states that it is a business group that provides public and private healthcare services. Among the companies that form part of the Group is MARINA SALUD SA. and its healthcare network includes the Denia Health Hospital."

The claim of disproportionateness cannot be upheld in this case. First, let us remember that, regarding the reference used to quantify the fine, the Agency has taken into account the latest available data published in the AXESOR tool, which shows a turnover of \*\*\*AMOUNT.1 euros for 2022.

The fine of €500,000 represents 0.3% of turnover. Taking into account that the GDPR allows fines of up to 2% of said turnover, it could not be considered disproportionate. Also taking into account the aggravating factors indicated, the data falls under Article 9 of the GDPR, and the entity is accustomed to processing such data.

It should be added that for fixed amounts, the limit would be €10 million, meaning that, under either parameter, the amount is clearly within the minimum range.

Furthermore, and despite the allegations, the respondent has not provided any additional information to justify the aforementioned decrease in its turnover, with the latest available figure being the one used by this AEPD to quantify the proposed fine. Therefore, the Agency does not have any elements other than those already used to quantify the sanction to be imposed.

Regarding the complainant's claim that the violation would be purely formal in nature, and therefore the amount would be disproportionate, it can be stated that this is not the case, since the failure to communicate the existence of subcontractors prevents the controller from properly exercising its supervisory powers.

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 19/24

And we must not lose sight of the fact that we are dealing with the provision of a public service as important as healthcare, where the processing of special-category data is routine.

The Administration cannot ignore the possible existence of subcontractors

(subcontractors in data protection) who have access to personal health data.

For all the reasons stated above, this claim is dismissed.

IV

Data Processor

Article 28 of the GDPR, "Data Processor," states the following:

"1. Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall only choose a processor that offers sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the processing complies with the requirements of this Regulation and ensures the protection of the rights of the data subject.

2. The processor shall not use another processor without the prior written authorization, whether specific or general, of the controller. In the latter case, the processor shall inform the controller of any planned changes to the addition or replacement of other processors, thus giving the controller the right to object to such changes...)"

In the present case, the defendant party, when subcontracting the services subject to the concession, had prior written authorization of a general nature signed by the controller when the Personal Data Processing Agreement was concluded in compliance with Article 28 of the GDPR. 12 of the LOPD (Organic Law on Personal Data Protection), signed on April 1, 2009. Said Agreement, in its Eighth Clause, which regulates subcontracting, states the following:

"The data controller authorizes the data processor to subcontract, in the name and on behalf of the data controller, the processing of the data necessary for the provision of the services subject to the concession. For these purposes, the data processor shall inform the data controller of the identity of the companies from which it intends to subcontract the services subject to this subcontracting. The validity of the power of attorney granted by the data controller (which, in such case, must be in writing) shall be subject to the signing of a written contract between the Data Processor and the subcontracted company, which includes terms similar to those provided for in this agreement, with the full content established in Article 12 of the LOPD (Spanish Data Protection Act) and the express assumption by the data processor, on its own behalf, and the subcontractor of joint and several liability for any breach of the terms of processing by the subcontractor..."

This agreement is signed based on the existing contract between the parties for the provision of healthcare services in the Denia Department of Health by concession, dated March 14, 2005, with the start date of services being February 1, 2009. At that time, as reflected in the transcribed clause, there was an obligation to inform the controller of the identity of the companies with which the contract was intended to be subcontracted.

Similarly, Article 28.2 of the GDPR is mandatory as of May 25, 2018.

In the present case, there is no evidence that the accused party has informed the data controller of the contracts signed after that date with the subprocessors.

These are the following, also detailed in the EIGHTH PROVEN FACT:

-Data Protection Agreement, annexed to the contract signed with the company

\*\*\*COMPANY.3., dated October 6, 2017, related to the use of the application
\*\*\*SISTEMA.1 (Document No. 14). The annex was signed on September 27, 2018.

- Contract for the Provision of Laboratory IT Services, entered into with the company \*\*\*EMPRESA.4, the purpose of which is "the acquisition by MARINA SALUD of the IT solution owned by \*\*\*EMPRESA.4, called \*\*\*SISTEMA.2, which will act as the Laboratory IT System (LIA) for the computerization of the clinical analysis laboratory at the new Denia hospital" (Document No. 15). This contract was signed on April 16, 2008. They also provide a data processor contract, adapted to the GDPR, dated May 5, 2022. (Document No. 16).

-Service contract for the provision of licensing and maintenance services without hosting for the computer application \*\*\*SISTEMA.3 and the APP \*\*\*SISTEMA.3, signed with the company \*\*\*EMPRESA.6 on April 12, 2022, for the use of a license for the Patient Management Software and the maintenance and technical support service. Annex II contains the provisions related to the provision of services by the subprocessor. (Document No. 17).

On January 27, 2023, the contracting authority issued instructions, a series of general obligations for the data processor, which are derived from Article 28 of the GDPR and, for the purposes of subcontracting, indicate the following:

"The concessionaire shall not use another data processor without the prior written authorization of the Regional Ministry. To this end, the concessionaire must inform the Regional Ministry of any such provision at least 10 business days in advance.

In subcontracting, the subcontractor shall also have the status of data processor and shall be obliged to comply with the obligations established in this document for the data processor, including those relating to international transfers, and any instructions that the Regional Ministry may establish.

It is the concessionaire's responsibility to regulate the relationship with the subcontractor so that the latter is subject to the same conditions regarding processing. of personal data and the guarantee of the rights of the data subjects. In the event of non-compliance by the subprocessor, the concessionaire will remain fully responsible to the Regional Ministry for compliance with its obligations as data processor.

The authorizations referred to in the first paragraph of this section will be subject to the concessionaire being able to confirm the suitability of the proposed entity, specifically its knowledge, capacity, and willingness to comply with the requirements imposed by the applicable legal regulations, particularly those relating to information security and personal data protection, as well as the instructions of the Regional Ministry, for the provision of the service subject to the data processing assignment.

For these purposes, the concessionaire must provide a declaration of suitability of the subcontractor in the terms set forth.

Likewise, if the concessionaire already has subcontracts that involve the processing of personal data for which the Regional Ministry is responsible, these must be notified within 15 business days following notification of these instructions.

These instructions merely reinforce the data processor's obligations already contained in Article 28 of the GDPR, which are fully enforceable from the entry into force of the GDPR, as previously indicated. Furthermore, they were issued only a few days before the reporting party's non-renewal of the service management contract.

Based on the evidence available at the time of the resolution of the sanctioning procedure, the facts disclosed are considered to constitute an infringement, attributable to the reported party for violating Article 28.2 of the GDPR.

V
Classification and classification of the infringement of Article 28.2 of the GDPR

The aforementioned infringement of Article 28.2 of the GDPR constitutes the commission of one of the infringements classified in Article 83.4 of the GDPR, which, under the heading "General conditions for the imposition of administrative fines," provides:

"4. Violations of the following provisions shall be punishable, in accordance with paragraph 2, by administrative fines of up to EUR 10,000,000 or, in the case of a company, by an amount equivalent to a maximum of 2% of the total annual global turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

a) the obligations of the controller and the processor under Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39, 42, and 43;

For the purposes of the statute of limitations for infringements, the alleged infringement expires after one year, in accordance with Article 74 of the LOPDGDD (Spanish Data Protection Act), which classifies the following conduct as minor:

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 22/24

The remaining infringements of a purely formal nature of the articles mentioned in sections 4 and 5 of Article 83 of the GDPR are considered minor and will expire after one year, and in particular the following:

l) The contracting of other data processors by a data processor without prior authorization from the controller or without informing the controller of changes in the subcontracting process when legally required.

The infringement is permanent because an unlawful state has been created, the cessation of which depends on the will of its perpetrator. The violation of this type is maintained by the will of the perpetrator and continues until the unlawful situation is abandoned, for which reason it is not considered time-barred.

VI

Proposed sanction

For the purposes of deciding on the imposition of an administrative fine and its amount, in accordance with the evidence available at the time of the resolution of the sanctioning procedure, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following criteria established in Article 83.2 of the GDPR:

- The nature, severity, and duration of the violation, taking into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing operation in question, as well as the number of data subjects affected and the level of damages they have suffered.

(paragraph a): for failure to report the three contracts entered into with subprocessors,
as long as a subprocessor continues to be used, the obligation to report persists,
since the obligation is imposed so that the controller is informed, and must This may be the case
as long as a subprocessor is acting, from the date of the signature of the contracts with
\*\*\*COMPANY.3 dated 09/27/18, \*\*\*SISTEMA.3 (\*\*\*COMPANY.6) dated

04/12/22, and \*\*\*COMPANY.4 dated 05/05/22 (Update of a contract dated
04/16/08), until the inspection carried out by the data controller on
01/19/2023.

- The categories of personal data affected by the breach
(section g): the categories of personal data affected by the breach

are health data, which are considered special categories of data.

Likewise, it is considered appropriate to grade the sanction to be imposed according to the following criteria established in section 2 of Article 76 "Sanctions and Corrective Measures" of the LOPDGDD:

- The connection between the offender's activity and the processing of personal data (section b): the processing of personal data constitutes, in the provision of the contract with the Administration, an inherent or substantial part of the entrusted service.

The balance of the circumstances contemplated in Article 83.2 of the GDPR and 76.2 of the LOPDGDD, with respect to the infringement committed by violating the provisions of

C/ Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es
28001 – Madrid sedeagpd.gob.es 23/24

Article 28.2 of the GDPR, allows for the imposition of an administrative fine of €500,000.00.

Therefore, in accordance with applicable legislation and having assessed the criteria for graduating sanctions whose existence has been proven, the Presidency of the Spanish Data Protection Agency RESOLVES:

FIRST: TO IMPOSE a fine of 500,000.00 euros (FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND euros) on MARINA SALUD, S.A., with NIF A97563563, for a
