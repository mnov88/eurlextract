## English Summary

### Facts

The decision is the consequence of a second complaint submitted in June 2019 by a Spanish citizen stating that, after a first complaint (July 2018) in which he informed the AEPD that he had exercised his rights of access and erasure before the data controller without results (and, according to which, the AEPD had issued a decision requesting the data controller to grant such rights), the data controller only granted the erasure right to the citizen, but not the access right.

The data controller answered to the AEPD investigation requests that it had sent the citizen the corresponding information on the reason why it could not grant such access right: it had not been able to do so because it had already managed and granted the erasure right also requested.

### Dispute

Did the data controller infringe its obligation to fulfill the data subject's rights of access and erasure?

### Holding

The AEPD found that the data controller did not comply with its previous decision (as it did not grant the access right to the citizen) and, after considering some aggravating (the data controller has the consideration of a big company) and extenuating (the data controller has not obtained any benefits from its actions) circumstances, it decided to impose a fine of 30,000 € to the data controller.
