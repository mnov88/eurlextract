## English Summary

### Facts

The controller is a news service provider. Data subjects subscribed to its service to receive daily news and updates through a newsletter. It was not clarified whether this was a paid service. The controller relied on [Article 6(1)(b) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1b "Article 6 GDPR") to process the data for the newsletter.

The controller also processed personal data for electronic direct marketing (eDM) and a prize draw. The eDM emails were sent to everyone who subscribed to the service. The prize draw was advertised by the controller in the period between 24 February 2022 to 24 March 2022. The controller wanted to offer the prize draw's prize to all service subscribers. Therefore, all the service users were subscribed to the prize draw and there was no way for them to opt out of the prize draw.

On 24 June 2022, the DPA opened an _ex officio_ investigation into a controller's services. According to the facts uncovered by the DPA, between January 1, 2021 and May 17, 2022, all subscribers who registered online for the news service were automatically subscribed to eDM. A single checkbox on the website was used to accept the Terms of Service (TOS) - a condition of the subscription - _and_ to subscribe to eDM. At the time of subscription. In other words, it was not possible to subscribe to the service through the website alone without subscribing to eDM. In its defense, the controller argued that the data processing could be legitimized through legitimate interests.

### Holding

The DPA decided that the controller's conduct was in breach of the GDPR.

_First_, the DPA rejected the controller's argument that, in the absence of other suitable legal grounds, the processing may have been done on the legal basis of legitimate interest. The DPA emphasized that controllers are obliged to decide _in advance_ on the legal basis for processing, to weigh the legitimate interest against the rights of the data subject pursuant to [Article 6(1)(f) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1f "Article 6 GDPR"), to document this, and to inform the data subjects accordingly, including about the right to object. In the absence of this, an _ex-post_ change of the legal basis would generally, as well as in the present case, constitute an unfair processing for the data subjects, and the balancing of interests would not lead to a positive result for the controller. As a matter of principle, the DPA stated that it is not up to the data subject or the DPA to identify the appropriate legal basis before the processing starts. Rather, by virtue of the principle of privacy by design and by default, it is the sole responsibility of the controller.

_Second_, the DPA held that the controller did not sufficiently inform data subjects about their rights. It emphasized that, under [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR"), a controller must provide the data subject with the necessary assistance to enable him or her to exercise all data subject rights in an informed manner. The information obligation is not a mere "paperwork" obligation, but is intended to enable the data subject to make an informed choice about the processing and to exercise his or her data subject rights. In order to be capable to fully exercise their rights (such as their right to withdraw consent), it is necessary to know exactly when and under what conditions data processing based on the data subject's consent for the purpose of eDM will cease. Such information was not provided. The duration for which personal data would be processed for eDM was not sufficiently clear and unambiguous. Therefore the DPA found the controller in breach of [Article 12(1) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR#1 "Article 12 GDPR").

_Third_, the DPA decided that the data processing was not based on consent, as the controller did not fulfil the conditions of Article 7 GDPR. Consent was neither sufficiently informed. Referring to the European Data Protection Board's Guideline 5/2020, the DPA explained that any information that may be relevant to a typical data subject's decision must be provided. According to the DPA this includes the duration of processing in the case of eDM. Data subjects typically subscribe to a large number of newsletters over the course of their lives, which are difficult for them to keep track of. Therefore, the DPA was of the opinion that the time of the cessation of e-mailing in the case of eDM is important information for data subjects. Moreover, according to [Article 7(2)](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR#2 "Article 7 GDPR") and [7(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR#4 "Article 7 GDPR"), consent must be granular. To use consent as a legal basis, controller must not bundle different incompatible processing purposes. This was violated in the present case. Consent would have to be given separately for the subscription service, the eDM, and the prize draw. The investigation of the DPA showed that the controller had not complied with these criteria.

Consequently, the DPA found the data processing to be unlawful. The processing violated [Article 7(2) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR#2 "Article 7 GDPR"), [Article 7(4) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_7_GDPR#4 "Article 7 GDPR") and [Article 6(1)(a) GDPR](/index.php?title=Article_6_GDPR#1a "Article 6 GDPR"). The controller was fined 2,000,000 HUF (approx. €5,080). In determining the height of the fine, the DPA took into account some mitigating circumstances, namely, that the controller cooperated with the DPA during the proceedings, acknowledged the infringement and remedied it for the future in the present proceedings, conducted internal training, and that the infringement only concerned the data subjects' email address data and not any other data or sensitive data. An aggravating circumstance was that the data processing continued for an extended period of time.

## Comment

On a weekly basis, the controller had sent eDM unlawfully to thousands of data subjects who had subscribed to its services. The fact that the data subjects were able to subsequently object to the eDM or to subsequently withdrawn their consent in the online account linked to the service does not alter the invalidity of the consent.

II. Legal provisions applicable in the case

According to Article 2 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the general data protection
regulation must be applied to personal data in part or in whole in an automated manner
processing, as well as the non-automated processing of data that
are part of a registration system or which are a registration system
want to be part of.

You are identified as "personal data" on the basis of Article 4, point 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation
any information relating to an identifiable natural person ("data subject"), including
also the online ID.

According to Article 4, point 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation, "data management" is personal
any 7 performed on data or data files in an automated or non-automated manner

operation or a set of operations, such as collection, recording, organization, segmentation, storage,
transformation or change, query, insight, use, transmission of communication,
by means of distribution or other means of making available, coordination or
connection, restriction, deletion or destruction.

Based on Article 4, point 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation, "profiling" is personal data

the purposes and means of data management are determined by EU or member state law, the data manager
or special considerations for the appointment of the data controller by the EU or the Member States
can also be determined by law

Pursuant to Article 4, point 11 of the General Data Protection Regulation, it is "the consent of the data subject".
of the will of the person concerned, based on voluntary, specific and adequate information and clear
declaration by which the relevant statement or confirmation is unambiguously expressed
indicates by action that he gives his consent to the processing of his personal data.

According to Article 6 (1) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation, it may be legal to
processing of personal data, if the data subject has given his consent to a or

for its management for several specific purposes.

According to Article 6 (1) point f) of the General Data Protection Regulation, it may be legal to
processing of personal data, if the data processing is authorized by the data controller or a third party
necessary to assert its interests, unless priority is given to these interests
interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject that are personal
data protection is necessary, especially if the person concerned is a child.

According to recital (47) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the data controller –
including the data controller with whom the personal data may be disclosed - or one
the legitimate interest of a third party can create a legal basis for data processing, provided that the data subject is involved
his interests, fundamental rights and freedoms do not take priority, taking into account that
the reasonable expectations of the data subject based on his relationship with the data controller. About such a legitimate interest
it can be the case, for example, when there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the

between data controllers, for example in cases where the data subject is a customer of the data controller
is in its application. In any case, to establish the existence of a legitimate interest
it must be carefully examined, among other things, that the data subject is personal data
at the time of its collection and in connection with it, can you reasonably expect that
data may be processed for the given purpose. The interests and fundamental rights of the data subject take precedence
may enjoy against the interest of the data controller if the personal data are in such circumstances

it is the task of the legislator to define in legislation what the public authorities are like
can process personal data on a legal basis, supporting the legitimate interest of the data controller
no legal basis can be applied, carried out by public authorities in the performance of their duties
for data management. Personal data is absolutely necessary to prevent fraud
its handling is also considered a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. Personal data direct
its processing for the purpose of acquiring business can also be considered based on legitimate interest. 8

Based on Article 7 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation, if the consent of the data subject

request for consent in a way that is clearly distinguishable from these other cases
must be presented in an understandable and easily accessible form, with clear and simple language. The

any part of such statement containing the consent of the affected person which violates e
decree does not have binding force.

Based on Article 7 (4) of the General Data Protection Regulation, during its determination,
whether the consent is voluntary should be taken into account as much as possible
the fact, among other things, that the fulfillment of the contract - including the provision of services
also - whether consent to the processing of personal data which

they are not necessary for the performance of the contract.

based on the Customer's express declarations, all subscribers are automatically also on the EDM

(which is a condition of the subscription) and to subscribe to EDM. Not at the time of registration
it was only possible to register for the Service via the Website for EDM

without signing up.

1.2. The General Terms and Conditions did not contain a provision on EDM.

1.3. Data management for the examination period attached to document No. NAIH-6003-6/2022
based on the table on page 15 of the information, the legal basis for data processing is the data subject
had his consent, and the Customer also stated this during the procedure, as written in point I.1.3.(v) above

according to The Authority's declaration of the Client that a legitimate interest may have existed
would have, for the following reasons, he did not consider it relevant when clarifying the facts. Data management
the data controllers are obliged to decide its legal basis in advance, Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation
To weigh up between the legitimate interest and the rights of the data subject according to point f) of paragraph (1).
and to document, and about this and, among other things, the right to protest, the affected parties accordingly
to inform. In the absence of all of these, the legal basis can be modified afterwards in general and in this case
would also be unfair data management to the affected parties, and the consideration of interests is the above

considering the circumstances, it would not lead to a positive result, so legitimate interest is the legal basis
cannot exist. It is not the responsibility of the person concerned, nor of the Authority, to identify the appropriate legal basis
before the start of data management, this is the built-in and default data management
due to its principle, it is the sole responsibility of the data controller. For this reason, the Authority investigated only that
also in the present case, that the legal basis for consent indicated by the Client to the affected parties
was it valid.

based on the table on page 18 of the data management information, the duration of data management a
lasts until withdrawal of consent. Compared to this, according to the Customer's statement, the Service

without withdrawal. The EDM consent could be revoked at any time through the Service
related online account settings.

1.5. The data management information did not indicate that there was a possibility that a

audio recording) did not take place and the prize draw has already closed.

III.2. Data management between May 18, 2022 and June 24, 2022

2.1. Based on the Customer's declaration according to point I.1.4.(ii), the Customer after May 17, 2022
period, he wanted to change the giving of consent to the EDM, however, this
was not implemented in practice.

2.2. The Authority has actually implemented and indicated in the information sheet for those concerned
examines data management, not data management that has not actually taken place. So the above
despite the fact that the EDM contribution on the Website remains unchanged in practice
could only be given with the acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions, in this regard, May 18, 2022 and May 18, 2022.
between June 24 and the period before that, the substantive difference influencing the decision
It was not. 12

2.3. The General Terms and Conditions contained a provision regarding EDM from May 18, 2022, however
this information was not clear based on what was described in points I.1.3.(viii) and I.1.4.(iv) and
was not fully consistent with the data management information, thus the duration of data management
clear and adequate information still did not meet the requirements

based on the Authority's invitation, it was recognized, and its practice can also be seen on its website
modified after June 24, 2022, however, this is a violation of previous years
does not affect the fact. From this point of view, it is not relevant that the above applies to the Customer's website
According to his statement in point I.1.4.(ii), what he wrote in his General Terms and Conditions was not included for technical reasons, since
in the absence of actual implementation, it was not perceptible in reality and was only examined

affected a small part of the period (about one month of the year and a half). Since the General Terms and Conditions 18 May 2022
the amendment applied since did not improve the transparency of the information from the previous period either
and accuracy, regarding the information between May 18, 2022 and June 24, 2022 and
between January 1, 2021 and May 17, 2022, the decision
there was no significant substantive difference, so the provisions of III.1 above apply accordingly.
was written in point

2.4. Due to the above, the Authority treated January 1, 2021 and 2022 uniformly in its decision.
between May 17 and the period between May 18 and June 24, 2022, since the
there was no significant difference influencing the decision. In the justification, if necessary, a
Authority marks those findings that do not apply to the entire period.

III.3. The information is provided in the entire examined period

3.1. According to Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation, the Customer - as a
data controller responsible for data management under investigation - obligation to take appropriate measures
in order to ensure that, for the data subjects, the 13.
and all the information mentioned in Articles 14 and 15-22. and each according to Article 34
information in a concise, transparent, understandable and easily accessible form, clearly and
provide it in a comprehensible way.

3.2. The system of appropriate information in the general data protection regulation serves to
so that the data subject can be aware of which personal data, which data controller and
for which purpose and for how long will it be treated. This is essential to be in a position to
to be able to meaningfully exercise its stakeholder rights.

3.3. Data management based on point a) of Article 6 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation

based on Article 4, point 11 of the General Data Protection Regulation, not only the data management
beginning, but before obtaining consent, the data controller is obliged to
to provide information based on which informed consent can be given, which is not possible a
3.2 above. in the absence of any of the basic information written in point.

3.4. In relation to the legal basis of data subject consent according to the General Data Protection Regulation
it is important to emphasize that it does not mean that the data controller is subject to other legal obligations

apply it as a general authorization regardless of conditions. For data management
stakeholder consent can only be valid if it is provided by the general data protection
according to the wording of Article 6 (1) point a) of the decree for specific purpose(s) - per purpose
can be specified separately - is obtained and appropriate information is provided beforehand, which is such

and complies with all other provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation 13

According to
can exercise his/her rights as a data subject in an informed manner.

3.5. As explained above, the obligation to provide information is not a mere "paperwork2"
is an obligation in the General Data Protection Regulation. All in the preamble
contained, all the articles of the general data protection regulation require the achievement of results
when determining the obligations of a data controller, not just a specified minimum

proof of effort on the part of the data controller. The aim of the information is to put you in such a situation
brings the data subject to be in the right decision-making position with the data management and the data subject
in connection with the exercise of your rights. Part of this is exactly when and under what conditions
data processing based on the consent of stakeholders related to EDM will cease.

3.6. In all cases, the EDM consent could easily be revoked, but not this one
aggravates the illegality of the Customer, but does not make the consent valid in itself
despite the non-fulfillment of the other conditions.

3.7. Due to the above, it can be concluded that in the examined period, the Customer used the EDM
provided on the duration of personal data processing in connection with
information violated Article 12 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation,
as it was not sufficiently clear and unambiguous regarding the duration of data management,

Between May 18, 2022 and June 24, 2022, the General Terms and Conditions were also contradictory
regarding.

III.4. The legality of EDM-related data management in the examined period

4.1. The above III.1.3. on the basis of what was explained in point 1, the Authority is responsible for data management related to EDM
only the consent indicated by the Customer in the information is the legal basis

investigated. In the absence of adequate information, as a general rule, it was based on consent
data management in itself is illegal. This is supported by the European Data Protection Board
Also paragraph 62 of the 5/2020 Guidelines (hereinafter: 5/2020 Guidelines). Accordingly
if the data controller does not provide accessible information, the user has control over the data

its provision becomes apparent and consent becomes an invalid basis for data management.
The basic requirement of easy accessibility is confirmed by Guideline 66 of 5/2020.
and also paragraph 67. 5/2020 regarding information regarding consent
Paragraph 63 of the guidelines also emphasizes that consent based on information

the consequence of not complying with relevant requirements is that a
consent will be invalid and the data controller may violate the general data protection regulation
Article 6.

4.2. Based on paragraph 64 of Directive 5/2020, in order for the consent to be informed

be based on, the data subject must be informed about certain key elements. That's why it is
The European Data Protection Board believes that valid consent requires at least a
the following information is required:

2 For example, the beginning of recital (39) of the General Data Protection Regulation: "The processing of personal data shall be lawful and
it should be fair. For natural persons, it must be transparent that the information concerning them is personal
how their data is collected and used, how it is viewed or in what other way it is handled, as well as
in connection with the extent to which personal data is or will be managed. \[...\]"

https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb\_guidelines\_202005\_consent\_en.pdf 14

 (i) the identity of the data controller - this was fulfilled in this case;

 (ii) the purpose of each data processing operation for which consent is sought – this
       fulfilled, but for the purpose of EDM, only the General Terms and Conditions, which are a condition for the provision of the Service
       it was possible to consent with its acceptance;

 (iii) what type of data will be collected and used - this is fulfilled, that is
       according to the data management information, only the email address was processed;

 (iv) the existence of the right to withdraw consent - this has been fulfilled;

 (v) where applicable, to use the data for automated decision-making

       relevant information in accordance with point c) of Article 22 (2) - this is present
       not relevant in this case;

 (vi) the compliance decision for data transmissions and described in Article 46
       possible risks arising from the lack of adequate guarantees - this is not the case in this case
       relevant.

4.3. At the end of the above list, the European Data Protection Board specifically indicates that it is
based on Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation, it is only a minimum requirement, but in addition
it is necessary to provide all information that may be important to a typical stakeholder
decision, such as the duration of data management in the case of EDM. Those involved typically
they subscribe to a number of newsletters in their lifetime that are difficult for them to keep track of by heart.
The termination of sending emails based on the EDM is the termination of the Service (a
Deleting an account related to a service) can be important information for those concerned.

4.4. It is important to choose the right legal basis and fulfill its conditions. The present
in the case related to the duration of EDM data management, III.1.4 above. and III.2.3. in points
detailed information is not a problem in itself in the absence of other factual elements
would result in the invalidity of the legal basis in the specific case, however, the Authority is all
examined the circumstances together and took this into account in his decision.

4.5. All according to Article 6 (1) point a) of the General Data Protection Regulation
legal text ("for one or more specific purposes"), as well as 7 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

conflicting if consent cannot be given separately for using the Service

completed, so in the case of subscriber … thousand affected persons, it was given to the EDM in the examined period
consent was invalid, based on this the management of the email address for sending EDM

was illegal on a weekly basis. It does not change the consent detailed above
its validity condition is that the affected parties could have objected to the EDM afterwards,
or the consent could later be withdrawn in the online account connected to the Service.

4.6. According to paragraph 26 of Directive 5/2020, "Article 7 of the General Data Protection Regulation
paragraph (4) of Article 4 states, among other things, that they are expressly undesirable

"connected" or "set as a condition" for the performance of a contract or service
consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary a
to fulfill the contract or the service. If consent is given in such a situation, no
considered voluntary ((recital 43)). Paragraph 4 of Article 7 thereof
strives to ensure that the purpose of processing personal data is not hidden
provision of a service contract and not be linked to a service 15

for the provisions of the contract, for which service these personal data are not
are necessary. The General Data Protection Regulation thereby ensures that personal data
management, for which consent is requested, should not directly or indirectly become a contract
compensation. The two legal bases for the lawful processing of personal data, i.e. a
consent and the contract cannot be combined and cannot obscure one another.".

4.7. In the present case, the subscription to EDM during the period under review is inseparable
connection to the subscription to the Customer's online service is contrary to the 5/2020
With the prohibition explained in paragraph 26 of the guidelines, and Article 7 of the general data protection regulation
(4) is completely disregarded.

4.8. Due to the above, it can be concluded that during the examined period, the Customer is with EDM
