the use of data management based on the legitimate interests of the employer is justified.

Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation under the legal basis of a legitimate interest
thus, personal data may be processed if the processing is carried out by the controller (or

third party), unless those interests
preceded by the right of data subjects to the protection of personal data.

It is important that the employer, as data controller, has a discretionary interest in invoking this legal basis
must perform. 6 Carrying out a balance of interests is a multi-step process in which

the legitimate interest of the controller, ie the employer, and the counterpoint to the weighting must be identified
the data subject, the employee, the fundamental right concerned, and finally on the basis of the weighting
it must be determined whether personal data can be processed. Where the balance of interests

as a result, it can be concluded that the employer’s legitimate interest precedes the employees
the right to the protection of personal data, a camera system can be operated.

 Article 4 (11) of the General Data Protection Regulation: ‘‘ consent of the data subject ’means the voluntary, specific and
a sufficiently informed and unambiguous statement giving the statement or confirmation concerned
by means of an unequivocally express act that he or she consents to the processing of personal data concerning him or her. "

Opinion on the concept of legitimate interests under Article 7 of Directive 95/46 / EC, in which the general
during the period of application of the Data Protection Regulation. The opinion can be obtained from the following link:
https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp217\_en.pdf

                                                      10From the "principle of accountability" under Article 5 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
however, as a result, the employer must prove that it uses electronic
monitoring system is compatible with the principle of purposeful data management and the balancing of interests
its outcome resulted in the primacy of the legitimate interest of the controller. This is a requirement
designates the framework for the purpose of an electronic monitoring system in the workplace
to operate.

Requested in the data protection regulations sent to the Authority as the legal basis for the monitoring
legitimate interest has been indicated. Required for data management based on the legitimate interest of the data controller
the balancing test is included separately in the data management rules sent to the Authority. THE
data management of a built-in camera system, necessarily monitoring employees
as a legal basis, he therefore requested Article 6 (1) (f) of the General Data Protection Regulation
applied. The use of this legal basis is accepted by the Authority as appropriate in the workplace
in connection with a camera system for the protection of persons and property, and thus in connection therewith

it makes no further findings.

   b. The purpose of the examined data management

Data management in the Applicant's replies to the Authority and in the attached documentation
to protect the security of buildings and their property, and
marked personal protection objectives. Thus, the purpose of operating the camera system is not to

monitoring and influencing the work of employees, but also protecting people and property.

In this regard, it is important to mention that workplace camera surveillance is absolute
is a constraint on respect for human dignity, and therefore cameras for workers and
not to operate on a permanent, non-targeted basis
may. It is also illegal to use an electronic monitoring system that
aimed at influencing employees ’behavior at work, employees

permanent monitoring and control with cameras. The reason for this is for control purposes
observation typically violates the principle of necessity proportionality, as the employer has a number of
there is another way to live Mt. 11 / A. § (1). Therefore,
it is not possible to operate cameras that are exclusively for the workers and the work done by them
activity is monitored on a permanent basis. Exceptions are workplaces where the
the lives and physical integrity of workers may be in imminent danger and thus exceptionally operable
camera, for example, in an assembly hall, furnace, industrial plant or other source of danger

facilities. It should be emphasized, however, that only in that case
an operable camera to protect the life and physical safety of workers in the event of danger
it actually exists and is direct, that is, the potential danger cannot be constitutional
acceptable data management purpose. However, all this must be proven by the employer
balancing test.

                                               11In the case of surveillance for property protection purposes, the employer must also certify the
in the balance of interests, that there are in fact circumstances which justify
placement of certain cameras and otherwise the goal to be achieved cannot be ensured. The protection of property
In the case of purpose monitoring, another important requirement is to pay special attention to the employer
must be such that the angle of view of the given camera is essentially aimed at the property to be protected,
and, as a result of the above, should not become an observation of the work of workers
suitable tool.

In addition, it is also not possible to use an electronic monitoring system in a room
which has been designated for the purpose of taking a break between employees. An exception to this
may be the case if there is some valuable property to be protected in this room,
in connection with which an employer interest can be justified (for example, employees
the equipment was damaged several times and the damage had to be borne by the employer). In this
In this case, a camera can be placed in the room for this specific purpose, but then the

The employer must also pay particular attention to the principle of data saving
be such that the angle of view of the camera can only be directed at the property to be protected.

Based on your requested responses and the submitted images transmitted by the placed cameras
it can be established that they are the storage premises on the premises, the goods stored there and the
courtyard and parking spaces there are observed. An exception to this is called \[…\]
room, as here a larger desk, chairs and

computer workstation as well, which Requested response based on short-term administration
activities (for example, publishing of warehouse materials, receipt by computer
documentation).

The purpose of the installation of \[…\] 's camera is also the protection of persons and property
because in the room, outside the workstation, there are high-value small machines, tools,
parts are stored. In the case of a recording attached by the Applicant, there are several in the room

employee is also visible.

Regarding the angle of view of this camera, it can be stated that its lower-right part is administrative
furniture and objects forming part of a workstation, while the upper left part is large
small appliances, tools and parts, as well as cabinets and shelves suitable for storing them
are visible.

According to his requested statement, \[…\] is not a room designated for breaks between work. If
it would be, there, under the Privacy Policy of the Requested Camera Surveillance
camera could not be operated. Nevertheless, the Applicant's request was received by the Authority
in connection with a further complaint, it can be stated that it was also used for this purpose by the employees, a
with short-term administrative work. For example, according to the applicant's statement, several employees
was also called upon by the site 's logistics manager to spend less time on
in the room.

Irrespective of the allegations made in the application or in the complaint, it can be concluded that \[…\] -
installed in the camera angle of view is suitable to see through them the workers (the tested
37 people in the period) requested to view the pictures of the cameras
through your authorized employees. This is because the camera's viewing angle is more than just
high - value assets to be protected or storage units containing them (mediated
upper left half of the image), but also the workstation for administrative purposes (lower right half of the transmitted image)

                                               12 hanging. Constant monitoring of the latter part of the room is neither the protection of property nor the
nor is it justified in order to protect the life and physical integrity of workers, as there is only physical
there is administrative work that does not pose a real threat to health, and there is significant storage of valuables
it doesn't happen either.

The ability of the image transmitted by the camera to monitor the intensity of work is
are also likely to be the subject of an independent complaint. The system is suitable

to ensure that it does not serve to unduly monitor employees by the intermediary
by those authorized to view the image (in this case, these are the logistics manager and the warehouse manager) a
Responsible as a data controller operating and operating the system
belongs to.

On the basis of the above, the Authority concludes that the Applicant's \[\] site is named \[…\]
the angle of view of the camera installed in the room is suitable for unreasonable surveillance of workers,

thus incompatible with the original purpose of protecting persons and property. Through the camera
therefore infringes Article 5 (1) (b) of the General Data Protection Regulation
the principle of "purpose limitation".

In addition, since said camera is aimed not only at the assets to be protected, but also at
a wider spectrum of vision is included in the image it conveys, thus enabling the room
the Authority is of the opinion that the principle of data saving - the general

Article 5 (1) (c) of the Data Protection Regulation.

In view of the above, the Authority requested the Applicant, in the operative part of this Decision, to
to change the angle of view of the camera installed in the \[…\] room of the \[…\] site
so that it is not suitable for unreasonable monitoring of workers and in accordance with
be for the purpose of protecting the person and property of the system installation.

    c. Informing stakeholders about the data management examined

An essential requirement for data management related to camera surveillance at work,
that employees ’data management is appropriate, transparent and easy to understand
receive information. In this connection, the following should be taken into account:

Pursuant to Section 9 (2) of the Labor Code: “On the manner, conditions and conditions of restriction of the right to personality

the expected duration and the circumstances justifying its necessity and proportionality
the worker must be informed in advance in writing. "

Mt. 11 / A. § (1), if the employer also uses technical means a
employees, they must inform them in writing in advance.

Article 13 (1) to (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation states that data processing
what information should be made available to employees.

For data management related to camera surveillance, the general data protection regulation
In accordance with the system of requirements laid down by
circumstances must be reported:

    - the person operating the electronic monitoring system (legal or natural)
       determining

                                                13 - the contact details of the Data Protection Officer, if appointed by the Data Controller
       person
    - the location of each camera and the purpose for which it is intended
       the area, subject, or whether you are directly with the camera

       whether the employer carries out a fixed observation,
    - the legal basis for the processing,

    - the determination of the legitimate interest of the controller,

    - the storage period of the recording,
    - the persons entitled to access the data and whether the recordings are made

       to which persons and bodies, in which case the employer may forward,
    - the rules for reviewing recordings and whether to record recordings
       what purpose the employer may use,

    - the rights of employees to electronic rights
       in the context of the monitoring system and how they can exercise their rights,

    - in the event of a breach of their right to information self-determination
       enforcement tools.

In connection with the obligation to provide information, it is also necessary to emphasize to the employer
for each camera, you must indicate exactly what that camera is like

for the purpose of the given area and what area or equipment the angle of view of the camera is aimed at.
This allows the employer to justify to employees why it is considered
it is necessary to monitor the area. The practice of a
employer generally informs employees that it is electronic
uses a monitoring system in the workplace.

An additional requirement in the context of proper information is that the employer is obliged

to place an alert on the fact that the area is electronic
uses a monitoring system.

Applicant notified by the Authority at the request of the \[…\] site of the camera system
immediately after its installation and commissioning on 18 November 2019
it was suitable for image capture, which began at this time.

Applicant distinguishes between the periods of operation of the system so-called. “Trial” and “sharp
although he did not comment on the exact duration of the trial operation. Requested
However, according to the statement, there was no difference between the “sharp” and the
"Trial operation", so the system operated in the same way during the relevant period. The two
the conditions for data management were thus the same.

On the “trial operation” of the camera system installed on site and the related data management

information about the start of the contract was not sent to employees on November 18, 2019
before.

Applicant attached to his application his employment contract on the day of his entry
Data management information provided by the applicant. The prospectus is general, not specific to only

                                                 14-camera document focusing on data management, but also the employee's personal data
contains information on the general management of Up to one paragraph in the prospectus
The applicant requests some issues of camera data management (eg legal basis, retention period, purpose,
prohibitions). This shorter summary document does not include those listed above
all categories as it is not with a camera system at a specific site
is only a general guide. According to the applicant, the site is a warning
signs were not posted either, with the availability of any further, more specific information

connection.

More detailed data protection regulations on the operation of the requested camera systems in 2020.
was sent to employees on April 3 by email containing a link to
To the policy available on your requested internal network. This document is not only for \[…\]
for all cameras operated by the Applicant
contains detailed privacy rules. The e-mail is not only from the employees of the \[…\] site,

but received by all employees (addressee: \[…\]), so it is likely to be considered
Requested general “camera” data management policy.

Based on the above, it can be stated that the Applicant handed over to the Applicant upon entry
in his data management prospectus he only informed him in general terms that he was performing his job
you can observe it with a camera. Such general, concise and easy-to-understand information is
data management options are to be welcomed and basically expected from data controllers.

However, brief general employee information alone is not enough if specific
with data management (in this case with camera surveillance at the specific site)
no further guarantees have been included in a more detailed data management policy
guaranteeing the rights and freedoms of those concerned. For these further
guarantees or a document describing them are not referred to in the prospectus (eg by link).

No information on camera data management was provided at the specific site, and the camera
detailed internal rules for monitoring well after the start of data processing,
was established with a delay of several months.

The absence of these additional specific guarantees defeats the purpose of the information, namely that the data subject is concerned
be aware of the circumstances in which your personal data are processed by the controller.
It is important that the data controller, at the request of the data subject, has additional specific, specific data processing

provide more detailed information on your circumstances. General privacy policy
Article 13 (1) to (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 specifies in detail which
shall inform the data subject of the information, of which, however, the
the information given when the employee entered was only partially compliant. The briefing is not
it included, for example, the balancing test and other references where it did
detailed rules would be available. The reason for this is that the regulations can only be
months later, after the start of data management, the
workers. The content of the warning sign to be placed in the monitored area is also only

subsequently, defined in these regulations.

Article 13 (1) of the General Data Protection Regulation provides that the controller a
at the time of obtaining personal data, make available to the data subject a
each of the information listed.

                                               15In this case, the Applicant was not able to start the data processing (which is the so-called
‘Trial operation’ date of 18 November 2019) to ensure this, as it is only a very
provided brief and general information on the possibility of camera surveillance by employees
upon entry. Complementing, briefing and briefing the brief for all employees
available detailed camera data management policy only after data management begins more
adopted and communicated to stakeholders (3 April 2020). After that the
information has already complied with the requirements of Article 13.

On the basis of the applicant 's request and the joint complaint, it can thus be concluded that a
at the site, there was inadequate information about camera data management at the site
employees (a total of 37 people in the period under review) all the way to detailed data management
until the issue of the regulations.

On the basis of the above, the applicant infringed Article 13 (1) of the \[…\]

for on-site camera data management from 19 November 2019 to 3 April 2020.
because it did not provide sufficient information and specificity to the
workers.

    d. Findings concerning the sanction applied.

The Authority has examined the type of sanction it intends to impose on the Applicant

for the breaches detected and whether a data protection fine is justified. E
Article 83 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation and Infotv. 75 / A. §-the
based on Infotv. § 61 (5), considered all relevant to the case
and found that in the case of the infringement discovered in the present proceedings, the Applicant
warning and solicitation is not in itself a sufficiently proportionate and dissuasive sanction,
it is therefore appropriate to impose a fine.

In determining the need to impose a fine, the Authority considered the infringements
aggravating and mitigating circumstances as follows:

Aggravating circumstances:

    - In connection with the data management activities of the Applicant, the Authority has already done so before
       infringement in an official data protection procedure (\[…\])

    - In relation to its position in the Requested Market and the resources available to it
       he is increasingly expected to comply with data protection legislation, including the workplace
       compliance with data management.

    - Infringement of camera data management and insufficient information at the investigated site is long
       lasted until 18 November 2019 - 3 April 2020

    In setting the amount of the fine, the Authority took into account that
       Infringements of principle by the applicant are covered by Article 83 of the General Data Protection Regulation
       (5), it falls within the higher maximum fine category
       constitute an infringement.

                                                16 Mitigating circumstances:

    - Infringement of camera surveillance and lack of information on the data management under investigation
       did not affect a particularly wide range of persons (a total of 37
       employee).

    - Only one camera (\[…\]) image transmitted at the site may be suitable for

       unjustified monitoring of workers.

Other circumstances considered:

    - The Authority also took note of the fact that the Applicant cooperated in all aspects of the
       Authority in the investigation of the case, although this conduct is not - as the law
       obligations were also not exceeded, he assessed as explicitly mitigating

       as a circumstance.

In setting the amount of the fine, the Authority took into account that
Net sales of HUF \[…\] (HUF \[…\]) in the business year between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019
volt. In setting the fine, it took into account the duration of the infringement
taking into account the Authority’s business year 2019 and the fact that 2020 is not yet available
public data available. On the basis of the above, the amount of the fine imposed is based on the gravity of the infringement

proportionate, shall not be considered excessive.

The Authority has issued the Infotv. Pursuant to Section 61 (2) (c) of the decision, the Applicant ID
ordered the disclosure of his data by obscuring his data, as it does not affect him
a wide range of persons.
