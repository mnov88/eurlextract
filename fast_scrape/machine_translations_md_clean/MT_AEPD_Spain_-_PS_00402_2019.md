## English Summary

### Facts and questions arising

In 2019, Mr D, a customer of Iberia Airlines, requested the company to delete all his personal data, including those concerning an ongoing Loyalty Program. Although the controller confirmed the deletion, Mr D continued to receive unsolicited marketing emails from the company. These facts led to a first complaint which ended in the sanctioning procedure PS/00370/2018. Notwithstanding the first formal notice, the sending of promotional did not stop. Therefore, Mr D lodged a second complaint alleging the ongoing violation of Article 6 GDPR.

### Holding

The AEPD finds the violation of Article 6 quite apparent and focuses on the criteria to assess the amount of the fine under Article 83 GDPR. In particular, the Agency finds a certain "recidivism" due to the commission of infringements of the same nature, already sanctioned in the context of a previous procedure.

This integrate the aggravating criteria under Art. 83(2)(b) (intentional or negligent character of the infringement) and (e) (previous infringements) of the GDPR. For these reasons, the controller was given a penalty of 20.000 euros.

Consequently, given that in the case in question there is recidivism due to the commission of infringements of the same nature, given that the complainant continued to receive emails from the requested party, even after the resolution of the PS/00370/2018 sanctioning procedure was issued.

Therefore, the known facts constitute an infringement, attributable to the defendant, for violation of Article 6.1, of the RGPD, which states that: "in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.11 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, consent of the affected party is understood as any free, specific, informed and unequivocal expression of will by which the affected party accepts, either by statement or clear affirmative action, the processing of personal data concerning you".

Article 72.1(b) of the LOPDGDD defines "very serious" as "the processing of personal data without meeting any of the conditions for the lawfulness of processing set out in Article 6 of the RGPD".
