                                            V

ce that:

                                             VII

        The violation of article 32 of the RGPD is typified in article

C / Jorge Juan, 6 www.aepd.es

83.4.a) of the aforementioned RGPD in the following terms:

        "4. Violations of the following provisions will be sanctioned, in accordance with

        For its part, the LOPDGDD in its article 73, for the purposes of prescription, qualifies
of "Violations considered serious":

        "Based on the provisions of article 83.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679

                                            VIII

        The RGPD defines personal data security violations as “all-
those security violations that cause the destruction, loss or alteration

        In this same sense, recital 83 of the RGPD states that:

        “(83) In order to maintain security and prevent treatment from infringing the dis-
