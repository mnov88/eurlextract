A complainant exercised their right to erasure of certain criminal records data. This was denied by the Directorate General of Police with a generic answer, so the claimant filed a complain with the AEPD. The AEPD dismissed the case, to which the claimant reacted taking the case to Court. The national court upheld the claim and overrode the AEPD's dismissal of the claim, obliging them to reconsider the case.

Is providing a general answer enough to fulfill a claim regarding the right to erasure, when there are no grounds for erasure?

### Holding

The AEPD held that, even if the Directorate General of Police was right in denying the right to erasure, as it is not possible to ask for the deletion of one's criminal record without meeting the conditions established in the law, a generic answer it is not enough. The Directorate General of Police shall provide a personalized and specific answer to the claimant, stating the grounds on which they are not granting the right to erasure.
